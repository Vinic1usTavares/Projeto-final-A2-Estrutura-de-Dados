king s cross thameslink station is a closed railway station in central london england it is located on pentonville road around east of king s cross mainline station at time of closure in 2007 it was on thameslink route between farringdon and kentish town stations and managed by first capital connect station opened in 1863 as king s cross metropolitan it was one of initial seven stations on metropolitan railway london s first underground line which ran between paddington and farringdon metropolitan had been planning for station since 1851 when king s cross mainline station was constructed to provide a connection between great western railway at paddington and great northern railway gnr out of king s cross within a year of opening a pair of tunnels was added which surfaced on gnr just north of king s cross and provided a direct rail connection between two lines in 1866 line was extended east to moorgate and south through snow hill tunnel to join london chatham and dover railway at ludgate hill and in 1868 a second pair of tracks known as city widened lines was opened along with a tunnel connection to midland railway near st pancras station route through station was very busy throughout remainder of century carrying trains from five companies in 1892 station was linked to concourse of king s cross mainline station by a foot tunnel opening of piccadilly and northern underground lines as well as growth of trams on surface streets led to a sharp reduction of services on city widened lines in early twentieth century metropolitan line remained popular however following electrification of its tracks in 1905 06 passenger service was reduced to peak hours only during world war i with no service through snow hill tunnel as lines were used heavily for freight and troop movements line and station were closed for five months during world war ii following damage in blitz only city widened lines platforms remained in use when station reopened in 1941 metropolitan line station was moved to a new pair of platforms which had been built at king s cross st pancras tube station providing a shorter connection to piccadilly and northern lines trains from east coast main line and midland main line continued to stop at king s cross metropolitan in 1980s city widened lines were electrified and snow hill tunnel reopened to passenger traffic as part of thameslink programme station was renamed first to king s cross midland city and then to its final name king s cross thameslink service on line grew and new destinations were added and by 2000s station could no longer handle passenger numbers a new pair of platforms were built at st pancras and king s cross thameslink closed in 2007 station was included in london station group from group s inception in 1983 and remained so until its closure naming station was officially known as king s cross metropolitan when it opened by metropolitan railway in 1863 although on timetables and maps it was often just called king s cross or king s cross met metropolitan line part of station was renamed to king s cross st pancras in 1925 and then to king s cross st pancras in 1933 when metropolitan railway was merged with underground electric railways company of london to form london passenger transport board lptb station was then part of king s cross st pancras tube station complex city widened lines platforms continued to be signed as king s cross through to 1970s when station reopened in 1983 following electrification it was known as king s cross midland city and acquired its final name king s cross thameslink in 1988 location and layout king s cross thameslink is located in a cutting around east of king s cross mainline station station s main entrance was on north side of station at western end of pentonville road part of london inner ring road this replaced an earlier entrance located south of tracks on gray s inn road thameslink platforms were linked directly by stairs and a tunnel to victoria and piccadilly line platforms at king s cross st pancras and via both sets of platforms to circle hammersmith city metropolitan and northern lines as well as mainline stations at king s cross and st pancras station had four platforms two to south were for metropolitan line and were used from 1863 to 1940 two northern platforms used from 1863 to 1979 and from 1983 to 2007 served city widened lines and later thameslink service southbound metropolitan and northbound widened shared an island platform after closure of metropolitan platforms a high wall was built on that island two platforms in use during king s cross thameslink era were lettered rather than numbered to avoid confusion with platforms at nearby king s cross among staff who worked at both stations in 1983 british rail introduced london station group a group of stations in central london which were regarded as a single destination for ticketing and fare purposes king s cross midland city as it was then called was one of original eighteen stations in group and it retained this status until closure in 2007 history early history area of king s cross was previously a village known as battle bridge an ancient crossing of river fleet river flowed along what is now west side of pancras road until it was rerouted underground in 1825 mainline king s cross station was built in 1851 52 as london terminus of great northern railway gnr and was fifth london terminal to be constructed station took its name from king s cross building a monument to king george iv that stood in area and was demolished in 1845 plans for station were made in december 1848 under direction of george turnbull resident engineer for constructing first of great northern railway out of london diaries of george turnbull chief engineer east indian railway company held at centre of south asian studies at cambridge university england page 87 of george turnbull c e 437 page memoirs published privately 1893 scanned copy held in british library london on compact disk since 2007 station opened on 14 october 1852 first suburban services to and from king s cross began operating in 1861 initially to seven sisters road station which was renamed to finsbury park in 1869 and later to hornsey and beyond king s cross metropolitan first underground station at king s cross was planned in 1851 during construction of mainline station intention was to connect great western railway gwr at paddington with great northern railway gnr at king s cross line was opened on 10 january 1863 along with six other stations as part of original section of metropolitan railway which would later become part of london underground king s cross metropolitan predecessor of king s cross thameslink opened at same time and was located to east of mainline station line was initially dual gauge enabling both gwr s broad gauge trains and other standard gauge stock to run later that year a pair of tunnels york road curve for southbound trains and hotel curve for northbound trains were built joining gnr lines north of king s cross mainline with metropolitan s line at king s cross metropolitan gwr ran first trains on line but relations towards metropolitan quickly became strained and gwr withdrew from route in august 1863 metropolitan was able to continue operating by leasing rolling stock from gnr which it brought on to line through york road tunnel gnr started routing all its suburban trains through tunnels to farringdon street now farringdon station in october trains into london stopped at a new platform known as king s cross york road to north east of mainline station and again at metropolitan station while trains out of london stopped at metropolitan station and again at mainline station by reversing into a platform after exiting hotel curve in 1866 snow hill tunnel was opened joining metropolitan railway at farringdon street to london chatham and dover railway lcdr terminus at ludgate hill this allowed goods and passenger trains to run from gnr lines south through to herne hill and beyond lines became very congested leading to opening in 1868 of a new pair of lines known as city widened lines these ran alongside original tracks from king s cross through to moorgate and allowed gnr and metropolitan traffic to run along line simultaneously same year metropolitan built a pair of tunnels to midland railway tracks north of its new terminus at st pancras station this enabled midland to begin running a service from bedford through to moorgate midland tunnels as well as original york road and hotel curve tunnels from king s cross mainline station were connected to city widened lines while link to original metropolitan lines was removed original metropolitan tracks became part of inner circle later known as circle line which ran partly on metropolitan tracks and partly on district railway tracks line was completed in 1884 services were provided by both metropolitan which ran clockwise trains and district which ran anticlockwise route through king s cross metropolitan remained busy throughout remainder of nineteenth century with trains from five companies metropolitan gnr midland lcdr and south eastern railway ser and routes including victoria to peterborough as well as services from north london to chatham and dover a service operated from liverpool to paris via widened lines departing at 08 00 and arriving in paris by 22 50 having travelled by across english channel in a paddle steamer trains continued to ascend up hotel curve from metropolitan station and reverse into mainline station until 1878 when a new platform was built on western side of gnr tracks this became known as king s cross suburban station but suffered from several problems including a steep incline and sharp curve along with a build up of smoke because of its proximity to mouth of tunnel congestion was somewhat alleviated when a connection between finsbury park and canonbury allowed use of north london railway tracks to take some of traffic from gnr lines into broad street station in city of london rather than down metropolitan line in 1892 station was linked to concourse of mainline station by a foot tunnel arrival of deep tube and relocation of metropolitan platforms advent of deep level tube lines at turn of twentieth century caused major changes in underground network great northern piccadilly brompton railway later known as piccadilly line opened a station serving king s cross and st pancras in 1906 and city south london railway now part of northern line opened its station following year tube platforms were linked to king s cross metropolitan through same foot tunnel as mainline making one station complex metropolitan line part of station was amalgamated in 1933 with deep level lines as part of newly formed lptb arrival of piccadilly and northern lines as well as growth of trams on surface streets led to a sharp reduction of services on city widened lines ser lcdr and gnr services were withdrawn in 1907 and midland and lc dr joint service in june following year decreased passenger service allowed a growth in freight traffic through station during world war i line was used for freight and troop movements with 250 000 tons of freight and 26 047 special troop trains passing through passenger service was reduced to four hours per day during morning and evening peak hours from 1915 snow hill tunnel closed to passenger service during war and north south link was used only by freight in postwar years service on circle and metropolitan line tracks increased over subsequent years however following electrification of those tracks in 1905 06 infrastructure around king s cross was bombed by germany in 1940 during blitz early in world war ii circle line between euston square and king s cross was particularly damaged and services stopped completely for five months when line reopened in march 1941 a new pair of platforms were opened to west making use of abandoned tunnels from 1860s and providing a shorter connection to piccadilly and northern lines this scheme part of what is now kings cross st pancras tube station had been planned by mr since 1935 original platforms were abandoned but are still in place and visible from passing trains as of 2019 after war national rail services continued to use city widened lines platforms of original station from gnr route now known as east coast mainline and from midland mainline thameslink programme thumb class 319 train at king s cross thameslink in 1989 snow hill tunnel which had seen no passenger services since 1916 closed completely on 24 march 1969 with withdrawal of freight services tracks were lifted in may 1971 services from east coast line then ended in 1976 after northern city line was transferred from london underground control to british rail allowing services to run from finsbury park directly to moorgate avoiding king s cross a handful of services from midland line continued to run but widened lines were almost unused in late 1970s in 1979 an ps80 million project was launched to electrify midland mainline from bedford to st pancras and city widened lines station was closed along with line and work was completed by may 1982 tracks were lowered to allow for overhead power cables to be installed and several bridges were remodelled despite completion of line and availability of rolling stock by early 1983 opening of line was delayed over a dispute with associated society of locomotive engineers and firemen aslef union regarding driver only operation on new electric trains station eventually reopened later in 1983 with new name of king s cross midland city trains ran between bedford and moorgate via st pancras and tunnels from midland mainline to city widened lines in 1988 network southeast one of newly created sectors of state owned british rail implemented a scheme first proposed in 1960s to reopen snow hill tunnel to passenger traffic project and new north south connection created was called thameslink trains ran between bedford and brighton using class 319 dual voltage trains which could run on both midland mainline s overhead ac system and brighton mainline s third rail system five years after its previous rename station at king s cross was once again renamed this time to king s cross thameslink services on line grew and new stations were added including a station at southern end of snow hill tunnel named city thameslink which replaced earlier terminal holborn viaduct station which was not on through route at around time thameslink was launched british rail began active planning for channel tunnel rail link a new high speed line to link london with channel tunnel initial proposal was for line to end at a new king s cross low level station which would run from north west to south east underneath great northern hotel and mainline terminal and would become a joint station for eurostar and thameslink services this plan was developed in some detail by architect norman foster but was ultimately vetoed by government in 1990 due to high costs project which became known as high speed 1 was eventually completed in 2007 with terminal platforms at st pancras rather than king s cross closure and relocation thumb upright 1 3 former ticket office in 2019 now used as an entrance to king s cross st pancras tube station in mid 2000s network rail began work on thameslink programme a scheme originally proposed in around 1990 but delayed several times plan involved increasing service frequency between king s cross and blackfriars up to 24 trains per hour planners for programme decided that existing king s cross thameslink station would be unable to cope with this increase they criticised its substandard platform widths and lengths lack of step free access and fire escape routes as well as poor quality passenger environment they decided to move station rather than upgrade it at its existing location surrounding infrastructure made this impractical and it would also have caused serious disruption to circle hammersmith city and metropolitan underground lines as well as nearby roads siting of high speed 1 terminus under st pancras rather than king s cross also meant that thameslink platforms were a long distance by foot from planned eurostar platforms network rail initially considered reusing abandoned norman foster proposal which had called for a combined eurostar and thameslink station underneath king s cross mainline station but updated to be for thameslink only this would have advantage of fewer closures to line during construction as site was not on existing line ultimately though due to cost of relocating lines and political issues with demolishing grade ii listed great northern hotel network rail decided to build new platforms on existing alignment under st pancras complex new platforms are close to high speed 1 platforms used by eurostar trains and provide an easier connection to mainline stations at st pancras and king s cross work required closure of through thameslink line for eight months in 2004 05 with trains from north terminating at st pancras project then stalled but was rescued by extra funding of ps63 million in february 2006 last train at king s cross thameslink was 23 59 from haywards heath which called at station at 01 08 on sunday 9 december 2007 from 9 december 2007 thameslink services started to call at new platforms at st pancras foot tunnel from king s cross st pancras tube station to ticket office of former thameslink station remains open from 07 00 to 20 00 on mondays to fridays to provide extra access to london underground platforms from pentonville road services off peak service pattern for king s cross thameslink in 2007 year of its closure was as follows 4 tph to brighton via london bridge and gatwick airport 4 tph to sutton 2 tph via wimbledon and 2 tph via mitcham junction 4 tph to bedford via st albans city luton airport and luton 2 tph to luton via st pancras international st albans city and luton airport 2 tph to st albans city via hendon notes references
