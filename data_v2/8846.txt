tamil place names have been retained in these districts outside tamil dominated northeast puttalam district has highest percentage of place names of tamil origin in sri lanka composite or hybrid place names are also present in these districts genetic affinities although sri lankan tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to other

dialects of tamil it has preserved several ancient features remaining more consistent with literary norm while at same time developing a few innovations it also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present day malayalam a dravidian language from kerala that originated as a dialect of old tamil around 9th century ce tamil dialect used by residents of trincomalee district has many similarities with jaffna tamil dialect dialect used in jaffna is oldest and closest to old tamil long physical isolation of tamils of jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old tamil that predate grammatical treatise on tamil dated from 3rd century bce to 10th century ce also a large component of settlers were from coromandel coast and malabar coast which may have helped with preservation of dialect their ordinary speech is closely related to classical tamil jaffna tamil dialect and indian tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible and former is frequently mistaken for malayalam by native indian tamil speakers closest tamil nadu tamil variant to jaffna tamil is literary tamil used in formal speeches and news reading there are

their conquest of jaffna kingdom in 1619 jesuits opened churches and seminaries but dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to dutch reformed churches when they took over tamil speaking regions of sri lanka primary impetus for educational opportunity came with establishment of american ceylon mission in jaffna district which started with arrival in 1813 of missionaries sponsored by american board of commissioners for foreign missions critical period of missionaries impact was from 1820s to early 20th century during this time they created tamil translations of english texts engaged in printing and publishing established primary secondary and college level schools and provided health care for residents of jaffna peninsula american activities in jaffna also had unintended consequences concentration of efficient protestant mission schools in jaffna produced a revival movement among local hindus led by arumuga navalar who responded by building many more schools within jaffna peninsula local catholics also started their own schools in reaction and state had its share of primary and secondary schools tamil literacy greatly increased as a result of these changes this prompted british colonial government to hire tamils as government servants in british held ceylon india malaysia and singapore by time sri lanka became independent in 1948 about sixty percent of government jobs were held by tamils who formed barely fifteen percent of population elected sinhalese leaders of country saw this as result of a british stratagem to control majority sinhalese and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of policy of standardization literature according to legends origin of sri lankan tamil literature dates back to sangam period 3rd century bce 6th century ce these legends indicate that tamil poet poothanthevanar poothanthevanar from sri lanka lived during this period medieval period tamil literature on subjects of

causes ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since colonial period rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies and political use of national past civil war resulted in death of at least 100 000 people and according to human rights groups such as human rights watch forced disappearance of thousands of others see white van abductions in sri lanka since 1983 sri lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people with eighty percent of them being sri lankan tamils before independence arrival of protestant missionaries on a large scale beginning in 1814 was a primary contributor to development of political awareness among sri lankan tamils activities by missionaries of american board of commissioners for foreign missions and methodist and anglican churches led to a revival among hindu tamils who created their own social groups built their own schools and temples and published their own literature to counter missionary activities success of this effort led to a new confidence for tamils encouraging them to think of themselves as a community and it paved way for their emergence as a cultural religious and linguistic society in mid 19th century britain which conquered whole island by 1815 established a legislative council in 1833 by unifying tamil and sinhalese nations on island and assigning three european seats and one seat each for sinhalese tamils and burghers this council s primary function was to act as advisor to governor and seats eventually became elected positions there

british governor william manning who was appointed in 1918 however actively encouraged concept of communal representation subsequently commission in 1931 rejected communal representation and brought

province an area tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland in favour of majority sinhalese in 1972 a newly formulated constitution removed section 29 2 of 1947 soulbury constitution that was formulated to protect interests of minorities also in 1973 policy of standardization was implemented by sri lankan government supposedly to rectify disparities in university enrolment created under british colonial rule resultant benefits enjoyed by sinhalese students also meant a significant decrease in number of tamil students within sri lankan university student population shortly thereafter in 1973 federal party decided to demand a separate tamil state in 1976 they merged with other tamil political parties to become tamil united liberation front by 1977 most tamils seemed to support move for independence by electing tamil united liberation front overwhelmingly elections were followed by 1977 riots in which around 300 tamils were killed there was further

community in such areas as education and public employment these policies made it difficult for middle class tamil youth to enter university or secure employment individuals belonging to this younger generation often referred to by other tamils as boys in tamil formed many militant organisations most important contributor to strength of militant groups was black july massacre in which between 1 000 3 000 tamils were killed prompting many youths to choose path of armed resistance by end of 1987 militant youth groups had fought not only sri lankan security forces and indian peace keeping force
