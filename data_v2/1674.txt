curly black hair talking into a microphone looking at something to left of camera naughty dog began developing last of us left behind following release of last of us in june 2013 with a team about half size following decision to create single player downloadable content for game development team immediately decided that story would focus on character of ellie they found that players of last of us were interested to learn about events in ellie s life prior to events of main game particularly events involving riley abel whom ellie mentioned in last of us in addition they found that some players were interested in events that occurred between fall and winter segments of main game in which ellie cares for an injured joel this led to team deciding to contrast these two events against each other feeling it would help story s pacing game director bruce straley said that team felt story justified development of left behind 150px thumb left ashley johnson portrayed ellie in left behind reprising role from last of us alt a 30 year old woman with long blonde hair smiling at someone to right of camera left behind was written to focus on relationship between ellie and riley and to recount events that defined their later personalities riley was chronologically introduced to ellie in last of us american dreams a comic book written by creative director neil druckmann and artist faith erin hicks team used comic as a reference point when developing relationship between ellie and riley becoming particularly interested in having chance to see more of their relationship druckmann felt that they would not have developed left behind if american dreams hadn t been written druckmann felt that story of joel and ellie s relationship in last of us dealt with survival loyalty and love and that ellie and riley s relationship in left behind deals with similar themes straley felt that themes involve love loss and devotion pondering extent that one goes to protect those one cares about ashley johnson portrayed ellie in left behind reprising her role from last of us to portray riley team cast yaani king johnson has noted that it was interesting to act against someone different and that king fit role immediately king felt intimidated to become part of a large project and was worried about fit ting in team found it interesting to tell story of riley as players of last of us were already aware of effect that she had on ellie left behind sees riley s behavior change ellie resulting in latter s focus to fight in order to save those close to her team were also interested in ellie s behavior around riley she is perceived as being more playful in left behind ellie and riley share a kiss team explored omitting kiss from game but felt that it was imperative to story and that it strengthened relationship though initially he only felt that ellie viewed riley as an influence druckmann later considered her romantic appeal and decided to explore concept while writing last of us druckmann had a general idea of events that would shape ellie s identity when conceiving story direction for left behind he found that these events were suitable druckmann felt that omitting nature of argument between ellie and riley which took place prior to events of game allowed players to draw their own conclusions team found various sections of game interesting such as references to facebook and halloween as characters are unaware of their meaning smaller time frame of development for left behind gave team an opportunity to trial mechanics and ideas that they were unable to test on main game with game s combat an added feature was to allow players to focus attention of infected towards human enemies allowing an easier escape gameplay was also more focused on characters as opposed to combat to allow players to relate to them more gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of ellie s life for example water gun fight with riley is contrasted to gunfights with enemies team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a challenge with even fewer combat scenarios in left behind than in last of us animation of masks also presented a challenge due to number of joints it took various iterations before final design was implemented last of us left behind was released worldwide for playstation 3 on february 14 2014 as a downloadable expansion pack to last of
