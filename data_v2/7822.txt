from soundtrack producers jon peters and peter guber along with music director phil ramone decided to use madonna after listening to her previous recordings employing bettis and lind to write song after reading script of film bettis and lind wrote song about situation in which lead characters meet at a nightclub initial recording sessions did not impress bettis and lind and they felt that crazy for you would be dropped from soundtrack however a new version was recorded to their liking john jellybean benitez was producer for song and it was a challenge for him as previously he was associated with recording dance pop songs only initially warner bros records did not want song to be released as a single since they believed that it would take away attention from madonna s second studio album like a virgin 1984 in end peters and guber convinced warner officials to greenlight its release crazy for you ushered a new musical direction for madonna as she had not previously released a ballad as a single track features instrumentation from snare drums harp bass synthesizer and electric guitar lyrically song speaks of sexual desire between two lovers and consists of innuendos crazy for you received positive response from music critics and earned madonna her first grammy award nomination in best female pop vocal performance category in 1986 song became madonna s second number one single on u s billboard hot 100 and reached top position in charts of australia and canada as well it also peaked at number two in ireland new zealand and united kingdom where it was released twice once in 1985 and again in 1991 madonna has performed crazy for you in three of her concert tours virgin tour in 1985 re invention world tour in 2004 and in some dates of rebel heart tour in 2016 performance from virgin tour was included in home video releases on vhs and laserdisc whereas re invention world tour remains unreleased crazy for you has been covered by a number of artists background thumb upright phil ramone proposed madonna to record crazy for you crazy for you was written by john bettis and jon lind ballad was released as first single from soundtrack of 1985 film vision quest a coming of age drama about a high school wrestler played by matthew modine producers jon peters and peter guber and music director phil ramone were aware of then unknown madonna who was just signed to sire records ramone took her for dinner at his house in carolwood records where she played some of her music videos ramone and other warner executives present there were impressed by madonna s self possession and fishnet crucifix style and they decided to test her voice in a new york studio peters assigned joel sill an executive in charge of music at warner bros pictures to handle recording of two songs for film sill sent script of film to bettis and lind after reading through script bettis wanted to write a song about situation where main characters a young boy and a girl boarding at a house dance together at a nightclub he elaborated we were noodling around and crazy for you was something that jon was singing over that section of song it was really descriptive of scene in film after that i was out on vacation out in desert and sill called and said phil ramone was in love with song and wanted to cut it on madonna laughing borderline was out at that time and i said excuse me this is for madonna really can she sing a song like this jon and i were surprised at choice of artist at time if you want to know truth recording after sill let bettis and lind know that madonna was singing song some time elapsed before either of them heard anything from warner bros records in between they went to one of recording sessions and were not impressed with process of recording song bettis commented we went to one of sessions and to be honest that particular session did not go all that well jon and i were depressed about way song had come out we heard nothing else about it and we were a little nervous that song was going to be dropped from picture bettis went to england to work on 1985 fantasy film legend with music producer jerry goldsmith it was there he received a call from lind who informed bettis that a new version of crazy for you was recorded and was made ready for a single release bettis was surprised and went over to lind s house where he warmly received new recorded version of song it had a different arrangement from demo version and arrangement was done by composer rob mounsey who rearranged original track and added background vocals bettis said we owe a big debt of gratitude to mounsey he really made a hit record out of song mounsey was introduced in project by record producer john jellybean benitez who was producing crazy for you benitez was previously associated with producing dance pop themed songs and it was first time that he produced a ballad in fred bronson s billboard book of number 1 hits benitez commented song was recorded live it was first time that i produced a live session as opposed to having synthesizers and drum machines do everything i was tense because i had never done a record like this everything i did was totally on instinct i tried to make song stand on its own but at same time work in two scenes in which it was used in movie benitez also noted that crazy for you was an important recording for madonna as song being a ballad was openly accepted at adult contemporary radios she had already charted with her singles like a virgin and material girl hence madonna wanted to prove that she can sing in a different genre of music however warner initially did not want song to be released as a single since release of vision quest coincided with release of madonna s second studio album like a virgin and releasing crazy for you would have distracted attention from album warner bros records chief mo ostin went to robert a daly chairman of warner and requested him to pull out madonna tracks from vision quest soundtrack daly summoned peters and guber to his office and informed them that they had to let go of madonna tracks peters protested and shouted at daly resulting him escaping in fright and warner allowing crazy for you to be released as a single composition crazy for you was a new musical direction for madonna as she had not recorded ballad songs before according to author rikky rooksby song is sophisticated compared to her previous singles introduction features a melody by a woodwind instrument and an electric guitar chord sliding from one motif to other it has a snare drum on last beat of bar leading to spacey quality to most of verses other instrumentation comes from a harp a bass synthesizer and a chattering single note guitar lick fuller rhythm of song does not start until chorus is reached turn of melody allows madonna s voice to stretch further on higher notes according to sheet music published at musicnotes com by alfred publishing crazy for you is set in time signature of common time with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute it is set in key of e major with madonna s voice spanning between high note of c5 to low note of g3 song has a basic sequence of e a b a as its chord progression unlike her previous singles chord sequence does not repeat itself and chorus slowly unravels to climax of song lyrically song talks about extreme love for one another it contains innuendos similar to crystals 1963 song then he kissed me according to scholar dave marsh lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers he believed that line i m crazy for you touch me once and you ll know it s true was not ambiguous and it helped madonna to capitalize on such disambiguation critical reception keith caulfield of billboard said that crazy for you is p erhaps ultimate slow dance song rikky rooksby author of complete guide to music of madonna called song sophisticated alex henderson of allmusic felt that other madonna song on vision quest soundtrack gambler should have been more successful single biographer j randy taraborrelli characterized song as sassy and commented that song provided proof that madonna was vocally capable of delivering a serious ballad author andrew morton believed that song cemented madonna as a talented and serious singer which had been missing from her past recordings allen metz and carol benson authors of madonna companion two decades of commentary said that song sounded like a remake of sweet sixteen connie francis tune dripping with old fashioned hand held romance especially in line it s so brand new i m really crazy for you edna gundersen from usa today felt that song is touching and beautifully arranged dave marsh author of heart of rock soul 1001 greatest singles ever made felt that with coda of song madonna
