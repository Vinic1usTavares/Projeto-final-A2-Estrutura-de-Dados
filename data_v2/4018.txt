days film editing took ten weeks while post production music mixing and visual effects took a few months film was finished by november 2006 because crew had to rush to meet february 16 deadline film was directed by nickelodeon s rugrats co creator and former hanna barbera animator gabor csupo who was first recommended for job by walden media president cary granat although csupo had never worked on a live action film before it didn t worry granat in least csupo stated that he was interested in making film because he had ambition to do a live action film for a long time but that he didn t like anything until i read this book he described book as beautiful and said that it moved him bridge to terabithia was cinematographer michael chapman s final film before his retirement chapman mentioned in film s dvd commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one this is such a beautiful story and it s exactly kind of movie i want to do at this time in my life casting thumb upright bailee madison was cast as may belle aarons director csupo stated that they had no actors initially in mind for film first actor cast was annasophia robb as leslie burke robb wrote csupo such a beautiful heartwarming letter that expressed her love for book and character csupo said that he cast her because of her letter her enthusiasm and her love of material robb also conversed with producer lauren levine before casting even began and their conversation convinced her that without a doubt annasophia was meant for this role levine said that it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that i was basically talking to leslie that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence she might be physically different from leslie in book but spirit of leslie and spirit of annasophia are nearly identical it was a match made in heaven with regard to character robb said leslie s one of those people who s just always lit up who has this glow about her and no one can bring her down leslie s such a lively and energetic character it was really fun for me to become her levine stated that looking for jesse was a really tough hunt we needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident brave leader in terabithia that s a heck of a range for such a young actor josh hutcherson was not their first choice for role of jesse aarons but they settled with him because they felt chemistry between annasophia robb and him hutcherson said that project appealed to him because of real life day to day drama as well as arc of character jesse filmmakers cast robert patrick as jess s hardworking and strict father based on his previous roles in films walk line flags of our fathers and television series unit patrick explained that he related to story because he was constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid himself and that film s setting reminded him of where he grew up he also said that he took on role because he wanted to star in a film that his children could watch csupo said that they cast bailee madison as may belle aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play part he went on to say that she had such a charm even before camera she was just like a little sweetheart she was very confident she showed up shook hands with everybody totally sweet and perky i said wow she was just stealing everybody s heart on spot design and effects csupo explained that it was a very conscious decision from very beginning that we re not going to overdo visual effects because of story s integrity and book s integrity because there was only a brief mention of jess and leslie fighting imaginary creatures in forest in novel with that in mind they tried to do absolute minimum which would be required to put it into a movie version in designing fantasy creatures found in terabithia csupo wanted to make creatures that were little more artsy imaginative fantastical creatures than typical rendered characters you see in other movies and drew inspiration from terry gilliam and ridley scott dima malanitchev came up with drawings for creatures with csupo s guidance csupo chose to have weta digital render 3d animation because he was impressed with their artistic integrity teamwork fact that people were really nice and also they responded to our designs very positively weta modified some of creature designs but ultimately remained faithful to csupo s original designs there were around 100 crew members from weta working on effects for film weta was already working on animating creatures while film was being shot and weta crew members were on set for all scenes that involved special effects during filming weta visual effects supervisor matt aitken explained that process involved in interpreting creatures was split into two steps first natural looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by csupo and malanitchev and this was done mostly through photoshop collages done by visual effects art director michael second step was to figure out animation or motion styles that best suited these creatures leslie s costumes in film were designed to look as if character might have made some of them herself and they were updated from those described in book to reflect what would currently be considered eccentric writing producer and screenwriter david l paterson is novel s author s son and his name was featured on its dedication page story was based on his real life best friend lisa hill who was struck by lightning and killed when they were both eight years old paterson had asked his mother katherine paterson if he could write a screenplay of novel and she agreed not only because he s her son but also because he s a very good playwright paterson had difficulty marketing screenplay mostly because of leslie s death if you can believe this i did meet with some companies that asked if i could just hurt leslie a little bit put her in a light coma and then bring her out most important thing for paterson was to keep spirit of book alive while finding a way to transform it from a novel that takes place mostly in characters heads to a dynamic visual medium paterson knew that film had to be about friendship and imagination while paterson focused on bringing out emotions of story he admitted to having difficulty writing about terabithia because it was too close he credited fellow screenwriter jeff stockwell for recreating terabithia for film what jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn t so attached to story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way david said csupo noted that two main characters are a little bit older in film than they are in book csupo reasons that movie deals with so many issues including friendship and maybe first innocent love things like that so it made more sense to make characters older soundtrack film features a musical score by aaron zigman who was hired after alison krauss backed out of job zigman mentioned that there are similarities between music he composed for bridge to terabithia and film in that at times there s a bit of a celtic influence but not much but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to music he composed for bridge to terabithia he did so as csupo requested him to not compose your typical hollywood score he then mixed up orchestral melody with a bit of a modern flavor score he composed for film is described as very large compared to his other work and zigman commented that aside from minimalist stuff and coloring that i love to do i also like big orchestral stuff and want to do more of that and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit official soundtrack for film was released as music from and inspired by bridge to terabithia by hollywood records on february 13 2007 notes i learned from you is originally sung with billy ray cyrus from hannah montana soundtrack this is a new version without billy ray cyrus and with different lyrics look through my eyes right here and when you love someone are not heard in film look through my eyes is originally from disneymania 4 right here is from camp s album stay and when you love someone is from bethany dillon s album so far acoustic sessions steve earle song someday and war s why can t we be friends sung by zooey deschanel and cast of school children in film do not appear on album release marketing and promotion promotion and advertising for film was met with criticism and controversy filmmakers distanced themselves from advertising campaign for film saying that it was deliberately misleading and made film seem to be about or occurring in a fantasy world david paterson was surprised by trailer but understood marketing reasoning behind it saying critics commented on film s misleading advertisement campaign one critic said film was actually grounded in reality far more than in fantasy while another thought far from a computer generated escapist fantasy this film is an unpretentious and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss distribution

family feature of early year ann hornaday of washington post praised script for being utterly recognizable and authentic and thought robb and hutcherson were perfectly cast hornaday wrote that although final five minutes succumbed to sentiment viewers would remember film s warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love jessica grose of village voice commended director csupo for omitting cutesy tween stereotypes and felt jess s relationship with his father elevated bridge to terabithia from a good kids movie to a classic contender new york times critic jeannette catsoulis believed that fantasy was kept in background to find magic in everyday and thought csupo directed like someone intimate with pain of being different allowing each personality more than a single characteristic reviewer praised all leads for their strong performances especially deschanel and madison catsoulis found film was able to handle adult topics with nuance and sensitivity and being consistently smart and delicate as a spider web it was kind of children s movie rarely seen nowadays miriam di nunzio of chicago sun times praised hutcherson and robb s performances saying that film s heart and soul rests on abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see world through children s eyes dynamic duo of hutcherson and robb do not disappoint not all reviews were as positive claudia puig of usa today wrote that for a movie about power of imagination bridge to terabithia is not as clever as you would hope puig called film a serviceable translation of novel but thought adult characters were caricatured puig found real life portions of movie were derivative and simplistic but found jess s emotional tumult felt powerfully authentic and this is where film finds its truth and soul wall street journal critic joe morgenstern felt that despite occasional misuse of enchantment brief spasms of overproduced fantasy novel s screen adaptation was told with agreeable simplicity in between computer generated monsters morgenstern was disappointed with performances by young members of cast which he described as appealing but unpolished morgenstern thought csupo lacked experience directing actors and that although deschanel was best adult performer she seemed self directed entertainment weeklys gregory kirschling was confused by main characters lack of excitement towards terabithia and felt film could not decide if it was a fantasy or a coming of age story accolades bridge to terabithia was nominated for seven awards of which it won five josh
