hd 40307 b is an extrasolar planet orbiting star hd 40307 located 42 light years away in direction of southern constellation pictor planet was discovered by radial velocity method using european southern observatory s harps apparatus in june 2008 it is second smallest of planets orbiting star after hd 40307 e planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form discovery as with many other extrasolar planets hd 40307 b was discovered by measuring variations in radial velocity of star it orbits these measurements were made by high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher harps spectrograph at chile based la silla observatory discovery was announced at astrophysics conference that took place in nantes france between 16 and 18 june 2008 hd 40307 b was one of three found here at time orbit and mass hd 40307 b is second lightest planet discovered in system with at least 4 2 times mass of earth planet orbits star hd 40307 every 4 3 earth days corresponding of its location at approximately 0 047 astronomical units from star eccentricity of planet s orbit was found to not differ significantly from zero meaning that there is insufficient data to distinguish orbit from an entirely circular one star around which hd 40307 b orbits has a low metallicity compared to other planet bearing stars this supports a hypothesis concerning possibility that metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar s accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets arizonan astronomer rory barnes s mathematical model in 2009 found that planet b s orbit must be more than 15 from face on however it cannot be much more characteristics hd 40307 b does not transit and has not been imaged more specific characteristics such as its radius composition and possible surface temperature cannot be determined characterizing extrasolar planets timothy m brown chapter 3 extrasolar planets xvi canary islands winter school of astrophysics edited by hans deeg juan antonio belmonte and antonio aparicio cambridge uk cambridge university press 2007 with a lower mass bound of 4 2 times mass of earth hd 40307 b is presumably too small to be a jovian planet this concept was challenged in a 2009 study which stated that if hd 40307 b is terrestrial planet would be highly unstable and would be affected by tidal heating in a manner greater than io a volcanic satellite of planet jupiter restrictions that seem to bind terrestrial planets however do not restrict ice giant planets like neptune or uranus as strong tidal forces often result in destruction of larger natural satellites in planets orbiting close to a star it is unlikely that hd 40307 b hosts any satellites hd 40307 b c and d are presumed to have migrated into their present orbits see also list of exoplanets references external links category hd 40307 category exoplanets category pictor constellation category super earths category exoplanets discovered in 2008 category exoplanets detected by radial velocity
