battle of solachon was fought in 586 ce in northern mesopotamia between east roman byzantine forces led by philippicus and sassanid persians under kardarigan engagement was part of long and inconclusive byzantine sassanid war of 572 591 battle of solachon ended in a major byzantine victory which improved byzantine position in mesopotamia but it was not in end decisive war dragged on until 591 when it ended with a negotiated settlement between maurice and persian shah khosrau ii r 590 628 in days before battle philippicus newly assigned to persian front moved to intercept an anticipated persian invasion he chose to deploy his army at solachon controlling various routes of mesopotamian plain and especially access to main local watering source arzamon river kardarigan confident of victory advanced against byzantines but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when kardarigan reached solachon persians deployed as well and attacked gaining upper hand in centre but byzantine right wing broke through persian left flank successful byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot persian camp but philippicus was able to restore order then while byzantine centre was forced to form a shield wall to withstand persian pressure byzantine left flank also managed to turn persians right under threat of a double envelopment persian army collapsed and fled with many dying in desert of thirst or from water poisoning kardarigan himself survived and with a part of his army held out against byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before byzantines withdrew background in 572 byzantine ruler justin ii reigned 565 578 refused to renew annual payments to sassanid persia that had been part of peace agreement concluded by his uncle justinian i r 527 565 and persian shah khosrau i r 531 579 in 562 this marked culmination of progressive deterioration of byzantine persian relations over previous years which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery thus byzantines initiated contacts with central asian gokturks for a joint effort against persia while persians intervened in yemen against christian axumites allies of byzantium justin furthermore regarded annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of romans and used outbreak of a major revolt in persian armenia in 571 572 as a pretext for refusing to continue payments justin s refusal was tantamount to a declaration of war fourth fought between two great powers of late antiquity in 6th century after initial persian successes such as capture of dara conflict proved inconclusive and became a drawn out affair with byzantine victories followed by persian successes intermittent negotiations and temporary truces in 582 maurice r 582 602 who had served as a general in war ascended to byzantine throne at constantinople by that time persians had gained upper hand in mesopotamia through their capture of dara in 574 while byzantines prevailed in arzanene initial moves and dispositions thumb right 280px map of roman persian frontier in late antiquity following failure of another round of peace negotiations about which little is known maurice appointed his brother in law philippicus as commander in chief for mesopotamian front magister militum per orientem in 584 philippicus raided region around major persian fortress of nisibis in 584 while in 585 he raided in arzanene persian commander kardarigan black hawk an honorific title rather than a proper name responded with an unsuccessful siege of philippicus main base in spring 586 maurice rejected new persian proposals involving conclusion of peace in exchange for renewed payments in gold contemporary historian theophylact simocatta reports that philippicus army was eager to confront persians in battle and byzantine commander marched south from his base at amida crossed arzamon river modern in south east turkey and north east syria to its eastern bank and advanced some east to plain of solachon where he pitched his camp this position south of fortresses of and dara allowed philippicus army to control passage of arzamon river and forced persian army under kardarigan to advance across waterless plain away from their supply routes before meeting byzantine force on persian side kardarigan was also eager to fight and confident of victory he arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to arzamon and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for prisoners he would take his movements however were detected when byzantines arab foederati captured a few of his men allowing philippicus to prepare his forces this early warning was of particular importance since kardarigan intended to attack on sunday a day of rest for christian byzantines battle both armies appear to have been composed exclusively of cavalry comprising a mix of lancers and horse archers possibly with a few cataphract units included when philippicus scouts reported persians approach he positioned his men on elevated ground facing direction from which persian army advanced with his left flank protected by foothills of mount byzantines appear to have been arranged in a single battle line with three divisions left division was commanded by dux of phoenice and included a hunnic contingent of horse archers under centre was commanded by general heraclius elder later exarch of africa and father of emperor heraclius r 610 641 while right wing was commanded by vitalius this arrangement was also adopted by persians as soon as they came into view of byzantine army on persian side right division was under centre under kardarigan himself and left wing under kardarigan s nephew unlike persian general philippicus remained with a small force at some distance behind main battle line directing battle after a short halt to leave their baggage train behind and form a battle line persian army quickly advanced on byzantines shooting arrows as they approached byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet oncoming enemy on byzantine right vitalius was quickly victorious his heavy cavalry breaking through persian flank and pushing his opponents to left behind their own main line at this point however disaster threatened as many of vitalius troopers broke formation and headed towards enemy camp intending to loot it philippicus however saw what had happened and reacted quickly he gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards theodore and sent him to rally cavalry on pain of punishment by army commander himself ruse worked men recognized helmet and returned to order just in time to stop persians who had regrouped in centre and were pushing numerically inferior byzantines back to counter this philippicus ordered men of central division to dismount and form a shield wall with their lances projecting from it formation it is not clear what happened next but apparently byzantine archers shot at persians horses breaking their momentum at same time byzantine left managed to launch a successful counter thrust which drove back opposing persian right in disarray soon persian right broke and fled pursued by byzantines with both wings having disintegrated persian centre was now subjected to an attack from reformed byzantine right which drove them towards area once occupied by persian right outnumbered and attacked from several sides persians soon began to break and flee defeated army suffered greatly not only from byzantine pursuit but also due to lack of water before battle kardarigan had ordered water supplies poured to ground trying to make his men fight harder to break through byzantine army and reach arzamon in addition surviving persians were refused entry into dara since according to simocatta persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives simocatta also narrates that many persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several byzantine attacks finally after three or four days byzantines not aware that enemy commander was there abandoned effort kardarigan thus escaped although his men suffered further casualties in process up to a thousand according to simocatta from byzantine patrols aftermath following battle philippicus rewarded soldiers who had distinguished themselves and divided spoils of defeated persians among them he then proceeded to invade arzanene again however his attempt to capture fortress of chlomaron was thwarted when kardarigan arrived with a new improvised force byzantine army retreated to fortress of aphumon fighting rear guard actions with shadowing persians victory of solachon allowed byzantines to regain upper hand in region of tur abdin and in its aftermath they began to re establish their control over region around dara war continued for a few years without a decision until revolt of bahram chobin caused rightful persian shah khosrau ii r 590 628 to find refuge in byzantine territory a joint expedition restored him to his throne and a peace treaty was concluded in 591 that left most of armenia in byzantine hands references sources category battles of roman
