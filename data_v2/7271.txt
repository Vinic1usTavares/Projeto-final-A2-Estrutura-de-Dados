harrison woman in cart both participated in first two films in original series planet of apes 1968 and beneath planet of apes 1970 as george taylor and nova respectively development late 1980s 20th century fox president craig baumgarten was impressed with adam rifkin s filmmaking with never on tuesday in 1988 rifkin was brought in studio to pitch ideas for films rifkin being a fan of 1968 planet of apes felt it was best to continue film series having independent film experience i promised i could write and direct a huge looking film for a reasonable price and budget like aliens fox commissioned rifkin to write what amounted to a sequel but not a sequel to fifth film an alternate sequel to first film he took influences from spartacus with storyline being ape empire had reached its roman era a descendant of charlton heston s character named duke would eventually lead a human slave revolt against oppressive roman esque apes led by general a real sword and sandal spectacular monkey style gladiator did same movie without ape costumes titled return to planet of apes project was put on fast track and almost entered pre production rick baker was hired to design prosthetic makeup with danny elfman composing film score tom cruise and charlie sheen were in contention for lead role i can t accurately describe in words utter euphoria i felt knowing that i adam rifkin was going to be resurrecting planet of apes it all seemed too good to be true i soon found out it was days before film was to commence pre production new studio executives arrived at fox which caused creative differences between rifkin and studio rifkin was commissioned to rewrite script through various drafts project was abandoned until peter jackson and fran walsh pitched their own idea with apes going through a renaissance in story ape government becomes concerned over new art works humans are revolting and liberal apes shelter a half human half ape from gorillas roddy mcdowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play leonardo da vinci type character they had written for him however executive jackson spoke to was not a fan of series and seemingly unaware of mcdowall s involvement in series and jackson turned his attention back to heavenly creatures oliver stone by 1993 fox hired don murphy and jane hamsher as producers sam raimi and oliver stone were being considered as possible directors though stone signed on as executive producer co writer with a 1 million salary hughes p 38 40 on storyline stone explained in december 1993 it has discovery of cryogenically frozen vedic apes who hold secret numeric codes to bible that foretold end of civilizations it deals with past versus future my concept is that there s a code inscribed in bible that predicts all historical events apes were there at beginning and figured it all out stone brought terry hayes to write screenplay entitled return of apes set in near future a plague is making humans extinct geneticist will robinson discovers plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in stone age he time travels with a pregnant colleague named billie rae diamond to a time when palaeolithic humans were at war for future of planet with highly evolved apes apes supreme commander is a gorilla named robinson and billie rae discover a young human girl named pronounced eve to be next step in evolution it is revealed that it was apes that created virus to destroy human race they protect her from virus thus ensuring survival of human race 102 000 years later billie rae gives birth to a baby boy named adam fox president peter chernin called return of apes one of best scripts i ever read chernin was hoping hayes script would create a franchise that included sequels spin off television shows and merchandise in march 1994 arnold schwarzenegger signed on as will robinson with condition he had approval of director chuck russell was considered as a possible director before phillip noyce was hired in january 1995 while pre production was nearing commencement with a 100 million budget stone first approached rick baker who worked on rifkin s failed remake to design prosthetic makeup but eventually hired stan winston fox became frustrated by distance between their approach and hayes interpretation of stone s ideas as producer don murphy put it terry wrote a terminator and fox wanted flintstones fox studio executive dylan sellers felt script could be improved by comedy what if robinson finds himself in ape land and apes are trying to play baseball but they re missing one element like pitcher or something sellers continued robinson knows what they re missing and he shows them and they all start playing sellers refused to give up his baseball scene and when hayes turned in next script sans baseball sellers fired him dissatisfied with sellers decision to fire hayes noyce left return of apes in february 1995 to work on saint columbus and cameron stone pursued other films of his own chernin was replaced by thomas rothman and a drunken sellers crashed his car killing a much loved colleague and earning jail time while producers murphy and hamsher were paid off after they got rid of us they brought on chris columbus murphy stated then i heard they did tests of apes skiing which didn t make much sense hughes p 41 43 stan winston was still working on makeup designs columbus brought sam hamm his co writer on an unproduced fantastic four script to write screenplay we tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to elements we liked from five films and would also incorporate a lot of material from pierre boulle s novel that had been jettisoned from earlier production hamm continued first half of script bore little resemblance to book but a lot of stuff in second half comes directly from it or directly inspired by it hamm s script had an ape astronaut from another planet crash landing in new york harbor launching a virus that will make human beings extinct dr susan landis who works for centers for disease control and prevention and alexander troy an area 51 scientist use ape s spacecraft to return to virus planet of origin hoping to find an antidote they find an urban environment where apes armed with heavy weapons hunt humans main villain was lord zaius in contrast to dr zaius lord zaius was very cruel to humans landis and troy discover antidote and return to earth only to find in their 74 year absence that apes have taken over planet statue of liberty s once proud porcelain features have been crudely chiseled into grotesque likeness of a great grinning ape schwarzenegger remained attached but fox had mixed emotions with hamm s script when columbus dropped out in late 1995 to work on jingle all way fox offered director s position to roland emmerich in january 1996 james cameron was in talks during filming of titanic as writer and producer cameron s version would have drawn elements from original film and its sequel beneath planet of apes after financial and critical success of titanic cameron dropped out after learning about his previous involvement chernin and rothman met with peter jackson to learn about his original renaissance idea jackson turned down directing film with schwarzenegger and cameron as his producer recognizing they would probably conflict over direction schwarzenegger left to work on eraser michael bay then turned down director s position jackson again turned down project while facing possible cancellation of lord of rings in 1998 because he was unenthusiastic following roddy mcdowall s death in mid 1999 hughes brothers were interested in directing but were committed to from hell pre production in 1999 william broyles jr turned down chance to write script but decided to sign on when i found out i could have an extensive amount of creative control fox projected release date for july 2001 while broyles sent studio an outline and a chronicle of fictional planet aschlar entitled visitor and billed as episode one in chronicles of aschlar broyles script caught attention of director tim burton who was hired in february 2000 i wasn t interested in doing a remake or a sequel of original planet of apes film burton said later but i was intrigued by idea of revisiting that world like a lot of people i was affected by original film i wanted to do a re imagining hughes p 44 46 richard d zanuck signed on as producer in march this is a very emotional film for me i greenlighted original apes when i was head of fox in 1967 under burton s direction broyles wrote another draft but his script was projected at a 200 million budget fox wanted to cut it to 100 million in august 2000 two months before principal photography fox brought lawrence konner and mark rosenthal for rewrites broyles had a lot of respect with work they konner and rosenthal did and to think that given what i d done and given what tim wanted they navigated right course one of considered endings had leo davidson crash landing at yankee stadium witnessing apes playing baseball various alternatives were considered before filmmakers decided on final one production of planet of apes was a difficult experience for burton this was largely contributed by fox s adamant release date july 2001 which meant that everything from pre production to editing and visual effects work was rushed konner and rosenthal were rewriting script even as sets were being constructed ari helena bonham carter s character was originally a princess she was changed to a senator s daughter with a liberal mentality helena bonham carter colleen atwood ape couture 2001 20th century fox one of drafts had general thade tim roth s character as an albino gorilla but burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening tim burton dvd audio commentary 2001 20th century fox limbo paul giamatti s character was supposed to turn into a good guy there was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at end giamatti reflected but tim burton and i both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as a jerk into end filming burton wanted to begin filming in october 2000 but it was pushed back to november 6 2000 and ended in april 2001 filming for planet of apes began at lake powell where parts of original film were shot due to a local drought production crews had to pump in extra water film was mostly shot at sony pictures studios in culver city california while other filming locations included lava plains in hawaii and trona pinnacles at ridgecrest to preserve secrecy shooting script did not include ending stan winston was original makeup designer but left because of creative differences fox considered using computer generated imagery to create apes but burton insisted on using prosthetic makeup designed by rick baker baker was previously involved with adam rifkin s unproduced remake burton commented i have a relationship with both of them winston and baker so that decision was hard he says stan worked on edward scissorhands and baker did martin landau s makeup as bela lugosi in ed wood on his hiring baker explained i did dino de laurentiis version of king kong in 1976 and was always disappointed because i wasn t able to do it as realistically as i wanted i thought apes would be a good way to make up for that in addition to king kong baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on greystoke legend of tarzan lord of apes gorillas in mist and 1998 remake of mighty joe young makeup took 4 5 hours to apply and 1 5 hours to remove burton explained it s like going to dentist at two in morning and having people poke at you for hours then you wear an ape costume until nine at night salisbury burton p 191 202 burton was adamant that apes should be substantially more animal like flying through trees climb walls swing out of windows and go ape shit when angry for a month and a half before shooting started actors who portrayed apes attended ape school industrial light magic rhythm and hues studios and animal logic were commissioned for visual effects sequences rick heinrichs served as production designer and colleen atwood did costume design to compose film score burton hired regular collaborator danny elfman who had previously been set as composer when adam rifkin was to do his remake in 1989 elfman noted that his work on planet of apes contained more percussion instruments than usual danny elfman chimp symphony 2001 20th century fox during filming roth held a grudge against heston due to his work with national rifle association it was very difficult for me on one level there s man and he s my dad but on other level whole nra thing is what it is now i m so against it very vocally so but it was inappropriate for workplace if i m going to talk to him i ll talk to him outside workplace so it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene roth later claimed he would not have appeared in film had he known he would be sharing a scene with heston reception box office to help market planet of apes fox commissioned an internet marketing campaign that also involved geocaching hasbro released a toy line while dark horse comics published a comic book adaptation original release date for film was july 4 2001 planet of apes was released on july 27 2001 in 3 500 theaters across north america earning 68 532 960 in its opening

approval rating of 44 based on 158 reviews with an average rating of 5 51 10 site s critical consensus reads this remake of planet of apes can t compare to original in some critics minds but striking visuals and b movie charms may win you over on metacritic film has an average score of 50 out of 100 based on 34 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale roger ebert of chicago sun times gave film 2 1 2 stars he praised twist ending but felt film lacked a balanced story structure peter travers of rolling stone gave a negative review call it a letdown worsened by forces of shoddy screenwriting to quote heston in both films damn them damn them all kenneth turan of los angeles times believed actors in nonhuman roles are mostly too buried by makeup to make strong impressions unfortunately none of good work counts as much as you d think it would turan said planet of apes shows that taking material too seriously can be as much of a handicap as not taking it seriously at all elvis mitchell of new york times gave a more favorable review feeling script was balanced and film served its purpose as pure entertainment susan wloszczyna of usa today enjoyed planet of apes feeling most of credit should go to prosthetic makeup designer rick baker much criticism was leveled against ambiguous ending tim roth who portrayed general thade said i cannot explain that ending i have seen it twice and i don t understand anything helena bonham carter who played ari said i thought it made sense kind of i don t understand why everyone went huh it s all a time warp thing he s gone back and he realizes thade s beat him there although ending was ambiguous it was closer to ending of actual pierre boulle book than was ending of 1968 charlton heston movie version in first of two twist endings of pierre boulle book astronaut escapes back to planet earth only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on landing strip burton claimed ending was not supposed to make any sense but it was more of a cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel it was a reasonable cliffhanger that could be used in case fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie he explained film was nominated for two bafta awards one for best make up held by rick baker other for best costume design roth supporting actor bonham carter supporting actress colleen atwood costume and rick baker make up received nominations at saturn awards atwood and baker were nominated at 55th british academy film awards while music composer danny elfman was nominated for his work at 43rd grammy awards planet of apes won worst remake at 22nd golden raspberry awards while heston worst supporting actor and estella warren worst supporting actress also won awards at 2001 stinkers bad movie awards film received nominations for worst director burton worst supporting actress warren and worst screenplay for a film grossing over 100m worldwide using hollywood math but it failed to win any of those legacy fox stated that if planet of apes was a financial success then a sequel would be commissioned although film was indeed a financial success fox decided not to proceed with a sequel when asked whether he would be interested in working on a follow up director tim burton replied i d rather jump out a window mark wahlberg and helena bonham carter would have returned if burton had decided to make another apes film paul giamatti had been interested in reprising his role i think it d be great to have apes driving cars smoking cigars giamatti said wearing glasses sitting in a board room stuff like that planet of apes was last film burton worked on with his former fiancee lisa marie after their relationship broke up
