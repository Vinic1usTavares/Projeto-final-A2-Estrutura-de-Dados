british and united states governments agreed to an australian government request that 9th division be returned home and ended role of second australian imperial force in western desert campaign this followed a lengthy debate between respective national leaders with winston churchill and franklin d roosevelt attempting to convince australian prime minister john curtin to withdraw his request until allied victory in north africa was complete curtin was unwilling to delay as he and allied military leaders in south west pacific believed that veteran division was needed to bolster forces for

1942 global strategic situation in december 1942 several factors influenced decision made by australian government in october 1942 to recall 9th division to australia most importantly government and commander of australian military forces general thomas blamey wanted to relieve 6th and 7th divisions from combat in new guinea campaign and blamey considered 9th division to be better prepared for this responsibility than australian army s militia forces or us army units hasluck 1970 pp 193 202 commander of allied forces in south west pacific area general douglas macarthur had also been pressing us and australian governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against japanese positions other factors influencing australian government s decision were a desire to concentrate australian army in a single theatre increasing difficulty of finding replacements for 9th division s casualties given army s manpower shortages political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside australian territory and concerns that a prolonged absence from australia would affect morale among 9th division s soldiers hasluck 1970

pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations long 1973 p 285 on 1 november us president franklin d roosevelt wrote to curtin proposing to send another us army division to

command that a decision had been made to return division to australia churchill told australian government on 2 december that while he was prepared to recommend to roosevelt that 9th division be returned resultant diversion of shipping would reduce size of build up of united states military forces in britain and north africa by 30 000 men in same cable churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping 9th division s heavy equipment would need to remain in middle east hasluck 1970 p 201 on 3 december roosevelt again wrote to curtin to suggest that 9th division remain in middle east until final defeat of axis forces in north africa roosevelt also informed curtin that us army s 25th infantry division would be transferred to australia during december following these messages australian government sought advice from blamey and macarthur on whether it was necessary for 9th division to return with its heavy equipment and was informed that necessary supplies could be sourced from american resources once unit arrived in australia maughan 1966 p 750 curtin replied to churchill and roosevelt on 8 december and again stressed need to return 9th division to australia as soon as possible to make good army s losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in pacific in his message he agreed to leave division s heavy equipment in middle east and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re enter combat in south west pacific hasluck 1970 p 202 no further debate took place and on 15 december churchill informed curtin that shipping would be

australia movement was code named tight security was instituted and more junior personnel who needed to be informed were told that their units were being transferred to egypt many members of aif

egypt threlfall 2014 pp 160 162 royal navy also made preparations in late 1942 for movement of 9th division back to australia four large troop ships were allocated to task and british chiefs of staff committee initially proposed to churchill that they sail across indian ocean without a protective escort however as eastern indian ocean was within range of japanese warships based at singapore and japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near aden this was judged to be unacceptably risky especially as it was not likely that movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret day 1993 p 91 moreover transporting division without an escort would have violated long standing policy of assigning at least one capital ship to protect troop convoys in this region and would not have been accepted by australian government in november chiefs of staff committee decided to allocate an escort to convoy but did not specify what it should comprise day 1993 p 92 ships assigned to carry 9th
