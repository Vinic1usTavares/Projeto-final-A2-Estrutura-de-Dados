hygrophorus eburneus commonly known as ivory waxy cap or cowboy s handkerchief is a species of edible mushroom in family of fungi it is widespread in europe and north america and has also been collected in northern africa fruit bodies are medium sized pure white and when wet are covered in a layer of slime thick enough to make mushroom difficult to pick up gills are broadly attached to stem or running down it as family name suggests they feel waxy when rubbed between fingers like all hygrophorus species fungus is mycorrhizal a symbiotic association whereby underground fungal mycelia penetrate and exchange nutrients with tree roots they are common in a variety of forest types where they grow on ground in thickets or grassy areas hygrophorus eburneus is type species of genus hygrophorus a number of biologically active chemicals have been purified from fruit bodies of fungus including fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity taxonomy species was first named as agaricus eburneus by french botanist jean bulliard in 1783 elias fries divided large genus agaricus into a number of tribes taxonomically equivalent to modern sections in his systema mycologicum i and classified a eburneus in tribe limacium when in 1836 fries first defined genus hygrophorus in his epicrisis systematis mycologici h eburneus was included fungus has also been named limacium by paul kummer in 1871 when he raised tribes of fries to rank of genus and eburneus by samuel frederick gray in 1821 h eburneus is type species of genus hygrophorus and is classified in section hygrophorus subsection hygrophorus this includes species with non amyloid smooth spores and divergent hyphae in tissue of hymenium other species in this subsection include h h coccus h h and h hesler and smith 1963 p 248 mushroom is commonly known as ivory waxy cap white waxy cap or cowboy s handkerchief specific epithet eburneus is a latin adjective meaning of ivory description thumb left species is characterized by its extremely slimy cap cap of h eburneus is broad with a shape ranging from convex to flattened sometimes with an umbo a raised area in center of cap in age cap margin sometimes becomes elevated and center of cap depressed cap is pure white and depending on moisture in environment may be glutinous to sticky cap surface is smooth margin is even and in young specimens rolled inward and covered with short fibrils flesh is white thick in center of cap but thinning toward margin odor and taste are mild gills are somewhat arcuate decurrent meaning they are shaped like a bow curving upward and then running down stem for a short distance in terms of spacing they are subdistant to distant so that space can be seen between them gills are moderately broad broadest near stem narrowed in front pure white slightly yellowish or buff with age or when dried stem is long thick equal in width throughout its length to somewhat tapered downward or with a greatly attenuated base and glutinous its surface is silky beneath gluten top of stem is covered with short fibrils pure white sometimes becoming grayish or dirty with age it is initially stuffed with cotton like mycelia then later becomes hollow caps of dried fruit bodies will typically remain white while stems will dry darker especially if they are initially waterlogged smith 1947 pp 253 55 microscopic characteristics thumb right spores are ellipsoid and smooth when they are viewed in mass such as with a spore print spores appear white observing with a light microscope reveals additional details spores are ellipsoid smooth and measure 6 8 by 3 5 5 mm they are pale yellow in melzer s reagent basidia spore bearing cells are 42 52 by 608 mm and four spored there are no pleurocystidia or cheilocystidia gill tissue is made of branching hyphae about 7 12 mm wide cap cuticle is made of gelatinous narrow 3 6 mm hyphae which are repent bent over but typically with some erect free ends clamp connections are present in hyphae edibility mushroom is edible although it may not be appealing to many due to its sliminess in china a yak milk beverage is made with h and yak milk by lactic acid fermentation with lactobacillus bulgaricus streptococcus and lactobacillus as mixed starter similar species a lookalike species of hygrophorus eburneus is h piceae which differs by having a less slimy cap dry to slightly viscid stem and frequent association with spruce h is just as slimy but has a cream colored cap thicker stalk and grows with pine snow white waxy cap h borealis is also similar in appearance but has a smaller cap diameter of up to and is not slimy roody 1997 p 119 retrieved 2010 06 30 hygrophorus cossus which typically grows with quercus species differs in its pale pinkish buff cap and gills and has a distinct sour odor also h cossus does not have a potassium hydroxide reaction on stem as does h eburneus white slime mushroom has non waxy gills that are free from attachment to stalk roody 1997 p 250 retrieved 2010 08 25 habitat and distribution fruit bodies of h eburneus grow on soil mostly in coniferous woods thickets and grassy areas fungus prefers soil that is moist mesic loamy and calcareous fungus is widely distributed in north america it is also found in europe poland and portugal israel and north africa bioactive compounds thumb 500px g acids found in hygrophorus eburneus several fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity have been isolated and identified from fruit bodies of h eburneus bioactive fatty acids are built upon a chemical structure called g oxocrotonate following gamma oxocrotonate derivatives have been identified from mushroom 2e 9e 4 oxooctadeca 2 9 17 trienoic acid 2e 11z 4 oxooctadeca 2 11 17 trienoic acid e 4 2 15
