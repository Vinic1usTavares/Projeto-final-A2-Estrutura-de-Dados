room as a murdered starlet he and gil set out to bring her killer to justice as they learn more about her troubled past they find themselves up against powerful hollywood elites who do not want to upset status quo although brubaker had been concerned premise was not commercial enough to have wide appeal fade out sold better than any of authors previous collaborations and early issues went through several printings series received positive reviews from critics publication history development ed brubaker s uncle john paxton was a noted hollywood screenwriter in 1930s and 1940s known for murder my sweet crossfire wild one and on beach his wife sarah jane paxton worked public relations for 20th century fox at same time they told brubaker stories about their experiences and he developed a lifelong fascination with time and setting in particular he was drawn to false personas he felt everyone had to put forward to succeed in mid 2014 having just finished their previous collaboration fatale brubaker and artist sean phillips were deliberating whether their next project would be a noir period piece or a science fiction tale brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels but timing aligned with their five year exclusive contract with image comics this contract guaranteed creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to publisher first pair announced fade out and their new contract on january 9 2014 at image expo david january 9 2014 ed brubaker and sean phillips sign a five year deal with image bleeding cool accessed june 10 2016 at time no length was given for series because they were not sure how many issues were needed to tell story since fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned they did not want to mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready they did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues when they were asked for a promotional image for use at image expo brubaker suggested a typewriter and some blood and a dead body s hands phillips removed hands and incorporated blood into logo after completing image he thought stark white background would help book stand out on sales racks and continued to use it for subsequent covers while central plot is a murder mystery initial idea was of a writer with ptsd who cannot write and is instead fronting for his blacklisted best friend throughout series brubaker switched between first and third person narration because it allowed him to tell a broader story he was also trying to create a layered story which would reward repeated reading so he avoided extraneous details when writing scripts brubaker listened to music from 1940s to stay in right frame of mind phillips who lives in united kingdom sometimes has difficulty accurately portraying modern america and said 1948 hollywood might as well be sci fi since there was not enough time for him to do his own research and maintain a monthly schedule brubaker hired amy condit as a research assistant condit who is manager of los angeles police museum supplied phillips with thousands of reference photos phillips also bought some dvds he thought might be useful but never found time to watch them although phillips has been using digital tools like cintiq and manga studio to create his art since 1997 fade out is his first project completed using them exclusively change increased amount of time needed to create each page by almost 50 percent but had no effect on colorist elizabeth breitweiser visually phillips style remained same as his previous work which critic charley parked notes for its strong spotted blacks and bold use of negative space parker charley june 9 2015 sean phillips lines and colors retrieved march 31

image comics retrieved september 13 2016 its total sales were estimated to be around 30 500 in addition to regular 22 pages of story each issue included extra material because opening credit page was a two page splash across inside front cover and page one an additional page needed to be inserted to make story start on recto side of page brubaker s solution was to use page two as a cast list with short descriptions that updated as story progressed which he felt was old fashioned and neat jess nevins and devin among others contributed essays and articles at end of each issue about crime and misfortune among actors famous in 1940s back cover of each issue included promotional images or reviews for fictional movie being filmed in comic these typically foreshadowed future events or expanded

fuse usually liked phillips work but felt sex scenes in issue seven did not play to artist s strengths mary kate jasper a reviewer for comic book resources noted how colorist elizabeth breitweiser enhanced phillips work with splotches of color in unexpected arrangements giving everyone appearance of being forever in shadow or inside with windows drawn she particularly liked how breitweiser made characters eyes appear to glisten and stand out in otherwise dark panels in other media brubaker received calls from interested parties in hollywood about adapting fade out very early in its publication however he did not want to sell rights until series was finished he had done so with a previous work and it affected way he wrote it because he was imagining it in other medium references
