shots three mainstream narratives emerged after shooting early view that israeli gunfire had killed boy developed into position that because of trajectory of shots palestinian gunfire was more likely to have been responsible this view was expressed in 2005 by denis jeambar editor in chief of l express and a former france 2 correspondent who viewed raw footage a third perspective held by arlette chabot france 2 s news editor is that no one can know who fired shots a fourth minority position held that scene was staged by palestinian protesters to produce a child martyr or at least appearance of one david frum l affaire al dura national post 17 november 2007 this is known by those who follow case as maximalist view as opposed to minimalist view that shots were probably not fired by idf

was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up several commentators questioned what time shooting occurred what time muhammad arrived at hospital why there seemed to be little blood on ground where they were shot and whether any bullets were collected several alleged that in other scenes in raw footage it is clear that protesters are play acting one physician maintained that jamal s scars were not from bullet wounds but dated back to an injury he sustained in early 1990s there was no criminal inquiry tom segev who killed mohammed al dura haaretz 22 march 2002 palestinian police allowed

international herald tribune said in 2005 that france 2 had shown newspaper original 27 minute tape of incident when court of appeal of paris asked in 2007 to see all footage during france 2 s libel

face final moments of footage france 2 30 september 2000 courtesy of youtube enderlin said he had cut this scene in accordance with france 2 ethical charter because it showed boy in his death throes

2012 126 127 in 2007 he said he had meant to use word agony not agonie if he were editing footage again he said in 2005 he would include that scene why footage stopped when it did another issue is why france 2 associated press and reuters did not film scene directly after shooting including shooting death of ambulance driver who arrived to pick up jamal and muhammad abu rahma s footage stops suddenly after shooting of father and son then begins again from same position with white minibus behind which abu rhama was standing visible in shot with other people being loaded into an ambulance abu rahma said muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up jamal and muhammad together but he did not film any of it when esther schapira asked why not he replied because when ambulance came it closed on them you know schapira and hafner 2009 00 13 32 14 when asked why he had not filmed ambulance arriving and leaving he replied that he had only one battery schapira and hafner 2009 00 14 01 09 enderlin reportedly told paris court of appeal that abu rahma changed batteries at that point schapira and hafner 2009 00 13 45 09 enderlin wrote in 2008 that

journalists view footage thumb denis jeambar in october 2004 france 2 allowed three french journalists to view raw footage denis jeambar editor in chief of l express daniel leconte former france 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at arte a state run television network and luc rosenzweig former editor in chief of le monde they also asked to speak to cameraman who was in paris at time but france 2 apparently told them he did not speak french and that his english was not good enough nidra poller myth fact and al dura affair commentary september 2005 jeambar and leconte wrote a report about viewing for le figaro in january 2005 none of scenes showed that boy had died they wrote they rejected position that scene had been staged but when enderlin s voiceover said muhammad was dead enderlin had no possibility of determining that he was in fact dead and even less so that he had been shot by idf soldiers they said footage did not show boy s death throes this famous agonie that enderlin insisted was cut from montage does not exist denis jeambar and daniel leconte dans la guerre des images le figaro 25 january 2005 several minutes of film showed palestinians playing at war for cameras they wrote falling down as if wounded then getting up and walking away a france 2 official told them you know it s always like that a comment that leconte said he found disturbing given controversy christine delavennat france 2 s communications director said that none of scenes in footage had been staged jeambar and leconte concluded that shots had come from palestinian positions given trajectory of bullets leconte said in an interview if they had been israeli bullets they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around corner he dismissed france 2 s explanation that perhaps bullets that hit boy had ricocheted off ground it could happen once but that there should be eight or nine of them which go around a corner they re just saying anything idea of writing about raw footage had been luc rosenzweig s he had initially offered a story about it to l express which is how jeambar editor of l express had become involved but jeambar and leconte ended up distancing themselves from rosenzweig he was involved with israeli french metula news agency known as mena which was pushing view that scene was a fake rosenzweig later called it an almost perfect media crime david gelernter when pictures lie los angeles times 9 september 2005 courtesy link when jeambar and leconte wrote up their report about raw footage they initially offered it le monde not le figaro but le monde refused to publish it because mena had been involved at an earlier stage jeambar and leconte made clear in le figaro that they gave no credence to staging hypothesis to those who like mena tried to use us to support theory that child s death was staged by palestinians we say they are misleading us and their readers not only do we not share that point of view but we attest that given our present knowledge of case nothing supports that conclusion in fact reverse is true enderlin s response enderlin responded to leconte and jeambar in january 2005 in le figaro he thanked them for rejecting that scene had been staged he had reported that shots were fired by israelis because he wrote he trusted cameraman who had worked for france 2 since 1988 in days following shooting other witnesses including other journalists offered some confirmation he said he added that israeli army had not responded to france 2 s offers to cooperate with their investigation another reason he had attributed shooting to israel he wrote was that image corresponded to reality of situation not only in gaza but also in west bank citing ben in israeli newspaper maariv he wrote that during first months of second intifada idf had fired one million rounds of ammunition 700 000 in west bank and 300 000 in gaza from 29 september to late october 2000 118 palestinians had been killed including 33 under age of 18 compared to 11 adult israelis killed during same period confusion about timeline confusion arose about timeline cameraman said shooting began at noon and continued for 45 minutes jamal s account matched his he and muhammad arrived at junction around noon and were under fire for 45 minutes enderlin s france 2 report placed shooting later in day his voiceover said that jamal and muhammad were shot around 3 00 pm local time gmt 3 james fallows agreed that jamal and muhammad first made an appearance in footage around 3 00 pm judging by comments from jamal and some journalists on scene abu rahma said he remained at junction for 30 40 minutes after shooting according to schapira he left for his studio in gaza at around 4 pm where he sent footage to enderlin
