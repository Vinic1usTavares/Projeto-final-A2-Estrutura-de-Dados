genus leptocyon whose various species existed from 34 mya before branching 11 9 mya into foxes and canini canines canids are found on all continents except antarctica having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time canids vary in size from gray wolf to fennec fox body forms of canids are similar typically having long muzzles upright ears teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh long legs and bushy tails they are mostly social animals living together in family units or small groups and behaving co operatively typically only dominant pair in a group breeds and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den canids communicate by scent signals and vocalizations one canid domestic dog long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of most widely kept domestic animals taxonomy in history of carnivores family canidae is represented by two extinct subfamilies designated as hesperocyoninae and borophaginae and extant subfamily caninae this subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives all living canids as a group form a dental monophyletic relationship with extinct with both groups having a two points on lower carnassial talonid which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication this together with development of a distinct entoconid cusp and broadening of talonid of first lower molar and corresponding enlargement of talon of upper first molar and reduction of its parastyle distinguish these late cenozoic canids and are essential differences that identify their

lycalopex and species evolution canidae today include a diverse group of some 34 species ranging in size from maned wolf with its long limbs to short legged bush dog modern canids inhabit forests tundra savannahs and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts of world evolutionary relationships between species have been studied in past using morphological approaches but more recently molecular studies have enabled investigation of phylogenetics relationships in some species genetic divergence has been suppressed by high level of gene flow between different populations and where species have hybridized large hybrid zones exist eocene epoch carnivorans evolved from about 55 mya during late paleocene some 5 million years later carnivorans split into two main divisions caniforms dog like and cat like by 40 mya first member of dog family proper had arisen called prohesperocyon wilsoni its fossilized remains have been found in what is now southwestern part of texas chief features which identify it as a canid include loss of upper third molar part of a trend toward a more shearing bite and structure of middle ear which has an enlarged bulla hollow bony structure protecting delicate parts of ear prohesperocyon probably had slightly longer limbs than its predecessors and also had parallel and closely touching toes which differ markedly from splayed arrangements of digits in bears canid family soon subdivided into three subfamilies each of which diverged during eocene hesperocyoninae about 39 74 15 mya borophaginae about 34 2 mya and caninae about 34 0 mya caninae are only surviving subfamily and all present day canids including wolves foxes coyotes jackals and domestic dogs belong to it members of each subfamily showed an increase in body mass with time and some exhibited specialized hypercarnivorous diets that made them prone to extinction oligocene epoch by oligocene all three subfamilies of canids hesperocyoninae borophaginae and caninae had appeared in fossil records of north america earliest and most primitive branch of canidae was hesperocyoninae lineage which included coyote sized of oligocene 38 24 mya these early canids probably evolved for fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat they resembled modern civets in appearance hesperocyonines eventually became extinct in middle miocene one of early members of hesperocyonines

subspecies of gray wolf c lupus had developed and had spread throughout europe and northern asia nowak r 1992 wolves great travelers of evolution international wolf 2 4 3 7 gray wolf colonized north america during late rancholabrean era across bering land bridge with at least three separate invasions with each one consisting of one or more different eurasian gray wolf clades mtdna studies have shown that there are at least four extant c lupus lineages dire wolf shared its habitat with gray wolf but became extinct in a large scale extinction event that occurred around 11 500 years ago it may have been more of a scavenger than a hunter its molars appear to be adapted for crushing bones and it may have gone extinct as a result of extinction of large herbivorous animals on whose carcasses it relied in 2015 a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole genome nuclear sequences of african and eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf like canids have colonized africa from eurasia at least five times throughout pliocene and pleistocene which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of african canid fauna diversity resulted from immigration of eurasian ancestors likely coincident with plio pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions when comparing african and eurasian golden jackals study concluded that african specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species canis anthus african golden wolf according to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences eurasian golden jackal canis aureus diverged from wolf coyote lineage 1 9 mya but african golden wolf separated 1 3 mya mitochondrial genome sequences indicated ethiopian wolf diverged from wolf coyote lineage slightly prior to

as exemplified by gray wolf although relative length of muzzle limbs ears and tail vary considerably between species with exceptions of bush dog raccoon dog and some domestic breeds of canis lupus canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies adapted for chasing prey tails are bushy and length and quality of pelage varies with season muzzle portion of skull is much more elongated than that of cat family zygomatic arches are wide there is a transverse ridge at rear of cranium and in some species a sagittal crest running from front to back bony orbits around eye never form a complete ring and auditory bullae are smooth and rounded females have three to seven pairs of mammae thumb skeleton of a black backed jackal canis mesomelas on display at museum of osteology all canids are digitigrade meaning they walk on their toes tip of nose is always naked as are cushioned pads on soles of feet these latter consist of a single pad behind tip of each toe and a more or less three lobed central pad under roots of digits hairs grow between pads and in arctic fox sole of foot is densely covered with hair at some times of year with exception of four toed african wild dog lycaon pictus five toes are on forefeet but thumb is reduced and does not reach ground on hind feet are four toes but in some domestic dogs a fifth vestigial toe known as a dewclaw is sometimes present but has no anatomical connection to rest of foot slightly curved nails are not retractile and more or less blunt penis in male canids is supported by a bone called baculum it also contains a structure at base called bulbus glandis which helps to create a copulatory tie during mating locking animals together for up to an hour young canids are born blind with their eyes opening a few weeks after birth all living canids caninae have a ligament analogous to nuchal ligament of ungulates used to maintain posture of head and little active muscle exertion this ligament allows them to conserve energy while running long distances following scent trails with their nose to ground however based on skeletal details of neck at least some of borophaginae such as are believed to have lacked this ligament dentition thumb 300px diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled thumb right eurasian wolf skull dentition relates to arrangement of teeth in mouth with dental notation for upper jaw teeth using upper case letters i to denote incisors c for canines p for premolars and m for molars and lower case letters i c p and m to denote mandible teeth teeth are numbered using one side of mouth and from front of mouth to back in carnivores upper premolar p4 and lower molar m1 form carnassials that are used together in a scissor like action to shear muscle and tendon of prey canids use their premolars for cutting and crushing except for upper fourth premolar p4 upper carnassial that is only used for cutting they use their molars for grinding except for lower first molar m1 lower carnassial that has evolved for both cutting and grinding depending on candid s dietary adaptation on lower carnassial trigonid is used for slicing and talonid is used for grinding ratio between trigonid and talonid indicates a carnivore s dietary habits with a larger trigonid indicating a and a larger talonid indicating a more omnivorous diet because of its low variability length of lower carnassial is used to provide an estimate of a carnivore s body size a study of estimated bite force at canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators when adjusted for their body mass found that for placental mammals bite force at canines was greatest in extinct dire wolf 163 followed among modern canids by four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves african wild dog 142 gray wolf 136 dhole 112 and dingo 108 bite force at carnassials showed a similar trend to canines a predator s largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits most canids have 42 teeth with a dental formula of bush dog has only one upper molar with two below dhole has two above and two below and bat eared fox has three or four upper molars and four lower ones molar teeth are strong in most species allowing animals to crack open bone to reach marrow deciduous or baby teeth formula in canids is molars being completely absent life history social behavior left thumb dholes attacking a sambar bandipur national park almost all canids are social animals and live together in groups in general they are territorial or have a home range and sleep in open using their dens only for breeding and sometimes in bad weather in most foxes and in many of true dogs a male and female pair work together to hunt and to raise their young gray wolves and some of other larger canids live in larger groups called packs african wild dogs have packs which may consist of 20 to 40 animals and packs of fewer than about seven individuals may be incapable of successful reproduction hunting in packs has advantage that larger prey items can be tackled some species form packs or live in small family groups depending on circumstances including type of available food in most species some individuals live on their own within a canid pack there is a system of dominance so that strongest most experienced animals lead pack in most cases dominant male and female are only pack members to breed left thumb red foxes barking in park gloucestershire england canids communicate with each other by scent signals by visual clues and gestures and by vocalizations such as growls barks and howls in most cases groups have a home territory from which they drive out other conspecifics territory is marked by leaving urine scent marks which warn trespassing individuals nowak r m paradiso j l 1983 walker s mammals of world baltimore maryland johns hopkins university press social behaviour is also mediated by secretions from glands on upper surface of tail near its root and from anal glands reproduction thumb right a feral dog from sri lanka nursing her puppies canids as a group exhibit several reproductive traits that are uncommon among mammals as a whole they are typically monogamous provide paternal care to their offspring have reproductive cycles with lengthy proestral and phases and have a copulatory tie during mating they also retain adult offspring in social group suppressing ability of these to breed while making use of care they can provide to help raise next generation of offspring during proestral period increased levels of oestradiol make female attractive to male there is a rise in progesterone during oestral phase and female is now receptive following this level of oestradiol fluctuates and there is a lengthy phase during which female is pregnant pseudo pregnancy frequently occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive a period of follows pregnancy or pseudo pregnancy there being only one oestral period during each breeding season small and medium sized canids mostly have a gestation period of 50 to 60 days while larger species average 60 to 65 days time of year in which breeding season occurs is related to length of day as has been demonstrated in case of several species that have been translocated across equator to other hemisphere and experiences a six month shift of phase domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more frequently perhaps because photoperiod stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting size of a litter varies with from one to 16 or more pups being born young are born small blind and helpless and require a long period of parental care they are kept in a den most often dug into ground for warmth and protection when young begin eating solid food both parents and often other pack members bring food back for them from hunt this is most often vomited up from adult s stomach where such pack involvement in feeding of litter occurs breeding success rate is higher than is case where females split from group and rear their pups in isolation young canids may take a year to mature and learn skills they need to survive w 1986 natural history of living mammals medford new jersey plexus publishing in some species such as african wild dog male offspring usually remain in natal pack while females disperse as a group and join another small group of opposite sex to form a new pack canids and humans thumb traditional english fox hunt one canid domestic dog entered into a partnership with humans a long time ago dog was first domesticated species archaeological record shows first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14 700 years ago with disputed remains occurring 36 000 years ago these dates imply that earliest dogs arose in time of human hunter gatherers and not agriculturists fact that wolves are pack animals with cooperative social structures may have been reason that relationship developed humans benefited from canid s loyalty cooperation teamwork alertness and tracking abilities while wolf may have benefited from use of weapons to tackle larger prey and sharing of food humans and dogs may have evolved together among canids only gray wolf has widely been known to prey on humans nonetheless at least two records of coyotes killing humans have been published and at least two other reports of golden jackals killing children human beings have trapped and hunted some canid species for their fur and some especially gray wolf coyote and red fox for sport canids such as dhole are now endangered in wild because of persecution habitat loss a depletion of ungulate prey species and transmission of diseases from domestic dogs see also canid hybrid free ranging dog
