leaves in a post credits scene a trail of blood leads away from an abandoned blade of olympus with kratos whereabouts unknown development in a 2007 interview with gametrailers god of war creator and game director david jaffe explained his original intention for series which is different from actual ending of god of war iii which was based on game director stig asmussen s vision jaffe s idea was that god of war explains or ultimately will explain why there are no more greek myths he said that it would have been hell on earth as gods and titans battled each other for domination other mythological pantheons would have become involved after kratos killed zeus and other greek gods and result would be that humankind no longer believed in gods according to jaffe only way a god can truly die god of war iii was first mentioned by god of war ii game director cory barlog at a god of war ii launch event barlog said that game would have full 1080p hd resolution changed to 720p in final release and support sixaxis tilt and vibration functions announced before dualshock 3 controller was introduced this caused confusion since sixaxis controller does not support rumble during 2009 game developers conference gdc creative team said that sixaxis tilt capability had been removed because they could not find a suitable situation to use sixaxis in game effectively after first eight months of development barlog left santa monica for other opportunities and stig asmussen took over as game director asmussen previously served as lead environment artist and art director on god of war and god of war ii respectively in an interview with ign asmussen said that barlog had a major impact on game and although he had left team they spoke several times afterwards and bounced a few ideas off him but there was no formal collaboration he also said that david jaffe had been around studio a few times and they had gone over some high level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback early in development when barlog was still with team he expressed interest in a cooperative mode if we can do something unique with it in november 2009 asmussen told gamepro that although a multiplayer option had been discussed it was unsuitable for god of war iii there s a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver and multi player doesn t fit into that by december 2009 game was in its final developmental stages in december 2008 sony reported that god of war iii would be last game in series however in january 2010 john hight told joystiq while god of war iii will conclude trilogy it won t spell end of franchise we re going to be really careful about what we do next asmussen mentioned possibility of downloadable content game would be shipped with regular challenge mode and new challenge modes might be released as downloadable content to maintain series in march 2009 it was reported that sony was seeking opinions about a collector s edition from playstation 3 owners in october an ultimate edition was unveiled for north america and an ultimate trilogy edition was announced soon afterwards for a limited european australian and new zealand release a trilogy edition was announced for japan where computer entertainment rating organization cero gave game an adults only z rating after previous two versions were considered suitable for players 17 and older technical asmussen said that one of greatest challenges in developing god of war iii for playstation 3 was complexity of everything individual tasks such as designing helios decapitation could take a year because level of detail that was expected was so high and intricate it crossed multiple departments he said that playstation 3 s hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with environment character model for kratos in playstation 2 ps2 games used about 5 000 polygons ps3 model was about 20 000 a high number but less than that used by other models such as nathan drake in uncharted 2 among thieves who used 35 000 ken feldman art director commented that polygon count was not only factor and cited increased texture detail as one of reasons for kratos s realistic appearance developers used a new technique called blended normal mapping to add realism to basic model and hugely enhance range of animation available e g muscle movement including visible veins and facial animations all of main protagonists were animated by hand because animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture though voice actors facial movements were recorded by image metrics s performance capture system for animating things like hair animators created a secondary animation code known as dynamic simulation which allows ps3 itself to mathematically calculate way it should look it accurately generates motion that previously took animators long hours to replicate engine for god of war iii was from first two installments santa monica senior producer steve said that development team ported god of war iis engine to playstation 3 and were able to quickly play game everything that kratos could do in previous games he could do on playstation 3 which allowed developers to immediately begin designing new content as game was being developed code department would swap out playstation 2 components with playstation 3 components they replaced renderer particle system and collision system feldman said that although they were re using engine from god of war ii core engine for god of war iii was brand new between 2009 electronic entertainment expo e3 and time game shipped morphological anti aliasing mlaa was added which graphics engineer ben diamand said improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame rate mlaa is now a popular edge detection process that can cost effectively remove jagged edges from each frame which helped santa monica free up processing cycle and allowed them to add to spectacle in other ways diamand also said that depth of field motion blur crepuscular god rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed during that same time period asmussen estimated overall game length to be 10 to 20 hours depending on how good of a gamer you are santa monica studio director john hight reassured players that god of war iii lasts longer than 10 hours we ve done a lot of play testing on it we know for a really hardcore player it ll take them longer than it took them to play either of previous god of war games finished game

ericson of sce santa monica studio confirmed that god of war iii has seamless loading no loading screens and no hard disk drive installation requirement sce america animator bruno velazquez said that

soundtrack was recorded by skywalker session orchestra and czech national symphony chorus each composer provided a different aesthetic to score for example marino s approach was brooding rhythmic and percussive and fish set hopeless and somber moods in an interview with game music online mike reagan said that although composers might have used each other s themes they did not collaborate with each other reagan said real collaboration came from clint bajakian senior music supervisor at sony and his team in scoring for god of war iii reagan said that composers were able to explore more melodic development than we were on first god of war score was recorded under new american federation of musicians video game agreement and because of sony s vision and support composers were able to record locally with some of best musicians in world in an interview with playstation blog clint bajakian described different ensembles that recorded score brass section is lead guitar choir gives game its epic feel strings are body of sound and percussion is foundation a nine out of ten review from square enix music online praised soundtrack s orchestration calling it best score in series to date g4 praised its quality saying that compositions were strong and it was fantastic as standalone music a six out of ten review from tracksounds said that although score lacks intricacy and personality that could set it apart and give it a sense of uniqueness it delivers on its promise of a loud wrathful bundle of tunes you can kill gods to for better or worse reviewer said to enjoy in small doses at 2010 spike video game awards soundtrack was nominated for best original score reception god of war iii received universal acclaim according to review aggregator metacritic with a score of 92 out of 100 and a score of 92 07 from gamerankings adam sessler of x play said that game finishes trilogy on an exceptionally high note and it blends all of its best attributes into a stellar experience ign s chris roper said that god of war iii practically redefines scale in video games singling out size of titans as being larger than entire levels in other games mike jackson of official playstation magazine uk called it biggest god of war game yet if it was series last game god of war iii gives playstation s toughest hero send off he deserves matt leone of 1up said that gameplay has variety you seemingly see acquire and participate in something new around every corner according to leone each weapon adds a lot of depth to combat system christian donlan of eurogamer said that combat system level flow and pacing of bosses and puzzles remains largely untouched but everything s bigger grander and more elaborate he praised weapons accessibility saying that it is easy to quickly switch between them according to tom mcshea of gamespot combat and scale have been pushed further than ever before creating an experience so focused and explosively fun that it s hard to put down and even harder to forget mcshea said that regardless of repetition brutality of combat is one of most satisfying aspects of god of war iii joe juba of game informer called god of war iii visceral and brutal and kratos undisputed king of genre jackson however said core gameplay s familiarity makes it feel less than very very best and according to roper two of three additional weapons are similar to main blades they have unique powers and slightly different moves but by and large they re more of same its plot received mixed reviews gametrailers said that god of war iiis storyline makes greek mythology more interesting gamefront s phil hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist and game assumed that players reveled in misery and violence as much as kratos did according to donlan story is as simple as it can get mcshea said that although it does not pick up until near end it becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale juba on other hand considered that plot doesn t have any standout revelations or developments jackson called god of war iiis graphics as good as if not better than those in killzone 2 and uncharted 2 among thieves according to juba cinematic camera work is even more impressive than naughty dog s feats with uncharted 2 roper said god of war iii presents some of most impressive visuals that i ve ever seen in a game kratos in particular looks phenomenal and is perhaps single most impressive looking character ever in videogames according to gametrailers levels are expertly designed and game s scale is most outstanding visual achievement awards and accolades god of war iii was awarded most anticipated game of 2010 at 2009 spike video game awards at 2010 spike video game awards it was awarded best ps3 game and best graphics and kratos received biggest badass award it was also a nominee for game of year best action adventure game best original score and character of year kratos other individual awards include best action adventure game gametrailers best action game gamespy best ps3 game game revolution and best ps3 exclusive shacknews at 2011 british academy of film and television arts bafta video game awards god of war iii received artistic achievement award and it was a nominee for action and gameplay awards remastered though original release of god of war iii was met with critical acclaim god of war iii remastered only garnered generally favorable reviews receiving aggregate scores of 80 37 and 81 out of 100 from gamerankings and metacritic respectively reviewers found it odd that sony decided to remaster god of war iii for playstation 4 as its story picks up immediately from ending of god of war ii which may confuse newcomers who have never played previous games praise was given to smoother textures and improved frame rate though because original already had impressive graphics changes were not major and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to game for 40 usd see also 2010 in video gaming 2012 in video gaming 2015 in video gaming references notes footnotes works cited
