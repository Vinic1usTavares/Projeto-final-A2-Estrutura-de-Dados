lt vz 34 formally designated as tank 34 light tank mark 34 was a czechoslovak designed light tank used mainly by slovakia during world war ii its suspension was based on that of carden loyd tankette of which czechs had purchased three plus a manufacturing license in 1930 dissatisfied with prototypes of vz 33 tankette czech army decided that it would be easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette s chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret 50 were built last of which was delivered during 1936 of which germans captured 22 including prototype when they occupied bohemia moravia in march 1939 but they promptly scrapped them slovaks seized remaining 27 when they declared independence from czechoslovakia at same time in slovak service it only saw combat during slovak national uprising description lt vz 34 was assembled from a framework of steel angle iron beams to which armor plates were riveted a firewall separated engine compartment from crew a door allowed access to engine from crew compartment it also had ventilation openings that could be closed driver sat on right side using a observation port protected by two flaps inner flap had an with a 25deg field of view it was connected to armored outer flap so that opening one closed other outer flap had a 3 mm slit to his right was a vision slit protected by of bulletproof glass inner flap was padded so that driver could rest his head on it when driving radio operator sat on left and had his own vision port with 50 mm of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter his radios were mounted on left wall of hull hull machine gun was between driver and radio operator in a ball mount with 30deg of traverse it could elevate 25deg and depress 10deg most of machine gun s barrel protruded from mount and was protected by an armored trough mount had a spotting telescope or open sights could be used if plug at top of ball mount was removed if necessary driver could lock mount into position and fire it himself using a bowden cable kliment and francev p 52 turret ring had a diameter of turret sides were thick and its roof had a thickness of turret was manually traversed 3deg per rotation of handle but gearing could be disengaged to allow commander to shoulder turret around as desired turret had a flat face in center of which was mounted main armament on right side was another machine gun in a ball mount commander had four in his cupola and a monocular mirror 1 3 x 35deg periscope which he could extend once he removed its armored cover in his hatch for vision while buttoned up this meant that commander was responsible for loading aiming and firing main gun and turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding tank kliment and francev pp 52 53 vertical front and side armor was 15 mm thick slanted plates had a thickness of engine hatch was thick and top and bottom plates were 8 mm in thickness this was deemed enough to deflect armor piercing 7 92 mm bullets fired from distances greater than kliment and francev p 51 water cooled inline 4 cylinder praga engine used a gasoline alcohol mix it had a top speed on road of and about cross country one fuel tank was located on each side of engine transmission had four forward gears and one reverse gear to drive front mounted drive sprockets suspension was an enlarged and modified version of that used in carden loyd tankettes it consisted of two small road wheels fastened together on a frame two frames paired and sprung by leaf springs that made a wheel carrier two wheel carriers per side track was guided by two return rollers and wooden metal lined frames rear mounted idler wheel was used to adjust track tension it had a ground pressure of only it could cross a ditch wide climb an obstacle high and ford a stream 80 cm deep it could uproot trees thick and breach a wall thick main armament was a skoda uv vz 34 a3 gun with a pepperpot muzzle brake and a prominent armored recoil cylinder above

25x power sights with a 25deg field of view tank used brno zb vz 35 heavy machine guns in both ball mounts kliment and francev p 53 development one prototype was ordered from ceskomoravska kolben in 1931 but development was slow and it was accepted only in november 1932 its evaluations were very positive and an order for fifty was placed on 19 april 1933 first six of these were to serve as pre production models and were to be delivered by 30 september 1933 delivery date for next batch of twenty four was a year after that and final batch of twenty was due by 30 july 1935 production was delayed by quality problems with initial batch of armor plates from and delivery of pre production series did not occur until 23 april 1934 a bigger problem was that army had rejected ckd s proposed armament of a vickers 44 60 gun and two zb vz 26 machine guns so contract was signed with no design work on desired armament configuration ckd did not finalize its design until december 1933 and first six tanks were delivered with only a pair of zb vz 26 machine guns last tanks were delivered on 14 january 1936 but six pre production models had to be returned to factory to be upgraded with proper armament and otherwise modified up to latest standards last one was delivered on 17 august 1936 kliment and francev pp 48 51 operational history czechoslovakia thumb right a czechoslovak lt vz 34 in 1935 czechoslovak army realized that 15 mm armor on its lt vz 34 tanks was too thin and a program to replace it was quickly mounted which resulted in lt vz 35 in meantime they offered army an opportunity to train with more modern tanks than its few surviving world war i era renault fts each of three armored regiments received between 9 and 24 tanks until replaced by lt vz 35 from 1937 after munich agreement in october 1938 army tried to sell them but could find no takers in november 1938 it decided to concentrate all of them in third armored regiment in slovakia but only eighteen had been transferred before german occupation of czechoslovakia and slovak declaration of independence in march 1939 germany germans captured 22 lt vz 34s plus prototype when they occupied czechoslovakia but there is no record of their use so they were presumably quickly scrapped ten lt vz 34s were captured after they were abandoned by insurgents during slovak national uprising in 1944 they were shipped to skoda works for repairs but local military representative ordered them scrapped because of their poor condition and obsolescence waffen ss tried to overturn this order as it planned to transfer them to nazi puppet state of croatia two were saved from scrapyard but by march 1945 others had their turrets salvaged to be rearmed with two machine guns and mounted in fixed fortifications hungary hungary captured one lt vz 34 in carpatho ukraine on 15 march 1939 when it conquered that country impressed hungarians asked skoda for a quote to repair it hungarians did not accept price but skoda fixed it for free once hungarians had bought a license to build medium 40m turan i tank in august 1940 it was returned to hungary in march 1941 and were used for training
