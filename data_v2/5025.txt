hms swordfish was an experimental submarine built for royal navy before first world war to meet navy s goal of an overseas submarine capable of on surface diesel engines of period were unreliable and not very powerful so steam turbines were proposed instead to meet rn s requirement swordfish proved to be slower than designed and unstable while surfacing and consequently she was modified as an anti submarine patrol vessel in 1917 she was paid off before end of war and sold for scrapping in 1922 design hms swordfish was developed to meet a requirement of royal navy s submarine committee for a large submarine capable of operating with fleet at a surfaced speed of most of earlier british submarines had been single hulled vessels built by vickers and navy was interested in evaluating other designs captain roger keyes inspecting captain of submarines had previously served as naval attache in italy and had kept abreast of italian submarine developments which notably included double hulled submarines designed by cesare laurenti of fiat san giorgio three boats of s class were ordered first and laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet rn requirement maber pp 154 55 fiat san giorgio was wary about using heavy oil diesel engines and hesitated to guarantee success of such engines of power required at same time laurenti prepared a design with geared steam turbines having a speed of 18 knots on a surface displacement of 856 tons harrison section 7 11 his design was modified by scotts shipbuilding and engineering company greenock to include guns swordfish kept same main dimensions as laurenti s original design but had a greater displacement and less endurance description swordfish had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of she displaced on surface and submerged she had a partial double hull which extended over 75 of her length upper portion of double hull was controlled free flooding while rest was devoted to watertight baling flats ballast and fuel tanks her hull was divided into eight compartments by seven watertight bulkheads harrison section 7 12 diving depth and time are not known because records from her sea trials have not survived shutting down her boiler retracting funnel and sealing boiler uptake required about a minute and a quarter which included switching over to electric motors in marked contrast to contemporary vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements including her extensive subdivision indicator and telephone buoys which could be released from inside submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or living spaces furthermore main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of ship mader p 159 propulsion swordfish had two parsons geared impulse reaction steam turbine sets each driving one of two propeller shafts turbines were powered by a single yarrow type boiler they were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of which used a superheater to increase working temperature by she was fitted with two electric motors which had a combined output of two battery rooms each had 64 battery cells it is uncertain if ship reached her designed speed of on surface although it seems unlikely given her increased displacement over laurenti s original design maximum speed was underwater mader pp 155 158 swordfish could carry of fuel oil which her builders estimated gave her an endurance of at a speed of on surface on her batteries her submerged endurance was at a speed of armament swordfish had two tubes for torpedoes in her bow they were stepped vertically and positioned well back from stem in a notch from keel to preserve fine lines of bow two torpedo tubes were positioned on each beam amidships each torpedo tube was provided with one reload two exact type of 3 inch gun is unknown were fitted on deck in disappearing mounts one each fore and aft of conning tower they were covered by watertight hoods to preserve streamlining of submarine construction and service swordfish was ordered from scotts shipbuilding and engineering company on 18 august 1913 although she was not laid down until 28 february 1914 start of first world war six months later greatly hindered her completion and she was not launched until 18 march 1916 mader p 158 hms swordfish was commissioned on 28 april 1916 before completion and renamed hms s1 that same day she was not completed until 21 july harrison section 7 20 captained by commander geoffrey layton her post completion trials lasted for five months as she was used to evaluate steam power for submarine use much was learned about operation of steam submarines which helped subsequent design of steam powered k class fleet submarines she proved to be very unstable while surfacing presumably because she could not pump water out of her controlled free flooding spaces quickly enough in upper part of her double hull these problems coupled with fact that she was too slow to work with fleet as originally envisioned meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship and she was laid up after her trials p 146 in july 1917 s1 reverted to her original name and was converted to a surface patrol vessel between 27 june 1917 and 24 january 1918 her torpedo tubes and disappearing guns were removed she was given a forecastle a bridge and her funnel was fixed in place and extended she was rearmed with a pair of 12 exact model of 12 pounder fitted is unknown guns and depth charges weapons more suitable for her new role as an anti submarine patrol boat swordfish joined 1st destroyer flotilla at portsmouth upon completion of her sea trials but nothing is known of her subsequent service swordfish was paid off on 30 october 1918 and stricken from navy list by january 1919 she was sold for scrapping to pounds of portsmouth in july 1922 but was reported to have been resold to hayes of porthcawl in 1923 colledge p 341 notes footnotes references category submarines of royal navy category ships built on river clyde category 1916 ships category world war i submarines of united kingdom
