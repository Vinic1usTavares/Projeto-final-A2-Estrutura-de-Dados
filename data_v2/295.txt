astronaut group 3 was a group of fourteen astronauts selected by nasa their selection was announced in october 1963 four died in training accidents before they could fly in space all of surviving ten flew in apollo program five also flew gemini missions aldrin bean cernan and scott walked on moon group 3 was first to waive requirement of a test pilot background though military jet fighter aircraft experience was substituted this applied to aldrin anders cernan chaffee cunningham and schweickart all others were test pilots on average its members were younger slightly taller and heavier than previous two groups and better educated background launch of sputnik 1 satellite by soviet union on october 4 1957 started a cold war technological and ideological competition with united states known as space race demonstration of american technological inferiority came as a profound shock to american public in response to sputnik crisis u s president dwight d eisenhower created a new civilian agency national aeronautics and space administration nasa to oversee an american space program space task group stg at nasa langley research center in hampton virginia created an american spaceflight project called project mercury which aimed to send a person to space and then into orbit selection of first astronauts known as original seven or mercury seven was announced on april 9 1959 by 1961 although it was yet to launch a person into space stg was confident that project mercury had overcome its initial setbacks and united states had overtaken soviet union as most advanced nation in space technology stg began considering mercury mark ii a two person successor to original mercury spacecraft this confidence was shattered on april 12 1961 when soviet union launched vostok 1 and cosmonaut yuri gagarin became first person to orbit earth in response president john f kennedy announced a far more ambitious goal on may 25 1961 to put a man on moon by end of decade this already had a name project apollo two person mercury ii spacecraft concept was officially named project gemini on january 3 1962 on april 18 1962 nasa formally announced that it was accepting applications for a second group of astronauts who would assist mercury astronauts with project mercury and join them in flying project gemini missions it was anticipated that they might go on to command project apollo missions nine candidates known as next nine were selected and their names were publicly announced on september 17 1962 by may 1963 while there were enough astronauts for needs of project gemini schedule for project apollo called for four crewed earth orbit missions launched by saturn i rockets in 1965 between two and four launched by saturn ib rockets in 1966 and six or more earth orbit and lunar orbit missions launched by saturn v rockets commencing in 1967 on that schedule nasa chief of astronaut office grounded mercury seven astronaut deke slayton could foresee a shortage of astronauts although he doubted so many flights would actually be flown moreover by mid 1963 three mercury seven astronauts scott carpenter john glenn and himself were no longer flying leaving thirteen active astronauts on that basis he calculated an attrition rate of about ten percent per year it followed that project apollo might require another ten to twenty astronauts on june 5 1963 nasa announced that it would be recruiting ten to fifteen new astronauts civilian applications had to be submitted by july 1 1963 military ones were due by july 15 to give services time to pre screen their applicants selection criteria selection criteria were similar to those for next nine except that minimum flight hours was lowered to 1 000 with test pilot qualification no longer required and maximum age was lowered to 34 key criteria were that candidates were u s citizens aged less than 34 on june 30 1963 or less in height with a degree in engineering or physical sciences were experienced test pilots or with 1 000 hours jet pilot flying time and recommended by employer selection process a selection panel was established consisting of mercury seven astronauts deke slayton alan shepard wally schirra and john glenn and nasa test pilot warren j north chief of flight crew operations by deadlines 720 applications were received of which 492 were from military personnel and 228 were from civilians of these 490 were considered eligible and 136 were selected for screening selection panel considered applications between july 17 and 20 and picked top 34 for further examination they were sent to brooks air force base for medical examinations between july 31 and august 15 candidates were relieved that we were not subjected to indignities endured by original seven tests included running on treadmills and blood sugar tests hypoxia tests were carried out to see how they reacted to a loss of oxygen they were spun about in darkened rooms to test their resistance to motion sickness and ice water was poured into one ear to test how inner ears reacted to such an imbalance psychological tests included being given a blank sheet of white paper and asked what it depicted michael collins one of few who had been through process in 1962 said it was of polar bears having sex in snow six candidates were eliminated on medical grounds final stage of selection process were interviews by selection panel which were conducted at manned spacecraft center msc in houston between september 2 and 7 collins felt that interview was easier second time around panellists were no longer strangers questions they asked were no longer unpredictable and he had benefit of having attended united states air force usaf aerospace research pilot school arps he recalled that even deke slayton and warren north seem to have mellowed a bit slayton had developed a points system for assessing candidates ten points each were allocated to academics pilot performance and character and motivation for a possible score of thirty points slayton then took thirteen names to a meeting chaired by msc director robert r gilruth maxime faget his director of engineering and development had an objection thirteen was an unlucky number so slayton added next candidate walter cunningham to list successful candidates received phone calls from slayton unsuccessful ones got calls from north or jack g from nasa public relations four of unsuccessful finalists would later become nasa astronauts in nasa astronaut group 5 in 1966 vance brand ronald evans james irwin and jack swigert and michael j adams would be posthumously awarded his astronaut wings for x 15 flight 3 65 97 an official announcement was made at a press conference at msc in houston on october 18 new astronauts became known as fourteen demographics seven of fourteen were from usaf major edwin buzz aldrin and captains william anders charles bassett michael collins donn eisele theodore freeman and david scott four were from united states navy lieutenant commander richard gordon and lieutenants alan bean gene cernan and roger chaffee captain clifton c c williams was from united states marine corps there were two civilians walter cunningham who was a captain in marine corps reserve and russell rusty schweickart who was a captain in massachusetts air national guard in retrospect collins noted we were in same tradition as previous two groups despite press s natural tendency to highlight differences all were married except for williams who became first bachelor astronaut their average age at time of selection was 31 compared with 34 5 for mercury seven and 32 5 for next nine they were slightly taller at compared with for seven and for nine their average weight was higher too compared to for seven and for nine flying time was lower whereas seven had averaged 3 500 hours of which 1 700 was in jets and nine had averaged 2 800 hours with 1 900 in jets fourteen had an average of 2 300 hours with 1 800 in jets educational achievement was a major while six of nine had bachelor s degrees and three had master s degrees only seven of fourteen had only bachelor s degree and three of them were working on their master s six had master s degrees and cunningham was working on his doctorate and buzz aldrin had a doctor of science degree from massachusetts institute of technology all were male and white president john f kennedy was disturbed at lingering discrimination against african americans in particular in armed services and in 1962 he brought pressure to bear on chief of staff of united states air force general curtis lemay to nominate an african american astronaut candidate usaf selected captain edward j dwight jr a b 57 pilot with 2 000 hours in high performance jets an aeronautical engineering degree from arizona state university and outstanding performance reviews for training at usaf test pilot school dwight graduated with class 62 c in april 1963 he was third african american to attend after john l whitehead jr who had graduated in 1958 and joseph c watts a civilian in 1960 fourth would be robert henry lawrence jr in 1966 by 1984 six had graduated dwight then applied for arps and robert f kennedy told lemay to ensure that he was accepted commandant colonel chuck yeager protested saying that there were other pilots that had been rated higher than dwight all were accepted so class iv had fourteen members instead of usual eight why in hell would a colored guy want to go into space anyway yeager asked adding and if it was left to me you guys wouldn t even get a chance to wear an air force uniform dwight was ranked eighth in his class along with seven ahead of him dwight was recommended by usaf for nasa astronaut training in july 1963 dwight was not one of final candidates although classmates scott
