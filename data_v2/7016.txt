preston bypass was britain s first motorway it was designed and engineered by lancashire county council surveyor james drake as part of a larger initiative to create a north south motorway network that would later form part of m6 motorway bypass was opened on 5 december 1958 by prime minister harold macmillan nearly ps3 million was spent in its construction original mile motorway ran around east side of preston between bamber bridge now m6 junction 29 and broughton now m55 junction 1 and crosses over river ribble at samlesbury at m6 junction 31 planning started in 1937 despite there being no legal powers that permitted motorway construction until introduction of special roads act 1949 early work was hampered by heavy rainfall resulting in postponement of various heavy engineering works such as base foundation result of weather meant original two year plan was delayed by a further five months weeks after opening road had to close temporarily due to water causing further problems when base layer was damaged as a result of a rapid freeze and thaw cycle bypass has undergone two separate lane widening schemes during its existence first in 1966 when it was widened to three lanes then in 1990s to expand it to four lanes in each direction latter upgrade was significant enough to require reconstruction of entire route including all bridges and it is now effectively a different motorway from one that opened in 1958 history planning before motorway was constructed a6 road through preston handled north south traffic with tailbacks and congestion a common occurrence more so during special occasions such as blackpool illuminations route had been planned as far back as 1937 1938 with basic alignment still deemed feasible by time lancashire county council gave approval in mid 1940s chief engineer drake was part of a delegation from lancashire that travelled to germany in 1938 in order that a plan could be drawn up by council agreed route formed part of county surveyors society s national proposals and was protected by lancashire county council from any future developments during planning legal powers necessary for motorway construction did not exist until introduction of special roads act in 1949 that made it lawful to construct roads that were to be used only by certain classes of vehicle bypass was seen as an experiment for future motorway construction with many lessons and techniques being learnt that would contribute to success of future projects when proposals were made public including a large scale model to ease explaining of scheme only a handful of formal objections were raised and were resolved by agreement without need to initiate a public inquiry cited in part because of close personal involvement of lancashire county council and surveyor during consultation tarmac group now carillion won construction bid in 1956 including 19 bridges john cox was onsite engineer assigned by contractor to oversee construction construction thumb right bypass under construction 5 december 1958 road was originally built with two lanes in each direction but with an unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date work was a compromise between ministry of transport and drake latter thinking that two lanes would not be adequate initially shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved a fact still reflected in british term hard shoulder a hedge was planted along length of central reservation to help reduce dazzle from headlights of oncoming traffic at night road was constructed not to be a long stretch of straight road and with addition of various bridges and tree planting in hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways earth material used for embankments was planned to come from road foundation works but rainfall meant it was no longer fit for purpose and had to be imported instead in total of earth was excavated with a further of material imported for filling sub base consisted of burnt red shale with thickness dependent upon ground conditions followed by a layer of wet mix around thick and topped with 2 3 inches approximately of tarmac lined with 0 5 1 inches approximately of asphalt a total of 22 bridges were required in construction and designers were given relative freedom in planning them chief engineer drake proposed bridges be painted different colours to enhance aesthetics and help alleviate driver boredom contrary to conventional practice of using neutral colours drivers subsequently reacted favourably to alternately coloured bridges contracted period for construction was planned to be around two years but timescale was lengthened by nearly 25 due to rainfall that persisted throughout much of early construction period heavy rainfall in late 1956 had profound effects on heavy engineering works required to construct road foundation resulting in this aspect of work being postponed until early 1957 an extension of five months was granted due to extraordinary and unforeseen weather conditions numerous lessons were learnt from construction of britain s first motorway particularly towards using an appropriately screened base material with water drainage systems that should be appropriate and fit for purposes as well as inclusion of continuous hard shoulders opening thumb right plaque to commemorate opening of bypass bypass was opened on 5 december 1958 by prime minister harold macmillan it had cost ps2 960 481 of which almost ps2 5m was for construction of motorway itself and over ps500 000 was for construction of two required major bridges those being samlesbury bridge ps334 431 and high walton bridge 690 respectively macmillan became first man in britain to travel on a motorway as a passenger in an austin limousine setting off from what is now junction 31 on m6 motorway many hundreds of people gathered at interchange in samlesbury to witness official opening of whom many had participated in construction and were proud of what they had achieved operation thumb left bypass being used shortly after opening 1958 motorway was designed to be capable of handling vehicles at speeds of a limit which is unchanged to this day no speed limit was enforced for first few years lancashire police estimated that 2 300 cars were using road each day within first month of opening which was considerably less than road s capacity during early period of operation drivers reported being apprehensive about using motorway through fear of faster drivers overtaking them with average speeds recorded as being around despite police records for month ending 23 may 1959 showing no vehicle being driven faster than shortly after opening motorway saw its first two minor incidents each was as a result of inexperienced drivers in one case an underage driver being unfamiliar with motorway driving and losing control of their vehicles on 21 january 1959 just 46 days after opening motorway had to close temporarily to undergo emergency resurfacing work as water had drained into hard shoulder and seeped into base layer this subsequently suffered as a result of frost weathering resulting in crumbling road parts affecting approximately 1 of surface cost of repairs was around ps5 000 as quoted by then minister of transport and civil aviation harold watkinson additional drainage systems were also installed alongside carriageway at a cost of ps90 000 upgrades an additional third lane was added in each direction in 1966 using land reserved within central reservation without need to modify existing bridges despite relative ease in this work lack of hard shoulders at bridges meant number of available lanes during engineering works was inadequate to cope with traffic volumes of time estimated to be have been in region of 140 000 vehicles daily construction of m61 motorway in 1969 1970 to carry manchester traffic northbound had its northern terminus connect to a new junction on bypass at bamber bridge requiring construction of bridge to carry north bound m61 traffic over m6 bypass underwent significant work during early 1990s when it was completely rebuilt to become four lanes in each direction all of bridges needed removing so a hard shoulder could be provided despite most of them having a design lifespan of 120 years bid to undertake work was awarded to balfour beatty in february 1993 at a cost of ps37 458 986 upgrade meant that bypass was entirely reconstructed and is now effectively a different motorway to original bypass four lane motorway had been initially proposed back in 1924 when idea was quickly dismissed after pressure mounted from railway lobbyists route thumb 330px right preston bypass route left 1958 right 2017 despite motorway passing through industrial areas proposed route alignment meant that property demolition was kept to a minimum with just a single farmhouse and three dwellings requiring demolition route was constructed through four separate localities including through county borough of preston through urban district of walton le dale through urban district of fulwood and through rural district of preston initially there were a total of 22 bridges built under or over motorway such as a principal bridge at samlesbury which carried traffic over river ribble and a59 trunk road only junction upon opening other principal bridge was at higher walton carrying traffic over river darwen and road overall width of motorway was for each carriageway for verges and a central reservation routes
