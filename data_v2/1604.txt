including singer ortega and racing driver carlos reutemann elections were a big success for pj romero p 300 after these elections all of pj was aligned with menem s leadership with exception of a small number of legislators known as group of eight opposition from ucr was minimal as party was still discredited by 1989 crisis with such political influence menem began his proposal to amend constitution to allow a re election romero p 301 party did not have required super majority in congress to call for it pj was divided as other politicians intended to replace menem in 1995 or negotiate their support ucr was divided as well as alfonsin opposed proposal but governors angeloz and were open for negotiations victory in 1993 elections strengthened his proposal which was approved

agreed to support proposal in exchange for amendments that would place limits on presidential power this negotiation is known as pact of olivos capital city of buenos aires would be allowed to elect its own chief of government presidential elections would use a system of ballotage and president could only be re elected once electoral college was abolished replaced by direct elections provinces

congressional plaza as a form of protest first operated in co and this protest method was soon imitated in rest of country his authority in pj was also held in doubt as he was unable to run for another re election and party sought a candidate for 1999 elections this led to a fierce rivalry with duhalde most likely candidate menem attempted to undermine his chances and proposed a new amendment to constitution allowing him to run for an unlimited number of re elections he also started a judicial case claiming that his inability to run for a third term was a proscription several scandals erupted such as scandal over argentine arms sales to ecuador and croatia rio tercero explosion that may have destroyed evidence murder of journalist jose luis cabezas and suicide of alfredo
