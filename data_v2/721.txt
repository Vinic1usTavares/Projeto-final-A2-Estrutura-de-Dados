hd 40307 is an orange k type main sequence star located approximately 42 light years away in constellation of pictor easel taking its primary name from its henry draper catalogue designation it is calculated to be slightly less massive than sun hd 40307 was observed during or before 1900 as part of cape photographic durchmusterung cpd 60 508 database entry cape photographic durchmusterung cpd d gill and j c 1895 1900 cds id i 108 star has six known planets three discovered in super earths found around one star nbc news june 16 2008 accessed on line june 18 2008 and three more in 2012 one of them hd 40307 g is a potential super earth in habitable zone with an orbital period of about 200 days this object might be capable of supporting liquid water on its surface although much more information must be acquired before its habitability can be assessed possible earth like planet could hold water scientists cautious amina khan los angeles times november 7 2012 accessed on line november 8 2012 history and nomenclature designation hd 40307 is from henry draper catalogue which is based on spectral classifications made between 1911 and 1915 by annie jump cannon and her co workers and was published between 1918 and 1924 pp 214 215 in henry draper memorial annie j cannon journal of royal astronomical society of canada 9 5 may june 1915 pp 203 215 henry draper catalogue annie j cannon and edward c pickering annals of harvard college observatory hours 0 to 3 91 1918 hours 4 to 6 92 1918 hours 7 to 8 93 1919 hours 9 to 11 94 1919 hours 12 to 14 95 1920 hours 15 to 16 96 1921 hours 17 to 18 97 1922 hours 19 to 20 98 1923 hours 21 to 23 99 1924 characteristics as a k type star hd 40307 emits orange tinted light it has only about three quarters of sun s radius and mass its temperature is measured at slightly under 5000 k this is relatively high for a k type star approaching temperatures normally found in g type stars such as sun astronomers who discovered planets orbiting hd 40307 suggested that metallicities of stars determine whether or not planetary bodies that orbit them will be terrestrial like earth or gaseous like jupiter and saturn distance and visibility despite its relative proximity to sun at 42 light years hd 40307 is not visible to naked eye given its apparent magnitude of 7 17 it came within 6 4 light years of sun about 413 000 years ago planetary system thumb 250px left orbits of inner three planets of hd 40307 after spending five years observing star european organisation for astronomical research in southern hemisphere eso announced that they had discovered three super earths in orbit around hd 40307 in june 2008 all three planets were detected by radial velocity method using harps spectrograph system in 2012 an independent analysis carried out by a team of astronomers led by mikko tuomi of university of hertfordshire confirmed existence of these planets and found an additional three planets in systems five of planets orbit very close to star with farthest of them located twice as close to hd 40307 than is planet mercury is to sun mercury orbits at approx 0 39 au outermost planet orbits at a distance similar to distance of venus to sun and is situated well in system s liquid water habitable zone minimum masses of planets in system ranges from three to ten times mass of earth placing them somewhere between earth and gas giants like uranus and neptune dynamical analysis of innermost planets suggests that planet b is unstable at its age unless it is an ice giant having migrated from further away that implies similar for other planets even further out most recent discovery also indicates via dynamical analysis that true planetary masses can not be much higher than their minimum masses see also list of extrasolar planets other stars with planets discovered in june 2008 hd 181433 hd moa 2007 blg notes references external links a trio of super earths a harvest of low mass exoplanets discovered with harps press release european southern observatory eso 19 08 june 16 2008 040307 2046 cd 60 category k type main sequence stars hd 040307 category pictor constellation category planetary systems with six confirmed planets
