youthful audience to be 49 and appreciated by 14 year olds again what a thrill weinberg engaged in stare downs with o brien and gave scripted about newsmakers additionally weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits when conan o brien was host of saturday night live on march 10 2001 his monologue featured a visit from snl studio to late night studio only a few floors apart in same building 30 rockefeller plaza where conan discovers weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk played by max s real

hartford civic center in 2007 springsteen reunited e street band in 1999 on a more lasting basis for bruce springsteen and e street band reunion tour this posed a dilemma for weinberg whose greater loyalty was to o brien and nbc indeed up until then weinberg had never missed a late night show appearing in over 1 000 in a row however allowing weinberg to tour for one of highest profile reunions in rock history was thought to be of long term benefit to television show s appeal and an arrangement was worked out wherein weinberg took a leave of absence from late night in order to go out on this and subsequent tours when he was tied up with springsteen drummer james wormworth took his place and band was led by jimmy vivino jimmy vivino and max weinberg 7 when reunion tour was extended in length shows were generally restricted to weekends so as to permit weinberg to fulfill his late night responsibilities at nbc coexistence between drummer s two bosses was known as weinberg springsteen rule and was not typically extended to other talent at network while weinberg did not forget breakup and long separation he viewed it as at same time most horrifying experience i ve ever been through and most liberating in any case he immediately felt comfortable playing with springsteen once more right from first downbeat of first rehearsal it was there again his drumming for e street band was more relaxed and mature than before showing more confidence and finesse and his hands and fingers were in better shape for having done daily late night work when tour concluded with ten shows at new york s madison square garden on several days weinberg taped conan show at rockefeller center in late afternoon put his hands in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest and played with

a float that took him outside studio and purportedly to airport weinberg returned to show on august 3 after flying back from a springsteen show that had ended early into same morning in spain of being tonight show bandleader he said i think one of biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in same sentence as doc severinsen who in my view is gold standard for tonight show bandleaders there s never been anyone who did it quite near class and brilliance of doc severinsen in original tonight show band i used to think when i was a kid what a great job that must be you know same place every time everyday lo and behold here i am 40 years later doing it that sounds deep deep deep deep deeply satisfying to me on september 25 weinberg left tonight show again for two months to join

retained his home in new jersey and considered that his permanent residence i m not really moving i m living out here but it s more like an extended road trip regarding his decision to stay in music rather than pursue legal profession he has had no regrets world needs more drummers and fewer lawyers however weinberg s stint as tonight show bandleader was not to last long 2010 tonight show host and timeslot conflict erupted and after an intense period of public turmoil last conan show took place on january 22 2010 finishing with weinberg propelling a guest filled rendition of free bird while

occasionally stopping by to sit in on new show weinberg said his health was better than ever but that life changing experience emotionally and spiritually of surgery a desire to remain in new jersey

again hit road with springsteen and e street band for river tour 2016 in january 2016 which in its various phases lasted until february 2017 he appreciated shows on first leg of tour where they played entire 20 song river album in sequence because when you play something night after night you really get to dig into material just as an instrumentalist he attributed his ability to keep playing during some of longest shows in e street band history to his keeping in top physical condition including exercise by swimming and to his love of playing with springsteen once tour was over weinberg said he would continue to appear with his various own bands including doing weddings and bar and bar mitzvahs just as he had earlier in his career he also liked to watch his son jay play with slipknot although he conceded he did so from a safe zone where he would not get knocked down by audience equipment for many years weinberg s gear included ludwig and pearl drums and zildjian cymbals he subsequently switched to dw drums but continues to use zildjian cymbals he also uses remo heads and previously using regal tip drumsticks and brushes he now uses vater drumsticks notably 5a nude wood tip model and wire tap brushes his setup has always been simple mostly consisting of a snare drum mounted tom bass drum and floor tom while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals a ride
