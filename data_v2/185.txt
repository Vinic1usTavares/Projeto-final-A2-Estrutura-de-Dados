upsets them so much with attacks getting so bad and coming so often biographer denis judd believes that john s seclusion and abnormality must have been disturbing to his brothers and sister as he had been a friendly outgoing little boy much loved by his brothers and sister a sort of mascot for family he spent christmas day 1918 with his family at sandringham house but was driven back to wood farm at night on 18 january 1919 after a severe seizure john died in his sleep at wood farm at 5 30 p m queen mary wrote in her diary that news wasa great shock tho for poor little boy s restless soul death came as a great relief she broke news to george and they motored down to wood farm found poor lala very resigned but heartbroken little johnnie looked very peaceful lying there mary later wrote to emily alcock an old friend john it is a great relief as his malady was becoming worse as he grew older he has thus been spared much suffering i cannot say how grateful we feel to god for having taken him in such a peaceful way he just slept quietly into his heavenly home no pain no struggle just peace for poor little troubled spirit which had been a great anxiety to us for many years ever since he was four years old she went on to add that first break in family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind sympathetic this has helped us much george described his son s death

first public mention of john s epilepsy his funeral was following day at st mary magdalene church john neale dalton officiating times 22 january 1919 queen mary wrote dalton dr brownhill john s physician conducted service which was awfully sad and touching many of our own people and villagers were present we thanked all johnnie s servants who have been so good and faithful to him though nominally private funeral was attended by sandringham house staff every single person on estate went and stood around gates and his grave was absolutely covered in flowers as remembered by winifred thomas quoted by her daughter in queen alexandra wrote to queen mary that now their two darling lie side by side legacy thumb left prince john right and prince george on a royal shopping trip prince edward who was eleven years older than his brother and had hardly known john saw his death as little more than a regrettable nuisance he wrote to his mistress of time that poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else edward also wrote an insensitive letter to queen mary which has since been lost she did not reply but he felt compelled to write her an apology in which he stated that he felt like such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that he did no one can realize more than she how poor little johnnie meant to him who hardly knew him i feel so much for you darling mama who was his mother in her final mention of john in her diary queen mary wrote simply miss dear child very much indeed she gave winifred thomas a number of john s books which she had inscribed in memory of our dear little prince lala bill always kept a portrait of john above her mantelpiece together with a letter from him which read nanny i love you in recent years prince john s seclusion has been brought forward as evidence of heartlessness of windsor family according to a 2008 channel 4 documentary much of existing information about john is based on hearsay and rumour precisely because so few details of his life and his problems have ever been disclosed and british epileptic association has stated there was nothing unusual in what king and queen did at that time people with epilepsy were put apart from rest of community they were often put in epilepsy colonies or mental institutions it was thought to be a form of mental illness adding that it was another twenty years before idea that epileptics should not be locked away began to take hold royal family believed that these afflictions flowed through their blood which was believed to be purer than blood of a commoner and as such wished to hide as much as possible in regard to john s illness others have suggested that john was sent to wood farm to give him best environment possible under austere conditions of world war i undoubtedly royal family were frightened and ashamed of john s illness and his life is usually portrayed either as tragedy or conspiracy at time that edward viii formerly prince edward abdicated an attempt was made to discredit prince albert who had succeeded as george vi by suggesting that he was subject to falling fits like his brother in 1998 after discovery of two volumes of family photographs john was briefly brought to public attention in popular culture lost prince a biographical drama about john s life written and directed by stephen poliakoff was released
