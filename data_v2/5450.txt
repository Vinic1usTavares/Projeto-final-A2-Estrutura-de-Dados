campaigns against english and forces of ottoman empire he became infamous in medieval france for fighting in last judicial duel permitted by french king and parlement of paris combat was decreed in 1386 to contest charges of rape carrouges had brought against his neighbour and erstwhile friend jacques le gris on behalf of his wife marguerite it was attended by much of highest french nobility of time led by king charles vi and his family including a number of royal dukes it was also attended by thousands of ordinary parisians and in ensuing decades was chronicled by such notable medieval historians as jean froissart jean juvenal des ursins and jean de waurin described in chronicles as a rash and temperamental man carrouges was also a fierce and brave warrior whose death in battle came after a forty year military career in which he served in normandy scotland and hungary with distinction and success he was also heavily involved in court politics initially at seat of his overlord count pierre of alencon at argentan but later in politics of royal household at paris to which he was attached as a chevalier d honneur and royal bodyguard in years following judicial duel during his life he conducted a long trail of legal and financial dealings which infuriated his contemporaries and may have invited violence against himself and his family truth of events which led him into public mortal combat in paris suburbs may never be known but legend is still debated and discussed 600 years later early life carrouges was born in late 1330s in village of saint marguerite de carrouges as eldest son of knight and minor noble sir jean de carrouges iii and his wife nicole de typically for period jean de carrouges name is subject to an array of spellings froissart calls him jean de sometimes anglicised in translation to john while encyclopaedia britannica calls him jean carrouge other sources including chronique du religieux de saint denys use jean de carrouges as does jager whose wide range of research indicates this to be correct spelling carrouges iii was an influential man in lower normandy being a vassal of count of perche and a veteran soldier in his service jager p 11 carrouges iii had been rewarded for his long military service in hundred years war with a knighthood and title of viscount of belleme a rank that came with command of a vital hill castle overlooking town as well as role of sheriff in vicinity a post carrying significant financial and social rewards jager p 16 carrouges iv grew up within his father s domain centred around village of carrouges where family maintained their own hereditary castle jager p 14 he followed his father into armed service of counts of perche and served in several minor campaigns against english and in normandy following his majority at age 21 he was given a parcel of family lands to administer and became interested in solidifying and expanding family holdings in 1367 family castle and village of carrouges were destroyed by english soldiers and a new castle was built on a hilltop nearby under instructions from charles v of france in early 1370s carrouges iv married jeanne de tilly a daughter of lord of chambois whose dowry included lands and rents vital to carrouges ambition of expanding his family estates shortly after their wedding jeanne gave birth to a son whose godfather was a neighbour and close friend of de carrouges squire jacques le gris in 1377 pierre d alencon inherited his brother robert s county of perche and with it castle of belleme in addition he gained fealty of his brother s vassals including carrouges father and son as well as jacques le gris younger carrouges and le gris soon joined court circle of count centered around town of argentan it was at argentan that friendship between carrouges and le gris began to deteriorate as le gris rapidly became a favourite of count pierre while carrouges was overlooked le gris was rewarded for service to count inheriting his father s lordship of castle at and being granted a newly purchased estate at aunou le faucon carrouges became jealous of his friend and two men soon became rivals at court jager p 20 a year after entering count pierre s service tragedy struck carrouges as both his wife and son died of unknown but natural causes in response carrouges left home and joined service of jean de vienne accompanied by a retinue of nine squires jager p 22 with this force under overall command of king charles v carrouges distinguished himself in minor actions against english in beuzeville carentan and coutances in a five month campaign during which over half his retinue were killed in battle or by disease marguerite de thibouville returning home in 1380 after a successful campaign carrouges married marguerite de thibouville only daughter of highly controversial robert de thibouville thibouville was a norman lord who had twice sided against french king in territorial conflicts betrayals he was lucky to survive albeit in reduced circumstances by union of marguerite and carrouges thibouville hoped to restore his family s status and wealth while carrouges was hoping for an heir from young marguerite whom contemporaries described as young beautiful good sensible and modest jager pp 24 26 shortly after his marriage carrouges revealed another motive for union valuable estate of aunou le faucon given to his rival jacques le gris two years earlier had been formerly owned by carrouges father in law and had been bought by count pierre for 8 000 french livres in 1377 carrouges immediately began a lawsuit to recover land based on an assumed prior claim to it case dragged on for some months until ultimately count pierre was forced to visit his cousin king charles vi to officially confirm his ownership of land and his right to give it to whomever of his followers he chose despite losing case lawsuit reflected very poorly on carrouges at court in argentan and resulted in his further estrangement from count pierre s circle jager p 31 jacques le gris and jean de carogne both of them of household of peter count d alencon and esteemed by him but more particularly jacques le gris whom he loved above all others and placed his whole confidence in him froissart s chronicles book iii chapter 46 life and death duel between james le gris and john de carogne froissart s chronicles book iii chapter years after aunou le faucon lawsuit carrouges was once again in court facing count pierre this time in dispute over lands administered by his recently deceased father carrouges iii s death early in 1382 vacated captaincy of castle of belleme a post carrouges iv believed would be his by right however due to failed lawsuit two years earlier count pierre passed carrouges over for captaincy and gave it to another of his followers infuriated carrouges again brought legal action against his overlord and again he was defeated in court only lasting result of action was further separation of carrouges and count pierre s court jager p 33 in march 1383 carrouges made a third effort to expand his family holdings with purchase of neighbouring fiefs of and plainville from his neighbour sir jean de sale required approval from count pierre who was overlord of both fiefs but as consequence of previous legal difficulties carrouges had caused him pierre refused to permit sale and insisted that carrouges turn properties over to him in exchange for a full refund of original price paid carrouges had no choice but to comply and subsequently blamed jacques le gris influence for this new misfortune jager p 35 campaigning in scotland thumb 250px medieval tapestry depicting border warfare between england and scotland late in 1384 carrouges entered society for first time since his marriage four years earlier attending a party to celebrate birth of a neighbour s son carrouges and le gris met at celebration and agreed to end their quarrel carrouges introducing le gris to his wife marguerite for first time jager p 37 a few months after this meeting in march 1385 carrouges attempted to increase his family wealth through military means by joining army of jean de vienne for an expedition sailing to edinburgh this force of about 3 000 soldiers was intended to unite with scottish army and raid northern england distracting english forces from operations in france traveling with men at arms horses gold and equipment carrouges and his entourage rode to sluys and took ship to leith during spring of 1385 on arrival in scotland much time was spent gathering scottish troops together for campaign on england and french were delayed for some months collecting supplies french receive bad treatment from their allies scots froissart s chronicles book ii chapter 160 army thus did not move south until july ravaging villages and farms in region of river tweed before besieging wark castle and burning it to ground allied army then continued south through northumberland and there burnt villages towns farms and castles across their line of advance in a large chevauchee scots and english each invade other country froissart s chronicles book ii chapters 171 173 english responded with an army led by king richard ii which advanced against allied force and offered battle french prepared to fight but their scots allies retreated leaving french exposed and they were consequently forced to retreat as well jager p 47 outside edinburgh scottish army dispersed and inhabitants of city fled north leaving french alone in city realising that his force was outnumbered and without food or help vienne took army south rounding english on night of 10 august and reentering northumberland for further looting attacking carlisle but being unable to break through its walls jager p 48 as franco scottish army returned northwards it was attacked by an army under henry percy which destroyed army s wagon train and took many prisoners when defeated french returned to edinburgh scots refused to provision french army and many men died of disease or starvation late in year french army boarded ship and returned to flanders bankrupt and defeated despite expedition s failure carrouges had distinguished himself in campaign although he had lost five of his nine men at arms and a substantial amount of money he had also been awarded a knighthood on battlefield substantially raising his social status and amount of money he received from military service jager p 50 despite being in poor health on his return from scotland carrouges had business in paris and in january 1386 he traveled there to collect his wages for previous year s campaign leaving his wife with her mother in law at village of capomesnil rape of marguerite jacques who was a strong man held her tight in his arms and flung her down on floor and had his will of her immediately afterward he opened door of dungeon and made himself ready to depart lady exasperated with rage at what had passed remained silent in tears but on his departure she said to him jacques jacques you have not done well in thus deflowering me blame however shall not be mine but whole be laid on you if it please god my husband ever return froissart s chronicles book iii chapter 46 before setting off for paris carrouges first visited argentan to meet with count pierre and there announcing his intention of continuing to capital what followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect on lives of all concerned what is certain is that carrouges encountered his rival jacques le gris at court of count pierre and words were exchanged although what was said is unknown jager p 60 in contrast to his bankrupt rival le gris had not been on scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in carrouges absence le gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser a reputation that may have played a part in allegations which followed on morning of 18 january 1386 dame nicole de carrouges departed her chateau at capomesnil for neighbouring town of saint pierre sur dives where she had legal business to attend to although journey was only a short one she apparently took some or all of household servants with her leaving her daughter in law unattended during day jager p 62 marguerite s testimony then alleged that a man at arms named adam louvel knocked on chateau door which marguerite opened herself in absence of servants according to marguerite louvel then made enquiries about a loan he owed jean de carrouges before suddenly announcing that jacques le gris was outside door and insisted on seeing her at her refusal louvel exclaimed that he loves you passionately he will do anything for you and he greatly desires to see you jager p 63 although marguerite protested le gris then forced his way into house and propositioned her offering money if she would remain silent of their affair when marguerite refused le gris then violently raped her with aid of louvel and threatened her not to tell anyone what had occurred on pain of death jager p 69 marguerite remained silent of her ordeal for several days until her husband s return on 21 or 22 january upon hearing of encounter outraged carrouges summoned his circle of courtiers and friends including his mother and most of marguerite s family and a council was convened where marguerite repeated her account of rape jager p 75 carrouges decided immediately to begin legal proceedings against le gris but faced great difficulties in prosecuting them as le gris was a favourite of count pierre who would act as judge in case in addition case was weak because only witness was marguerite indeed trial at argentan was so one sided an affair that carrouges and his wife did not even bother to attend pierre acquitted le gris of all charges and furthermore accused marguerite of inventing or even dreaming attack jager p 79 legal proceedings right thumb 250px palais de justice paris in search of a fair trial carrouges traveled to paris to appeal to king himself knowing that his case depended solely on his wife s testimony and was therefore weak carrouges developed a plan instead of proceeding with a normal criminal trial carrouges would challenge le gris to a judicial duel survivor of which would thus have been deemed by god to have been rightful claimant last duel eric jager retrieved on 26 july 2007 such trials by combat once common in france were rare by 1386 and chance of one being permitted by king unlikely nevertheless carrouges saw this scheme as his best option of procuring justice and redeeming his wife s reputation jager p 83 a few days after his arrival in paris carrouges was presented to king at chateau de vincennes in order to make first official appeal in lengthy trial process in doing so he captured imagination of french court which later become so fascinated with carrouges le gris trial that it would shape its schedule around watching culminating combat on 9 july 1386 second stage in legal process began when both carrouges and le gris with their followers presented themselves before parlement of paris at palais de justice to issue formal challenge this involved reciting their accusations and throwing down a gauntlet signifying their intention to fight declarations were pronounced in front of king his brother louis of valois and entire parlement who decided to initially hear case as an ordinary criminal one and defer their decision on whether to permit judicial duel until both sides had given testimony jager p 103 attempts had been made to persuade le gris to insist on a church trial but these proved unsuccessful as le gris wished to counter accusation with a lawsuit against his opponent claiming 40 000 livres for defamation le gris was a cleric in minor orders and thus was permitted to demand a trial through roman catholic church which did not condone trial by combat following declarations a number of high ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in duel for both men including waleran of saint pol for carrouges and philip of artois count of eu for le gris jager p 104 criminal trial continued for most of summer and carrouges le gris and marguerite were all called on to give evidence marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on case jager p 117 adam louvel and at least one of marguerite s maidservants also gave evidence and as was custom of day for people of low birth they were tortured to test veracity of their testimony jager p 119 during this process neither produced evidence incriminating le gris although louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by marguerite s cousin du bois louvel du bois duel was eventually denied by court as part of same verdict in which carrouges le gris combat was approved in his evidence carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife s testimony while le gris accused carrouges of inventing charges and beating his wife into making accusations against squire in his statement le gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival le gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during entire week crime was supposed to have been committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden twenty five miles which supposedly separated him from marguerite on morning in question jager p 110 a rebuttal from carrouges emphasised shame trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if le gris s alibi was true jager p 113 le gris alibi was compromised some days later when man providing it a squire named jean was arrested for committing rape in paris even as trial progressed on 15 september with king in flanders preparing for an invasion of england parlement handed down its verdict as they had been unable to determine guilt in case two men would fight a duel to death on 27 november 1386 trial by combat two months following verdict were ones of great activity between two parties and citizens of paris as judicial duels were now so rare no established battleground had been set aside and a jousting arena at abbey of saint martin des champs north of city agreed to host combat jager p 132 both carrouges and le gris endured bouts of illness in weeks following verdict but recovered with aid of their families and supporters who had joined hundreds of people flocking to city from nearby regions to witness fight jager p 149 indeed event was so popular that when king charles vi believed that his return to paris in time for combat would be held up in flanders due to bad roads he sent a fast messenger to paris delaying duel by a month in order that he would be present to witness it this royal intervention set date for combat back to 29 december 1386 jager p 121 in months between trial and duel marguerite and french queen isabeau of bavaria had both given birth to sons while marguerite s son robert was a strong healthy boy dauphin was a sickly child and died on 28 december rather than descend into mourning king ordered a frenzy of parties and celebrations pinnacle of which was intended to be duel between carrouges and le gris jager p 141 morning of combat saw thousands of parisians arriving at abbey at dawn long before appointed hour amongst spectators were king and his entourage including his uncles john duke of berry philip bold and louis ii duke of bourbon as well as his brother duke of orleans also present dressed in black and sitting in a carriage overlooking field was marguerite should her husband lose battle she would be burnt at stake in montfaucon immediately following duel having been thus proven guilty of perjury by its outcome combatants took field in early afternoon mounted and dressed in plate armour both carried a lance longsword a heavy battle axe known as holy trinity and a long dagger called misericordia carrouges appeared first reciting his charges against le gris to king and crowd before le gris followed and did same le gris was then knighted in order that he and carrouges be of equal standing during fight both knights then dismounted and gave oaths to god virgin mary and st george thereby sanctifying god s judgment over duel s outcome finally carrouges approached his wife and pledged his honour before her kissing her and promising to return jager p 151 as field was cleared silence descended on arena following king s instructions that anybody who interfered in duel would be executed and that anyone who shouted or verbally interrupted combat would lose a hand jager p 157 readying their steeds knights squared up and at marshal s signal charged towards one another their lances struck but failed to penetrate thick hides covering their shields and combatants wheeled and charged again this time striking one another on their helms rounding once more knights charged a third time again striking shields and this time both shattering their lances reeling from impact warriors drew their axes and charged a fourth time slashing and kicking at one another in centre of field they traded blows until le gris much stronger man was able to drive his axe through neck of carrouges horse as beheaded beast tumbled to ground carrouges jumped clear and lashed out with his own weapon disemboweling le gris steed in turn jager p 173 two champions were then advanced and placed opposite to each other when they mounted their horses and made a handsome appearance for they were both expert men at arms they ran their first course without hurt to either after tilting they dismounted and made ready to continue fight they behaved with courage but sir john de carogne was at first onset wounded in thigh which alarmed all his friends notwithstanding this he fought so desperately that he struck down his adversary and thrusting his sword through body caused instant death when he demanded of spectators if he had done his duty they replied that he had froissart s chronicles book iii chapter 46 now on foot knights drew swords and returned to battle le gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining upper hand after several minutes of engagement carrouges slipped and le gris was able to stab his rival through right thigh as crowd gasped and murmured le gris stepped back to view his opponent s injury and carrouges desperately counter attacked wrestling le gris to ground le gris heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent his blows denting but not puncturing thick plate steel realising that his sword was inadequate carrouges straddled le gris and used handle of his dagger to smash lock holding le gris faceplate in position even as his opponent struggled beneath him carrouges tore plate off and demanded that le gris admit his guilt le gris refused and cried out in name of god and on peril and damnation of my soul i am innocent infuriated carrouges drove his dagger through le gris neck killing him instantly standing over his vanquished opponent carrouges remained on field as crowd cheered him and pages rushed to bind his wound jager p 180 he then kneeled before king who presented him with a prize of a thousand francs in addition to a royal income of 200 francs a year only then did he greet his wife in an emotional scene before thousands of spectators jean and marguerite de carrouges then with crowd following in a great procession rode from abbey to cathedral of notre dame de paris to give thanks for victory a few weeks after duel parlement awarded carrouges a further six thousand livres in gold and a position within royal household such rewards enabled carrouge to begin further legal action attempting to exert his earlier claim to aunou le faucon however this land which carrouges so coveted remained beyond his reach count pierre who held land never forgave carrouges death of his favourite and held estates from him in court jager p 187 royal service over next three years jean and marguerite de carrouges had two more children and settled in paris and normandy profiting from their celebrity with gifts and investments jager p 186 in 1390 carrouges was promoted to a chevalier d honneur as a bodyguard of king a title which came with a substantial financial stipend and was a position of important social standing following year he was dispatched to hungary on a mission to investigate severity of threat from ottoman empire boundaries of which had been steadily spreading under sultan bayezid i in this mission he was second in command to jean de a marshal of france and famous soldier indicating elevated social position carrouges enjoyed following duel jager p 188 in 1392 however carrouges was present for one of more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century france first descent into madness of king charles vi as a chevalier d honneur carrouges accompanied king on campaign and thus was present when royal army entered brittany to hunt for pierre de craon a noble who had fled paris following a failed attempt to murder olivier de clisson constable of france as army passed le mans on 8 august 1392 a loud noise within his entourage startled french king who believing himself to be under attack lashed out at nearest person to him man happened to be his brother louis of valois who turned and fled from his brother s sword killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper king set off on full pursuit of louis leaving army strung out across countryside behind him pursuit continued for hours until exhausted king was eventually subdued by his bodyguard including jean de carrouges jager p 189 crusade of nicopolis thumb right 250px battle of nicopolis in early 1396 following peace treaty with england french army mobilised against another pressing threat that of turks to east as part of a new crusade as a leader of original party to investigate events in hungary it was natural that jean de carrouges would return with his followers in service of his old commander admiral jean de vienne jager p 193 army crossed central europe united with hungarians and marched south burning city of vidin and massacring inhabitants before following course of danube southeast cutting a swathe of destruction through ottoman territory on 12 september army arrived at city of nicopolis but were repulsed from its walls and settled into a siege two weeks later sultan bayezid arrived with a large army to south of town and took up a strong defensive position challenging crusaders to meet him crusader army moved to confront him on 24 september but poor discipline and fractured leadership between national factions resulted in a premature assault by french force against bluffs controlled by ottoman troops with allied army strung out bayezid marshaled his reserves and defeated crusaders in a furious engagement in which fell most of allied army billings p 198 thousands more were captured and executed after battle by victorious turkish troops exact fate of sir jean de carrouges in midst of this melee is unknown but it is probable that he fell close to his commander jean de vienne whose forces were trapped in a gully and decimated by turkish cavalry jager p 196 following his death his estates passed to his ten year old son robert and a mural of jean and marguerite de carrouges was painted in abbey of st etienne in caen to celebrate his memory since that time however both family and mural have faded into obscurity jager p 13 legacy mother of

account of duel between jean de carrouges and jacques le gris in chronicle of monk of st denis chronique du religieux de saint denys translated by steven retrieved on 25 july 2007 due to controversy and celebrity surrounding case judicial duel between carrouges and le gris was last ever permitted by french government and as such a well attended and infamous event it soon attracted near legendary status a fatal medieval triangle ucla college of letters and science retrieved on 25 july 2007 in france memory of duel far outlasted its participants primarily a result of it being recorded soon after by contemporary chronicler jean froissart over following century vivid and imaginative accounts were carried in chronicles of jean juvenal des ursins and grandes chroniques de france as well as by jehan de waurin and others many embellishing story with imaginative twists jager p 203 factual details of case are unusually well recorded for a medieval trial as records of parlement de paris have survived intact and jacques le gris lawyer jean le coq kept meticulous notes on case which still exist in addition to a clear view of proceedings these notes also contain le coq s own concerns about his client whose innocence le coq deemed highly suspect jager p 122 despite these records event entered many historical texts as an example of a great miscarriage of justice which therefore brought tradition of trial by combat to an end several chronicles including chronique du religieux de saint denys and chronicles of jean juvenal des ursins tell of a deathbed confession to rape by another man this story which is without basis in fact was subsequently repeated in many later sources most notably encyclopaedia britannica which for many years contained a version of tale under entry for duel this information was eventually removed in an edition printed in 1970s jager p 207 other sources have discussed story in varying degrees of detail including a section in diderot s encyclopedie in histoire du parlement de paris by voltaire and in a number of books written in nineteenth century including a work in 1880s by a descendant of jacques le gris in which author attempted to prove his
