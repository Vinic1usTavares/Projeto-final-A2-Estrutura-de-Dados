typhoon soudelor known in philippines as typhoon egay was a powerful typhoon that underwent rapid deepening east of taiwan in 2003 pacific typhoon season it was sixth named storm by japan meteorological agency jma of season as well as third typhoon it formed on june 12 from a disturbance in monsoon trough located east of philippines system moved generally to northwest after its genesis gradually intensifying into a tropical storm while offshore philippines soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless storm caused 2 46 million in damage and 12 deaths after affecting philippines soudelor moved into an area of low wind shear and with favorable outflow it became a typhoon on june 17 and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying storm struck japanese island of iriomote jima where wind gusts reached 204 km h 127 mph it also affected taiwan where floods covered highways and caused mudslides early on june 18 soudelor reached peak 10 minute sustained winds of 150 km h 90 mph subsequently an increase in shear and passage of a trough weakened typhoon and caused it to turn to northeast soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on june 19 and subsequently it passed between japan and south korea it became an extratropical cyclone that day dissipating on june 24 in japan storm caused widespread power outages although damage was minimal and there were 21 injuries in south korea there was 12 1 million in damage and two deaths meteorological history origins of soudelor were from a tropical disturbance that persisted a short distance northwest of pohnpei on june 7 by two days later it had a large area of convection and it moved generally westward late on june 9 joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa although system initially failed to develop due to wind shear in region thunderstorms decreased over increasingly exposed circulation on june 11 shear decreased and convection became better organized jtwc initiated warnings on tropical depression 07w late that day and at 0000 utc on june 12 japan meteorological agency jma also remarked that a tropical depression had formed to northeast of palau after forming depression tracked generally westward due to a subtropical ridge to north around that time it was still located within monsoon trough and it interacted with another circulation to its east southeast causing a motion to west northwest as it moved away from other circulation depression was able to intensify and wind shear decreased on june 13 jma upgraded depression to tropical storm soudelor to east of samar island in philippines that day philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa initiated advisories and gave it local name egay upon becoming a tropical storm soudelor developed rainbands to north and south although it could not intensify significantly due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough to east a mid latitude trough to north weakened ridge which allowed soudelor to turn more to northwest off northeast coast of philippines circulation became exposed from deepest convection and around that time storm was located about 160 km 100 mi east of samar island thunderstorms gradually increased and outflow improved late on june 16 jtwc upgraded soudelor to a typhoon and next day jma followed suit when storm was located southeast of taiwan around time that soudelor became a typhoon it began moving toward north influenced by an approaching trough and it passed about 95 km 60 mi northeast of luzon a ragged eye developed early on june 17 which quickly became better organized with its outflow enhanced by approaching trough soudelor rapidly intensified to east of taiwan typhoon struck japanese island of iriomote jima at around 2030 utc on june 17 at 0600 utc on june 18 jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km h 135 mph at same time jma estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km h 90 mph when it was located west of okinawa while at its maximum strength soudelor had a circular eye 33 km 21 mi in diameter it turned to north northeast maintaining its peak winds for about 12 hours before increased shear from westerlies caused weakening eye quickly dissipated and system began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone early on june 19 jma downgraded soudelor below typhoon status and storm later crossed tsushima island into sea of japan at 1500 utc that day jma declared storm as extratropical while it was near oki islands jtwc followed suit three hours later extratropical remnants of soudelor continued to northeast crossing northern japan on june 20 storm slowed and turned to east dissipating on june 24 preparations thumb right tropical storm soudelor near south korea and japan on june 19
