aerojet rocketdyne rs 25 also known as space shuttle main engine ssme is a liquid fuel cryogenic rocket engine that was used on nasa s space shuttle nasa is planning to continue using rs 25 on space shuttle s successor space launch system sls designed and manufactured in united states by rocketdyne later known as pratt whitney rocketdyne and aerojet rocketdyne rs 25 burns cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants with each engine producing of thrust at liftoff although rs 25 can trace its heritage back to 1960s concerted development of engine began in 1970s with first flight sts 1 occurring on april 12 1981 rs 25 has undergone several upgrades over its operational history to improve engine s reliability safety and maintenance load engine produces a specific impulse isp of in a vacuum or at sea level has a mass of approximately and is capable of throttling between 67 and 109 of its rated power level in one percent increments components of rs 25 operate at temperatures ranging from to 3300 degc 6000 degf space shuttle used a cluster of three rs 25 engines mounted in stern structure of orbiter with fuel being drawn from external tank engines were used for propulsion during entirety of spacecraft s ascent with additional thrust being provided by two solid rocket boosters and orbiter s two orbital maneuvering system engines following each flight rs 25 engines were removed from orbiter inspected and refurbished before being reused on another mission components rs 25 engine consists of various pumps valves and other components which work in concert to produce thrust fuel liquid hydrogen and oxidizer liquid oxygen from space shuttle s external tank entered orbiter at umbilical disconnect valves and from there flowed through orbiter s main propulsion system mps feed lines whereas in space launch system sls fuel and oxidizer from rocket s core stage will flow directly into mps lines once in mps lines fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine three on space shuttle four on sls in each branch then allow propellants to enter engine once in engine propellants flow through low pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps lpftp and lpotp and from there into high pressure turbopumps hpftp and hpotp from these propellants take different routes through engine oxidizer is split into four separate paths to oxidizer heat exchanger which then splits into oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems to low pressure oxidizer turbopump lpotp to high pressure oxidizer preburner from which it is split into hpftp turbine and hpotp before being reunited in hot gas manifold and sent on to main combustion chamber mcc or directly into main combustion chamber mcc injectors meanwhile fuel flows through main fuel valve into regenerative cooling systems for nozzle and mcc or through chamber coolant valve fuel passing through mcc cooling system then passes back through lpftp turbine before being routed either to fuel tank pressurization system or to hot gas manifold cooling system from where it passes into mcc fuel in nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre burners into hpftp turbine and hpotp before being reunited again in hot gas manifold from where it passes into mcc injectors once in injectors propellants are mixed and injected into main combustion chamber where they are ignited burning propellant mixture is then ejected through throat and bell of engine s nozzle pressure of which creates thrust turbopumps oxidizer system low pressure oxidizer turbopump lpotp is an axial flow pump which operates at approximately 5 150 rpm driven by a six stage turbine powered by high pressure liquid oxygen from high pressure oxidizer turbopump hpotp it boosts liquid oxygen s pressure from with flow from lpotp then being supplied to hpotp during engine operation pressure boost permits high pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating lpotp which measures approximately is connected to vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on launch vehicle s structure hpotp consists of two single stage centrifugal pumps a main pump and a preburner pump mounted on a common shaft and driven by a two stage hot gas turbine main pump boosts liquid oxygen s pressure from while operating at approximately 28 120 rpm giving a power output of hpotp discharge flow splits into several paths one of which drives lpotp turbine another path is to and through main oxidizer valve and enters main combustion chamber another small flow path is tapped off and sent to oxidizer heat exchanger liquid oxygen flows through an anti flood valve that prevents it from entering heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present for heat exchanger to utilize heat contained in gases discharged from hpotp turbine converting liquid oxygen to gas gas is sent to a manifold and then routed to pressurize liquid oxygen tank another path enters hpotp second stage preburner pump to boost liquid oxygen s pressure from 30 to 51 mpa 4 300 psia to 7 400 psia it passes through oxidizer preburner oxidizer valve into oxidizer preburner and through fuel preburner oxidizer valve into fuel preburner hpotp measures approximately it is attached by flanges to hot gas manifold hpotp turbine and hpotp pumps are mounted on a common shaft mixing of fuel rich hot gases in turbine section and liquid oxygen in main pump can create a hazard and to prevent this two sections are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by engine s helium supply during engine operation two seals minimize leakage into cavity one seal is located between turbine section and cavity while other is between pump section and cavity loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown fuel system low pressure fuel turbopump lpftp is an axial flow pump driven by a two stage turbine powered by gaseous hydrogen it boosts pressure of liquid hydrogen from 30 to 276 psia 0 2 to 1 9 mpa and supplies it to high pressure fuel turbopump hpftp during engine operation pressure boost provided by lpftp permits hpftp to operate at high speeds without cavitating lpftp operates at around 16 185 rpm and is approximately in size it is connected to vehicle propellant ducting and is supported in a fixed position by being mounted to launch vehicle s structure hpftp is a three stage centrifugal pump driven by a two stage hot gas turbine it boosts pressure of liquid hydrogen from 1 9 to 45 mpa 276 to 6 515 psia and operates at approximately 35 360 rpm with a power of 71 140 hp discharge flow from turbopump is routed to and through main valve and is then split into three flow paths one path is through jacket of main combustion chamber where hydrogen is used to cool chamber walls it is then routed from main combustion chamber to lpftp where it is used to drive lpftp turbine a small portion of flow from lpftp is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization remaining hydrogen passes between inner and outer walls of hot gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into main combustion chamber a second hydrogen flow path from main fuel valve is through engine nozzle to cool nozzle it then joins third flow path from chamber coolant valve this combined flow is then directed to fuel and oxidizer preburners hpftp is approximately in size and is attached to hot gas manifold by flanges powerhead

combination chamber located in center of injector of each preburner two dual redundant spark are activated by engine controller and are used during engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner they are turned off after approximately three seconds because combustion process is then self sustaining preburners produce fuel rich hot gases that pass through turbines to generate power needed to operate high pressure turbopumps oxidizer preburner s outflow drives a turbine that is connected to hpotp and to oxidizer preburner pump fuel preburner s outflow drives a turbine that is connected to hpftp speed of hpotp and hpftp turbines depends on position of corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves these valves are positioned by engine controller which uses them to throttle flow of liquid oxygen to preburners and thus control engine thrust oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease liquid oxygen flow thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure hpotp and hpftp turbine speed and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into main combustion chamber which increases or decreases engine thrust oxidizer and fuel preburner

zirconium alloy called narloy z developed specifically for rs 25 in 1970s around 390 channels are machined into liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through liner to provide mcc cooling as temperature in combustion chamber reaches 3300 degc 6000 degf during flight higher than boiling point of iron an alternative for construction of rs 25 engines to be used in sls missions is use of advanced structural ceramics such as thermal barrier coatings tbcs and ceramic matrix composites cmcs these materials possess significantly lower thermal conductivities than metallic alloys thus allowing more efficient combustion and reducing cooling requirements tbcs are thin ceramic oxide layers deposited on metallic components acting as a thermal barrier between hot gaseous combustion products and metallic shell a tbc applied to inconel 718 shell during production could extend engine lifetime and reduce cooling cost further cmcs have been studied as a replacement for ni based superalloys and are composed of high strength fibers bn c continuously dispersed in a sic matrix a mcc composed of a cmc though less studied and farther from fruition than application of a tbc could offer

combustion chamber referred to as a de laval nozzle rs 25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio about 77 5 1 for chamber pressure at sea level a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of jet from nozzle which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage vehicle however to aid engine s operation rocketdyne engineers varied angle of nozzle walls

wires and pieces of hardware and some warning stickers are attached to casing each engine is equipped with a main engine controller mec an integrated computer which controls all of engine s functions through use of valves and monitors its performance built by honeywell aerospace each mec originally comprised two redundant honeywell 601 computers later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant motorola 68000 m68000 processors for a total of four m68000s per controller having controller installed on engine itself greatly simplifies wiring between engine and launch vehicle because all sensors and actuators are connected directly to only controller each mec then being connected to orbiter s general purpose computers gpcs or sls s avionics suite via its own engine interface unit eiu using a dedicated system also simplifies software and thus improves its reliability two independent dual cpu computers a and b form controller giving redundancy to system failure of controller system a automatically leads to a switch over to controller system b without impeding operational capabilities subsequent failure of controller system b would provide a graceful shutdown of engine within each system a and b two m68000s operate in lock step thereby enabling each system to detect failures by comparing signal levels on buses of two m68000 processors within that system if differences are encountered between two buses then an interrupt is generated and control turned over to other system because of subtle differences between m68000s from motorola and second source manufacturer trw each system uses m68000s from same manufacturer for instance system a would have two motorola cpus while system b would have two cpus manufactured by trw memory for block i controllers was of plated wire type which functions in a manner similar to magnetic core memory and retains data even after power is turned off block ii controllers used conventional cmos static ram controllers were designed to be tough enough to survive forces of launch and proved to be extremely resilient to damage during investigation of challenger accident two from engines 2020 and 2021 recovered from seafloor were delivered to honeywell aerospace for examination and analysis one controller was broken open on one side and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life both

emergency valves can be fully closed by using engine s helium supply system as a backup actuation system in space shuttle main oxidizer and fuel bleed valves were used after shutdown to dump any

cooling for throttle settings between 65 and 100 its position ranged from 66 4 to 100 open for reduced cooling gimbal thumb rs 25 gimbal test each engine is installed with a gimbal bearing a universal ball and socket joint which is bolted to launch vehicle by its upper flange and to engine by its lower flange it represents thrust interface between engine and launch vehicle supporting of engine weight and withstanding over of thrust as well as providing a means to attach engine to launch vehicle gimbal bearing allows engine to be pivoted or around two axes of freedom with a range of 10 5deg

and low pressure fuel turbopumps were mounted 180deg apart on orbiter s aft fuselage thrust structure lines from low pressure turbopumps to high pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable low pressure turbopumps to remain stationary while rest of engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control and also to prevent damage to pumps when loads were applied to them liquid hydrogen line

consisting of ten storage tanks in addition to various regulators check valves distribution lines and control valves system is used in flight to purge engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns during entry on space shuttle any remaining helium was used to purge engines during reentry and for history development thumb

rocketdyne were conducting a series of studies on high pressure engines developed from successful j 2 engine used on s ii and s ivb upper stages of saturn v rocket during apollo program studies were conducted under a program to upgrade saturn v engines which produced a design for a upper stage engine known as hg 3 as funding levels for apollo wound down hg 3 was cancelled as well as upgraded f 1 engines already being tested it was design for hg 3 that would form basis for rs 25 meanwhile in 1967 us air force funded a study into advanced rocket propulsion systems for use during project isinglass with rocketdyne asked to investigate engines and pratt whitney p w to research more efficient conventional de laval nozzle type engines at conclusion of study p w put forward a proposal for a 250 000 lbf engine called xlr 129 which used a two position expanding nozzle to provide increased efficiency over a wide range of altitudes in january 1969 nasa awarded contracts to general dynamics lockheed mcdonnell douglas and north american rockwell to initiate early development of space shuttle as part of these phase a studies involved companies selected an upgraded version of xlr 129 developing as baseline engine for their designs this design can be found on many of planned shuttle versions right up to final decision however since nasa was interested in pushing state of art in every way they decided to select a much more advanced design in order to force an advancement of rocket engine technology they called for a new design based on a high pressure combustion chamber running around which increases performance of engine development began in 1970 when nasa released a request for proposal for phase b main engine concept studies requiring development of a throttleable staged combustion de laval type engine request was based on then current design of space shuttle which featured two reusable stages orbiter and a manned fly back booster and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles 12 booster engines with sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with vacuum thrust each rocketdyne p w and aerojet general were selected to receive funding although given p w s already advanced development demonstrating a working concept engine during year and aerojet general s prior experience in developing m 1 engine rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into design process to allow company to catch up to its competitors by time contract was awarded budgetary pressures meant that shuttle s design had changed to its final orbiter external tank and two boosters configuration and so engine was only required to power orbiter during ascent during year long phase b study period rocketdyne was able to make use of their experience developing hg 3 engine to design their ssme proposal producing a prototype by january 1971 engine made use of a new rocketdyne developed copper zirconium alloy called narloy z and was tested on february 12 1971 producing a chamber pressure of three participating companies submitted their engine development bids in april 1971 with rocketdyne being awarded contract on july 13 1971 although work did not begin on engine development until march 31 1972 due to a legal challenge from p w following awarding of contract a preliminary design review was carried out in september 1972 followed by a critical design review in september 1976 after which engine s design was set and construction of first set of flight capable engines began final review of all space shuttle s components including engines was conducted in 1979 design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of design including hpftp hpotp valves nozzle and fuel preburners individual engine component tests were followed by first test of a complete engine 0002 on march 16 1977 nasa specified that prior to shuttle s first flight engines must have undergone at least 65 000 seconds of testing a milestone that was reached on march 23 1980 with engine having undergone 110

facility prior to orbiter being transferred to vehicle assembly building if necessary engines could be changed on pad engines drawing propellant from space shuttle external tank et via orbiter s main propulsion system mps were ignited at t 6 6 seconds prior to liftoff with each ignition staggered by 120 ms which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of space shuttle solid rocket boosters which committed shuttle to launch at launch engines would be operating at 100 rpl throttling up to 104 5 immediately following liftoff engines would maintain this power level until around t 40 seconds where they would be throttled back to around 70 to reduce aerodynamic loads on shuttle stack as it passed through region of maximum dynamic pressure or max q level of throttle was initially set to 65 but following review of early flight performance this was increased to a minimum of 67 to reduce fatigue on mps throttle level was dynamically calculated based on initial launch performance generally being reduced to a level around 70 engines would then be throttled back up until around t 8 minutes at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67 to prevent stack exceeding 3 g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption engines were then shut down a procedure known as main engine cutoff meco at around t 8 5 minutes after each flight engines would be removed from orbiter and transferred to space shuttle main engine processing facility where they would be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight a total of 46 reusable rs 25 engines each costing around us 40 million were flown during space shuttle program with each new or overhauled engine entering flight inventory requiring

during space shuttle program sorted by engine version over course of space shuttle program rs 25 went through a series of upgrades including combustion chamber changes improved welds and turbopump

reducing number of welds block i improvements also included a new two duct powerhead rather than original design which featured three ducts connected to hpftp and two to hpotp which helped improve hot gas flow and an improved engine heat exchanger block ia rs 25b first flown on sts 73 block ia engine offered main injector improvements block iia rs 25c first flown on sts 89 block iia engine was an interim model used whilst certain components of block ii engine completed development changes included a new large throat main combustion chamber which had originally been recommended by rocketdyne in 1980 improved low pressure turbopumps and certification for 104 5 rpl to compensate for a reduction in specific impulse original plans called for engine to be certified to 106 for heavy international space station payloads but this was not required and would have reduced engine service life a slightly modified version first flew on sts 96 block ii rs 25d first flown on sts 104 block ii upgrade included all of block iia improvements plus a new high pressure fuel turbopump this model was ground tested to 111 fpl in event of a contingency abort and certified for 109 fpl for use during an intact abort engine throttle output most obvious effects of upgrades rs 25 received through space shuttle program were improvements in engine throttle whilst fmof engine had a maximum output of 100 rpl block ii engines could throttle as high as 109 or 111 in an emergency with usual flight performance being 104 5 these increases in throttle level made a significant difference to thrust produced by engine sea level vacuum 100 thrust 104 5 thrust 109 thrust specifying power levels over 100 may seem nonsensical but there was a logic behind it 100 level does not mean maximum physical power level attainable rather it was a specification decided on during engine development expected rated power level when later studies indicated engine could operate safely at levels above 100 these higher levels became standard maintaining original relationship of power level to physical thrust helped reduce confusion as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data or operational data from past or future missions can be easily compared if power level was increased and that new value was said to be 100 then all previous data and documentation would either require changing or cross checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100 power level on that date engine power level affects engine reliability with studies indicating probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104 5 which was why power levels above 104 5 were retained for contingency use only incidents thumb alt refer to caption this shuttle control panel is set to select

nasa to them all being given away or sold for us 400 000 800 000 each to various institutions such as museums and universities this policy followed changes to planned configurations of constellation program s ares v cargo launch vehicle and ares i crew launch vehicle rockets which had been planned to use rs 25 in their first and second stages respectively whilst these configurations had initially seemed worthwhile as they would use then current technology following shuttle s retirement in 2010 plan had several drawbacks engines would not be reusable as they would be permanently attached to discarded stages each engine would have to undergo a test firing prior to installation and launch with refurbishment required following test it would be expensive time consuming and weight intensive to convert ground started rs 25d to an air started version for ares i second stage following several design changes to ares i and ares v rockets rs 25 was to be replaced with a single j 2x engine for ares i second stage and six modified rs 68 engines which was based on both ssme and apollo era j 2 engine on ares v core stage this meant that rs 25 would be retired along with space shuttle fleet in
