hatches egg was born in 1940 day after new year s when he took a break from drawing in his park avenue apartment and went for a walk when he returned he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree morgan 1995 pp 96 97 this account was based on interviews with geisel who had told similar stories about book s creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957 story had changed with each telling but always involved fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree cohen 2004 pp 2 5 charles cohen on other hand found traces of horton hatches egg in early dr seuss works in an early installment of geisel s cartoon feature and which began in judge magazine in 1927 he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant a few weeks later he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a tree in a 1959 cartoon for life magazine he depicted a dachshund who sits on eggs for storks in 1961 he drew an illustration for judge that showed a walrus sitting in a tree trying to hatch eggs in a bird nest some of his earlier work also featured elephant bird hybrids which prefigured elephant bird that hatches at end of horton hatches egg cohen 2004 pp 6 11 in 1938 two years before horton hatches egg judge published perhaps most obvious precursor to horton matilda elephant with a mother complex a short story by geisel about an old maid elephant who sits on a chickadee egg until it hatches only to have newborn chickadee fly away from her in 1939 geisel created an advertisement for nbc featuring a sympathetic looking elephant lashed with ropes and contained in a cage made of sticks similar to horton s situation when hunters capture him in horton hatches egg cohen 2004 p 9 in early drafts elephant s name changed from to bosco to humphrey final choice horton was apparently after horton conrad one of geisel s classmates at dartmouth college bird s name changed from bessie to and finally mayzie in first draft elephant character volunteered to sit on eggs for bird who was very reluctant morgan 1995 pp 97 98 publication and reception horton hatches egg was published by random house in fall 1940 to immediate success morgan 1995 p 99 it received primarily positive notice from critics kirkus reviews called it sheer nonsense but good fun reviewer for new york times book review wrote a moral is a new thing to find in a dr seuss book but it doesn t much interfere with hilarity with which he juggles an elephant up a tree to an adult tale seems a little forced compared to his first grand yarns less inevitable in its nonsense but neither young nor old are going to quibble with fantastic comedy of his pictures book also found early success with book buyers and general public it sold 6 000 copies in its first year and 1 600 in its second minear 1999 p 9 frances chrystie juvenile buyer for fao

united methodist pastor compared horton to early christians to whom first epistle of peter was addressed like those early christians horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions but horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded as evidenced by elephant bird that hatches at end of book richard b freeman writing in 2011 about contemporaneous economic situation in united states called horton hatches egg a tale of investment freeman argued that economic growth requires long term investments as embodied by horton s sitting on egg and that trust is important in a well functioning economy as embodied by horton s repeated maxim i meant what i said and i said what i meant alison lurie in a 1990 article about dr seuss from a feminist perspective criticized horton hatches egg as a statement for fetal rights and for its negative treatment of mayzie lurie pointed out almost complete lack of strong female protagonists in dr seuss books and argued that mayzie who is obviously an antagonist and is depicted as lazy and irresponsible is most memorable female character in dr seuss s entire oeuvre geisel responded to lurie s criticism by way of his biographers near end of his life by remarking that most of his characters are animals noting if she can identify their sex i ll remember her in my will jill deans in a 2000 article used book in a discussion of adoption surrogacy and particularly embryo donation she noted that it is a classic tale of surrogacy and that it evokes intricacies of nature nurture debate she contends that book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers in form of horton but vilifies birth mothers in form of mayzie both deans and philip nel point to book s real life implications for geisel and his wife deans draws a connection between elephant bird in horton and a failed invention geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like nel meanwhile connected book to short story matilda elephant noting that geisels could not have children nel argued that matilda and by extension horton may have been manifestations of geisels longing for children nel 2004 p 113 115 adaptations
