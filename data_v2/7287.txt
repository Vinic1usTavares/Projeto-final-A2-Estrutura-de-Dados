hurricane debra was a destructive tropical cyclone that developed during 1959 atlantic hurricane season fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of season debra originated from interaction of a cold core low and a tropical wave on july 15 system was designated a tropical depression on july 23 when it was south of louisiana and meandered westward while it swiftly intensified into a tropical storm along gulf coast of united states a turn towards northwest became evident as it attained category 1 hurricane status on saffir simpson hurricane scale following day while it organized into a developed storm as hurricane curved northward at a slow forward speed strength was maintained as it approached coast of texas as a minimal hurricane it came ashore during evening of july 24 local time 0000 utc on july 25 between freeport and galveston texas it rapidly weakened into a tropical storm and later a depression as it moved inland and dissipated on july 28 while it turned northwestward remnant moisture later sparked upper level thunderstorms in late july and early august prior to debra s arrival in texas numerous hurricane warnings were issued and at least 8 600 individuals evacuated torrential rains were produced in southeastern texas which led to widespread flooding on highways sea vessels took brunt of storm with many having become stranded or damaged forms of transportation such as air rail and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down high winds from storm caused expansive damage to buildings windows signs and roofs hurricane resulted in 11 injuries but no deaths and approximately 90 cattle drowned damage in texas brazoria galveston and harris counties surmounted 6 685 million and total damage from storm reached 7 million in aftermath weather bureau was criticized for lack of warning bureau s chief stephen lichtblau maintained that it was fortunate that any warnings were issued and those that were had been delivered in a timely manner meteorological history debra s origins were from an area of convection over western bahamas and florida related to an upper tropospheric cold core low and a tropical wave on july 15 whilst under influence of a subtropical ridge or a belt of high pressure it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into gulf of mexico on july 20 a weak surface circulation was observed near 1900 est 0100 utc on july 21 which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward system s circulation remained indistinct until july 23 as winds of 22 30 knots consorted with squalls adjacent to coasts of louisiana and texas storm attained tropical characteristics near 0000 utc while situated south of louisiana and was subsequently designated a tropical depression ship communications off coast on july 24 relayed winds of 23 50 knots and a barometric pressure of 1007 5 mbar 29 75 inhg which indicated it was a tropical storm on saffir simpson hurricane scale radar imagery taken near cst 1333 utc from a dow chemical plant in freeport texas evidenced that debra was a full fledged category 1 hurricane on scale with a prominent spiral appearance that was not perceived by radar previous afternoon as result of a polar trough aloft in central united states debra curved northward though its winds shifted southward defying earlier prediction of a bend west northwest to northwest a reconnaissance flight determined location of its center during mid morning and hurricane made landfall near its peak intensity between freeport and galveston texas during evening of july 24 local time 0000 utc on july 25 it rapidly weakened on july 26 while it arched west northwest though it maintained tropical characteristics until its dissipation on july 28 over central oklahoma while system progressed north northwestward as it moved inland moisture along its eastern fringe converged with a front to its northeast causing heavy rains that were confined to limited areas in northeast louisiana and southern arkansas they eventually traversed east northeastward over northern mississippi tennessee and kentucky moisture and instability from debra led to high level thunderstorms in montana and northern idaho on july 31 and august 1 hurricane debra s development near coast was unusual complicating forecasting in addition to its rapid intensification and abnormal direction lack of ship reports and incorrect information received from those that were received further complicated debra s forecasts however due to its formation close to coast debra had inadequate time to cause a greater storm surge debra s floods accounted for most of month s rainfall preparations weather bureau in new orleans louisiana issued small craft warnings at 1230 utc on july 24 stretching from port o connor to high island texas while whole gale warnings were posted from port o connor to matagorda texas with regular gale warnings extending north to freeport texas at 1500 utc a hurricane warning was later declared for areas

texas which led to inundation low lying streets this total was highest attributed to debra a daily rainfall record of was achieved at beaumont and hurricane force winds stretched inland simultaneous occurrence of a storm surge and heavy rainfall wrought by debra led to widespread flooding on highways including that on highway 75 northwest of galveston on july 25 which caused detachment of

kentucky and ohio debra sparked high level thunderstorms in montana and northern idaho eventually leading to wildfires aftermath an editorial published in houston chronicle criticized lack of warnings prior to hurricane debra s arrival in texas alleging that with radar aircraft and communication systems weather bureau should have been able to give a warning well in advance of storm article remarked that bureau seemed almost as uninformed as ordinary citizen in regards to forecasting chief of weather bureau stephen lichtblau fired back saying that we were fortunate to get a warning he continued had weather bureau not had such equipment they are complaining about we could have released nothing and maintained that warnings were issued promptly when repairs in calhoun county texas were
