bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without use of ropes or harnesses while it can be done without any equipment most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls unlike free solo climbing which is also performed without ropes bouldering problems sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete climb are usually less than 6 meters 20 ft tall traverses which are a form of boulder problem require climber to climb horizontally from one end to another artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders in addition bouldering competitions take place in both indoor and outdoor settings see boulder a philosophy for bouldering stone country press by francis sanzaro for a more on bouldering movement and its relation to other sports i also found this article from sanzaro on bouldering philosophy and landscape called when earth enters you movement aesthetics sport originally was a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering so climbers could practice specific moves at a safe distance from ground additionally sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength throughout 20th century bouldering evolved into a separate discipline individual problems are assigned ratings based on difficulty although there have been various rating systems used throughout history of bouldering modern problems usually use either v scale or fontainebleau scale growing popularity of bouldering has caused several environmental concerns including soil erosion and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off trail to reach bouldering sites this has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether outdoor bouldering thumb bouldering in hueco tanks baby martini v6 thumb right largest outdoor bouldering gym in north america cliffs at dumbo is located in brooklyn bridge park https dumbo is cliffs at www timeout com newyork news largest outdoor climbing gym in country is returning to brooklyn bridge park characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on type of rock being climbed for example granite often features long cracks and slabs while sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks limestone and volcanic rock are also used for bouldering there are many prominent bouldering areas throughout united states including hueco tanks in texas mount evans in colorado and buttermilks in bishop california british columbia is one of most popular bouldering areas in canada europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites such as fontainebleau in france albarracin in spain and various mountains throughout switzerland africa s most prominent bouldering areas are more established rocklands in south africa and new kid on block in morocco or recently opened areas like in zimbabwe indoor bouldering alt an indoor bouldering gym thumb an indoor bouldering gym artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment usually at climbing gyms these walls are constructed with wooden panels polymer cement panels concrete shells or precast molds of actual rock walls holds usually made of plastic are then bolted onto wall to create problems walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces which force climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength however in more recent times many problems set on flat walls now require climber to execute a series of coordinated movements in order to complete route these routes were likely to have originated at gym in germany and style of climbing can be said to closely resemble sport of parkour ifsc climbing world championships have noticeably included more of such problems in their competitions as of late climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within same section of wall in us most common method routesetters use to designate intended problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold for example red tape would indicate one bouldering problem while green tape would be used to set a different problem in same area across much of rest of world problems and grades are usually designated using a set color of plastic hold to indicate problems and their difficulty levels using colored holds to set has certain advantages most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where holds for a problem are and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off footholds smaller resource poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large expensive holds can be used in multiple routes by marking them with more than one color of tape grading right thumb 150px a climber completing an indoor v3 problem bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by routesetters and climbers two most widely used rating systems are v scale and fontainebleau system v scale which originated in united states is an open ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty v1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts scale begins at v0 and as of 2013 highest v rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is some climbing gyms also use a vb grade to indicate beginner problems fontainebleau scale follows a similar system with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with letters a b and c for example fontainebleau 7a roughly corresponds with v6 while fontainebleau 7c is equivalent to v10 in both systems grades are further differentiated by appending to indicate a small increase in difficulty despite this level of specificity ratings of individual problems are often controversial as ability level is not only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber height arm length flexibility and other body characteristics can also be relevant highball bouldering highball bouldering is simply climbing high difficult long and tall boulders using same protection as standard bouldering climbers venture up house sized rocks that test not only their physical skill and strength but mental focus like most of climbing is open to interpretation most climbers say anything above 15 feet is a highball and can range in height up to 35 40 feet where highball bouldering then turns into free soloing highball bouldering may have begun in 1961 when john gill without top rope rehearsal a steep face on a 37 foot 11 meter granite spire called thimble thumb right 150px climber on thimble in difficulty level of this ascent v4 5 or 5 12a when considered a rock climb was extraordinary for that period climbing magazine millennium special march 2000 gill s achievement initiated a wave of climbers making ascents of large boulders later with introduction and evolution of crash pads climbers were able to push limits of highball bouldering ever higher in 2002 jason kehl completed first highball at double digit v difficulty called a 55 foot 18 meter boulder in buttermilks of california earning grade of v12 this climb marked beginning of a new generation of highball climbing that pushed not only height but great difficulty it is not unusual for climbers to rehearse such risky problems on top rope although this practice is not a settled issue groundbreaking ascents in this style include ambrosia a 55 foot 18 meter boulder in bishop california climbed by kevin in 2015 sporting grade of too big to flail v10 another 55 foot 18 meter line in bishop california climbed by alex in 2016 livin large a 35

daniel woods in 2015 line was worked with another climber dan beal but a hold broke after woods s top and climb has yet to see a second ascent competitions traditionally competition in bouldering was informal with climbers working out problems near limits of their abilities then challenging their peers to repeat these accomplishments however modern climbing gyms allow for a more formal competitive structure international federation of sport climbing ifsc employs an indoor format although competitions can also take place in an outdoor setting that breaks competition into three rounds qualifications semi finals and finals rounds feature different sets of four to six boulder problems and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem at end of each round competitors are ranked by number of completed problems with ties settled by total number of attempts taken to solve problems some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between in an open format competition all climbers compete simultaneously and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible more points are awarded for more difficult problems while points are deducted for multiple attempts on same problem right thumb 150px a competitor at 2012 boulder world cup in 2012 ifsc submitted a proposal to international olympic committee ioc to include lead climbing in 2020 summer olympics proposal was later revised to an overall competition which would feature bouldering lead climbing and speed climbing in may 2013 ioc announced that climbing would not be added to 2020 olympic program in 2016 international olympic committee ioc officially approved climbing as an olympic sport in order to

history rock climbing first appeared as a sport in late 1800s early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering not as a separate discipline but as a playful form of training for larger ascents it was during this time that words bouldering and problem first appeared in british climbing literature oscar eckenstein was an early proponent of activity in british isles origins of bouldering http www net in early 20th century fontainebleau area of france established itself as a prominent climbing area where some of first dedicated or boulderers emerged one of those athletes pierre allain invented specialized shoe used for rock climbing thumb 165px gill on scab in needles of black hills 1963 in late 1950s through 1960s american mathematician john gill pushed sport further and contributed several important innovations distinguishing bouldering as a separate discipline in process gill previously pursued gymnastics a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for movements and body positions and shifted focus of bouldering from reaching summit to navigating a set of holds gill developed a rating system that was closed ended b1 problems were as difficult as most challenging roped routes of time b2 problems were more difficult and b3 problems had been completed once gill introduced chalk as a method of keeping climber s hands dry promoted a dynamic climbing style and emphasized importance of strength training to complement skill for more on gill s bouldering philosophy see boulder a philosophy for bouldering stone country press by francis sanzaro stone country press 2013 as gill improved in ability and influence his ideas became norm in 1980s two important training tools emerged one important training tool was bouldering mats also referred to as crash pads which protected against injuries from falling and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous otherwise second important tool was indoor climbing walls which helped spread sport to areas without outdoor climbing and allowed serious climbers to train year round as sport grew in popularity new bouldering areas were developed throughout europe and united states and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions visibility of sport greatly increased in early 2000s as youtube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers

first female ascent by lynn hill 1998 thirty nine years after its solution it has been described as one of world s most famous bouldering problems together with dreamtime see above equipment unlike other climbing sports bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment an aspect which makes discipline highly appealing but opinions differ while bouldering pioneer john sherman asserted that only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders others suggest use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag a small pouch where ground up chalk is kept as bare minimum and more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of climbing shoes chalk brushes crash pads and a skincare kit right thumb 150px a modern climbing shoe manufactured by quechua climbing shoes have most direct impact on performance besides protecting climber s feet from rough surfaces climbing shoes are designed to help climber secure footholds climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear and often curl toes downwards to enable precise footwork they are manufactured in a variety of different styles to perform in different situations for example high top shoes provide better protection for ankle while low top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity front of shoe called toe box can be asymmetric which performs well on overhanging rocks or symmetric which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs to absorb sweat most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands stored in a chalkbag which can be tied around waist also called sport climbing chalkbags allowing climber to reapply chalk during climb there are also versions of floor chalkbags also called bouldering chalkbags which are usually bigger than sport climbing chalkbags and are meant to be kept on floor while climbing this is because boulders do not usually have so many movements as to require chalking up more than once different sizes of brushes are used to remove excess chalk and debris from boulders in between climbs they are often attached to end of a long straight object in order to reach higher holds crash pads also referred to as bouldering mats are foam cushions placed on ground to protect climbers from falls safety thumb 227x227px climber with crash pad and spotters for safety boulder problems are generally shorter than from ground to top this makes sport significantly safer than free solo climbing which is also performed without ropes but with no upper limit on height of climb however minor injuries are common in bouldering particularly sprained ankles and wrists two factors contribute to frequency of injuries in bouldering first boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines making falls more common second without ropes to arrest climber s descent every fall will cause climber to hit ground to prevent injuries boulderers position crash pads near boulder to provide a softer landing as well as one or more spotters people watching out for climber to fall in convenient position to help redirect climber towards pads upon landing boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics spreading impact across entire body to avoid bone fractures and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout impact technique although every type of rock climbing requires a high level of technique and strength bouldering most dynamic form of sport requires highest level of power and thus places considerable strain on body training routines that strengthen fingers and forearms are useful in preventing injuries such as tendonitis and ruptured ligaments however as with other forms of climbing bouldering technique begins with proper footwork leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles thus proficient boulderers use their arms to maintain balance and body positioning as much as possible relying on their legs to push them up rock boulderers also keep their arms straight with their shoulders engaged whenever feasible allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles bouldering movements are described as either static or dynamic static movements are those that are performed slowly with climber s position controlled by maintaining contact on boulder with other three limbs dynamic movements use climber s momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically with an increased risk of falling if movement is not performed accurately environmental impact bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks such as mosses and lichens this can occur as a result of climber intentionally cleaning boulder or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds vegetation on ground surrounding boulder can also be damaged from overuse particularly by climbers laying down crash pads soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails or when they unearth small rocks near boulder in an effort to make landing zone safer in case of a fall repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage rock surface of boulders and cliffs particularly sandstone and other porous rock types and scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade rock surface for avoiding chalk damaging surface of rock it is important to remove it gently with a brush after a rock climbing session other environmental concerns include littering improperly disposed feces and graffiti these issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering as was case in tea garden a popular bouldering area in rocklands south africa references
