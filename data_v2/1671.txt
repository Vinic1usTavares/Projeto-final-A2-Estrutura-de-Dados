banded houndshark triakis scyllium is a species of houndshark in family triakidae common in northwestern pacific ocean from southern russian far east to taiwan found on or near bottom it favors shallow coastal habitats with sandy or vegetated bottoms and also enters brackish water this shark reaches in length it has a short rounded snout and mostly narrow fins pectoral fins are broad and triangular and trailing margin of first dorsal fin is almost vertical it is gray above and lighter below younger sharks have darker saddles and dots which fade with age nocturnal and largely solitary banded houndshark preys on benthic invertebrates and bony fishes it is aplacental viviparous with developing embryos sustained by yolk after mating during summer females bear as many as 42 pups following a gestation period of 9 12 months banded houndshark poses no danger to humans and adapts well to captivity it is caught as bycatch off japan taiwan and likely elsewhere in its range it may be eaten but is not as well regarded as related species because fishing does not appear to have diminished this shark s population international union for conservation of nature has listed it under least concern taxonomy first scientific description of banded houndshark was authored by german biologists johannes peter muller and friedrich gustav jakob henle based on a dried specimen from japan in their 1838 41 systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen they gave it specific epithet scyllium derived from ancient greek dogfish and placed it in genus triakis within genus it is placed in subgenus triakis along with leopard shark t triakis semifasciata distribution and habitat native to northwestern pacific ocean banded houndshark occurs from southern russian far east to taiwan including japan korea and eastern china records from philippines are questionable this common benthic shark is found over continental and insular shelves mostly close to shore but also to a depth of it frequents sandy flats and beds of seaweed and eelgrass additionally it is tolerant of brackish water and enters estuaries and bays description thumb left markings of banded houndshark become indistinct with age banded houndshark is a moderately slender bodied species growing up to long snout is short broad and rounded widely separated nostrils are each preceded by a lobe of skin that does not reach mouth horizontally oval eyes are placed high on head they are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes protective third eyelids and have prominent ridges underneath mouth forms a short wide arch and bears long furrows at corners that extend onto both jaws each tooth has an upright to oblique knife like central cusp flanked by strong cusplets there are five pairs of gill slits most of fins are fairly narrow in adults pectoral fins are broad and roughly triangular moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about halfway between pectoral and pelvic fins and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near apex second dorsal fin is about three quarters as high as first and larger than anal fin caudal fin has a well developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near tip of upper lobe in young sharks lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct this species is gray above with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age underside is off white biology and ecology thumb spoon worms are an important food source for small banded houndsharks banded houndshark is nocturnal and generally solitary though several individuals may rest together sometimes piled atop one another inside a cave it feeds mainly on crustaceans including shrimp crabs hermit crabs and mantis shrimp cephalopods including octopus and spoon worms polychaete worms tunicates peanut worms and small bottom living bony fishes including flatfishes conger eels herring jacks drums and grunts are occasionally consumed shrimp and spoon worms are important prey for sharks up to long cephalopods predominate in diets of larger sharks mating occurs during summer and involves male swimming parallel to female and gripping her pectoral fin with his teeth thus secured he then twists distal portion of his body to insert a single clasper into her cloaca for copulation banded houndshark is aplacental viviparous in which developing embryos are sustained to birth by yolk females bear litters of 9 26 pups after a gestation period of 9 12 months though litters as large as 42 pups have been recorded newborns measure long males mature sexually at 5 6 years old when they are long and live up to 15 years females mature sexually at 6 7 years old when they are long and live up to 18 years known parasites of this species include tapeworms callitetrarhynchus gracilis and phyllobothrium leech and copepods punctatus kroyeria and pseudopandarus human interactions thumb live banded houndshark on display at a restaurant in china harmless to humans banded houndshark is commonly displayed in public aquariums in china and japan and has reproduced in captivity individuals have survived in captivity for over five years this species is often caught incidentally off japan in gillnets and set nets meat is sometimes sold but is considered to be of poorer quality than that of other houndsharks in region it is caught in lesser numbers off taiwan and is probably also fished off korea and northern china off japan it can be found in rocky areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure see also list of sharks references banded houndshark category fish of japan category
