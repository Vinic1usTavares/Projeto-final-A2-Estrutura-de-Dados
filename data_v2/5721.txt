thumb upright 1 1 alt illustration of a great auk a great auk which may be source for descriptions of boobrie boobrie is a mythological shapeshifting entity inhabiting lochs of west coast of scotland it commonly adopts appearance of a gigantic water bird resembling a cormorant or great northern diver but it can also materialise in form of various other mythological creatures such as a water bull a generally malevolent entity boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships but it is also fond of otters of which it consumes a considerable number in its manifestation as a water horse creature is able to gallop across top of lochs as if on solid ground during summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect sucking blood of horses folklorist campbell of islay has speculated that descriptions of boobrie may be based on sightings of great auk bellowing sound made by boobrie more like a bull than a bird may have its origin in strange call of common bittern which was a rare visitor to scotland etymology boobrie may derive from meaning cow giver or cow bestowing edward dwelly a scottish lexicographer lists tarbh boidhre as monster demon and god capable of changing himself into many forms tarbh aoidhre is given as a northern counties variation simpler component of tarbh as a single word is defined by dwelly as bull of tale have used several differing spellings of second component some even adopting inconsistent variations throughout their own renditions george henderson for instance a folklorist and celtic scholar used five alternatives bo eithre boidhre bo eithre and spelling variations employed by other writers include aoidhre boidhre and folk beliefs description and common attributes investigation into folklore especially celtic oral traditions began in 19th century and several bizarre and less familiar beasts were identified including boobrie it is a generally malevolent entity with ability to materialise in form of various mythical creatures it commonly preys on animals being transported on ships preferably calves but will also happily eat lambs and sheep carrying its prey away to deepest water before consuming it it is also extremely fond of otters which it consumes in large quantities in its favoured bird manifestation boobrie resembles a gigantic great northern diver or cormorant but with white markings according to folklorist campbell of islay a detailed account of its dimensions provided by an authoritative source claims that it is larger than seventeen of biggest eagles put together it has a strong black beak about wide and in length final of which taper like that of an eagle creature s neck is almost long with a girth of a little under short black powerful legs lead to webbed feet with gigantic claws an imprint of a boobrie s foot left in some lakeside mud equalled span of a large wide spreading pair of red deer s horns it bellows noisily with displeasure sounding more like a bull than a bird design of its wings is more conducive to swimming rather than for flight its evil powers when in form of a bird were said by campbell of islay to have terrified a minister out of his propriety boobrie s insatiable appetite for livestock posed a threat to local farmers as they relied on their animals as a means of providing income and food although sea lochs are natural home they will shelter on land in overgrown heather accounts are inconsistent as to extent of boobrie s habitat campbell of islay claims that it is specific to lochs of argyllshire as does emeritus professor of english james mackillop writers katharine briggs and patricia monaghan on other hand consider creature s range to be broader scottish highlands although briggs does sometimes specify argyllshire campbell of islay s undated manuscript notes boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to widespread burning of heather in area of its habitat alternative manifestations when manifested as a water horse creature is able to gallop across surface of lochs beating noise of creature s hooves on water is same as if it were galloping on solid ground henderson reproduced parts of campbell of islay s manuscripts when writing survivals in belief among celts 1911 among them is a story listed as boobrie as tarbh tale starts by detailing how a man named eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death at side of loch nan on west coast of argyll some months later phemie eachann s girlfriend is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on loch which make her think of murdoch her former paramour while she sat dreaming of eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near loch she sensed flicker of a shadow behind her except this time it was murdoch he promptly overpowered her by enveloping her in a blanket and tying her hands at that point a water bull came to phemie s rescue by knocking murdoch to ground bull then knelt down allowing phemie to get on its back before transporting her at speed of light back to home of her mother bull disappeared never to be seen again but a voice was heard in air calling out loudly verse heard was in gaelic and translates as it is then asserted that tale reveals persistence in folk belief of idea of transformation boobrie being abode of a spirit boobrie can also manifest itself in form of a large insect that sucks blood of horses henderson refers to it as a big striped brown or ear wig with lots of tentacles or feelers it was infrequently seen in this form usually only at height of summer during august and september capture and hunting a farmer and his son were ploughing a field on isle of mull using a team of four horses beside loch but work stalled after one of horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement once harnessed to wooden plough horse appeared to be familiar with task and initially worked steadily as it began to work towards an area closest to loch it became restless and farmer gently used a whip to encourage animal to continue it reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie giving out a loud bellow and diving into loch pulling plough and other three horses with it frightened farmer and his son watched as creature swam to centre of loch then dived underwater taking other horses and plough with it seven hours later there was still no sign of three horses in a story transcribed by john campbell of a hunter attempted to shoot a boobrie after he spotted it in its bird like manifestation on a sea loch one chilly february day man paddled into loch until water was up to his shoulders but when he was about from creature it dived under water hunter maintained his position for forty five minutes before returning to shore where he remained for a further six hours waiting unsuccessfully for boobrie to resurface no clear indication is given of loch s whereabouts origins campbell of islay speculates that boobrie may have originated from sightings of great auk he noted he had been told stories of creature by various people and regarded it as having a real existence in popular mind he considered tale of boobrie in its water horse manifestation resembled norse myth of ploughing of asa referring to forbes 1905 dictionary of gaelic names of beasts in which is defined as a common bittern and a detailed description given by scholar james logie robertson of bull o bog an alternative name for a bittern in scotsman in 1908 henderson hypothesises that boobrie may stem from bittern referring to bittern s strangely weird sound and highlighting its weird hollow cry during night and throughout evening he describes it as resembling quietly bellowing cattle particularly during bird s breeding season records indicate that bird was rare in scotland but had been sighted in first decade of 20th century although catching sight of a bittern was believed to be a harbinger of death or disaster references notes citations bibliography category scottish legendary creatures category scottish folklore category legendary birds category
