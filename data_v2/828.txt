river hull is a navigable river in east riding of yorkshire in northern england it rises from a series of springs to west of driffield and enters humber estuary at kingston upon hull following a period when archbishops of york charged tolls for its use it became a free navigation upper reaches became part of driffield navigation from 1770 after which they were again subject to tolls and section within city of hull came under jurisdiction of port of hull with same result most of its course is through low lying land that is at or just above sea level and regular flooding has been a long standing problem along waterway drainage schemes to alleviate it were constructed on both sides of river holderness drainage scheme to east was completed in 1772 with a second phase in 1805 and beverley and barmston drain to west was completed in 1810 since 1980 mouth of river has been protected by a tidal barrier at estuary which can be closed to prevent tidal surges entering river system and causing flooding upriver most of bridges which cross river are movable to allow shipping to pass there are six swing bridges four bascule bridges two of which have twin leaves one for each carriageway of roads which they carry and three scherzer lift bridges which are a type of rolling bascule bridge scott street bridge which is now permanently raised was originally powered from a high pressure water main maintained by first public power distribution company in world course source of river hull is in yorkshire wolds it rises from a series of springs to west of driffield near site of medieval village of elmswell elmswell beck flows eastwards from these and is joined by little driffield beck which flows southwards from little driffield it continues as driffield beck flowing around south western edge of driffield where it is joined by driffield trout stream after junction it becomes river hull or west beck and flows to east before turning south to reach corps landing for much of route below driffield driffield navigation runs parallel to river ordnance survey 1 25 000 explorer map sheets 294 295 river from corps landing to its mouth is navigable at emmotland it is joined by frodingham beck which is also navigable and leads to canal into driffield which forms major part of driffield navigation dyke joins from west and is followed by struncheon hill lock which marks end of navigation and official start of navigable river hull below here river is tidal tidal range of tides can be up to in winter and in summer just above lock beverley and barmston drain which collects water from catchwater drains on either side of main channel flows under navigation in a tunnel and runs just to west of river almost to its mouth below lock surrounding land is almost at sea level and river is constrained by flood banks on both sides ordnance survey 1 25 000 explorer map sheet 293 thumb left grovehill weel bridge beverley on its route southwards river passes former junction with aike beck once navigable to lockington landing but stream was subsequently re routed to join arram beck leven canal used to join on east bank but entrance lock has been replaced by a sluice arram beck flows in from west and then river is crossed by hull bridge cause of repeated disagreement between owners of driffield navigation and corporation of beverley who owned bridge just above beverley beck which joins from west is grovehill bridge now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge once river reaches outskirts of hull its course is marked by a series of bridges most of which open to allow boats to pass there are swing bridges lift bridges and bascule bridges and river becomes part of port of hull river which is dividing line between west and east hull bisects city s industrial area bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides though river traffic is less than it once was beverley and barmston drain rejoins river above scott street bridge below north bridge an unused dry dock on west bank marks former entrance to queens dock below drypool bridge a muddy basin on east bank was once entrance to drypool basin and victoria dock ordnance survey 1 10 560 map 1938 46 edition river reaches its confluence with humber estuary in centre of kingston upon hull at its mouth a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering river in past these had regularly flooded town and flat countryside to north history river hull has served as a navigation and a drainage channel and has been subject to conflicts that this usually creates as water levels need to be raised for navigation but lowered for efficient drainage in 1213 archbishops of york laid claim to river and declared their right to navigate on a channel a number of fish weirs made navigation difficult and archbishop negotiated their removal in 1296 so that a wharf could be established at grovehill to serve town of beverley by 1321 river rights had been extended to charging of tolls one third of a shilling 1 7 p was charged for each bushel carried on river between emmotland and humber but merchants of hull were unhappy with this eventually river had free navigation and goods could be carried on it without toll arram beck was also exempt from all tolls it has remained free except for from mouth which is part of port of hull and is under control of hull corporation outlet of river onto humber is thought to have changed in early medieval period original outlet has been identified at a place called limekiln creek a second channel sayers creek was cut or widened with both outlets existing simultaneously at one point limekiln creek was subsequently reduced in flow to level of a drain sources thumb left hull and barnsley railway bridge built in 1885 lower river was bordered by salt marshes in medieval times when efforts were first made to drain them further upstream channels were cut through fens in twelfth and thirteenth centuries by monks of meaux abbey primarily to enable travel by boat but these gradually became part of drainage system john smeaton when asked by merchants of driffield to advise on ways to allow keels to reach their town suggested a small cut of about including one lock from river near merchants sought a second opinion and john grundy jr suggested a much longer canal running for from on frodingham beck when fully opened in 1770 new route was some shorter than river which follows an extremely winding course in its upper reaches river above aike was now considered to be part of driffield navigation and tolls were charged for its use also in this period first cut of holderness drain was made enabled by an act of 1764 originally onto river in addition to drainage works to east of river banks were raised for on east side to prevent flooding although beyond their jurisdiction navigation commissioners attempted to extend their powers to improve river below junction with aike beck they particularly wanted to replace stone hull bridge near beverley with a swing bridge which would make it easier for keels to reach frodingham bridge corporation of beverley objected because bridge was main route of communication between beverley and holderness and commissioners instead dredged parts of river to improve access plans to improve hull bridge were again resisted by beverley corporation in 1799 but an agreement was finally reached in 1801 and an act of parliament was obtained in july of that year william chapman acted as engineer as act authorised construction of towpaths a new cut between bridge and lock at struncheon hill to avoid a long loop in river and rebuilding of bridge bridge cost ps500 half of which was met by richard bethell owner of leven canal on condition that tolls for passing through it were reduced significantly thumb right wilmington bridge now used as a cycleway and footbridge passage through hull had long been difficult because of number of ships which used river for loading and unloading goods in 1794 merchants of beverley had advocated building of docks at hull with a separate entrance so that traffic to upper river would not be impeded while driffield navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into act of parliament which hull dock company obtained in 1840 to ensure free passage for vessels and removal of tolls for boats not using docks navigation company also received complaints from beverley and barmston drainage commissioners who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage in 1980 environment agency constructed a tidal barrier at mouth of river structure spans river and a huge steel gate weighing 202 tonnes can be lowered into waterway effectively sealing river from humber and preventing tidal surges from moving up river and flooding parts of city and low lying areas beyond gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year and protects around 17 000 properties in 2009 a ps10 million upgrade of structure was started to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years upgrade included a new drive mechanism which raises and lowers gate and pivots it when it is at top of structure so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically it also included a new control system in july 2017 barrier was granted grade ii listed status plans have been considered to build a barrage at mouth of hull where it joins humber estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through city idea was first raised by abercrombie report which considered how to redevelop hull after significant destruction during second world war estimated cost of such a project was around million in 2007 traffic thumb left freighter near scott street bridge 1990 because river was a free river there are no figures for traffic on lower river however it connected to a number of waterways on which tolls were collected and so an indication of traffic can be gained from figures for these waterways main cargoes on beverley beck in 1730 were coal bricks turfs and wool together with cereal crops consisting of wheat barley oats and malt receipts from tolls more than doubled between 1732 and 1748 after which tolls were let to an independent collector annual rent charged for this privilege doubled again between 1748 and 1792 there was a steady expansion of trade on driffield navigation during same period as dividends paid to shareholders rose from 1 5 to 4 per cent in 1789 bainton boyes and co negotiated a lump sum payment to cover coal from aire and calder navigation to their new carpet factory and export of their carpets in downstream direction factory later became a corn mill toll rentals continued to increase on beverley beck rising from ps190 to between 1793 and 1835 some 31 185 tons of cargo were carried in 1838 in 1817 a steam packet service started to run between driffield and hull three return trips each week were made but journey times were too long and an advertisement in 1825 indicated that engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence three boats were recorded as trading between driffield and hull every other day in a directory of yorkshire published in 1823 traffic for 1832 included 7 394 of coal 18 173 quarters of wheat 7 745 quarters of oats 19 396 quarters of barley and 4 555 sacks of flour an additional 1 564 quarters of wheat and 8 194 sacks of flour were carried to or from foston mill reached from frodingham beck a regular carrier also operated between leven canal and hull once a week between 1848 and 1905 traffic on beverley beck more than trebled from 33 498 tons to 101 540 tons coal and other minerals accounted for around one quarter of traffic in 1905 while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser burnt ore flour and scrap metal commercial traffic continued into 1970s when tolls of ps2 365 were collected on 28 169 tons of cargo traffic on driffield navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905 falling slightly from 35 654 to 32 666 tons goods carried included coal linseed cottonseed wheat flour and artificial manures in 1922 ps7 of income was received from pleasure craft using navigation traffic declined during 1930s with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944 leven canal carried 4 242 tons in 1888 and 4 546 in 1905 but then succumbed to road competition and closed in 1935 drainage thumb right river hull at problems of flooding of land adjacent to river were addressed by construction of catchwater drains to both sides of it east side of river was protected by holderness drainage scheme john grundy worked on plans for scheme which would protect of low lying land to north east of hull john smeaton was also involved although final report was largely grundy s work and an act of parliament to authorise work was passed on 5 april 1764 trustees for scheme wrote to grundy and smeaton in may 1764 asking them to work on project grundy s wife had died only a fortnight previously and two engineers corresponded but besides valuable comment on grundy s plans for outfall sluice smeaton had no further involvement and it was grundy who ran project which included of barrier bank along east side of river john hoggard acted as superintendent for scheme while joseph page was appointed as resident engineer to oversee construction of drains and outfall sluice grundy made regular visits until october 1767 by which time sluice and main drainage channels were completed at which point he and page moved on while hoggard oversaw additional work on drains and banks which lasted for several more years by time of its completion in 1772 scheme had cost ps24 000 despite holderness scheme there were still problems near leven and weel and william jessop spent a month inspecting area before writing a report in july 1786 his plan advocated separating water which fell on uplands to north and flowed through low lying areas from local drainage of those low lying areas george plummer carried out most of subsequent survey work on jessop s behalf although jessop surveyed river hull in 1787 to identify how outfall could be improved jessop visited works from time to time making seven visits between 1789 and 1792 while day to day oversight of scheme was handled by plummer as resident engineer plummer was succeeded by anthony bower who was engineer from 1792 to 1795 and whole scheme was completed in 1805 having cost ps16 000 in 1796 robert chapman was asked to report on possible solutions for flooding to west his report formed basis for beverley and barmston drainage act which was passed by parliament in june 1798 chapman was appointed as engineer for scheme which would cost ps115 000 and would provide flood defences and drainage for of land to west of river project included construction of of drainage cuts and building embankments along of river at hull an outfall sluice was constructed and drain passed through tunnels under eleven waterways including beverley beck 27 bridges were built to carry roads over drain and whole project was finished in 1810 river crossings there are several bridges in hull area which cross river

morris s new bridge opened in march 1961 hull times 11 march 1961 p 5 scott street bridge had gradually deteriorated and a public consultation was held in 1986 to determine its future by that time a 10 ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using bridge because of its poor structural state three suggestions were made as to its future these were to close and demolish it to refurbish it at an estimated cost of ps1 6 million and to build a new bridge on same site but a different alignment to eliminate awkward turn at west end which was costed at ps2 million yorkshire post 11 june 1986 none of these actions have been taken as bridge leaves were raised in 1994 and have remained raised ever since consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of hydraulic rams which operated bridge during planning to demolish structure hull hydraulic power company was set up in 1872 and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on street this supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from wellington street to sculcoates bridge and was used by local industries to power machinery including bridge when it was constructed although power company closed in 1940s it made hull first city in world to have a public system of power distribution thumb right scott street bridge 1990 design for ennerdale link road included a tunnel under river initial investigations suggested that there was a layer of boulder clay below alluvium of river bed and that a chalk aquifer was below clay construction work started in july 1991 a cofferdam was built on east bank and cutting which would have provided access to twin bore tunnel was nearly excavated when a hole appeared in river bed and entire site flooded a 3 month investigation took place which suggested that it would be difficult to finish tunnel and maintain integrity of aquifer despite some ps10 million having been spent on project it was abandoned in 1993 a contract for a replacement bridge was awarded in june 1995 and river was crossed by twin lift bridges which were opened in april 1997 project had cost ps30 million compared to an original budget of just ps13 million a tunnel was successfully constructed under river in 2001 long sewer runs from city centre to a treatment works at salt end it was excavated using two tunnelling machines which were manufactured in canada and were named maureen and gloria tunnel was officially opened on 21 august 2001 when a mini car was driven through it recreating scenes from film italian job before 1897 there had been a ferry at grovehill and a shipyard on east bank owned by joseph scarr to assist his workers to reach shipyard scarr designed and built a ferry bridge which cost him ps300 it consisted of a large rectangular pontoon above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails two jack screws enabled deck to be raised or lowered in relation to pontoon so that it remained at approximately same height whatever state of tide on eastern bank scarr constructed a variable height landing but landing on west bank was constructed by beverley council and was fixed scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well and was prepared to fund it but his requests were always rejected fixed landing made access to bridge difficult at high tides when a boat needed to pass west end was freed and pontoon swung round to lie parallel to bank either upstream or downstream depending on state of tide it would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch at night bridge was closed and moored beside bank responsibility for bridge was taken over by beverley council before second world war its condition deteriorated and in 1948 they attempted to replace it with a footbridge around further upstream because ferry rights had been in existence for more than 600 years an act of parliament was needed and this was thwarted by a petition containing 84 signatures presented by people of weel to house of lords plans for a new lift bridge were drawn up and it was opened on 19 october 1953 in 1913 hull bridge upstream of beverley which had caused so much disagreement in 18th century until it had been replaced in 1801 was demolished by county council who installed a steel rolling bridge in its place once tickton bypass bridge had been built a short distance upstream it no longer needed to carry road traffic and it was replaced by a footbridge in 1976 at other end of river millennium bridge was opened in 2001 there was once a ferry at this point before 1865 ordnance survey 1 2500 map 1856 which gave access to victoria dock opened in 1850 south bridge replaced ferry in 1865 making it easier for workers to reach dock swing footbridge was closed in 1934 but was not demolished until 1944 water quality environment agency measure water quality of
