announced his appointment as replacement for director sam mendes who had been working on such an adaptation sondheim although not directly involved was extensively consulted during production depp not

bower as anthony hope ed sanders as tobias ragg production development tim burton first saw stephen sondheim s 1979 stage musical sweeney todd demon barber of fleet street as a calarts student in london in 1980 burton recalled his experience of seeing show saying i was still a student i didn t know if i would be making movies or working in a restaurant i had no idea what i would be doing i just wandered into theatre and it just blew me away because i d never really seen anything that had mixture of all those elements i actually went three nights in a row because i loved it so much although not a fan of musical genre burton was struck by how cinematic musical was and repeatedly attended subsequent performances he described it as a silent film with music and was dazzled both by music and its sense of macabre when his directing career took off in late 1980s burton approached sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation but nothing came of it in sondheim s words burton went off and did other things meanwhile director sam mendes had been working on a film version of story for several years and in june 2003 sondheim was approached to write script although he turned down offer mendes and producer walter f parkes obtained his approval to use writer john logan instead logan had previously collaborated with parkes on gladiator and claimed his biggest challenge in adapting sondheim stage play was taking a sprawling magnificent broadway musical and making it cinematic and an emotionally honest film onstage you can have a chorus sing as people of london but i think that would be alienating in a movie mendes left to direct 2005 film and burton leaped at taking over direction after his project ripley s believe it or not fell apart due to its excessive budget on burton s hiring he and logan reworked screenplay logan felt they agreed over film s tone due to share d stunted childhoods watching amicus movies turning a three hour stage musical into a two hour film required some changes some songs were shortened while others were completely removed burton said in terms of show it was three hours long but we weren t out to film broadway show we were out to make a movie so we tried to keep pace like those old melodramas sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape burton and logan also reduced prominence of other secondary elements such as romance between todd s daughter johanna and anthony to allow them to focus on triangular relationship between todd mrs lovett and toby casting dreamworks announced burton s appointment in august 2006 and johnny depp was cast as todd christopher lee peter bowles anthony head and five other actors were set to play ghost narrators but their roles were cut head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates depp after shaving contest according to lee these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during march 2007 while depp s daughter recovered from an illness burton s domestic partner helena bonham carter was cast in october 2006 as well as sacha baron cohen in december 2006 alan rickman was cast in january 2007 laura michelle kelly was cast as lucy barker timothy spall was added to cast and said he was urged to audition by his daughter who wanted him to work with depp he recalled i really wanted this one i knew tim was directing and that johnny depp was going to be in it my daughter my youngest daughter really wanted me to do it for that reason johnny depp was in it she came on set to meet depp and he was really delightful to her she had a great time then i took her to junket and depp greeted her like an old pal when he saw her i ve got plenty of brownie points at moment three members of cast had never been in a film before ed sanders was cast as toby jayne wisener as johanna and jamie campbell bower who auditioned and after four days got part of anthony said i think i weed myself i was out shopping at time and i got this call on my mobile i was just like oh my god honestly i was like a little girl running around this shop like oh my god oh my god oh my god filming filming began on february 5 2007 at pinewood studios and was completed by may 11 despite a brief interruption when depp s daughter was taken seriously ill burton opted to film in london where he had felt very much at home since his work on batman in 1989 production designer dante ferretti created a darker more sinister london by adapting fleet street and its surrounding area burton initially planned to use minimal sets and film in front of a green screen but decided against it stating that physical sets helped actors get into a musical frame of mind just having people singing in front of a green screen seemed more disconnected depp created his own image of todd heavy purple and brown make up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage as if he s never slept burton said of character sweeney todd we always saw him as a sad character not a tragic villain or anything he s basically a dead person when you meet him only thing that s keeping him going is one single minded thing which is tragic you don t see anything else around him depp said of character he makes sid vicious look like innocent paper boy he s beyond dark he s already dead he s been dead for years depp also commented on streak of white in todd s hair saying idea was that he d had this hideous trauma from being sent away locked away that streak of white hair became shock of that rage it represented his rage over what had happened it s certainly not first time anyone s used it but it s effective it tells a story all by itself my brother had a white spot growing up and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair burton insisted that film be bloody as he felt stage versions of play which cut back on bloodshed robbed it of its power for him everything is so internal with sweeney that blood is like his emotional release it s more about catharsis than it is a literal thing producer richard d zanuck said that burton had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal almost kill bill kind of stylization we had done tests and experiments with neck slashing with blood popping out i remember saying to tim my god do we dare do this on set fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on desaturated color film used and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming this macabre tone made some studios nervous and it was not until warner bros pictures dreamworks and paramount had signed up for project that film s 50 million budget was covered burton said studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what show was any movie is a risk but it is nice to be able to do something like that that doesn t fit into musical or slasher movie categories after filming burton said of cast all i can say is this is one of best casts i ve ever worked with these people are not professional singers so to do a musical like this which i think is one of most difficult musicals they all went for it every day on set was a very very special thing for me hearing all these guys sing i don t know if i can ever have an experience like that again burton said of singing you can t just lip synch you d see throat and breath every take they all had to belt it out it was very enjoyable for me to see with music on set everybody just moved differently i d seen johnny depp act in a way i d never seen before walking across room or sitting in chair picking up a razor or making a pie whatever they all did it in a way that you could sense depp said of working with baron cohen when asked what he was like in real life meaning not doing one of his trademark characters he s not what i expected i didn t look at those characters and think this will be sweetest guy in world he s incredibly nice a real gentleman kind of elegant i was impressed with him he s kind of today s equivalent of peter sellers music burton wanted to avoid traditional approach of patches of dialogue interrupted by song we didn t want it to be what i d say was a traditional musical with a lot of dialogue and then singing that s why we cut out a lot of choruses and extras singing and dancing down street each of characters because a lot of them are repressed and have their emotions inside music was a way to let them express their feelings he cut show s famous opening number ballad of sweeney todd explaining why have a chorus singing about attending tale of sweeney todd when you could just go ahead and attend it sondheim acknowledged that in adapting a musical to film plot has to be kept moving and was sent mp3 files of his shortened songs by mike higham film s music producer for approval several other songs were also cut and sondheim noted that there were many changes additions and deletions though if you just go along with it i think you ll have a spectacular time to create a larger more cinematic feel score was re orchestrated by stage musical s original orchestrator jonathan tunick who increased orchestra from 27 musicians to 78 deluxe complete edition soundtrack was released on december 18 2007 depp s singing was described by a new york times reviewer as harsh and thin but amazingly forceful another critic adds that though depp s voice does not have much heft or power his ear is obviously excellent because his pitch is dead on accurate beyond his good pitch and phrasing expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to portrayal beneath this sweeney s vacant sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous rage that threatens to burst forth every time he slowly takes a breath and is poised to speak yet when he sings his voice crackles and breaks with sadness marketing film s marketing has been criticized for not advertising it as a musical michael halberstam of writers theatre said by de emphasizing score to extent they did in trailer it is possible producers were condescending to us a tactic which cannot ultimately end in anything but tears in uk a number of audience members walked out of film on realizing it was a musical and complaints that advertisements for film were deliberately misleading were made to both advertising standards authority and trading standards agency studios involved opted for a low key approach to their marketing producer walter parkes stated all these things that could be described as difficulties could also be movie s greatest strengths warner bros felt it should take a similar approach to marketing as with departed with little early exposure and discouraging talk of awards release sweeney todd demon barber of fleet street officially opened at united states box office on december 21 2007 in 1 249 theatres and took 9 300 805 in its opening weekend worldwide releases followed during january and february 2008

marcus theaters corporation was not initially planning to screen film following its premiere because it was unable to reach a pricing agreement with paramount however dispute was resolved in time for official release critical reception although sondheim was cautious of a cinematic adaptation of his musical he was largely impressed by results film received critical acclaim with depp and bonham carter s performance receiving unanimous praise review aggregator rotten tomatoes reports that 85 of critics gave film positive reviews based on 227 reviews and an average rating of 7 71 10 site s critical consensus reads full of pith and grand guignol grossness this macabre musical is perfectly helmed and highly entertaining tim burton masterfully stages musical in a way that will make you think he has done this many times before metacritic gave film an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 39 reviews indicating universal acclaim sweeney todd appeared on many critics top ten lists of best films of 2007 of reviewers time rated it an a minus and added burton and depp infuse brilliant cold steel of stephen sondheim s score with a burning passion helena bonham carter and a superb supporting cast bring focused fury to this musical nightmare it s bloody great time s richard corliss named film one of its top ten movies of 2007 placing it fifth roger ebert of chicago sun times gave it four stars out of four lauding burton s visual style in his review in variety todd mccarthy called it both sharp and fleet and a satisfying screen version of stephen sondheim s landmark 1979 theatrical musical things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by tim burton expert screw tightening by scenarist john logan and haunted and musically adept lead performances from johnny depp and helena bonham carter assembled artistic combo assures film will reap by far biggest audience to see a pure sondheim musical although just how big depends on upscale crowd s tolerance for buckets of blood and degree to which masses stay away due to whiff of highbrow lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly gave film a b plus in its movie reviews section and stated to stage a proper sweeney todd necks must be slit human flesh must be into pastries and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death enter tim burton who has tenderly art directed soup thick tomato red fake gore blood with zest of a hollywood funded jackson pollock she went on to refer to piece as opulent attentive so finely minced a mixture of sondheim s original melodrama and burton s signature spicing that it s difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for job in its dvd reviews section ew s chris nashawaty gave film an a minus stating depp s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he s been hiding watching depp s barber wield his razors it s hard not to be reminded of edward scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal 18 years ago and all of twisted beauty we would ve missed out on had burton and depp never met in rolling stone peter travers awarded it 3 1 2 out of 4 stars and added sweeney todd is a thriller diller from start to finish scary monstrously funny and melodically thrilling film is a bloody wonder intimate and epic horrific and heart rending as it flies on wings of sondheim s most thunderously exciting score as with time critic ranked it fifth on his list of best movies of 2007 kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter said blood juxtaposed to music is highly unsettling it runs contrary to expectations burton pushes this gore into his audiences faces so as to feel madness and destructive fury of sweeney s obsession teaming with depp his long time alter ego burton makes sweeney a smoldering dark pit of fury and hate that consumes itself with his sturdy acting and surprisingly good voice depp is a sweeney todd for ages harry knowles gave film a highly positive review calling it burton s best film since ed wood his favorite burton film and said it was possibly superior he praised all of cast and cinematography but noted it would probably not appeal to non musical fans due to dominance of music in film
