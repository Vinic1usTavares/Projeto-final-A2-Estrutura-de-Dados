magazine s munro cited lines so many places you d prefer to be than framed by a picket fence and salary as an example of this as well as examples from future songs these days and my kind of scene when asked about this fanning offered no direct explanation saying it wasn t a conscious theme but did suggest that it could be a part guilt complex because of his relatively care free lifestyle in
