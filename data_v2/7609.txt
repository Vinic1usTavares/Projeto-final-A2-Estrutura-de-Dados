following right winged second cabinet bondevik victory in 2001 parliamentary election minister of transport torild skogsholm from liberal party announced that government would make all subsidized passenger trains services in country subject to public service obligation pso this had previously been done in several other european countries such as sweden and germany initial plans launched in 2002 called for three routes to be subject to pso gjovik line bratsberg line and bergen commuter rail these are commuter train services least passengers and purpose was to use initial tenders as a learning exercise and to create a more efficient system to implement in future tenders plans also called for transferring responsibility for managing and financing pso contracts on commuter rail services to counties but this was not followed in part because of a report from institute of transport economics which concluded that this would provide a worse service at time government was spending nok 1 4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from nsb by introducing pso skogsholm stated that she hoped costs would be reduced and that quality and safety levels would remain or even improve counties have been allowed to issue pso contracts on bus transport since 1994 and skogsholm saw competition in rail transport as a continuation of this following announcement of competition ceo of nsb einar said that he did not see competition as a threat but instead that nsb would introduce means to rationalize costs in november 2002 nsb laid off 100 employees and reduced its administration by a third administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to oslo skogsholm stated that government had no plans to sell nsb bid process in 2003 telemark county municipality had attempted to create a pso contract for operation of bratsberg line that had been transferred from state to county five private companies had bid but all five had been disqualified and county was forced to sign a concession contract with nsb instead despite nsb not having bid in tender same year national process was delayed one year however government announced that bidding would happen in three stages first gjovik line and bergen commuter rail second long distance trains as well as trondelag commuter rail and finally rest of oslo commuter rail as well as jaeren commuter rail among challenges was ownership of rolling stock and depots department considered creating a separate government owned company that would own these since nsb had been converted to a limited company it would be necessary for state to purchase trains and depots for full price from nsb with 69 multiple units delivered within past five years this could become an expensive transaction for state an alternative was launched were nsb would have to lease locomotives carriages and multiple units to winner and also sell tickets for them at railway stations a solution that was later chosen in september 2004 it was announced that current employees working for nsb along gjovik line would have right to work for winner and could demand same wage and pension rights as before thumb left while veolia has been successful at winning pso contracts in sweden they failed to offer lowest bid for operating gjovik line gjovik line was chosen as first service to be subject to pso deadline for applying for was on 1 april 2004 and seven companies applied these were norges statsbaner ofotbanen arriva veolia danske statsbaner dsb and companies were required to document their competency to be qualified for security and operation permits from norwegian railway inspectorate and were not allowed to subsidize operations from activities that were not subject to competition to participate in bid nsb established subsidiary nsb anbud as in 2004 by time tenders were submitted it turned out only nsb dsb and veolia had chosen bid tender was won by nsb anbud on 30 may 2005 wanting nok 70 million annually for contract ten million less than with former agreement after contract was won nsb anbud announced schedule for gjovik line number of train services would increase by 40 three stations serving recreational area nordmarka outside oslo would be dropped and skogsholm tried to make an agreement with nsb to not abandon all stations but since this had not been part of pso tender an agreement could not be made and service was canceled after tender 80 employees were transferred to subsidiary including director chartered engineer arne fosen to press he said that increased efficiency in organization was related to a small administration and being able to use uniform trains previously both locomotive hauled trains as well as class 70 and class 69 trains had been used following pso nsb anbud would operate nine class 69g trains which are somewhat smaller than locomotive hauled and class 70 trains these would be owned by nsb but rented by subsidiary ministry would pay for a nok 40 million overhaul of stock representatives from labor union said they feared for flexibility of nsb since 80 employees were now bound up in serving only a single line nordby replaced fosen as director in august operation thumb minister of transport liv signe navarsete centre cancelled pso process in 2005 following second cabinet stoltenberg s election victory service was introduced on 11 june 2006 with a contract lasting ten years along with change of operator and stock norwegian national rail administration who owns stations and tracks did an overhaul of maintenance

100 game are killed each year along line in september nsb anbud launched a service allowing passenger riding from gjovik and toten areas to transfer to a coach at roa station and continue onwards to oslo airport gardermoen since establishment nsb anbud has requested an additional passing loop on gjovik line this will allow more freight trains on line and reduce travel time for passenger trains by four minutes investment would cost nok 50 to 70 million during 2007 company also accused norwegian national rail administration of giving gjovik line less priority in maintenance just because nsb anbud had their train run more on time than trains operated by other companies aftermath pso project cost ministry at least 25 million millions were needed for external consultant fees to prepare contracts in addition to cost of upgrading rolling stock exact fees paid were not disclosed to public following left winged stoltenberg s second cabinet s victory in 2005 parliamentary election new
