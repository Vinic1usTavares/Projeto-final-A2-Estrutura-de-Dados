were played by young women gross altman 1993 p 163 children were considered for parts but production team thought that it would be too troublesome because of limited time they could work each day and

series james hunt reviewed episode for website den of geek in january 2013 he was surprised by episode as he went in expecting something that was typically season one awful and got something that was actually a lot of fun he thought that theme of symbiosis between man and machine was interesting stating it was best episode up until that point in season one and one of best of season overall zack handlen watched episode for a v club in may 2010 he too was surprised by what he found handlen said that last time i saw it i thought riker and minuet s interactions were cheesy as hell they didn t bother me so much now because they don t go on very long and there s something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions but he said i had fun with this which i wasn t expecting and thought this was solid he gave episode a b grade keith decandido reviewed episode for tor com in june 2011 he described it as one of strongest first season episodes and bynars as one of finest alien species trek has provided he also thought that turning off auto destruct with two minutes to go instead of mere seconds neatly avoided a cliche and gave it a score of seven out of ten michelle erica green for treknation watched episode in june 2007 she thought that it came very close to being a really good episode she also thought that picard and riker s actions were most boneheaded joint behavior by top two officers in that they got distracted by a female character on holodeck and didn t notice ship being evacuated jamahl epsicokhan at his website
