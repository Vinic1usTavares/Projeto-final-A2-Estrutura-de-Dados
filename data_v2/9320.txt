severe tropical cyclone althea was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated parts of north queensland just before christmas 1971 one of strongest storms ever to affect townsville area althea was fourth system and second severe tropical cyclone of 1971 72 australian region cyclone season after forming near solomon islands on 19 december and heading southwest across coral sea storm reached its peak intensity with 10 minute average maximum sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph category 4 on australian cyclone scale at 09 00 aest on christmas eve althea struck coast of queensland near rollingstone about north of townsville although early weather satellites provided only occasional glimpses into cyclone s formative stages its landfall was monitored closely by land based radar that depicted an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle althea produced copious rainfall over central and western queensland as it turned toward southeast and on 26 december cyclone emerged over open waters after briefly re intensifying system dissipated on 29 december while moving ashore althea generated wind gusts as high as that wrought significant destruction around townsville and left nearby magnetic island in a state of ruin almost all of buildings on island were damaged to some degree a significant storm surge battered mainland while high waves destroyed roads and seawalls beaches receded by up to due to coastal erosion in townsville thousands of homes were damaged and many were destroyed most widespread damage was to roofs which were often poorly or not at all secured damage from althea prompted queensland to develop its first statewide building codes requiring new homes to be cyclone resistant townsville was first community to adopt enhanced construction standards in addition to coastal effects althea triggered extensive river flooding in interior queensland most major roads in western portions of state were cut off by floodwaters and hundreds of families had to leave their homes for higher ground in aftermath of cyclone 600 australian army soldiers aided recovery efforts in townsville and magnetic island while both state and federal governments contributed disaster relief funds three people were killed and damage totaled 120 million 1971 aud meteorological history cyclone althea originated in an expanding area of thunderstorm activity near solomon islands in mid december 1971 although little is known about storm s genesis because of sparse reports and infrequent weather satellite images disturbance is thought to have organised into a tropical low on 19 december as it tracked slowly southwestward into coral sea according to bureau of meteorology s bom tropical cyclone warning centre tcwc in brisbane system reached tropical cyclone status around 06 00 utc on 20 december less than southwest of honiara just after 23 00 utc on 21 december imagery from united states essa 8 satellite showed first indications of an emerging eye feature althea tracked southwest toward coast of queensland around a subtropical ridge to south and steadily strengthened near 18 00 utc on 22 december it reached its peak intensity with 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 165 km h 105 mph this made it a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on australian scale cyclone s central barometric pressure of was estimated using lowest recorded air pressure at townsville airport a radius of maximum wind and environmental air pressures right thumb radar image of althea just before landfall showing concentric eyewalls alt image of a radar scan showing cyclone s core concentric eyewalls are shown with a small ring at center of a larger circular void late on 22 december eye remained obscured to satellite imagery by a canopy of cirrus clouds while cyclone passed north of lihou reef early next day it tracked just south of automated weather station on flinders reef althea likely continued to organise until landfall which occurred at 23 00 utc on 23 december 09 00 aest on christmas eve near rollingstone about north of townsville landfall point placed townsville and nearby magnetic island in cyclone s powerful left front quadrant because of tight pressure gradient between althea and high pressure area to south gale force winds extended well to south of cyclone s centre while system was moving ashore land based radar imagery identified an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle with two distinct concentric eyewalls rings of intense thunderstorms surrounding centre strongest winds were found under contracting outer ring which shrank from between 21 00 and 23 00 utc to become dominant eyewall as inner ring dissipated consequently extreme winds initially extended relatively far from centre storm quickly weakened as it continued southwest passing just north of charters towers city though it continued to produce heavy rainfall over interior queensland curving southeastward althea re emerged over open waters between maryborough and double island point on 26 december and began to intensify once again at 00 00 utc on 28 december cyclone reached a third peak with 10 minute winds of 110 km h 70 mph but as it turned more toward south increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures weakened cyclone on 29 december althea lost its tropical characteristics over tasman sea preparations in hours leading up to landfall tcwc in brisbane issued 17 cyclone warnings for coastal areas according to bom residents received 20 hours of advance warning in which to complete preparations by late on 23 december police and state emergency service workers were on alert for approaching storm high public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to bom cyclone awareness initiatives in wake of 1970 s deadly cyclone ada however storm victims still criticised agency and local radio news stations for unclear untimely or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion significant delays between issuance of warnings from tcwc brisbane and local broadcast in townsville area raised some question about need for a warning centre closer to north queensland impact total damage from cyclone althea amounted to just under a 120 million 1971 and normalised damage total for 2012 which accounts for growth and inflation was estimated at 648 million throughout affected region 257 people were treated for storm related injuries mostly inflicted by airborne debris three people were killed in townsville ten people were reported missing during cyclone nine on three boats that were unaccounted for and one whose car was found in a swollen creek they were all found safe magnetic island an estimated 90 of buildings on magnetic island were damaged to some degree by wind gusts and there was not a tree left with leaves on it island s main town of picnic bay was hit particularly hard about 100 people endured cyclone in dining room of a picnic bay hotel that ultimately sustained severe structural damage 65 would remain sheltered there through christmas day around 60 of houses in nelly bay and 40 in arcadia were demolished in village of horseshoe bay one woman died in a building collapse and reportedly only 8 out of 150 houses in community survived cyclone island suffered a nearly total power outage and after water pipeline from mainland was damaged strict usage rations were put in place until repairs could be made about 30 people on magnetic island were treated for injuries sustained during storm and damage reached 2 million coastal queensland left thumb upright 1 3 damage to a hotel

coast of queensland it still stands as most intense ever in townsville area gusts as high as and sustained winds of were recorded at townsville airport though anemometer was somewhat sheltered by upwind castle hill so stronger winds may have occurred storm bent large steel utility poles and lifted houses off their foundations while entirely stripping trees of their leaves pieces of dislodged debris acted as projectiles penetrating fibre cement walls in some cases entire roofs crashed down on vehicles and other property power outages were extensive one post storm survey of 6 000 houses in townsville found around 0 7 totally demolished 1 7 with critical but repairable damage and 13 3 with minor damage other estimates placed share of damaged or destroyed houses at 60 several months after storm townsville city council reported that about 200 houses had been leveled about 1 in every 100 with 600 more rendered uninhabitable and as many as 4 000 damaged among structures damaged or destroyed were 200 queensland housing commission homes and roughly 500 of 700 war service homes commission dwellings in townsville overall althea wrought at least 6 million in damage to government owned buildings cyclone killed two people in townsville one man was crushed when his home collapsed and another suffered a stress related heart attack although worst of storm struck near low tide combination of a large storm surge and high waves caused widespread damage along coast storm surge values reached in townsville harbour ross river experienced a water level rise that submerged streets in city shipping interests in river suffered extensively when a barge broke free of its moorings and collided with numerous smaller vessels an estimated peak storm surge of occurred at toolakea in addition to surge wave action was highly destructive seawalls and coastal roadways were crushed by pounding surf in places such as strand and cape pallarenda violent onshore flow generated severe beach erosion from townsville to toolakea while north of storm s center in greater palm group of islands substantial erosion resulted from southwesterly winds beaches receded by as much as between pallarenda and bay and by up to at beach near cyclone s landfall point storm surge values tapered off sharply to north of storm centre but remained high well to south with above normal water levels extending as far south as mackay at pallarenda storm surge swept vehicles off roads and inundated homes around 40 of dwellings were rendered uninhabitable trees and power lines in community were mangled nearly every building was unroofed and damage amounted to approximately 1 million in saunders beach wind blown sand debarked trees and buffeted paint from houses althea generally dropped of rain in townsville area much of it falling after cyclone moved inland as so many roofs had been damaged many home interiors were left exposed to elements as a result deluge caused significant water damage to interior walls electrical wiring and personal belongings storage facilities at raaf garbutt were seriously damaged by combined wind and rain and four helicopters at base were destroyed in weeks following cyclone s passage further downpours plagued townsville and triggered flooding when storm drains clogged with debris were unable to handle runoff severe flooding from althea in burdekin river delta was exacerbated by rainfall from cyclone bronwyn in early january interior queensland farther inland up to of rain fell in 12 hours most substantial rainfall in 15 years in some drought stricken parts of state rain proved beneficial to farmers but there was also widespread flash flooding over western and southern queensland numerous communities were isolated by rising floodwaters and hundreds of families were forced to evacuate their homes in some cases residents had to be moved to higher ground by boat along with any food and provisions they were able to salvage overflowing warrego river washed out parts of mitchell and warrego highways near charleville and most of major roads in western portions of state were blocked by flooding several hundred homes in south west queensland were inundated in addition to damaging highways cyclone disrupted rail and air transportation railroads traveling out of townsville were submerged under as much as of water while several airfields were forced to close later as storm approached open water once again it dropped over of precipitation along southern coast of queensland as runoff from heavy rains traveled downstream southern areas continued to experience flooding into early january two tornadoes embedded within cyclone s outer bands touched down in bowen causing damage to buildings and vegetation damaging thunderstorms in suburbs of sydney new south wales on 25 december were broadly attributed to weather pattern associated with althea aftermath right thumb upright 1 3 a house in townsville lifted off its foundation and dropped on a vehicle by winds alt black and white photograph of a contorted single story home a crushed automobile is visible beneath structure a state of emergency was declared for townsville area making an initial 7 000 in emergency aid available for distribution among 84 individuals left homeless immediately after storm salvation army began collecting and distributing donated clothing while providing hot meals to hundreds of destitute storm victims australian prime minister william mcmahon soon traveled to townsville to assess damage and authorise distribution of emergency grants for affected residents at end of december officials announced that state and federal governments would jointly issue individual rebuilding grants ranging from 1 000 to as high as 4 000 for pensioners for latter higher allocations to cover full cost of rebuilding homes were soon considered townsville city council received a special 25 000 grant with goal of repairing schools for start of new academic year by 27 december 150 000 in private donations had arrived as organisations and radio stations throughout queensland sought assistance for disaster area western australia provided 72 000 of relief funding while tasmania contributed 2 000 australian federal government reimbursed queensland for an estimated 5 5 6 million spent by state on recovery about 600 australian army soldiers including 130 engineers were recalled from christmas leave and stationed at lavarack barracks in townsville for relief efforts around area troops were then split into 30 crews and assigned to different parts of disaster area in response to a request by premier of queensland joh petersen 1st battalion royal australian regiment spent 10 days on magnetic island assisting in cleanup and recovery emergency vehicles specialised personnel electric generators refrigerators food rations and other critical supplies were ferried to island and medical officers rushed there to limit spread of gastroenteritis after several cases were reported to recognise efforts of australian army in aftermath of althea a commemorative plaque was later erected in townsville s anzac memorial park initial recovery work was delayed by persistent flooding of roadways but within a few days of cyclone residents received around 2 000 tarpaulins to protect their damaged homes and building materials to begin repairs by early january royal australian air force had airlifted of emergency supplies into townsville area isolated instances of looting were reported after disaster and multiple local merchants were investigated for alleged price gouging after season ended name althea was retired from australian tropical cyclone naming list due to cyclone s severe impact many of damaged houses were of poor construction and in wake of althea engineering studies of destruction resulted in a new understanding of structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds australian achievements in mitigation of wind damage to housing from tropical cyclones walker george r 17 october 1991 in particular inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among primary points of failure consequently much stricter building codes were explored in queensland and australia as a whole three years later cyclone tracy s devastation in darwin northern territory bolstered trend of more rigorous construction specifications in country many of buildings destroyed by tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after althea showing need for further study severe cyclones prompted queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975 new queensland home building code was fully adopted in mid 1980s under new regulations roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings having seen dangers of deficient construction first hand townsville was first community to enact enhanced building standards and served as a testing ground for further revisions cyclone testing station a wind damage research organisation housed within james cook university s townsville campus was established in 1977 in response to cyclones althea and tracy see also 1998 townsville floods climate of australia cyclone cyclone yasi list of tropical cyclones references external links footage of
