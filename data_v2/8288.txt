oldest international football ground still in use venue hosted all of wales fixtures until 1890 when a fixture against ireland was held in english border town of shrewsbury over following two decades wales played matches in several areas of country including bangor cardiff and swansea advent of professionalism among welsh club sides saw construction of several purpose built football grounds two of these ninian park which hosted its first international in 1911 and vetch field which hosted its first in 1921 would go on to share wales home fixtures with racecourse for nearly a century although one match was moved to anfield in liverpool in 1977 as a result of crowd trouble no other venue would host a wales home international fixture between 1910 and 1989 when team began playing at national stadium in cardiff in 2000 construction of millennium stadium was completed and venue was immediately assigned as side s new home ground although crowds were initially high at millennium a gradual drop in attendances saw team play matches in several newly built grounds including cardiff city stadium and liberty stadium cardiff city stadium proved popular and was credited as a factor in team s improvement as such it was subsequently assigned as wales permanent home venue since team s first match sixteen grounds have hosted a wales home international racecourse has held more matches than any other venue hosting 94 as of october 2019 total is twelve more than second most frequently used ground ninian park which was demolished in 2009 four home fixtures have been held outside wales three of

scotland travelling to wales and first home international played in wales took place on 5 march 1877 at racecourse ground in wrexham which was owned by wrexham cricket club ground included a separate tent that was erected for ladies to attend along with their accompanying gentlemen as a result racecourse ground is officially recognised as oldest football ground in world that continues to host international matches by guinness world records and has hosted more welsh international matches than any other ground next ground to host an international that is still in use is hampden park in glasgow which did not host its first match for another 27 years racecourse remained only ground to host a wales home international fixture until 1890 including hosting first meetings between wales and both england and ireland in 1880 and 1882 respectively wales meeting with ireland led to side s first victory on home ground john price scored four times for wales in a 7 1 victory wales enjoyed considerable success over irish side in 1880s winning by five or more goals on five occasions final victory an 11 0 triumph at racecourse remains wales record victory in international competition during formative years of international football wales only fixtures were played against other home nations in british home championship with matches alternating between home and away venues each year matches against england and scotland were kept at racecourse in wrexham due to their propensity to draw large crowds while fixtures against traditionally lesser known irish team were moved to alternate venues in 1890 wales hosted ireland in a fixture that was held at old racecourse in english border town of shrewsbury football association of wales faw governing body for sport in wales believed that holding match at site would attract a bigger crowd although match drew a significant number of fans 5 000 total attendance was only equal to figures seen at some previous fixtures at racecourse ground in wrexham matches returned to wrexham until 1892 when wales opening fixture of 1891 92 british home championship against ireland was moved to penrhyn park in bangor faw had been petitioned by committee of town s football club bangor to host a match venue was provided by george douglas pennant 2nd baron penrhyn who was present at match and was located in grounds of penrhyn estate which was lent to faw to host fixture inexperienced security employed proved troublesome however when a crush began to develop in waiting crowd resulting in at least one serious injury when a boy suffered broken ribs crush forced stewards to open gates to ground and allow majority of spectators in without paying losing faw a significant portion of gate revenue north wales express derided decision to attempt to pass all 5 6 000 spectators through a single small gate as sheer stupidity in 1894 faw decided to host first wales international in south of country traditionally a stronghold of rugby union st helen s home ground of wales rugby union team was chosen as venue and decision was seen as a direct move against competing sport by some one english newspaper described decision as carrying war into enemy camp with a vengeance on day of match western mail published a diagram of a football pitch and included a list of differences between association football and rugby union for unfamiliar crowd wales went on to win match 4 1 a large crowd of over 10 000 meant match in swansea generated a profit for faw buoyed by this income a second fixture in south wales was arranged for 1896 visit of england first time a team other than ireland had been hosted away from racecourse encouraged by a rugby union crowd of 20 000 at cardiff arms park earlier in year faw selected ground as venue in hope of attracting a similar number however match proved to be a let down both on and off pitch despite organising free train travel for supporters in north wales only 5 000 attended game which ended in a crushing 9 1 defeat for wales faw instead turned its attention back to north wales with bangor initially scheduled to host ireland in 1898 however a late change of venue led to match being moved to oval in llandudno instead wales would return to site two years later with a crowd of 6 000 attending a second fixture against ireland in 1900 when match began only 4 000 spectators were at ground but noise generated by crowd attracted interest from town as game continued and boosted initial attendance moving south and pre war success 1900 1945 in 1902 wales returned to arms park to face ireland before meeting england at racecourse following month match against england which ended in a goalless draw attracted a record crowd for wales of around 10 000 as such when only home fixture played in 1903 was awarded to arms park 25 clubs from north wales area penned a letter of complaint to faw and requested a general meeting with governing body decision ultimately stood and a crowd of 6 000 witnessed a 1 0 defeat to scotland wales matches were becoming highly sought after and bangor looked to bring side back to town by offering purpose built stands at town s cricket ground to host 1904 match with ireland however crowd control issues proved problematic again in town as large numbers of spectators were able to circumvent measures taken to stop them viewing game for free by watching from several nearby vantage points including roof of a local school and along a road that overlooked ground bangor subsequently made a loss of ps17 from crowd of just over 4 000 and has not hosted an international fixture since wales meeting with england in 1906 was held at arms park and attracted a record crowd of around 20 000 as wales were defeated 1 0 this coupled with relatively low crowds for recent matches in wrexham led faw to look for further venues in south of country with ireland being hosted at athletic ground in rhondda mining town of aberdare workers in local collieries started work an hour early on day in order to reach match on time and a large crowd rewarded faw s decision arms park in cardiff was used again in 1910 for a match against england but emergence of cardiff city as a professional football club and construction of their purpose built football ground ninian park meant match was last wales international held at a rugby ground until 1989 ninian park hosted its first international fixture on 6 march 1911 against scotland ground had been constructed on site of a former rubbish tip and pitch often became littered with debris that rose to surface although attempts were made ahead of each match to clear surface fixture proved costly for scottish player peter mcwilliam who suffered a gash to his leg from a piece of glass that ended his playing career wales billy meredith also suffered a cut to his knee during game ninian park and racecourse ground continued to alternate fixtures until outbreak of first world war thumb upright 200px vetch field hosted its first international fixture in 1921 post war ninian park hosted wales first competitive internationals and in april 1921 vetch field hosted its first international with visit of ireland racecourse and ninian park became main venues for national side following first world war although despite welsh clubs such as cardiff city and swansea town attracting record crowds on a regular basis national side struggled to attract a similar attention during 1920s faw even put forward a proposal to move a home fixture to manchester or liverpool in hope of earning more money from a larger crowd although they were eventually dissuaded by representatives from wrexham a restructuring of side under manager coach ted robbins and a switch to midweek fixtures which allowed wales players to be released by their club teams on a more regular basis triggered a resurgence during 1930s side went on to win 1932 33 british home championship with newly refurbished racecourse attracting 25 000 fans for a goalless draw with england a record crowd in north wales wales retained championship following year and another record crowd of 40 000 saw wales defeat scotland 3 2 at ninian park in first match held in city for four years robbins had been reluctant to sanction a match in cardiff due to his belief that faw could earn more in north of country but pressure from western mail reporter harry ditton and promise of a free publicity campaign had eventually convinced robbins to agree visit of england in september 1934 became first wales home fixture to surpass 50 000 spectators and increased crowds at ninian park resulted in venue becoming favoured choice for wales biggest matches this was despite main grandstand at ground being burnt down in january 1937 when thieves used explosives to gain entry to a safe in order to steal gate receipts from an fa cup fixture when competitive football was halted during second world war wales continued to play unofficial war time fixtures against england and met neighbouring nation eight times during hostilities with all but one fixture being held at ninian park world cup qualification to low points 1946 1990 for wales first official post war international side returned to racecourse in october 1946 return of football proved a great attraction for public and match was an all ticket affair selling out before day of match after returning to ninian park following year side was scheduled to play at vetch field in swansea for first time since 1928 for a match against northern ireland faw however moved match to racecourse after claiming that appropriate authorities at swansea had not found it convenient to meet with wishes of council post war crowds continued to see large numbers of fans attending international fixtures with added incentive of british home championship now providing qualification to fifa world cup racecourse hosted more than 30 000 for first time in 1946 and ninian park more than 60 000 in 1950 previous year ninian park had played host to first foreign international side to visit wales when belgium were defeated 5 1 with trevor ford scoring a hat trick both portugal and switzerland travelled to wales to play friendlies soon after thumb upright john charles at ninian park ahead of a match against scotland in 1954 in 1952 wales returned to vetch field for first time in nearly 25 years to play northern ireland in final match of 1951 52 british home championship first post war match to be held away from cardiff or wrexham match was seen as a homecoming for a side containing numerous players who hailed from area including ford ivor allchurch and ray daniel with allchurch contributing a goal during a 3 0 victory in november 1955 wales met austria at racecourse having played side a year before in vienna in first match austria had been taken by surprise by rough play of welsh forwards ford and derek tapscott a style of play not commonplace in europe in response austrian side had looked to match wales physically in return fixture which was dubbed battle of wrexham due to nature of game austria claimed a 2 1 victory with wales roy paul later describing team s dressing room after game our goalkeeper jack kelsey had scars on both legs derek tapscott had a six inch gash on his knee john charles leaned over his brother melvyn with tears in his eyes melvyn lay silent still dazed by a tackle which had sent him crashing to ground western mail labelled match as a disgrace and one austrian player described game as more like a boxing and kicking match than football despite a positive start to their qualifying campaign for 1958 fifa world cup defeating czechoslovakia at ninian park during their opening game wales ultimately finished second in its group however when political status of israel prompted several sides to refuse to play against nation wales were handed a new chance of qualifying with fifa rules decreeing that a team could not qualify for a world cup without playing a fixture in a two legged play off wales defeated israel 4 0 on aggregate with home tie being held at ninian park to qualify for finals of tournament at tournament wales reached quarter finals where they were defeated by brazil team s exploits at world cup resulted in increased interest in side and in october 1959 a year after world cup a crowd of 62 634 watched a 1 1 draw with england at ninian park attendance was a record for a wales home international that stood for more than 40 years and was highest attendance ever recorded at ninian park high attendance figures continued into early 1960s with next visit of england in 1961 attracting a similar crowd of 61 566 steady decline in fortunes suffered by side in mid 1960s resulted in crowd numbers falling dramatically as wales struggled a 4 1 victory over greece at ninian park in march 1965 attracted only 11 159 spectators lowest post war crowd at ground since before second world war and following year only 4 616 fans attended a world cup qualifying match against denmark at racecourse lowest crowd ever recorded for a wales world cup qualification match although crowd numbers improved slightly in early 1970s interest in fixtures against neighbouring england still attracted considerable numbers of fans with three fixtures at ninian park at start of decade being attended by more than 30 000 each time with swansea city struggling financially faw secretary trevor morris sought to help club by holding wales matches at vetch field between 1970 and 1974 ground hosted more international matches in quick succession than ever before with four matches more than racecourse including world cup and european championship qualifiers against czechoslovakia finland and luxembourg racecourse was however chosen to host wales crucial final group match against austria during qualifying for uefa euro 1976 two teams entered fixture tied on seven points and prior to match traditional british anthem god save queen was dropped for first time in side s history with only welsh anthem hen wlad fy nhadau being played god save queen would later return for several fixtures but would eventually be dropped permanently a goal from griffiths secured a 1 0 victory for wales resulting in side reaching quarter finals although for this edition of european championships they were played as two legged encounters on a home and away basis rather than as part of finals wales next fixture was a centenary match against england to celebrate 100 year anniversary of welsh national side s first international fixture which saw 21 000 fans witness a 2 1 defeat at racecourse wales were drawn against yugoslavia for euro 1976 quarter finals losing first leg 2 0 in zagreb second leg was billed as one of biggest matches in wales history and faw which had become increasingly short of funds considered an offer to move match to wembley stadium in london in a bid to maximise profit faw board remained split after a vote leaving decision in hands of president terry squire who chose ninian park as venue east german referee rudi glockner was appointed for match and was infuriated when flag of his home nation was not raised ahead of game glockner awarded yugoslavia a penalty in first half and disallowed a goal for wales in second as increasingly irate crowd made several attempts to enter field of play missiles were aimed at glockner for remainder of match which ended in a 1 1 draw eliminating wales from competition violence flared up again at final whistle glockner required a police escort from pitch yugoslavia midfielder jerkovic entered into a physical altercation with a welsh fan who had run onto pitch and another welsh fan was arrested after a corner flag thrown in anger at referee struck a policeman in neck scenes against yugoslavia prompted widespread condemnation from footballing community and wales were initially issued with a two year ban from international football although this was later reduced to a fine of 20 000 swiss francs and home qualifying matches for uefa euro 1980 being played at least 200 km from cardiff wales next fixture was a 2 0 friendly defeat to west germany at ninian park in october 1976 that attracted only 14 000 people despite opposition being reigning world cup holders in response trevor morris questioned viability of ninian park as an international venue in future wales would not return to cardiff for nearly two years although decision was partly taken out of faw s hands when safety of sports grounds act was introduced in 1977 revoking public safety certificates of both ninian park and racecourse which severely reduced capacity of both as a result of restrictions and with possibility of a large return for gate receipts visit of scotland in october 1977 was moved to anfield in liverpool by faw becoming first welsh home fixture held outside country in side s history despite promises to contrary wales fans ended up outnumbered at a perceived home fixture after system to sell tickets was exploited by scottish fans who travelled to wales to bulk buy them in advance numerous welsh fans also lost their tickets in muggings outside ground and even faw president terry squire lost his ticket to a pickpocket scotland midfielder lou macari later claimed that decision to move fixture outside wales had undoubtedly benefited scots who won 2 0 remarking if welsh fa had not moved game then history may have been oh so different thumb left upright ninian park pictured in 2005 hosted 62 634 fans for a match against england in 1959 a record which stood for more than 40 years wales next home fixture returned to ninian park where ongoing safety improvements had allowed for 25 000 fans to attend a match against england punishment enforced by uefa was further reduced to only two euro 1980 qualifiers being played away from cardiff matches against malta and turkey at end of 1978 side s next fixture against west germany was now outside ban but had originally been scheduled at racecourse before ban was reduced wrexham officials initiated a ticket sales drive for turkey match in an attempt to convince faw to remain at ground with 12 000 proving sufficient to keep fixture faw made a record ps100 000 profit from west germany match with a crowd of 30 000 attending fixture although majority of income came from newly negotiated commercial and broadcasting deals start of 1980s witnessed sporadic crowd numbers for national side football hooliganism proved rife as club rivalries were carried over into international matches including between fans of rival welsh sides cardiff city and swansea city wales manager mike england was heavily critical of his side s supporters on occasion and matches were frequently moved between grounds in hope of finding more interest trevor morris favoured matches at vetch field after voicing his frustration at low crowds at ninian park and racecourse including wales 3 0 over northern ireland in may 1982 which attracted a post war low crowd of only 2 315 in 1984 british home championship was abolished after 100 years of competition with falling crowd numbers being cited as one of main reasons decision cost faw one of its main revenue streams organisation lost around ps80 000 in tv broadcasting rights alone wales final match in competition was a 1 1 draw with northern ireland at vetch field which was attended by 7 845 spectators wales enjoyed a much improved qualifying campaign for 1986 fifa world cup and entered final two matches with a chance of reaching tournament finals a 3 0 victory over spain at racecourse left wales tied with scotland with one match to play two sides were due to meet in final fixture victory over spain was wales eighth consecutive match unbeaten at racecourse and majority of welsh players were keen to return to north wales for deciding fixture however faw which was experiencing severe financial difficulties had hoped to earn biggest possible income from match and surprisingly announced national stadium new home for welsh rugby union side built at site of arms park as venue welsh rugby union wru had initially agreed to deal but eventually reneged on its decision after becoming concerned over potential hooliganism instead faw chose ninian park as venue for match which could host 12 000 more spectators than racecourse at time needing a win wales could only manage a 1 1 draw with scots ultimately missing out on qualification match was overshadowed by death of scotland manager jock stein who collapsed on touchline during aftermath of his side s equalising goal after suffering a heart attack ps200 000 generated from two fixtures effectively kept faw solvent for following few years despite its financial issues faw donated its gate receipts from a friendly with sweden in april 1989 to a benefit fund for victims of hillsborough disaster swansea city were also suffering from

iceland at ninian park faw pushed ahead with developing ground for future matches installing floodlights at a cost of ps400 000 from a grant provided by football trust following year wales played romania in a crucial qualifying match for 1994 fifa world cup needing a win to reach finals however side suffered its first loss at site of national stadium since its original incarnation in 1910 match was marred by death of a welsh supporter after being struck by a marine flare fired from opposite side of ground in late 1990s plans for redevelopment of national stadium were being considered following publication of taylor report capacity of ground had decreased and wru became concerned that ground was being overshadowed by other rugby venues such as twickenham and murrayfield when work began national side was forced to look for another venue ninian park hosted a friendly against jamaica but faw were reluctant to host qualifying matches for uefa euro 2000 at ground due to its limited seating capacity despite welsh players voting for ninian park to be chosen faw decided to move a match against italy and denmark following year to anfield in 1998 in order to maximise revenue wales returned to ninian park for side s next fixture a 3 2 victory over belarus in a match that proved to be final international fixture held at ground having hosted 88 matches in 88 years victory over belarus saw welsh team lobby faw to host match against denmark at ninian park although faw agreed danish authorities complained to uefa that they should receive same treatment as italians in order to bring their planned 4 000 fans who could not be accommodated at ninian park decision to move tie was slammed by wales assistant manager graham williams who labelled it as shocking and faw president john owen hughes who commented they are entitled to 10 per cent of a stadium s capacity not a set figure despite wales resistance to move match eventually went ahead at anfield with danes winning 2 0
