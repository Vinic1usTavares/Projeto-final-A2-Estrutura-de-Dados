encounters resulting in destruction of enemy aircraft achieved in 93 combat missions he recorded 56 victories at night including 33 mosquitos and scored more aerial victories from a jet fighter aircraft than anyone else in world war ii and possibly in aviation history however this score is a matter of controversy research of royal air force losses suggests welter mosquito victories considerably welter was born in cologne lindenthal on 25 february 1916 he joined military service of luftwaffe in 1934 and was trained as a pilot he showed a strong natural ability as a pilot and was subsequently selected for flight instructor training and served many years as a flight instructor in 1943 welter transferred to an operational night fighter unit flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft on 18 october 1944 after 40 combat missions welter was awarded knight s cross of iron cross in early 1945 welter transferred to an experimental jet night fighter unit flying messerschmitt me 262 on 11 march 1945 he was awarded knight s cross of iron cross with oak leaves for 48 aerial victories welter survived war and was killed in an accident at a railroad crossing on 7 march 1949 biography welter was born on 25 february 1916 in cologne lindenthal following schooling and completing a merchant apprenticeship he joined luftwaffe on 1 october 1934 and was trained as a pilot because of his skill as a pilot he was trained as a flight instructor during world war ii welter was promoted to feldwebel on 1 august 1940 and transferred to flight training school flieger regiment 63 and later on to flight instructor school at here welter served as a flight instructor until 10 august 1943 when he was transferred to 10 school for instrument flight training in altenburg with rank of oberfeldwebel as a night fighter instructor on 2 september 1943 welter was transferred to 5 staffel 5th squadron of jagdgeschwader 301 jg 301 a night fighter squadron that experimented with use of largely radar less single seat focke wulf fw 190a 5 and fw 190a 6 fighter aircraft by night often equipped with fug 350 naxos radar detector used in form of german night fighter operations without ai radar due to duppel interference from raf bomber command aircraft these free ranging interception operations were called wilde sau wild boar on his first wilde sau intercept mission against allied bombers on night of 22 september 1943 welter shot down two allied four engine bombers he shot down a further two on his third mission on night of 3 october 1943 by beginning of april he had accumulated 17 victories in only 15 missions subsequently on 10 may 1944 welter was awarded german cross in gold leutnant welter was transferred to 5 staffel jagdgeschwader 300 jg 300 on 7 july 1944 in july welter claimed two united states army air forces usaaf boeing b 17 flying fortress four engined bombers and three north american p 51 mustangs two of which claimed on 19 july between munich and memmingen shot down by day from 25 july 1944 welter served with 1 staffel 10 10 performing further wilde sau missions he claimed four royal air force raf avro lancaster four engine heavy bombers shot down on night of 29 august 1944 to record his 24th through 27th victories welter transferred to 10 jg 300 on 4 september 1944 10 staffel jg 300 was established to counter intrusions by raf s fast de havilland mosquito twin engined bombers flying specially optimized for speed messerschmitt bf 109g 6 as fighters in september welter claimed seven mosquitos downed including one by ramming it is thought that during his service with 1 njg 10 and 10 jg 300 welter recorded 12 victories in only 18 missions on night of 19 september 1944 according to hinchliffe welter may have shot down wing commander guy gibson who was leading a 300 bomber attack on monchengladbach and rheydt gibson s mosquito crashed near steenbergen in netherlands welter was only german pilot to have claimed a mosquito claim is unlikely welter submitted his victory claim north of wittenberg in eastern germany some hundreds of miles away from place gibson s mosquito was found recent research suggests that his victim was mosquito vi serial of no 23 squadron raf which was shot down at west of bad holzminden crew f o k eastwood and navigator f l g g rogers were both killed welter was awarded knight s cross of iron cross on 18 october 1944 for 33 victories in just 40 missions flying messerschmitt me 262 thumb left neptun radar equipped me 262b 1a u1 in south african national museum of military history alt a twin

white number 305 is visible on nose of aircraft on 2 november 1944 welter was transferred to ii gruppe nachtjagdgeschwader 11 njg 11 a reformation of his former unit here he was given command of a special kommando subordinate to ii njg 11 set up on 11 november 1944 at erprobungsstelle s southern airbase 2 november 1944 28 january 1945 and dedicated to performing nocturnal interception with messerschmitt me 262 jet fighter of raf mosquitos attacking berlin area according to some sources oberleutnant welter added a lancaster to his growing list of mosquitos on night of 12 december 1944 first night victory by a jet fighter other sources state that his first aerial victory flying me 262 was claimed either on night of 2 january 1945 or 5 january 1945 on 28 january 1945 unit initially known as sonderkommando stamp named after its founder major gerhard stamp and then sonderkommando welter was re designated 10 staffel njg 11 and transferred to airfield at burg near magdeburg 28 january 1945 12 april 1945 unit was equipped with me 262 jet fighters and tasked with intercepting mosquito bomber aircraft of no 8 group raf in berlin area me 262 were not fitted with radar and used aid of ground control and searchlight defences partially a wilde sau form of night combat welter had claimed three aerial victories while flying me 262 by early february 1945 thereafter welter made a string of questionable air combat claims against mosquito aircraft in berlin area three on night of 21 february 1945 no mosquitoes recorded lost according to a comprehensive documentary survey by boiten and mackenzie 2008 losses described in this section relate only to mosquitos tasked with attacking berlin or magdeburg and exclude attrition due to non combat accidents aircraft known to have crashed well outside of berlin area of operations or attrition due to causes other than fighter attack and another three on night of 2 march 1945 one mosquito damaged in aerial combat 10 njg 11 made further claims against mosquito aircraft attacking berlin on nights of 21 march 1945 three claims one mosquito lost 23 march 1945 three claims one mosquito lost another damaged in aerial combat 24 march 1945 two claims one mosquito damaged in aerial combat 27 march 1945 two claims two mosquitos lost 30 march 1945 four claims one mosquito lost and another damaged in aerial combat 2 april 1945 one claim one mosquito lost 3 april 1945 two claims one mosquito lost and another damaged in aerial combat and 19 april 1945 two claims no mosquitos lost last known aerial combat claim by welter occurred on night of 3 april 1945 when a mosquito of no 139 squadron raf was shot down over berlin welter was awarded knight s cross of iron cross with oak leaves on 11 march 1945 for 48 victories controversy over aerial victories much of controversy surrounding welter s claims for success in nocturnal aerial combat with me 262 stems from a memorandum written by welter on 29 may 1945 for his british captors in this memorandum welter stated that between december 1944 and end of january 1945 as sole pilot of kommando welter he flew seven me 262 sorties and achieved three victories against mosquito aircraft and two victories against lancaster aircraft welter further stated that from formation of 10 njg 11 on 28 january 1945 to end of war 10 njg 11 flew around another 63 operational sorties and claimed a further 38 victories against mosquito aircraft at night and five victories against mosquito aircraft by day his share being 20 mosquitos at night and two during day thus according to memo a total of 25 mosquitoes and two lancasters were claimed in aerial combat by welter flying me 262 with kommando staffel while other pilots of staffel claimed a further 21 kills of which three were achieved with two seater me 262 official luftwaffe documents show that by 4 april 1945 10 njg 11 had claimed 34 aerial victories of which only one was claimed in a two seater me 262 according to boiten and mackenzie 2008 a radar equipped me 262b 1a u1 two seater night fighter flown by lt herbert and his radar operator unteroffizier was first used operationally on night of 27 march 1945 and was never flown in combat by welter research of raf records show that at most 15 mosquitoes could have been possibly destroyed by kommando welter 10 njg 11 officially kurt welter was credited with 63 victories in 93 missions of which 56 victories were achieved at night and seven by day among his claimed 63 victories are up to 33 mosquitos thus there remains some controversy about exact number of victories achieved while flying me 262 with only three of mosquito kills coinciding with raf records rest might be overclaiming post war welter survived war and was employed at a sugar factory he was killed on 7 march 1949 in leck in schleswig holstein waiting at a level crossing when logs falling from an improperly loaded passing train crushed his car summary of career aerial
