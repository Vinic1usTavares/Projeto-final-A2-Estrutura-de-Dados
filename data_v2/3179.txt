lobaria pulmonaria is a large epiphytic lichen consisting of an ascomycete fungus and a green algal partner living together in a symbiotic relationship with a a symbiosis involving members of three kingdoms of organisms commonly known by various names like tree lungwort lung lichen lung moss lungwort lichen oak lungs or oak lungwort it is sensitive to air pollution and is also harmed by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices its population has declined across europe and l pulmonaria is considered endangered in many lowland areas species has a history of use in herbal medicines and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts description left thumb detail of thallus soredia and isidia may be seen on ridges and margins in full magnification it is a foliose lichen and its leaf like thallus is green leathery and lobed with a pattern of ridges and depressions on upper surface bright green under moist conditions it becomes brownish and papery when dry this species often has a fine layers of hairs a tomentum on its lower surface cortex outer protective layer on thallus surface is roughly comparable to epidermis of a green plant thallus is typically in diameter with individual lobes wide and up to 7 cm long asexual reproductive structures soredia and isidia are present on thallus surface minute 0 5 1 5 mm in diameter cephalodia pockets of cyanobacteria are often present on lower surface of thallus these spots are conspicuously darker than green surface of thallus like other foliose lichens thallus is only loosely attached to surface on which it grows photobionts thallus contains internal structures known as cephalodia characteristic of three membered lichen symbioses involving two photobionts photosynthetic symbionts in fungal algal lichen relationship these internal cephalodia found between ribs of thallus surface arise when blue green algae from genus nostoc on thallus surface are enveloped during growth structurally cephalodia consist of dense aggregates of nostoc cells surrounded by thin walled hyphae this delimits them from rest of thallus which contains a loose structure of thick walled hyphae blue green cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen enhancing nutrient availability for lichen other photobiont of l pulmonaria is green algae reticulata reproduction l pulmonaria has ability to form both vegetative propagation and sexual propagules at an age of about 25 years scheidegger c walser jc 1998 reintroduction and augmentation of populations of endangered lobaria pulmonaria methods and concepts in lichens as indicators of primeval forests of eastern carpathians eds s b pp 33 52 ukrainian centre kiev in sexual reproduction species produces small reddish brown discs known as apothecia containing asci from which spores are forcibly released into air like based on studies of germination it has been suggested that l pulmonaria spores use some mechanism to inhibit germination inhibition is lifted when spores are grown in a synthetic growth medium containing an like bovine serum albumin or a dispersal by vegetative propagules via soredia or isidia has been determined as predominant mode of reproduction in l pulmonaria in this method protruding propagules become dry and brittle during regular wet dry cycles of lichen and can easily crumble off thallus these fragments may develop into new thalli either at same locale or at a new site after dispersal by wind or rain a number of steps are required for development of vegetative propagules including degeneration of thallus cortex replication of green algal cells and entanglement of fungal hyphae with green algal cells this steps lead to an increase in internal pressure which eventually breaks through cortex continued growth leads to these granules being pushed upwards and out of thallus surface distribution and habitat thumb right in schwabisch frankische germany it has a wide distribution in europe asia north america and africa preferring damp habitats with high rainfall especially coastal areas it is most widely distributed and most common lobaria species in north america associated with old growth forests its presence and abundance may be used as an indicator of forest age at least in interior cedar hemlock biogeoclimatic zone in eastern british columbia it is also found in pasture woodlands it usually grows on bark of broad leaved trees such as oak beech and maple but will also grow on rocks in laboratory l pulmonaria has been grown on nylon microfilaments various environmental factors are thought to affect distribution of l pulmonaria such as temperature moisture average humidity rapidity and frequency of wet dry cycles sunlight exposure and levels of air pollution attempts to quantitatively evaluate contribution of these factors to lichen growth is difficult because differences in original environment from which lichen thalli are collected will greatly affect heat and desiccation tolerances due to declining population l pulmonaria is considered to be rare or threatened in many parts of world especially in lowland areas of europe scheidegger c clerc p dietrich m

geneve 124 s decline has been attributed to industrial forestry and air pollution particularly acid rain l pulmonaria like other lichens containing a blue green algal component are particularly susceptible to effects of acid rain because subsequent decrease in ph reduces nitrogen fixation through inhibition of algal nitrogenase enzyme chemical compounds l pulmonaria is known to contain a variety of acids common to lichens such as stictic acid stictic acid acid acid acid acid and acid these compounds collectively known as are known to be involved in defense against grazing herbivores like lichen feeding molluscs it also contains sugar alcohols d volemitol in addition to several carotenoids total content 10 mg kg such as alpha carotene beta carotene and beta upper cortex of lichen contains melanins that screen uv and par radiation from photobiont synthesis of melanin pigments in lichen increases in response to greater solar irradiation and shade adapted thalli are greenish grey in air dry state while sun exposed thalli can be dark brown in color this adaptation helps protect d reticulata known to be relatively intolerant to high light levels also known to be present are various steroids namely ergosterol and uses medicinal its shape somewhat resembles tissue inside lungs and therefore it is thought to be a remedy for lung diseases based on doctrine of signatures lichen s common english names are derived from this association gerard s book herball or general historie of plants 1597 recommends l pulmonaria as medicinally valuable it is still used for asthma urinary incontinence and lack of appetite in india it is used as a traditional medicine to treat hemorrhages and eczema and it is used as a remedy for coughing up blood by in british columbia canada an survey of high region in central southern italy revealed that l pulmonaria is used as an antiseptic and is rubbed on wounds a hot water extract prepared using this species has been shown to have anti inflammatory and ulcer preventing activities also methanol extracts were shown to have a protective effect on gastrointestinal system of rats possibly by reducing oxidative stress and reducing inflammatory effects of neutrophils furthermore methanol extracts also have potent antioxidative activity and reducing power probably due to presence of phenolic compounds other uses l pulmonaria has also been used to produce an orange dye for wool in tanning of leather in manufacture of perfumes and as an ingredient in brewing references external links university of british columbia botany photo
