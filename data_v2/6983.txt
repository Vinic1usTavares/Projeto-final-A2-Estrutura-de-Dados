battle of coral sea fought from 4 8 may 1942 was a major naval battle between imperial japanese navy ijn and naval and air forces from united states and australia taking place in pacific theatre of world war ii battle is historically significant as first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other as well as first in which opposing ships neither sighted nor fired directly upon one another in an attempt to strengthen their defensive position in south pacific japanese decided to invade and occupy port moresby in new guinea and tulagi in southeastern solomon islands plan to accomplish this was called operation mo and involved several major units of japan s combined fleet these included two fleet carriers and a light carrier to provide air cover for invasion forces it was under overall command of japanese admiral shigeyoshi inoue u s learned of japanese plan through signals intelligence and sent two united states navy carrier task forces and a joint australian u s cruiser force to oppose offensive these were under overall command of u s admiral frank j fletcher on 3 4 may japanese forces successfully invaded and occupied tulagi although several of their supporting warships were sunk or damaged in surprise attacks by aircraft from u s fleet carrier now aware of presence of u s carriers in area japanese fleet carriers advanced towards coral sea with intention of locating and destroying allied naval forces on evening of 6 may direction chosen for air searches by opposing commanders brought two carrier forces to within of each other unbeknownst to both sides beginning on 7 may carrier forces from two sides engaged in airstrikes over two consecutive days on first day both forces mistakenly believed they were attacking their opponent s fleet carriers but were actually attacking other units with u s sinking japanese light carrier while japanese sank a u s destroyer and heavily damaged a fleet oiler which was later scuttled next day fleet carriers found and engaged each other with japanese fleet carrier heavily damaged u s fleet carrier critically damaged and later scuttled and yorktown damaged with both sides having suffered heavy losses in aircraft and carriers damaged or sunk two forces disengaged and retired from battle area because of loss of carrier air cover inoue recalled port moresby invasion fleet intending to try again later although a tactical victory for japanese in terms of ships sunk battle would prove to be a strategic victory for allies for several reasons battle marked first time since start of war that a major japanese advance had been checked by allies more importantly japanese fleet carriers shokaku and former damaged and latter with a depleted aircraft complement were unable to participate in battle of midway following month while yorktown did participate ensuring a rough parity in aircraft between two adversaries and contributing significantly to u s victory in that battle severe losses in carriers at midway prevented japanese from to invade port moresby from ocean and helped prompt their ill fated land offensive over kokoda track two months later allies took advantage of japan s resulting strategic vulnerability in south pacific and launched guadalcanal campaign this along with new guinea campaign eventually broke japanese defenses in south pacific and was a significant contributing factor to japan s ultimate surrender in world war ii background japanese expansion thumb left japanese advances in southwest pacific from december 1941 to april 1942 on december 8 1941 december 7 us time japan declared war on us and british empire after japanese forces attacked malaya singapore and hong kong as well as us naval base at pearl harbor in launching this war japanese leaders sought to neutralize u s fleet seize territory rich in natural resources and obtain strategic military bases to defend their far flung empire in words of imperial japanese navy ijn combined fleet s secret order number one dated 1 november 1941 goals of initial japanese campaigns in impending war were to eject british and american strength from netherlands indies and philippines and to establish a policy of autonomous self sufficiency and economic independence parker p 3 see also millot pp 12 13 to support these goals during first few months of 1942 besides malaya japanese forces attacked and successfully took control of philippines singapore dutch east indies wake island new britain gilbert islands and guam inflicting heavy losses on opposing allied land naval and air forces japan planned to use these conquered territories to establish a perimeter defense for its empire from which it expected to employ attritional tactics to defeat or exhaust any allied counterattacks

this still left at least two more u s navy carriers enterprise and hornet which could help defend midway aircraft complement of u s carriers was larger than that of their japanese counterparts which when combined with land based aircraft at midway meant that combined fleet no longer enjoyed a significant numerical aircraft superiority over u s navy for impending battle in fact u s would have

to repair yorktown put to sea only 48 hours after entering drydock at pearl harbor which meant that she was available for next confrontation with japanese at midway yorktowns aircraft played crucial roles in sinking two japanese fleet carriers yorktown also absorbed both japanese aerial counterattacks at midway which otherwise would have been directed at enterprise and hornet parshall pp 63 67

employ maximum forces available for midway japanese apparently did not even consider trying to include zuikaku in operation no effort appears to have been made to combine surviving shokaku aircrews with zuikakus air groups or to quickly provide zuikaku with replacement aircraft so she could participate with rest of combined fleet at midway shokaku herself was unable to conduct further aircraft operations with her flight deck heavily damaged and she required almost three months of repair in japan historians h p willmott jonathan parshall and anthony tully believe yamamoto made a significant strategic error in his decision to support mo with strategic assets since yamamoto had decided decisive battle with u s was to take place at midway he should not have diverted any of his important assets especially fleet carriers to a secondary operation like mo yamamoto s decision meant japanese naval forces were weakened just enough at both coral sea and midway battles to allow allies to defeat them in detail willmott adds if either operation was important enough to commit fleet carriers then all of japanese carriers should have been committed to each in order to ensure success by committing crucial assets to mo yamamoto made more important midway operation dependent on secondary operation s success willmott 1982 pp 459 460 parshall pp 58 59 moreover yamamoto apparently missed other implications of coral sea battle unexpected appearance of u s carriers in exactly right place and time due to cryptanalysis to effectively contest japanese and u s navy carrier aircrews demonstrating sufficient skill and determination to do significant damage to japanese carrier forces these would be repeated at midway for same reason and as a result japan lost four fleet carriers core of her naval offensive forces and thereby lost strategic initiative in pacific war parshall and tully point out that due to u s industrial strength once japan lost its numerical superiority in carrier forces as a result of midway japan could never regain it parshall and tully add battle of coral sea had provided first hints that japanese high water mark had been reached but it was battle of midway that put up sign for all to see parshall pp 63 67 58 59 430 ito p 59 lundstrom 2006 p 222 situation in south pacific australians and u s forces in australia were initially disappointed with outcome of battle of coral sea fearing mo operation was precursor to an invasion of australian mainland and setback to japan was only temporary in a meeting held in late may australian advisory war council described battle s result as rather disappointing given that allies had advance notice of japanese intentions general macarthur provided australian prime minister john curtin with his assessment of battle stating that all elements that have produced disaster in western pacific since beginning of war were still present as japanese forces could strike anywhere if supported by major

kokoda track on 21 july from buna and gona by then allies had reinforced new guinea with additional troops primarily australian starting with australian 14th brigade which embarked at townsville on 15

from this base japanese would threaten shipping supply routes to australia to prevent this from occurring u s chose tulagi and nearby guadalcanal as target of their first offensive failure of japanese to take port moresby and their defeat at midway had effect of dangling their base at tulagi and guadalcanal without effective protection from other japanese bases tulagi and guadalcanal were four

of operation galvanic new type of naval warfare battle was first naval engagement in history in which participating ships never sighted or fired directly at each other instead manned aircraft acted as offensive artillery for ships involved thus respective commanders were participating in a new type of warfare carrier versus carrier with which neither had any experience in h p s words commanders had to contend with uncertain and poor communications in situations in which area of battle had grown far beyond that prescribed by past experience but in which speeds had increased to an even greater extent thereby compressing decision making time because of greater speed with which decisions were required japanese were at a disadvantage as inoue was too far away at rabaul to effectively direct his naval forces in real time in contrast to fletcher who was on scene with his carriers japanese admirals involved were often slow to communicate important information to one another willmott 2002 pp

models to estimate impact of various alternatives for example suppose u s carriers had chosen to sail separately though still nearby rather than together models indicated americans would have suffered slightly less total damage with one ship sunk but other unharmed however battle s overall outcome would have been similar by contrast suppose one side had located its opponent early enough to launch a first strike so that only opponent s survivors could have struck back modeling suggested striking first would have provided a decisive advantage even more beneficial than having an extra carrier experienced japanese carrier aircrews performed better than those of u s achieving greater results with an equivalent number of aircraft japanese attack on u s carriers on 8 may was better coordinated than u s attack on japanese carriers japanese suffered much higher losses to their carrier aircrews losing ninety aircrew killed in battle compared with thirty five for u s side japan s cadre of highly skilled carrier aircrews with which it began war were in effect irreplaceable because of an institutionalised limitation in its training programs and absence of a pool of experienced reserves or advanced training programs for new airmen coral sea started a trend which resulted in irreparable attrition of japan s veteran carrier aircrews by end of october 1942 wilmott 1983 pp 286 287 515
