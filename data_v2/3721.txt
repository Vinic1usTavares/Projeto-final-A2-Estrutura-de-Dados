everywhere with festivities for first time in prussian history queen emerged as a celebrated public personality in her own right as she occupied a much more prominent role than her predecessors louise s presence on her husband s eastern journey was a break from traditional role of consort importantly however queen s power and enduring legacy did not stem from holding a separate court and policy than her husband s but rather opposite she subordinated her formidable intelligence and skill for her husband s sole advantage clark pp 317 18 she also became a fashion icon for instance starting a trend by wearing a neckerchief to keep from getting ill clark p 317 left thumb an elisabeth vigee lebrun painting of queen louise c 1801 after her husband s accession louise developed many ties to

developments at court and from very beginning of his reign new king consulted louise on matters of state clark p 217 frederick william was hesitant and cautious and hated war stating in 1798 i abhor war and know of nothing greater on earth than preservation of peace and tranquility as only system suited to happiness of human kind clark pp 298 99 in keeping with later foreign policy of his father s frederick william favored neutrality during early years of conflict with revolutionary french first republic which evolved into napoleonic wars 1803 15 he refused various pressures to pick a side in war of second coalition louise supported this view warning that if prussia were to side with coalition powers of austria great britain and russia it would lead to dependence on latter power for military support clark p 299 she foresaw that because prussia was by far weakest of great powers and it would not have been able to ensure it benefited from results of such an alliance french aggression caused king to eventually consider entering wars but his indecision prevented him from choosing a side either france or coalition powers he consulted many differing opinions of queen louise and his ministers and was eventually compelled into an alliance with napoleon who was recently victorious from battle of austerlitz 1805 clark pp 301 02 right thumb queen louise with her husband and

government clark p 303 he prepared a document for king detailing in strong language what administrative reforms were needed such as establishing clearer lines of responsibility among ministers this work however never reached frederick william as stein passed it first to general ernst von who in turn passed it onto queen in spring of 1806 though louise agreed with its contents she thought it too violent and passionate for king and consequently helped suppress it simms p 332 war with france among king s advisers members of his family such as queen an open advocate of war and prince louis ferdinand led militaristic faction in favor of war against france those against neutrality but in favor of reform were led by baron vom stein and karl august von hardenberg herold p 177 clark p 304 knowing temperament of king hardenberg appealed directly to queen for desired reform wisely as it turned out as frederick william viewed demands to remove his trusted advisers in kabinett as a mutiny similar to simms p 222 332 though prussia had not fought in a war since 1795 its military leaders confidently expected that they could win against napoleon s troops after a small incident concerning an anti french pamphlet occurred king frederick william was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter war against french emperor herold p 179 prussian troops began mobilizing culminating in october 1806 battle of jena auerstedt which was a disaster for prussia as ability of its armed forces to continue war were effectively wiped out king and queen had

houses according to one witness traveling with them clark p 312 after various events took place napoleon demanded from a highly superior position peace terms in what was to be called peace of tilsit 1807 clark p 309 in midst of these negotiations emperor agreed to keep half of prussia intact men were joined by queen louise frederick william had sent for his wife then pregnant with her daughter princess louise to beg for a better settlement for prussia with louise advising her husband for god s sake no shameful peace prussia should at least not go down without honor herold p 187 as king felt that her presence might put napoleon in a more relaxed mood louise reluctantly agreed to meet emperor at tilsit but only to save her prussia napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning louise s marital fidelity but queen met him anyway attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms formerly louise had regularly referred to him as monster but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with emperor whereon she threw herself at his feet herold p 188 though he was impressed by her grace and determination napoleon refused to make any concessions writing back to his wife empress josephine that louise is really charming and full of toward me but don t be jealous it would cost me too dearly to play gallant clark p 310

for her admiration of future generations right thumb queen louise in a riding habit c 1810 by wilhelm remaining years harsh restrictions were imposed on prussia such as a massive indemnity of one hundred and twenty million francs and quartering of troops at time one hundred and twenty million francs was equivalent to entire yearly budget of prussia as perceived symbol of prussia s former grandeur and pride french occupation of prussia had a particularly devastating effect upon louise as queen endured personal insults napoleon himself called her only real man in prussia fisher p 254 queen recognized that her adopted country depended on her for moral strength and as a consequence louise regained her old sense of optimism often taking time to prepare their eldest son for his future role as king in following few years louise supported reforming efforts of government carried out by stein and hardenberg as well as those of gerhard von scharnhorst and august neidhardt von gneisenau to reorganize army chisholm ed after disaster at tilsit louise was instrumental in stein s reappointment king had previously dismissed him telling frederick william stein is my last hope a great heart an encompassing mind perhaps he knows remedies that are hidden to us by 1808 it was still considered unsafe to return to berlin and royal family consequently spent summer near konigsberg louise believed that hard trials of her children s early lives would be good for them if they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be in winter of 1808 tsar

louise in park of charlottenburg berlin queen louise was revered by her subjects as soul of national virtue and some historians have written that louise was prussian nationalism personified according to christopher clark louise was a female celebrity who in mind of public combined virtue modesty and sovereign grace with kindness and sex appeal and whose early death in 1810 at age of only thirty four preserved her youth in memory of posterity her reputation as a loving and loyal supporter of her husband became crucial to her enduring legacy cult that eventually surrounded louise became

it as a hostile organization fischer p 186 significantly louise and maria theresa of austria were only two historical women used in nazi propaganda as regime felt louise was personification of womanly qualities which government was trying to integrate into german schools blackburn p 111 while queen s resistance and defiance of french kept prussian spirit alive her husband was cast as a pathetically embarrassing king who would rather have lived in peace than revenge himself on napoleon popular culture character of queen louise was popular subject of countless films released in german cinema these
