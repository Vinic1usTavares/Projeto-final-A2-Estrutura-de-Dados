persano initially adopted a cautious course of action he was unwilling to risk battle with austrian navy despite fact that austrian fleet was much weaker than his own persano claimed he was simply waiting on ironclad ram en route from britain but his inaction weakened morale in fleet with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice greene massignani pp 217 222 rear admiral wilhelm von tegetthoff brought austrian fleet to ancona on june 27 in attempt to draw out italians at time many of italian ships were in disarray several ships did not have their entire armament and several others had problems with their engines san martino was one of few ironclads fit for action so she and formed up to prepare to attack tegetthoff s ships persano held a council of war aboard principe di carignano to determine whether he should sortie to engage tegetthoff but by that time austrians had withdrawn making decision moot minister of navy agostino depretis urged persano to act and suggested island of lissa to restore italian confidence after their defeat at battle of custoza previous month on 7 july persano left ancona and conducted a sweep into adriatic but encountered no austrian ships and returned on 13th wilson pp 216 218 battle of lissa thumb upright map showing disposition of fleets on 20 july on 16 july persano took italian fleet out of ancona bound for lissa where they arrived on 18th with them they brought troop transports carrying 3 000 soldiers italian warships began bombarding austrian forts on island with intention of landing soldiers once fortresses had been silenced in response austrian navy sent fleet under tegetthoff to attack italian ships sondhaus pp 1 2 at that time san martino was assigned to 2nd division under persano along with ironclad and coastal defense ship wilson p 219 after arriving off lissa on 18th persano sent most of his ships to bombard town of vis but persano was unable to effect landing wilson p 220 next morning persano ordered another attack four ironclads would force harbor defenses at vis while san martino and rest of fleet would attempt to suppress outer fortifications this second attack also proved to be a failure but persano decided to make a third attempt next day san martino and bulk of fleet would again try to disable outer forts in preparation for landing wilson pp 222 224 before italians could begin attack dispatch boat arrived bringing news of tegetthoff s approach persano s fleet was in disarray three ships of admiral giovanni vacca s 1st division were three miles to northeast from persano s main force and three other ironclads were further away to west wilson pp 223 225 persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with vacca s first in line abreast formation and then in line ahead formation san martino was at center of italian line wilson p 232 shortly before action began persano decided to leave his flagship and transfer to affondatore though none of his subordinates on other ships were aware of change they there thus left to fight as individuals without direction more dangerously by stopping re d italia he allowed a significant gap to open up between vacca s three ships and rest of fleet wilson pp 233 tegetthoff took his fleet through gap between vacca s and persano s ships though he failed to ram any italian vessels on first pass austrians then turned back toward persano s ships and took re d italia san martino and palestro under heavy fire san martino initially engaged unarmored ships of austrian 2nd division but as re d italia became embroiled in ensuing melee san captain attempted to come to her aid though ship was unable to prevent austrian flagship from ramming and sinking her wilson pp 234 235 247 tegetthoff immediately ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up men in water but with san martino fast approaching he could not leave his ship a stationary target he instead ordered small aviso to pick up italian survivors but she too came under fire and was forced to abandon effort wilson 238 during battle san martino collided with regina maria pia and had her ram bow twisted causing leaks in her hull wilson p 245 shortly thereafter persano broke off engagement to consolidate his forces but his ships low on coal and ammunition and with badly demoralized crews could not be rallied by persano s half hearted attempt to launch an attack italian fleet began to withdraw followed by austrians as night began to fall opposing fleets disengaged completely heading for ancona and pola respectively wilson pp 238 241 250 san martino had been hit numerous times and had her side armor penetrated by one shell which did not succeed in penetrating timber backing twice during engagement ship was set on fire by austrian shells though her crew was able to put fires out after battle vacca replaced persano he was ordered to attack main austrian naval base at pola but war ended before operation could be carried out wilson p 251 later career for rest of her long career san martino served in a variety of roles both in main fleet and in italy s colonial empire ordovini et al pp 343 344 after war italian government slashed naval budget so significantly that fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack port of civitavecchia in september 1870 as part of wars of italian unification instead ships were laid up and sailors conscripted to man them were sent home gardiner p 336 some time after 1866 ship was rebuilt as a central battery ship with most of her guns located in a central armored casemate two other
