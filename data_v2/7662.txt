danube crested newt or danube newt triturus dobrogicus is a species of newt found in central and eastern europe along basin of danube river and some of its tributaries and in dnieper delta it has a smaller and more slender body than other crested newts in genus triturus but like these males develop a conspicuous jagged seam on back and tail during breeding season for half of year or longer adults live in slow flowing river margins lakes or ponds where reproduction takes place males perform a courtship display and females lay around 200 eggs individually onto leaves of aquatic plants larvae develop two to four months in water before reaching metamorphosis for remainder of year newts live in shady land habitats usually forests although not yet considered threatened danube crested newt populations have declined significantly reason being mainly habitat loss species is protected by law in european union systematics and taxonomy danube crested newt was described as a variety of northern crested newt triturus cristatus by c in 1903 later it was considered a subspecies until genetic analysis supported its recognition as a separate species in crested newt species complex northern crested newt is its likely sister species according to a molecular phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial dna analysis of nuclear dna gives however some conflicting results regarding this sister relationship separated populations from danube delta and pannonian basin see distribution and habitats were described as two subspecies t dobrogicus dobrogicus and t dobrogicus in 2000 later genetic study however did not support distinction of these two forms description measuring long in total danube crested newt is smallest crested newt species it has a more slender elongate body than other species well adapted to swimming with a narrow head and relatively short limbs this body shape has evolved through an increase in number of rib bearing vertebrae there are 16 17 of them in t dobrogicus highest number among crested newts have now recognized that crest is actually used in combat during mating season males will flick their crest at each other attempting to flick their poison at each other danube crested newt s back and sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling belly is orange to red in other crested newts it is usually yellow or orange yellow with small or medium sized black blotches that have sharp edges like all crested newts t dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between eyes and nostrils another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish white stripe along tail distribution and habitats danube crested newt is found in three allopatric areas of distribution from central to eastern europe pannonian basin from easternmost austria through czech republic small part in southeast slovakia hungary northern croatia bosnia hercegovina marginally northern serbia to east of romania and southeast of ukraine region this includes middle floodplains of danube river and some of its tributaries including drava sava and tisza lower danube and danube delta separated from pannonian basin by an area where northern crested newt occurs this central part ranges from southern romania northern bulgaria and small parts of southern moldova to odessa region of southern ukraine dnieper delta this small area of distribution in southern ukraine was reported in 2005 it is now isolated by steppe from danube basin but it has been suggested that these areas were connected through marshlands during last glacial maximum when level of black sea was around 100 metres lower than today this range may also extend to lower basins of dniester and bug rivers thumb right alt an oxbow lake surrounded by trees riparian forests of danube national park in austria harbour important populations breeding in a variety of temporarily flooded water bodies in addition to northern crested newt to north danube crested newt s range borders that of italian crested newt t carnifex in west and that of macedonian t macedonicus and balkan t crested newts in south compared to other crested newt species danube crested newt is more adapted to life along a river system and frequently occurs in flowing water and together with fish typical breeding sites are slow flowing river margins oxbow lakes flooded marshland larger ponds or ditches provided abundant underwater vegetation is available during land phase newts live in deciduous forests or groves bushlands or meadows behaviour and ecology danube crested newts have longest aquatic phase in genus triturus adults move to their breeding sites in february or march and usually stay there for six months occasionally they may even stay longer or return to water in autumn males court females with a display of ritualised body movements when they have gained female s interest they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on ground which female then takes up with her cloaca eggs are fertilised internally as in other crested newts a female lays around 200 eggs per season which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave water both in water and on land newts are largely nocturnal in their aquatic habitats they hide under vegetation and on land they use structures such as logs rocks or small animal burrows for cover they feed mainly on different invertebrates but in water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts predators include herons and other birds snakes such as grass snake and various carnivorous mammals threats and conservation population of danube crested newt has declined significantly and international union for conservation of nature has assessed its conservation status as near threatened main threat is habitat destruction by humans especially through drainage damming or pollution hybridisation with other crested newt species and a loss of breeding ponds because of decreasing spring rain in southern range possibly due to global warming are also seen as threats like other crested newts t dobrogicus is listed in berne convention appendix ii and eu habitats directive annexes ii and iv and capture disturbance killing trade and destruction of habitats are prohibited see
