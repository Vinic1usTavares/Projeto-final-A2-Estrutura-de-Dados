kaufering was a system of eleven subcamps of dachau concentration camp located around town of landsberg am lech in bavaria which operated between 18 june 1944 and 27 april 1945 previously nazi germany had deported all jews from reich but having exhausted other sources of labor jews were deported to kaufering to create three massive underground bunkers weingut ii diana ii and walnuss ii which would not be vulnerable to allied bombing which had devastated german aircraft factories bunkers were intended for production of messerschmitt me 262 aircraft but none were produced at camps before united states army liberated area kaufering was largest of dachau subcamps and also one with worst conditions about half of 30 000 prisoners died from hunger disease executions or during death marches most of sites were not preserved and have been repurposed for other uses establishment thumb left internal view of weingut i bunker at muhldorf in early 1944 allied bombing raids had reduced fighter aircraft production of german factories by as much as two thirds in order to reduce effectiveness of allied bombing jagerstab a task force of reich ministry of armaments and war production for increasing fighter production planned to move production underground existing underground areas such as caves and mines were not suited to factory production so new concrete bunkers were to be built using concentration camp prisoners for labor area around landsberg am lech in bavaria where kaufering subcamps were established was selected for this project due to its favorable geology there was a layer of gravel up to thick and water table was below out of six planned bunkers three began construction at kaufering and another at nearby muhldorf concentration camp previously nazi germany had attempted to make reich judenrein cleansed of jews by deporting all jews to eastern areas however they had exhausted other sources of forced labor so jews were deported to reich to work on new project kaufering i later redesignated kaufering iii was established by a transport of 1 000 hungarian jewish men from auschwitz concentration camp that arrived in kaufering bavaria on 18 june 1944 prisoner functionaries were brought from dachau to manage new camp forced labor thumb purpose of camp was to produce messerschmitt me 262a aircraft unusually construction of camps as well as providing food and medical care was responsibility of organization todt ot not ss which sought to extract maximum labor for minimum expense prisoners deported to each camp had to construct accommodation themselves resulting huts partially buried for camouflage from aerial reconnaissance were completely inadequate for weather conditions rain and snow leaked through earthen roofs and vermin infested huts prisoners had to sleep in straw spread on floor of dachau s subcamps kaufering had worst conditions most prisoners were forced to work building railway embankments and hauling bags of cement for bunker building projects codenamed weingut ii diana ii and walnuss ii weingut ii was long and high more than five stories with a concrete roof thick roof had been planned to be thick but that was pared down due to lack of materials total floor area would be augsburg factory that it intended to replace had only of floor area in three dispersal locations for protection from air raids 40 of bunker was underground and its roof was covered with dirt for camouflage at least 10 000 jewish prisoners worked on bunker at some point thumb left external view of weingut ii bunker bunkers were to be used for producing different components of messerschmitt me 262a aircraft first operational jet aircraft which germans hoped would turn tide of war against allies messerschmitt ag hoped to produce 900 me 262 aircraft and additional me rocket powered aircraft at kaufering by employing 10 000 workers per shift in each bunker 90 000 in all of whom one third were to be concentration camp prisoners however construction of diana ii and walnuss ii was not finished due to lack of concrete and steel when united states liberated area in april 1945 excavation of weingut ii was not complete but already production machines had been set up however not a single aircraft was produced before liberation murderous conditions meant that most prisoners were incapacitated in a short time and ot and construction workers brutally beat victims in order to extract labor most prisoners were forced to work building railway embankments and hauling bags of cement for bunker building projects ot workers complained that due to severe vermin infestation prisoners spent time attempting to rid themselves of fleas when they were supposed to be working in december 1944 an ot staff member observed that of 17 600 prisoners only 8 319 were capable of work including those only capable of light work because companies that hired workers complained that they had to pay for labor of prisoners unable to work transports totaling 1 322 or 1 451 people were dispatched to auschwitz in september and october 1944 where victims were gassed command and organization ss hierarchy at kaufering had mostly served at eastern death camps such as majdanek and auschwitz which had been liberated by red army first commandant heinrich forster had previously worked at sachsenhausen dachau and kovno concentration camps forster was replaced in december 1944 by hans aumeier former deputy commandant of auschwitz and commandant of concentration camp in february 1945 otto former commandant of mittelbau dora took over command of kaufering camp doctor was who had worked at multiple concentration camps architect hermann giesler a close associate of adolf hitler was in charge of bunker construction consisting of eleven subcamps kaufering was largest of dachau subcamp systems and probably largest jewish subcamp system in reich list of kaufering subcamps thumb gate of kaufering i with american soldier thumb kaufering iv on day of liberation prisoners thumb left barracks at kaufering vii about 30 000 prisoners passed through kaufering camps including 4 200 women and 850 children this dwarfed population of surrounding area only 10 000 people lived in landsberg area almost all of prisoners were jews majority of prisoners came from hungary or areas annexed by hungary eight thousand jews were forced to leave kovno ghetto in july 1944 as red army approached male prisoners were separated from women and sent to kaufering additional jews arrived at kaufering that summer during liquidation of labor camps in baltics about to be overrun by red army these jews had already survived countless aktions in which victims were taken away to be murdered and three years of forced labor as well as long transports in cattle cars other kaufering prisoners had survived four years in lodz ghetto and a selection at auschwitz on 10 october 1944 a transport of jewish men who had been imprisoned at theresienstadt ghetto in protectorate of bohemia and moravia arrived via auschwitz other jewish prisoners were from holland france italy or rhodes some of food allotted to prisoners was diverted by ss guards further reducing nutrient intake of prisoners those who were sick with diseases such as typhus spotted fever and tuberculosis that were widespread in camp were fed even less and rations were further reduced as war drew to an end and shortages arose conditions were too harsh for a resistance movement to develop however survivors of kovno ghetto continued to publish a clandestine newspaper spark handwritten and illegally distributed elkes head of judenrat at kovno was camp elder of kaufering i where he died a commission established after war estimated that 14 500 kaufering prisoners had died german historian edith raim wrote that about half of 30 000 prisoners died before liberation main causes of death were hunger disease execution deportation to auschwitz and death marches according to american historian daniel about 4 300 of those victims died at kaufering itself additional victims were sent to dachau after becoming unable to work or were killed during death marches death marches thumb survivors liberated at kaufering i as allied troops approached rumors circulated among prisoners that germans were going to massacre them before liberation in mid april ss general ernst kaltenbrunner relayed orders from adolf hitler for luftwaffe to bomb dachau landsberg and muhldorf which all had high jewish populations gauleiter of munich paul giesler ordered gerdes administrator of upper bavaria to prepare plans for extermination of surviving prisoners gerdes prevaricated citing lack of airplane fuel and ammunition as well as poor weather in response kaltenbrunner ordered that kaufering prisoners be taken to dachau main camp where they were to be poisoned gerdes ordered a local doctor to prepare poison but this plan could not be implemented either third plan was to take prisoners to valley in alps where they were to be murdered in one way or another according to german records 10 114 prisoners including 1 093 women were at kaufering camps during last week of april most of them were evacuated to dachau or locations further south either on foot or by train prisoners faced a difficult choice of whether to join death marches or to try to stay behind knowing that they might be massacred on death marches anyone who could not keep up was beaten or shot leading to many deaths evacuation was disorderly and many prisoners succeeded in escaping during roundups at camp or later when columns were attacked by american aircraft on 23 april 1 200 prisoners left kaufering vi on foot and joined prisoners forced on a death march from dachau s main camp another 1 500 prisoners left kaufering next day proceeding at first on foot and later by train on multiple occasions prisoners were attacked by allied aircraft in one of these attacks which hit a train carrying ammunition as well as prisoners hundreds of victims were killed some of prisoners evacuated from kaufering ended up at concentration camp hundreds of evacuees from kaufering arrived at buchberg labor camp south of on 29 april otto moll a functionary of kaufering attempted to massacre these prisoners but was foiled by camp commander instead moll killed 120 or 150 russian prisoners from buchberg
