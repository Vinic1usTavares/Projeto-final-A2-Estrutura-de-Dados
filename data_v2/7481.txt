uss galena was a wooden hulled broadside ironclad built for united states navy during american civil war ship was initially assigned to north atlantic blockading squadron and supported union forces during peninsula campaign in 1862 she was damaged during battle of drewry s bluff because her armor was too thin to prevent confederate shots from penetrating widely regarded as a failure galena was reconstructed without most of her armor in 1863 and transferred to west gulf blockading squadron in 1864 ship participated in battle of mobile bay and subsequent siege of fort morgan in august she was briefly transferred to east gulf blockading squadron in september before she was sent to philadelphia pennsylvania for repairs in november repairs were completed in march 1865 and galena rejoined north atlantic blockading squadron in hampton roads following month after end of war ship was decommissioned at portsmouth new hampshire in june she was transferred to hampton roads in 1869 condemned in 1870 and broken up for scrap in 1872 background after united states received word of construction of confederate casemate ironclad congress appropriated 1 5 million on 3 august to build one or more armored steamships it also ordered creation of a board to inquire into armored ships u s navy advertised for proposals for iron clad steam vessels of war roberts 1999 p 5 on 7 august and gideon welles secretary of navy appointed three members of ironclad board following day their task was to examine plans for completion of iron clad vessels well before this date cornelius bushnell had commissioned a design for an armored sloop from naval architect samuel h pook in june for 1 500 anticipating an order from union navy to counter confederate ironclad already known to be building bushnell expected that order because his bid at a higher cost for building steam had already been accepted provided that he subcontract construction to charles mallory sons shipyard of mystic connecticut in exchange navy asked if bushnell could give a price on an armored gunboat he could and subcontracted building of his design to maxon fish co also of mystic on 20 july day after a bill to authorize construction of a number of armored ships was introduced in senate building of galenas wooden hull began two days later remling pp 21 24 ironclad board initially accepted two of sixteen designs submitted in early september armored frigate that became and bushnell s design board required a guarantee from bushnell that his ship would float despite weight of its armor and he needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor to that end cornelius h recommended that bushnell consult with his friend john ericsson two first met on 9 september and again on following day after ericsson had time to evaluate galenas design and give his guarantee during this second meeting ericsson showed bushnell his own design future uss monitor bushnell got ericsson s permission to show model of his design to welles and latter told bushnell to show it to board despite a preliminary rejection board accepted ericsson s proposal on 16 september after he explained his design in person previous day thompson pp 223 24 three ironclad ships differed substantially in design and degree of risk monitor was most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard shallow draft iron hull and total dependence on steam power riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret something that had not previously been tested by any navy ericsson s guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite risk involved wooden hulled galenas most novel feature was her armor of interlocking iron rails new ironsides was much influenced by and was most conservative design of three which copied many of features of french ship roberts 1999 pp 7 11 design and description galena s original design dated 28 june was for a schooner rigged corvette with three masts long at waterline with a beam of a depth of hold of and an estimated displacement of ship s sides were protected by wrought iron plates thick backed by of india rubber and side of hull ship s deck consisted of armor a revised design was submitted to ironclad board for which a contract was awarded on 28 september in which sloop was enlarged probably because it was uncertain if original design could support proposed armor s weight canney pp 21 22 as built galena was long between perpendiculars and long overall she had a beam of a depth of hold of and a draft of ship displaced and had 738 tons burthen silverstone p 11 number of masts was reduced to two and amount of tumblehome greatly increased canney p 21 her crew numbered 150 officers and enlisted men on her only ocean voyage in her original configuration galena rolled heavily while under construction armor scheme was modified rubber backing was replaced by an additional of iron although commodore joseph smith chief of bureau of yards and docks and pook were uncertain if ship could support this weight to reduce weight several alternatives were proposed one proposal was to reduce thickness of protection to for a distance from from bow and stern and other was to reduce armor s thickness above sills of gun ports to and deck armor s thickness to 1 2 inch over 2 1 2 inches of wood it is unknown exactly how situation was resolved but one report on 31 march 1862 suggests that two proposals were combined as it said that armor was two inches thick above gun ports except around stern where it was 1 2 inch thick galena was powered by a single cylinder horizontal ericsson vibrating lever steam engine which drove one propeller engine used steam generated by two boilers and gave ship a top speed of it had a bore of and a stroke of during her trip to hampton roads after commissioning ship reached a speed of using her sails canney p 22 ship was armed with two 100 pounder parrott rifles in pivot mounts fore and aft and four smoothbore dahlgren guns

approximately 20 caliber guns weighed about each olmstead et al p 117 keel was laid down by maxson fish co in 1861 and she was launched on 14 february 1862 ship was commissioned on 21 april 1862 with commander alfred taylor in command galena galena arrived in hampton roads on 24 april after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route remling p 26 and was assigned to flag officer l m goldsborough s north atlantic blockading squadron commander john rodgers relieved taylor same day when goldsborough inspected ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and nuts on inside of her hull to be covered with sheet iron to prevent them from breaking loose when ship was hit galena prepared for action on 4 and 7 may when ironclad virginia sortied into hampton roads but virginia did not attack on 8 may ship together with gunboats and sailed up james river with orders to cooperate with major general george b mcclellan s army in peninsula campaign and harass retreating confederate forces ships silenced one battery and ran past another covering river without damage before galena ran aground later that day she was not damaged although she required a day and a half of work before she was freed rodgers ships were reinforced by ironclads and on 12 may and they reached city point following day orn vol 7 pp 327 29 battle of drewry s bluff thumb left galena on 15 may 1862 showing some battle damage on morning of 15 may galena led her squadron up to drewry s bluff about from richmond where confederates had blocked river and placed a battery on bluff to cover obstacles galena anchored some from bluff and opened fire at 07 45 while wooden ships remained further downriver monitor attempted to fire on battery as well but her guns could not elevate enough to reach it coski p 44 galena engaged confederate position for over three hours until her ammunition was nearly exhausted canney p 23 her fire was largely ineffective although her shells did manage to kill seven and wound eight members of battery in return ship was hit an estimated 44 times on her port side of which 13 hits penetrated her armor and she had three large holes punched through her spar

to depots on 27 june major general mcclellan came aboard ship to locate a new camp which was later established near harrison s landing on 30 june mcclellan was compelled to withdraw down james covered by gunfire from galena and other gunboats they continued to support his forces until they were transferred to northern virginia galena patrolled river to defend transports and supply ships against confederate raids and ambushes until she was detached from james river flotilla in september 1862 galena and monitor were retained at newport news virginia in case confederate ironclads building at richmond sortied into hampton roads orn vol 8 p departed hampton roads on 19 may 1863 and arrived at philadelphia pennsylvania two days later where she was decommissioned for repairs and reconstruction orn vol 9 pp 30 35 most of her ineffective armor was removed except around engines and boilers her armament was increased to eight nine inch dahlgren guns and a single 100 pounder

two columns four monitors would comprise starboard column closest to ft morgan and their mission was to bombard fort while wooden ships in other column passed by and to sink ironclad ram once past fort wooden ships were to prevent escape of confederate wooden gunboats to mobile to ensure that his wooden ships could get past ft morgan farragut ordered that they be lashed together in pairs so that one ship could pull other if confederates succeeded in knocking out its boilers or engines friend pp 124 was tied to port side of larger sloop and pair were last ships in port column when battle began on morning of 5 august friend p 164 while passing fort oneida had her starboard boiler disabled by a shell hit and her crew was attempting to reroute her steam to both engines when she was
