sperm whale physeter macrocephalus or cachalot is largest of toothed whales and largest toothed predator it is only living member of genus physeter and one of three extant species in sperm whale family along with pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of genus kogia sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide range and will migrate seasonally for feeding and breeding females and young males live together in groups while mature males bulls live solitary lives outside of mating season females cooperate to protect and nurse their young females give birth every four to 20 years and care for calves for more than a decade a mature sperm whale has few natural predators although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by pods of killer whales orcas mature males average in

sperm whale is a truncation of spermaceti whale spermaceti originally mistakenly identified as whales semen is semi liquid waxy substance found within whale s head see below sperm whale is also known as cachalot which is thought to derive from archaic french for tooth or big teeth as preserved for example in in gascon dialect a word of either romance or basque origin etymological dictionary of says origin is uncertain but it suggests that it comes from vulgar latin plural of sword hilt word cachalot came to english via french from spanish or portuguese perhaps from galician portuguese big head encarta dictionary term is retained in russian word for animal as well as in many other languages scientific genus name physeter comes from greek meaning blowpipe blowhole of a whale or as a pars pro toto whale specific name macrocephalus is latinized from greek meaning big headed from large head its synonymous specific name catodon means down tooth from greek elements below and tooth so named because it has visible teeth only in its lower jaw see teeth another synonym australasian was applied to sperm whales in southern hemisphere taxonomy sperm whale belongs to order cetartiodactyla order containing all cetaceans and even toed ungulates it is a member of unranked clade cetacea with all whales dolphins and porpoises and further classified into odontoceti containing all toothed whales and dolphins it is sole extant species of its genus physeter in family physeteridae two species of related extant genus kogia pygmy sperm whale kogia breviceps and dwarf sperm whale k sima are placed either in this family or in family kogiidae in some taxonomic schemes families kogiidae and physeteridae are combined as superfamily physeteroidea see separate entry on sperm whale family swedish

was near sperm whale is one of species originally described by linnaeus in 1758 in his 18th century work systema naturae he recognised four species in genus physeter experts soon realised that just one such species exists although there has been debate about whether this should be named p catodon or p macrocephalus two of names used by linnaeus both names are still used although most recent authors now accept macrocephalus as valid name limiting catodon status to a lesser synonym until 1974 species was generally known as p catodon in that year however dutch zoologists antonius m husson and lipke holthuis proposed that correct name should be p macrocephalus second name in genus physeter published by linnaeus concurrently with p catodon this proposition was based on grounds that names were synonyms published simultaneously and therefore iczn principle of first reviser should apply in this instance it led to choice of p macrocephalus over p catodon a view re stated in holthuis 1987 this has been adopted by most subsequent authors although 1986 and 1987 argued that macrocephalus was published with an inaccurate description and that therefore only species catodon was valid rendering principle of first reviser inapplicable most recent version of itis has altered its usage from p catodon to p macrocephalus following l b holthuis and more recent 2008 discussions with

of compartments of spermaceti separated by cartilage it is analogous to melon found in other toothed whales structure of junk redistributes physical stress across skull and may have evolved to protect head during ramming running through head are two air passages left passage runs alongside spermaceti organ and goes directly to blowhole whilst right passage runs underneath spermaceti organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into distal sac at very front of nose distal sac is connected to blowhole and terminus of left passage when whale is submerged it can close blowhole and air that passes through phonic lips can circulate back to lungs sperm whale unlike other odontocetes has only one pair of phonic lips whereas all other toothed whales have two and it is located at front of nose instead of behind melon at posterior end of this spermaceti complex is frontal sac which covers concave surface of cranium posterior wall of frontal sac is covered with fluid filled knobs which are about 4 13 mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves anterior wall is smooth surface reflects sound waves that come through spermaceti organ from phonic lips grooves between knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever orientation or depth of whale making it an excellent sound mirror spermaceti organs may also help adjust whale s buoyancy it is hypothesized that before whale dives cold water enters organ and it is likely that blood vessels constrict reducing blood flow and hence temperature wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume increase in specific density generates a down force of about and allows whale to dive with less effort during hunt oxygen consumption together with blood vessel dilation produces heat and melts spermaceti increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing however more recent work has found many problems with this theory including lack of anatomical structures for actual heat exchange whitehead pp 317 321 herman melville s

sperm whale eye according to fristrup and harbison 2002 sperm whales eyes afford good vision and sensitivity to light they conjectured that sperm whales use vision to hunt squid either by detecting silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence if sperm whales detect silhouettes fristrup and harbison suggested that they hunt upside down allowing them to use forward parts of ventral visual fields for binocular vision sleeping for some time researchers have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at surface a 2008 study published in current biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with both sides of brain it appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of time most often between 6 p m and midnight genetics sperm whales have 21 pairs of chromosomes 2n 42 genome of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin vocalization complex mechanism when echolocating sperm whale emits a directionally focused beam of broadband clicks clicks are generated by forcing air through a pair of phonic lips also known as monkey lips or de singe at front end of nose just below blowhole sound then travels backwards along length of nose through spermaceti organ most of sound energy is then reflected off frontal sac at cranium and into melon whose lens like structure focuses it some of sound will reflect back into spermaceti organ and back towards front of whale s nose where it will be reflected through spermaceti organ a third time this back and forth reflection which happens on scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi pulse click structure this multi pulse click structure allows researchers to measure whale s spermaceti organ using only sound of its clicks because interval between pulses of a sperm whale s click is related to length of sound producing organ an individual whale s click is unique to that individual however if whale matures and size of spermaceti organ increases tone of whale s click will also change lower jaw is primary reception path for echoes a continuous fat filled canal transmits received sounds to inner ear whitlow w echolocation pp 359 367 in perrin source of air forced through phonic lips is right nasal passage while left nasal passage opens to blow hole right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to phonic lips it is thought that nostrils of land based ancestor of sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions left nostril becoming blowhole and right nostril becoming phonic lips air that passes through phonic lips passes into distal sac then back down through left nasal passage this recycling of air allows whale to continuously generate clicks for as long as it is submerged types of vocalization a creak is a rapid series of high frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge it is typically used when homing in on prey a coda is a short pattern of 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations they were once thought to be a way by which individuals identified themselves but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas and same codas are used by multiple individuals whitehead p 141 however each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects whitehead p 131 large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas in breeding grounds codas are almost entirely produced by adult females despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates slow clicks are heard only

orycterocetus fossils have also been found in north atlantic ocean and mediterranean sea in addition to west coast of united states placoziphius found in europe and acrophyseter from peru are dated to late miocene fossil sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and shape of face and jaws for example scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum genera from oligocene and early and middle miocene with possible exception of aulophyseter had teeth in their upper jaws acrophyseter from late miocene also had teeth in both upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible lower jaw these anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep sea squid eaters such as modern sperm whale but that some genera mainly ate fish zygophyseter dated from middle to late miocene and found in southern italy had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey rather like modern killer whale orca other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales two fossil species belonging to modern genus physeter have been recognized so far p antiquus neogene of france and p vetus neogene of eastern north america phylogeny traditional view has been that mysticeti baleen whales and odontoceti toothed whales arose from more primitive whales early in oligocene period and that super family physeteroidea which contains sperm whale dwarf sperm whale and pygmy sperm whale diverged from other toothed whales soon after that over g sperm whales evolution pp 1172 1174 in perrin from 1993 to 1996 molecular phylogenetics analyses by milinkovitch and colleagues based on comparing genes of various modern whales suggested that sperm whales are more closely related to baleen whales than they are to other toothed whales which would have meant that odontoceti were not monophyletic in other words it did not consist of a single ancestral toothed whale species and all its descendants however more recent studies based on various combinations of comparative anatomy and molecular phylogenetics criticised milinkovitch s analysis on technical grounds and reaffirmed that odontoceti are monophyletic these analyses also confirm that there was a rapid evolutionary radiation diversification of physeteroidea in miocene period kogiidae dwarf and pygmy sperm whales diverged from physeteridae true sperm whales at least whitehead pp 2 3 relationship with humans sperm whaling thumb in 19th century sperm whales were hunted using rowboats and hand thrown harpoons a rather dangerous method as whales sometimes fought back alt painting of a sperm whale destroying a boat with other boats in background spermaceti obtained primarily from spermaceti organ and sperm oil obtained primarily from blubber in body were much sought after by 18th 19th and 20th century whalers these substances found a variety of commercial applications such as candles soap cosmetics machine oil other specialised lubricants lamp oil pencils crayons leather waterproofing rust proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds ambergris a solid waxy flammable substance produced in digestive system of sperm whales was also sought as a fixative in prior to early eighteenth century hunting was mostly by indigenous indonesians whitehead p 14 legend has it that sometime in early 18th century around 1712 captain christopher hussey while cruising for right whales near shore was blown offshore by a northerly wind where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one although story may not be true sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by american whalers judge paul dudley in his essay upon natural history of whales 1725 states that one atkins 10 or 12 years in trade was among first to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off new england coast there were only a few recorded catches during first few decades 1709 1730s of offshore sperm whaling instead sloops concentrated on nantucket shoals where they would have taken right whales or went to davis strait region to catch bowhead whales by early 1740s with advent of spermaceti candles before 1743 american vessels began to focus on sperm whales diary of benjamin bangs 1721 1769 shows that along with bumpkin sloop he sailed he found three other sloops sperm whales off coast of north carolina in late may 1743 on returning to nantucket in summer 1744 on a subsequent voyage he noted that 45 are brought in here this day another indication that american sperm whaling was in full swing american sperm whaling soon spread from east coast of american colonies to gulf stream grand banks west africa 1763 azores 1765 and south atlantic 1770s from 1770 to 1775 massachusetts new york connecticut and rhode island ports produced 45 000 barrels of sperm oil annually compared to 8 500 of whale oil in same decade british began sperm whaling employing american ships and personnel by following decade french had entered trade also employing american expertise sperm whaling increased until mid nineteenth century spermaceti oil was important in public lighting for example in lighthouses where it was used in united states until 1862 when it was replaced by lard oil in turn replaced by petroleum and for lubricating machines such as those used in cotton mills of industrial revolution sperm whaling declined in second half of nineteenth century as petroleum came into broader use in that sense petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation whitehead pp 13 21 sperm whaling in 18th century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats fleet s scope and size increased over time and larger ships entered fishery in late 18th century and early 19th century sperm whaling ships sailed to equatorial pacific indian ocean japan coast of arabia australia and new zealand hunting could be dangerous to crew since sperm whales especially bulls will readily fight to defend themselves against attack unlike most baleen whales when dealing with a threat sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram arguably most famous sperm whale counter attack occurred on 20 november 1820 when a whale claimed to be about long rammed and sank nantucket whaleship essex only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships this instance is popularly believed to have inspired herman melville s famous book moby dick divers find shipwreck of doomed sailor who inspired classic tale of moby dick off coast of hawaii co uk 2011 02 12 thumb right scrimshaw was art of drawing on teeth of sperm whales it was a way for whalers to pass time between hunts sperm whale s ivory like teeth were often sought by 18th and 19th century whalers who used them to produce inked carvings known as scrimshaw 30 teeth of sperm whale can be used for ivory each of these teeth up to and across are hollow for first half of their length like walrus ivory sperm whale ivory has two distinct layers however sperm whale ivory contains a much thicker inner layer though a widely practised art in 19th century scrimshaw using genuine sperm whale ivory declined substantially after retirement of whaling fleets in 1880s currently endangered species act and convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites prevents sales of or trade in sperm whale ivory harvested after 1973 or scrimshaw crafted from it modern whaling was more efficient than open boat whaling employing steam powered ships and exploding harpoons initially modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales but as these populations were taken sperm whaling increased spermaceti fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales was in high demand in both 1941 1942 and 1942 1943 seasons norwegian expeditions took over 3 000 sperm whales off coast of peru alone after world war ii whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high performance machinery such as automobile transmissions hunting led to near extinction of large whales including sperm whales until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972 international whaling commission gave species full protection in 1985 but hunting by japan in northern pacific ocean continued until 1988 it is estimated that historic worldwide population numbered 1 100 000 before commercial sperm whaling began in early 18th century by 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent from that date until 1946 population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased but after second world war population declined even further to 33 per cent of pre whaling population between 184 000 and 236 000 sperm whales were killed by various whaling nations in 19th century while in 20th century at least 770 000 were taken majority between 1946 and 1980 over 680 000 officially reported at in addition studies have found that official reports understated ussr catches by at least 89 000 furthermore other countries such as japan have been found to have understated catches thumb sperm whaling peaked in 1830s and 1960s sperm whales increase levels of primary production and carbon export by depositing iron rich faeces into surface waters of southern ocean iron rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from atmosphere when phytoplankton dies it sinks to deep ocean and takes atmospheric carbon with it by reducing abundance of sperm whales in southern ocean whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in atmosphere each year remaining sperm whale populations are large enough that species conservation status is rated as vulnerable rather than endangered however recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process particularly in south pacific where toll on breeding age males was severe whitehead pp 360 362 current conservation status total number of sperm whales in world is unknown but is thought to be in hundreds of thousands conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales commercial whaling has ceased and species is protected almost worldwide though records indicate that in 11 year period starting from 2000 japan has caught 51 sperm whales fishermen do not target creatures sperm whales eat but long line fishing operations in gulf of alaska have complained about sperm whales stealing fish from their lines currently entanglement in fishing nets and collisions with ships represent greatest threats to sperm whale population other threats include ingestion of marine debris ocean noise and chemical pollution whitehead pp 362 368 international union for conservation of nature iucn regards sperm whale as being vulnerable species is listed as

sperm whales are not easiest of whales to watch due to their long dive times and ability to travel long distances underwater however due to distinctive look and large size of whale watching is increasingly popular sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones to listen to clicks of whales and locate them before they surface popular locations for sperm whale watching include town of kaikoura on
