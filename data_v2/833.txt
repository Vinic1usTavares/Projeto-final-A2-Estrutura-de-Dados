burman with blind favouritism born of first impression when i die i will be a burman and i will always walk about with a pretty almond coloured girl who shall laugh and jest too as a young maiden ought she shall not pull a sari over her head when a man looks at her and glare suggestively from behind it nor shall she tramp behind me when i walk for these are customs of india she shall look all

subsequently appeared in several collections of kipling s verse including early verse in 1900 inclusive verse in 1919 and definitive verse in 1940 it appears also in 1936 a kipling pageant and t s eliot s 1941 a choice of kipling s verse structure poem has rhyming scheme aabb traditional for ballad verse however kipling begins poem with stunningly memorable a being sea me and b including say lay mandalay another ballad like feature is use of stanzas and refrains distinguished both and by triple end rhymes of refrains poem s ending closely echoes its beginning again in circular manner of a traditional ballad making it convenient to memorise to recite and to sing metre in which poem is written is trochaic meaning there are eight feet each except last on line consisting of a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one last foot is catalectic consisting only of stressed syllable in kipling s time poem s metre and rhythm were admired in art of verse making 1915 modeste jordan could write kipling has a wonderful ear for metre for rhythm his accents fall just right his measure is never halting or uncertain his mandalay may be quoted as an excellent example of rhythm as easy and flowing as has ever been done poet and critic t s eliot writing in 1941 called variety of forms kipling devised for his ballads remarkable each is distinct and perfectly fitted to content and mood which poem has to convey themes colonialism thumb upright british at palace in mandalay in third anglo burmese war illustrated london news 1887 for literary critic sharon hamilton writing in 1998 called 1890 mandalay an appropriate vehicle for imperial thought she argued that kipling cued victorian reader to see it as a song of empire by putting it in border ballad song tradition where fighting men sang of their own deeds lending it emotional weight she further suggested that since kipling assembled his 1892 barrack room ballads including mandalay in that tradition during a time of intense scrutiny of history of british ballad he was probably well aware that mandalay would carry message of submission of a woman and by extension her city to a white conqueror she argues that soldier is grammatically active while native girl is grammatically passive indicating her willing servitude hamilton sees fact that girl was named supayalat jes same as theebaw s queen as a sign that kipling meant that winning her mirrored british overthrow of burmese monarchy against andrew selth commented of hamilton s analysis that it is debatable whether any of kipling s contemporaries or indeed many people since saw ballad in such esoteric terms but even so it met with an enthusiastic reception in 2003 david gilmour argued in his book long recessional imperial life of rudyard kipling that kipling s view of empire was far from jingoistic colonialism and that he was certainly not racist instead gilmour called mandalay a poem of great charm and striking inaccuracy a view with which selth concurs selth notes that contemporary readers soon noticed kipling s inaccurate geography such as that moulmein is 61 kilometres 38 miles from sea which is far out of sight and that sea is to west of town not east ian jack in guardian wrote that kipling was not praising colonialism and empire in mandalay he explained that kipling did write verse such as white man s burden which was pro colonial but that mandalay was not of that kind a similar point is made by political scientist igor in an article for kipling society where he writes that moving love of burmese girl and british soldier is described in a picturesque way fact that burmese girl represented inferior and british soldier superior races is secondary because kipling makes here a stress on human but not imperial relations notes romanticism thumb upright rudyard kipling in 1891 by john collier hamilton noted too that kipling wrote poem soon after his return from india to london where he worked near a music hall music hall songs were standardized for a mass audience with catchiness a key quality hamilton argued that in manner of music hall songs kipling contrasts exotic of neater sweeter maiden with mundane mentioning beefy face an grubby and of british this is paralleled in her view with breaking of rhyming scheme to abba in single stanza set in london complete with slightly discordant rhymes tells else else smells and minor dissonance as in blasted english drizzle a gritty realism very different she argues from fantasizing airy nothings of burma stanzas with their mist sunshine bells and kisses she suggests too that there is a hint of minstrelsy in mandalay again in music hall tradition as kipling mentions a banjo instrument of escapist sentimentality this contrasted with well ordered western musical structure such as stanzas and refrains which mirrored ordered systematic nature of european music michael wesley reviewing andrew selth s book on riff from mandalay wrote that selth explores why poem so effectively caught national mood wesley argues that poem says more about writer and his audience than subject of their he notes that poem provides a romantic trigger not accurate geography that name mandalay has a falling cadence lovely word has gathered about itself chiaroscuro of romance name conjures for wesley images of lost oriental kingdoms and tropical splendour despite this he argues name s romance derives solely from poem with couplets like literary critic steven moore wrote that in once popular poem lower class cockney soldier extols tropical paradise of burma drawn both to an exotic lover and to a state of lawless freedom without ten commandments that lover was however now way out of reach far removed from real needs and social obligations selth identified several interwoven themes in poem exotic erotica prudish victorian britain and its horror at mixed marriages idea that colonialism could uplift oppressed heathen women conflicting missionary desire to limit behaviour of women in non prudish societies in selth s view mandalay avoids austere morality hard finance and high geopolitics of british imperialism opting instead for pure romanticism or in wesley s words imperial romanticism a common touch thumb upright sheet music of oley speaks s on road to mandalay 1907 eliot included poem in his 1941 collection a choice of kipling s verse stating that kipling s poems are best when read aloud ear requires no training to follow them easily with this simplicity of purpose goes a consummate gift of word phrase and rhythm in jack s view poem evoked effect of empire on individuals he argued that kipling was speaking in voice of a cockney soldier with a burmese girlfriend now unattainably far away he argued that poem s 51 lines cover race class power gender erotic exotic and what anthropologists and historians call colonial desire jack noted that kipling s contemporaries objected not to these issues but to kipling s distortions of geography bay of bengal being to burma s west not east so that china was not across bay impact according to selth mandalay had a significant impact on popular western perception of burma and far east it was well known in britain america and english speaking colonies of british empire poem was widely adapted and imitated in verse and in music and musical settings appeared in several films ballad style lent itself easily to parody and adaption resulting in half a dozen soldiers songs starting as early as 1896 1896 campaign in sudan selth noted that poem s name became commercially valuable some 30 books have titles based directly on poem with names such as road from mandalay and red roads to mandalay in 1907 h j heinz produced a suitably spicy mandalay sauce while a rum and fruit juice cocktail was named a night in old mandalay in music thumb upright first sheet of oley speaks s setting of on road to mandalay 1907 kipling s text was adapted by oley speaks for what became his best known song on road to mandalay and popularised by peter dawson speaks sets poem to music in time marked alla marcia key is e flat major this largely replaced six earlier musical settings of mandalay by gerard cobb 1892 arthur thayer 1892 henry 1898 walter damrosch 1898 walter 1899 and arthur whiting 1900 percy grainger composed another in 1898 but did not publish it total number of settings is now at least 24 spanning jazz ragtime swing pop folk and country music most of them use only first two and last two stanzas with chorus versions exist in french danish german and russian arranged and conducted by billy may speaks s setting appears in frank sinatra s album come fly with me kipling s daughter and heiress objected to this version which had altered kipling s burma girl into a burma broad man who east of suez can raise a thirst into a cat and following temple bells into crazy bells sinatra sang song in australia in 1959 and relayed story of kipling family s objections to song bertolt brecht
