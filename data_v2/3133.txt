known as in its upper reaches is longest and widest river in japan and third largest by basin area behind tone river and river it is located in northeastern honshu rising in japanese alps and flowing generally northeast through nagano and niigata prefectures before emptying into sea of japan history shinano river has a long history in honshu and along with other rivers in region has a significant effect on geography and ecology of area originally shinano river would have drained straight into an estuary like fukushima lagoon before making its way into sea of japan after flowing down from japanese alps over centuries of sediments being brought downstream a marshy plain formed in lagoon into what is currently echigo plain estimates presented in 1993 place amount of loose sediment in river system at construction of diversion channels have limited upkeep required to keep a navigable passage between niigata port and open ocean however a consequence of diverting sediment has been that northern coast of niigata prefecture which includes niigata and its port is receding by an average per year measured from 1947 to 1975 due to sediment being released well south of river s original mouth in niigata thumb 150px left flame style pottery from nagaoka site shinano river project funded by british academy investigates development of shinano chikuma river system it has uncovered some of earliest examples of flame style pottery kaen doki dating from middle jomon period 3500 2500 bce have been found at sanka excavation site in nagaoka niigata near confluence of sai and shinano rivers as with rivers across world shinano provided a valuable means of transport system also provided a method of transport for goods to be moved downstream to one of three ports niigata and provincial port of kambara little evidence remains which details importance or role of these ports however large amounts of medieval chinese artefacts have been found in region and it is setting of muromachi period play was set in kambara indicating its regional significance there is limited evidence which has caused some historians such as shishi to suggest that shinano system was not widely used for boat travel until eighteenth century brian goldsmith however contends that shinano was in fact used for waterborne trade based on archaeological finds including coin hoards and imported pottery found in headwaters of shinano one of main inland roads in honshu followed shinano valley inland to japanese alps location of road indicates that river played a vital role in local trade chikuma valley also provided a link across island of honshu confluence of chikuma and sai rivers called plain was location a series of battles in sixteenth century as part of sengoku period most significant of battles was fought on 18 october 1561 between takeda clan and uesugi clan and resulted in severe casualties to both sides battles have become well known in japanese military history mentioned in literature woodblock printing and movies shinano river system has a long history of hydroelectric power generation with first hydroelectric power plant in japan being located in system during construction of a plant on shinano river in niigata prefecture in july 1922 it was reported at time that korean workers were being mistreated and murdered shinano river incident involved 1 200 workers approximately 600 of whom were korean who were subjected to regular mistreatment by their japanese foremen mistreatment included malnutrition forced labour up to sixteen hours a day and severe beatings for those who tried to escape news articles at time alleged that up to 100 koreans were killed during construction and that local farmers had reported seeing bodies floating down river this incident occurred following annexation of korea by japan and was partially responsible for development of trade unions for korean workers in japan two japanese naval cruisers one launched in 1911 and second in 1938 were named after chikuma river a 1940s aircraft carrier was named after old shinano province course thumb chikuma river from yashima bridge looking downstream toward bridge nagano city chikuma river rises in northeastern foothills of mount in japanese alps on border of saitama yamanashi and nagano prefectures partially in chichibu tama kai national park it joins with yochi river and flows roughly north to join yu river then turns northwest into an basin at nagano city where it is joined by sai river from matsumoto and hoshina river chikuma then changes direction and flows northeast from nagano into niigata prefecture where it changes its name to shinano river shinano continues northeast to a confluence with uono river between ojiya and after its confluence with uono river shinano is crossed by bridge and train line before emerging onto echigo plains of niigata prefecture at sanjo after entering echigo plains river becomes deltaic and swampy due to its very small gradient an average of 1 in 4000 completed in 1920s diverts flood water northwest into sea of japan while river splits into a number of branches and continuing northeast approximately south of its mouth river turns north and flows towards niigata thumb left river mouths in niigata city from top agano river shinano river sekiya diversion channel sekiya diversion channel was completed in 1960s in response to flooding in niigata continuing after construction of okozu channel it is designed to mitigate flooding by diverting flood waters away from city and straight into sea of japan river turns northeast and flows through niigata city for approximately before finally emptying into sea of japan river is crossed multiple times as it meanders its way through niigata including by bandai bridge which was when it was originally built in 1886 longest bridge in japan at current bandai bridge built in 1929 and designated as a nationally important cultural property is only long this is also in stark contrast with river s width at diversion channel okozu diversion channel due to seasonal high rainfall in shinano s watershed fertile farmlands on niigata plain were subjected to flooding every three to four years which destroyed crops particularly rice and villages attempts from local residents to secure funding to build a diversion channel began in mid early eighteenth century during era government support was not secured until early twentieth century following severe flooding and inundation in 1896 thumb alt image showing an excavation being cut into hills with crisscrossed railway tracks construction of okozu channel construction work on began in 1909 and concluded in 1922 success of channel was short lived however as floodgate collapsed in 1927 due to erosion of channel bed and was not fully repaired until 1931 construction of diversion channel has resulted in marsh fields drying on niigata plain which allows for greater production likewise drier land has also allowed for construction of infrastructure such as expressways and shinkansen express train network to support a greater population in area a new weir wall was constructed between 1992 and 2000 due to safety concerns with original wall construction was planned to limit negative affects on scenery and wildlife to this end natural stones were used for exterior and were included in design sekiya diversion channel 150px thumb sekiya ocean gate flooding in niigata area continued following construction of okozu channel as a result another channel which was originally planned in edo period 1700s 1800s was built on western outskirts of niigata city to further mitigate risk of flooding and to help prevent saltwater intrusion into shinano estuary sekiya diversion channel was originally to be funded by niigata prefecture however 1964 niigata earthquake resulted in funds no longer being available so it was adopted as a national project 150px thumb shinano river gate construction of sekiya diversion channel commenced in 1968 and concluded in 1973 with a channel long and wide channel provides another alternate path for sediment to be directed straight out to sea and away from niigata port channel is crossed by echigo line and national route 402 excavated materials from channel were used in construction of route 402 major dams there are a number of major dams in shinano river system but not on main river itself rather its tributaries are extensively dammed and used for electricity generation as well as water for irrigation major dams in system are listed below takase dam on takase river a tributary of sai river holds and is tallest of its size in japan it is also second tallest dam in japan after dam nanakura dam which is part of takase dam system holds omachi dam is further downstream from nanakura dam and holds dam is on azusa river another tributary of sai holds and is followed downstream by a number of smaller dams including dam and dam dam sits on river which is a tributary of uono river it holds and is used for a range of purposes including storage for power generation flood control and water for irrigation watershed thumb alt aerial image showing two rivers meandering towards confluence near bottom of image looking southwest with sai river on right and chikuma on left basin of shinano chikuma river system is third largest in japan and at is longest river in country river system supports a population of around 3 million but supports significant agriculture and electricity generation river has 880 branches which is second highest in japan after yodo river discharge of river averages with a mean maximum of to mean minimum of in addition to this discharge of water is used for municipal and industrial supply across basin chikuma river originates in japanese alps at altitudes of above and has a basin in its own right of chikuma continues generally north northeast joining with sai and changing name to shinano after chikuma therefore includes around sixty percent of whole river system s basin and around 58 percent of river s length in upper reaches of river where it is known as chikuma only around ten percent of land is flat agricultural land and around of it is irrigated by time river flows onto echigo plain however much more land is devoted to agriculture and there is huge potential for irrigation especially due to influence of channel and weir abundance of water and fertile soils has led to this area being one of best rice producing areas in japan rainfall varies considerably in shinano basin in middle part of chikuma river near its confluence with sai river rainfall is some of lowest in japan generally staying below low precipitation is primarily due to its encirclement by three ranges which make up japanese alps and by etsu kogen national park however upper reaches of chikuma and sai rivers and lower part of chikuma river where it changes name to shinano river receive annually in central areas of shinano river especially in uono basin precipitation increases to around this area receives some of highest winter snow falls in japan with 40 50 of this precipitation falling as snow heavy snow melt is responsible for much of flooding to affect echigo but also allows for hydroelectricity generation and regular irrigation ecology thumb left alt river moving left to right in mid ground surrounded by green grass and trees and mountains in background chikuma river near shinano basin supports a large range of plant life including over 1 100 species of plant which grow on river bank in river bed or more broadly basin also supports a large range of animal life both in and around river however development of river has threatened continuing existence of a number of different species across country thirty to fifty or higher percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and impact on shinano river system is also clear primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on river construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as introduction of invasive species and pollution have been main causes of ecosystem degradation shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty five percent of japan s fish species around fifty five of 200 fish species living in japan including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish construction of large dams especially in mid and upper reaches of system have significantly affected ability of fish to migrate up and down river and into sea of japan there has also been a significant increase in amount of fishing which takes place in system which is associated with introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into system development of river and human settlement has also resulted in environmental degradation of key fish habitat changes in system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to river some actions have been taken to overcome these issues including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing especially in areas where tsukeba fish shacks popup stores along riverbank are regularly set up river system has also long been home to bird life negative effects of human development have not as significantly affected birds as fish due to more limited changes to bird habitat which includes forests which still remain on surrounding mountains there are more than 130 species of birds which frequent river system these include starlings and ducks as well as migratory birds such as cranes and ibis economy electricity production shinano river system particularly in its upper reaches chikuma river and in sai basin is used for hydroelectric power generation due to steep gradient in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing as a whole 2 618 megawatts while construction of hydroelectric power stations began before world war ii it significantly increased following war these power plants such as power station and 450 000 kilowatt jr east shinano river hydropower station near ojiya supply tokyo there are several hydroelectric power plants operated by tokyo electric power company in river system shin pumped storage station is a significant power plant located on takase river near omachi it boasts second tallest dam and tallest rock filled embankment in japan and an output of 1280 megawatts additionally japan s oldest hydroelectric power plant is located in shinano river system miyashiro power plant no 1 was opened by electric power company in 1904 and has since then been in continual operation currently operated by chubu electric power company tourism tourism is a major industry in shinano river basin as there are a number of attractions in area shinano river system attracts a number of tourists from across country for angling and to experience tsukeba fish shacks which are set up along river bank and bed to cook fish as they are caught hot springs along chikuma river for example from tourists into upper reaches of river high rate of snow in mountains surrounding both chikuma and shinano rivers make them attractive places for snow sports with a number of ski resorts scattered throughout mountains 1998 winter olympics which were held in nagano indicate large number of locations for snow sports in area in addition to these natural attractions human involvement in area is also responsible for making tourism a large part of regional economy every year around 6 5 7 million people visit zenko ji buddhist template in nagano it is believed that visiting template will grant salvation this has resulted in head temple of tendai sect being a significant attraction for tourists throughout its 1 400 year history see also shinano province shinano
