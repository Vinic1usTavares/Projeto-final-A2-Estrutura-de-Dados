attacked and that he was keeping wagons ready in case a precipitate departure was needed lieutenant general lord charles cornwallis in command of british forces in new jersey had had enough of ongoing petite guerre and organized a reprisal action against bound brook outpost according to hessian jager captain johann ewald cornwallis asked him to draft a plan of attack on february 12 after battle of

right bank of raritan aiming to gain control of bridge directly at bound brook while cornwallis took a longer route to ford river above bound brook and thus cut off possibility of retreat in that

to morristown many americans escaped via this route british also captured cannons ammunition and supplies and looted bound brook but returned to new brunswick later that morning aftermath continental army response was immediate washington sent a large force under major general nathanael greene to reoccupy bound brook british had already left by time they arrived greene sent a detachment to harass

campaign season worried that his troops were not yet in place to deal with major british movements two weeks later after no further major activity americans learned that enemy are to take field first of june washington recognized that bound brook itself was a difficult place to defend on may 26 he withdrew garrison and on may 28 he moved part of his army from morristown to a new entrenched camp

hills washington aware that howe had left army s heavy baggage behind was not fooled and refused to move howe then abruptly retreated back to piscataway on june 19 upon which washington had some of his troops give chase and he moved down out of hills ward p 326 a week later howe tried to spring a trap on one of washington s detachments that would have cut american retreat into hills off this
