single demon s blade panik one fourth of hip hop production team collaborated for first time with army of pharaohs on dantai yakuza other producers included paul nice juan muteniac and lecs beats none of whom who had previously collaborated with army of pharaohs critical reception in death reborn received generally positive reviews from music critics mark of exclaim gave album a 7 10 rating calling it a hard hitting slab of jacked up fight music that combines aggressive beats with aggressive yet intricate wordplay he gave praise to producers of album including likes of underground and as he described highly slept on producers stu bangas and vanderslice both of whom crafted classics in blaq poet s 2011 blaq poet society amongst others mag described group as dropping knowledge on songs that resemble a b movie in terms of track title and subject matters omar burgess of hiphopdx rated album 3 5 5 saying that it had sufficient experimentation and raw talent to entice in casual listeners whilst still providing to its loyal fan base according to burgess hardcore material representative of hip hop made in mid to late 90s has been taking a beating in some circles he critiqued groups use of phrases like rap and boom bap and how it epitomizes aggressive rap infused with similes and metaphors stressed with sample based production army of pharaoh s individual and collective careers originated from that era and group rarely give off impression of being threatened by this stigma he went on to say that 16 years later aotp divides their time between concurrently conserving hip hop s golden era and affirming their current importance by competitively out rhyming each other despite various lineup changes and over a decade of seeing rap change rapreviews grant jones gave album a score of 5 5 10 with a music vibe of 5 10 and a lyrical vibe of 6 10 jones described his review as harsh but felt that this album summarises what army of pharaohs has become whilst still crediting group as underground s most prominent supergroup and a modern example of underground hip hop even though group has declared authenticity in their previous and individual albums jones described in death reborn as one that feels most manufactured compared to all their releases he added that production is provided by different producers on each song and vocals lack any real cohesion almost as if each one was recorded on its own emailed and pieced together however he embraced groups collaboration with leaf dog whom he describes as one of best british producers for his work on demon s blade as an explosive track that hits listener after 15 minutes of predictable water treading hip hop noting its resemblance to previous singles seven and battle cry from earlier lps visual camouflage produced by juan muteniac was another noteworthy performance by army of pharaohs according to rapreviews as it appealed character and ultimately binding rappers with a track worth rewinding whilst concluding that rest of album is decidedly average allmusic s david jeffries rated in death reborn 4 5 he praised album as one that immediately feels old school due to significant participation from original member esoteric that unapologetic brutal dude attitude is in full force as midnight burial barks lyrics i m out to make a million kinda hard to do without pussies feelings whilst 13th track of album 7th ghost threatens me peeling your grill off front of our hummer truck because that s what gas were made to do in terms of production jeffries reviewed lead single god particle as one that is a new kind of stomping electro hulk by stu bangas whilst rapper and producer apathy puts a funky harpsichord driven ghost dance below headless ritual he concluded by describing album as flying death ball from phantasm driven by hunger for blood and focused on looking for a forehead to lodge itself into track listing personnel album credits adapted from allmusic apathy composer featured
