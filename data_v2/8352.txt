founded in christchurch by joseph brittan and which existed from 1854 to 1866 canterbury standard was less widely read welcomed sewell s intention of representing electorate again but criticised him for briefness of his statement newspaper s expectation was that sewell should publicly state what his policies were and not just rely on his past representation in parliament on 7 january 1860 sewell placed an advertisement in lyttelton times inviting electors to a meeting at mechanics institute next to christchurch town hall on friday 13 january in an editorial on 11 january lyttelton times implied that sewell s election was a foregone conclusion no other candidates having come forward so sewell would simply be declared elected on nomination night editorial urged sewell to address issue of improved education when he again represented christchurch in parliament on 14 january lyttelton times repeated and increased its criticism of sewell s policies and plans being unknown to public and it talked of option of rejecting sewell note that rejection of a candidate was not possible if he was only one standing for office an editorial said of sewell a thick impenetrable haze has hitherto enveloped his relations with public in 1860 lyttelton times was still based in lyttelton newspaper only moved to christchurch in 1863 and was a bi weekly when it went to print after meeting in town hall previous night editorial expressed disappointment that they could not report on meeting called by sewell this ongoing criticism caused sewell to provide his own report to lyttelton times of meeting with electors editor compared this report with one supplied by their own reporter and containing no substantial differences decided to print sewell s account in next edition on 18 january editorial defended newspaper s critical stance we disclaim all hostile feelings against mr sewell we have not decided to thwart but to understand him editor welcomed sewell s detailed address and expressed general satisfaction with sewell s statements by finally addressing electors sewell removed only objection urged against him thumb upright meeting was held in a room adjoining christchurch s first town hall in high street meeting on 17 january was crowded many attendees were not electors as franchise was attached to land ownership in excess of ps50 or yearly rental over ps10 and resulting roll was only about 160 names long including absentee owners in england there had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose sewell william thomson was elected to chair meeting sewell spoke at length about various issues that he should be elected because of service that he had given canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis that he even delayed his departure to england to resolve issues that he had no conflict of interest with steam ship company that provided new zealand s postal service with england that he did not have land holdings in north island more valuable than holdings in canterbury that he gave qualified support to lyttelton rail tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving stafford ministry so soon after his return to colony last year he disagreed with stafford s government on some issues two most important disagreements were land policy where sewell wanted land revenue to be retained by provincial governments rather than southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in north and native policy where sewell predicted that land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with maori in fact first taranaki war started in march 1860 as a solution sewell suggested possible separation of north island and south island into separate countries this was first time as far as editor of lyttelton times was aware that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician politician who is today known to have favoured separation is julius vogel and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862 lyttelton times argued against objection of many that such an idea had merit for further consideration after sewell had spoken michael hart briefly addressed those present he announced himself as a candidate and vouched his support for lyttelton rail tunnel project nomination nomination meeting was held on 18 january at town hall returning officer john hall read writ richard packer proposed sewell as a candidate and william wilson seconded this hart was proposed by mr sutcliffe and seconded by mr rees both sewell and hart then spoke sewell stressed importance of electing right person with reference to his experience and hart being an unknown quantity hart argued that it was his right to put himself forward whilst hart could not say that he received his qualifications from oxford or cambridge he had obtained his knowledge from university of common sense he further argued that he was as able as packer whom he regarded as a locum tenens for sewell he criticised sewell for not residing in christchurch returning officer john hall after no other candidate came forward asked for a show of hands and declared it to be in favour of sewell upon which hart demanded a poll hall declared that poll be held at town hall following day 19 january from 9 am to 4 pm results 110 votes were cast in election at time voting was done by elector telling election
