central and northern greece grow also in park like centaurea tsunis 1988 p 1 moreover rare species of forests of pindus mountains typical of lower geological layers are campanula viola and silene most important places for gathering of rare plants are northern slopes of peaks of aftia flegga and kapetan all above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of forest in this area is progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved serpentine soil which is dominant in area of pindus national park also favors growing of rare endemic plant species natura 2000 p 9 fauna thumb right fire salamander in pindus national park national park is one of three areas in greece that hosts a population of eurasian brown bears ursus arctos

areas in greece also part of natura 2000 an initiative by governments of european union that aims to protect most seriously threatened habitats and species across europe northern pindus management body together with local forest service is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining ecological value of protected area however until now this target remains elusive because of a lack of expertise and of a science based management plan a great need therefore exists to conduct conservation oriented research that can be translated directly into practical management proposals kati 2009 p 2 core of national park has been declared a reserve zone by european council with human activities such as woodcutting grazing hunting fishing and access by car prohibited in park s buffer zone activities are also controlled in general kati 2009 p 3 most serious danger park faced in past were extensive fires caused by cattle breeders to create meadows for grazing these fires have destroyed large parts of pinus nigra and p heldreichii forests however since 1960 no fire has occurred due to improved protection measures by opening up many forest roads furthermore an observation post was established near avgo peak a potential threat for national park is a state initiative to divert river for construction of a hydroelectric power plant this initiative will have a negative impact on park since a great part of existing forest area will be covered by water resulting in reduction of core zone another danger is high grazing pressure in core area while a number of small coal producing units at outskirts of park have raised a lot of concern recreation pindus national park is considered as one of least visited and least known national parks in europe and it is not
