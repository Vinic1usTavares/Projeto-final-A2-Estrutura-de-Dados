schunemann edina muller and maria kuhn and australia s clare nott once again stewart took opening tip a defensive rebound by kean after germany missed two free throws resulted in gliders scoring first with gauci assisting crispin gliders used same game plan that had defeated united states employing a strong defence against a normally high scoring team at first they were successful with three minutes to go in quarter despite several missed shots australia was ahead 10 4 in last minutes germany scored ten points that gave them a 10 14 lead at quarter time in second quarter germany extended their lead to ten points but kean scored a point from a free throw and then with seconds left on clock stole ball enabling crispin to score so gliders were only seven points behind at half time

assists and four rebounds in end gliders lost by fourteen points 44 58 triscari felt that gliders did not put enough pressure on germans and that their shooting was not accurate enough in particular they scored a dismal one point from twelve attempts from free throw line basketball australia ceo kristina keneally praised gliders efforts gliders have been nothing short of brilliant at paralympic

wales in may 2013 tom kyle was appointed gliders new head coach we have had opportunity to play germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there kean told media it started off really good for us unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that s way it goes sometimes they played a great game we stuck together 12 deep from second buzzer started to that end buzzer and no one gave up i think that we can hold our heads high because of that i guess plan is next four years rio we go one more it was not to be gliders did
