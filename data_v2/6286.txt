wittelsbach class battleships were a group of five pre dreadnought battleships built for german kaiserliche marine imperial navy in early 1900s they were first battleships ordered under second navy law of 1898 part of admiral alfred von tirpitz s fleet expansion program class comprised lead ship and and all five ships were laid down between 1899 and 1900 and were finished by 1904 ships of wittelsbach class were similar in appearance to their predecessors in but had a more extensive armor belt and a flush main deck as opposed to lower quarterdeck of previous class both classes carried a battery of four guns in two twin gun turrets wittelsbach wettin mecklenburg and zahringen served in i squadron for duration of their peacetime careers where they were primarily occupied with training exercises and cruises abroad schwaben was used as a training ship to modernize training unit of german fleet by 1910 with arrival of first dreadnought battleships wittelsbach class ships were removed from front line service and relegated to training duties or simply laid up in reserve with outbreak of world war i in july 1914 ships returned to active service as iv battle squadron seeing guard duty in north sea and limited operations in baltic sea against russian forces these operations included supporting attack on libau in may 1915 and battle of gulf of riga in august that year by late 1915 naval command had decided to decommission five ships owing to a combination of crew shortages for more important vessels and increased threat of british submarines operating in baltic ships were thereafter used as training vessels or in case of mecklenburg a prison ship wittelsbach and schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers in postwar effort to clear up minefields that had been laid in north sea those two ships mecklenburg and wettin were stricken from naval register in early 1920s and thereafter broken up but zahringen was converted into a radio controlled target ship a role she filled until she was bombed and sunk by british bombers in 1944 during world war ii wreck was eventually broken up in 1949 1950 design thumb left lithograph of of c 1900 ships of wittelsbach class were first battleships built under first naval law of 1898 that had been passed through efforts of admiral alfred von tirpitz state secretary of reichsmarineamt imperial navy office they were designed by prof dr dietrich then chief constructor ships represented an incremental improvement over preceding although konteradmiral rear admiral emil felix von bendemann had argued for an increase in main battery from guns of kaiser friedrich iii class to more powerful guns wittelsbach class ships were equipped with same armament of 24 cm guns but were given an additional torpedo tube along with other improvements incremental nature of changes resulted in two classes of battleships that were in most important respects identical providing german fleet with a tactically homogeneous group of ten battleships design staff considered a variety of other alterations from basic kaiser friedrich iii design including replacing four of secondary battery casemate guns with a pair of turret mounted guns and reducing scale of armor protection to increase top speed by though both of these proposals were rejected actual thickness of armor plate was considerably reduced through adoption of krupp cemented armor which had significantly greater protective value compared to early steel manufacturing processes weight savings combined with a 5 percent increase in engine power permitted top speed to be increased by lighter armor also allowed adoption a more comprehensive armored belt which significantly improved new ships defensive capabilities wittelsbachs also differed from preceding ships in their main deck entire length of which was flush in kaiser friedrich iii class ships quarterdeck was cut down general characteristics and machinery thumb left line drawing of wittelsbach class ships of wittelsbach class were long at waterline and overall they had a beam of and a draft of forward wittelsbachs were designed to displace with a standard load and displaced up to at full combat weight wittelsbach class ships hulls were built with transverse and longitudinal steel frames steel hull plates were riveted to structure created by frames each hull was split into 14 watertight compartments and included a double bottom that ran for 70 percent of its length ships were regarded in german navy as excellent sea boats with an easy roll ships rolled up to 30deg with a period of 10 seconds they maneuvered easily at hard rudder ships lost up to 60 percent speed and heeled over 9deg however they suffered from severe vibration particularly at stern at high speeds they also had very wet bows even in moderate seas ships had a crew of 33 officers and 650 enlisted men with an additional 13 officers and 66 enlisted men when serving as squadron flagship while acting as a second command ship 9 officers and 44 enlisted men were added to standard crew wittelsbach and her sisters carried a number of smaller vessels including two picket boats two launches one pinnace two cutters two yawls and two dinghies five ships of wittelsbach class each had three 3 cylinder triple expansion steam engines outer engines drove a three bladed screw that was in diameter central shaft drove a four bladed screw that was slightly smaller at in diameter to produce steam to power engines each ship had six marine type boilers with exception of wettin and mecklenburg which had six thornycroft boilers along with six transverse cylindrical boilers steering was controlled by a single large rudder electrical power was supplied by four generators that each produced at 74 volts although in wittelsbach generators were rated at propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of but on trials five ships had significantly varied performances schwaben slowest ship reached and was only capable of steaming at wettin fastest slightly exceeded her design speed at from they carried in their holds but fuel capacity could be nearly tripled to with usage of additional spaces in ships this provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of armament thumb lithograph of mecklenburg in 1902 ships were nearly identical in armament to preceding kaiser friedrich iii class primary armament consisted of a battery of four 24 cm 9 4 in sk l 40 guns in twin gun turrets one fore and one aft of central superstructure guns were mounted in drh l c 98 turrets which allowed elevation to 30deg and depression to 5deg at maximum elevation guns could hit targets out to guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of each gun was supplied with 85 shells for a total of 340 turrets were hydraulically operated secondary armament included eighteen 15 cm 5 9 inch sk l 40 guns four were mounted in single turrets amidships and rest were mounted in mpl casemates casemates were located at main deck level which made them difficult to work in heavy seas these guns fired armor piercing shells at a rate of 4 to 5 per minute ships carried 120 shells per gun for a total of 2 160 rounds total guns could depress to 7 degrees and elevate to 20 degrees for a maximum range of 13 700 m 14 990 yd shells weighed and were fired at a muzzle velocity of guns were manually elevated and trained ships also carried twelve 8 8 cm 3 45 in sk l 30 quick firing guns also mounted in casemates and pivot mounts these guns were supplied with between 170 and 250 shells per gun these guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 590 mps 1 936 fps their rate of fire was approximately 15 shells per minute guns could engage targets out to gun mounts were manually operated ships gun armament was rounded out by twelve machine cannons ships were also armed with six torpedo tubes all submerged in hull one was in bow another in stern and two on each broadside these weapons were 5 1 m 201 in long and carried an 87 5 kg 193 lb tnt warhead they could be set at two speeds for different ranges at torpedoes had a range of 800 m 870 yd at an increased speed of range was reduced to 500 m 550 yd armor five wittelsbach class battleships were armored with krupp cemented steel their armored decks were thick with sloped sides that ranged in thickness from sloped section of deck connected it to lower edge of main armored belt which was in central citadel where it protected ships ammunition magazines and propulsion system connecting sloped deck to lower edge of belt provided additional protection to ships interiors for shells that penetrated belt forward and aft of main battery turrets belt was reduced to bow and stern were not protected with any armor entire length of belt was backed by 100 mm of teak planking directly above main belt 15 cm casemate guns were protected with a strake of thick steel plating 15 cm guns in turrets were more exposed and therefore slightly better protected their side armor was increased to with gun shields thick 24 cm gun turrets had heaviest armor aboard ship with sides thick and roofs 50 mm thick forward conning tower also had 250 mm armor though its roof was only thick rear conning tower was much less protected its sides were only 140 mm thick roof was 30 mm thick ships s armor layout compared favorably to many foreign contemporaries they were protected similarly to british and s and while their belts were thinner than those of french or russian they did not suffer from unarmored and very vulnerable hulls above belt that characterized french and russian

save schwaben were assigned to i squadron on entering service schwaben was instead assigned to training squadron at tirpitz s insistence at time training squadron s reliance on obsolescent ships hindered its ability to effectively train crews squadron ship that schwaben replaced was ancient ironclad warship which had been launched in 1867 other ships peacetime careers generally consisted of routine fleet squadron and individual training throughout each year squadron and fleet training typically took place in april and may and a major fleet cruise generally followed in june and july after which fleet assembled for annual autumn fleet maneuvers in late august and september major fleet cruises typically went to norwegian waters in company with kaiser wilhelm ii s yacht though in 1908 and 1909 fleet embarked on long distance cruises out into atlantic making visits to mainland spain canary islands and azores portugal ships also frequently steamed to foreign ports on goodwill visits for example in july 1904 i squadron toured britain and netherlands and in july 1905 ships went to denmark and sweden by 1910 ships began to be withdrawn from front line service their place having been taken by dreadnought battleships of and es zahringen was decommissioned in 1910 and placed in reserve division seeing little activity for next four years mecklenburg joined her there following year and was reactivated once briefly in 1912 for annual autumn maneuvers wittelsbach joined schwaben in training squadron in 1911 and wettin replaced schwaben which was by then fleet s gunnery training ship while latter underwent an overhaul in 1912 schwaben thereafter went into reserve world war i thumb wittelsbach c 1910 alt a large warship at rest with light gray smoke drifting up from its two smokestacks following outbreak of world war i in july 1914 five wittelsbach class ships were mobilized into iv battle squadron under command of vice admiral ehrhard schmidt squadron was based in kiel and they conducted several sorties into baltic sea to patrol for russian warships but they saw no action these operations included a failed attempt to rescue light cruiser that had run aground in russian territory in late august and screening joint army navy attack on libau against a possible russian counterattack in may 1915 after libau was seized iv squadron relocated there as it provided an advance base closer to front line ships were also used to guard mouth of elbe in north sea in first year of war wittelsbach class supported battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 but did not take an active role in attack before it broke down in face of determined russian resistance further operations took place in september and october which included iv squadron covering laying of defensive minefields in western baltic by this time manpower shortages began to affect german fleet combined with increased threat of british submarines operating in baltic inability to man more important vessels convinced naval command of need to remove wittelsbachs from service squadron returned to kiel in november where it was re designated as reserve division of baltic sea in january 1916 it was dissolved altogether and ships were reduced to training ships except for mecklenburg which was used as a prison ship ships served in those roles for remainder of war which ended in 1918 postwar fates in 1919 wittelsbach and schwaben were converted into depot ships for f type minesweepers since germany was required by treaty of versailles to clear extensive minefields that had been laid in north sea during war entire class with exception of zahringen were struck from navy list after end of world war i mecklenburg was struck on 27 january 1920 wettin followed on 11 march 1920 and wittelsbach and schwaben were struck on 8 march 1921 four ships were broken up in 1921 1922 zahringen was initially used as a storage hulk in 1920s and was converted into a radio controlled target ship in 1926 1927 superstructure was cut down extensively her hull was subdivided filled with cork and sealed to improve its resistance to flooding royal air force bombers sank ship in gotenhafen in 1944 during
