sutton wick air crash occurred on 5 march 1957 when a blackburn beverley c mk 1 heavy transport aircraft serial number of 53 squadron royal air force crashed at sutton wick drayton berkshire england following a shut down of one engine and partial loss of power on another shortly after take off no 1 engine was shut down as a precautionary measure then whilst on final approach back to raf abingdon no 2 engine failed to respond to throttle inputs aeroplane struck cables and trees 18 minutes after lifting off of 17 passengers and five crew aboard all but four were killed in accident two people on ground were also killed an investigation found that a non return valve in fuel system had been installed wrong way round causing two of engines to be starved of fuel technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting valve was charged under air force act following accident non return valve was re designed so it could not be installed incorrectly two raf officers who took part in rescue after crash were highly praised for refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among wreckage flight history thumb a blackburn beverley c mk 1 heavy transport aircraft of raf similar to that involved in accident served in a number of raf squadrons between 1957 and 1967 secretary of state for air george ward described crash to house of commons beverley took off from raf abingdon near abingdon on thames bound for raf akrotiri in cyprus it was carrying cargo a relief crew eight raf police dog handlers and eight police dogs there was low cloud at visibility was less than and an easterly wind of as aircraft climbed no 1 engine on port wing developed a fuel leak flight crew responded by shutting down engine and feathering its propeller flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to raf abingdon controller alerted emergency services on ground a short time later cockpit instruments alerted flight crew to a large loss of fuel from no 2 fuel tank second of four such tanks in port wing in an effort to stop leak crew de activated fuel cocks and boosters for no 2 tank but left them on for no 1 tank as beverley turned on to final approach for raf abingdon crew attempted to increase power from remaining three bristol centaurus engines but no 2 engine also on port wing failed to respond and aircraft began to lose speed and height knowing he could not reach airfield captain tried to land in a field however aircraft became uncontrollable and struck a number of high tension cables and a group of elm trees that tore port wing from fuselage on impact with ground aircraft destroyed a caravan and a prefabricated house before somersaulting and crashing upside down john dawson was in garden of red lion at drayton and described what he witnessed thumb a group of 1950s commonwealth war graves commission raf graves in abingdon new cemetery including seven victims of sutton wick crash aircraft crashed at 11 00 am 18 minutes after take off near sutton wick south of abingdon 50 year old muriel binnington lived in prefabricated house eyewitness eric webb said it was swept away and she must have been killed instantly a 19 year old called j maltravers from southern electricity board was in one of houses to read electricity meter and was also killed tail section of aircraft crashed on a farmhouse near main wreckage trapping and seriously injuring margaret stanton in kitchen of house she was later freed by emergency workers distance by air from abingdon to akrotiri is at least at beverley s cruising speed of flight could be expected take about 12 hours plane was therefore carrying a large amount of fuel and on impact this rapidly caught fire a newspaper reported wreckage was scattered over three quarters of a mile and force of explosion sent main part of fuselage and tailplane tearing back over field into farmyard carrying with it an inferno fuel and debris emergency workers worked for several hours to free survivors and bodies from charred fuselage in all two civilians on ground three crew 15 passengers and a number of raf police dogs were killed in initial impact and ensuing fire two crew two passengers and one raf police dog survived rescue local farm workers were first on scene eric webb was stacking hay when he realised that aircraft was about to crash he ran to help he was joined by p richards who had been working on a tractor in a farmyard less than 100 yards from crash site house of one of farmworkers was at crash site he first ran to his house where he found that his wife had survived and was safe richards rescued one man from wreckage and put him by an apple tree another survivor was on fire in a contemporary interview one of rescuers says survivor came running across farmyard 1957 television report filmed at site including an interview with one of rescuers 60 years later richards said he rescued survivor from aircraft accounts agree that rescuers put survivor in a horse trough to extinguish flames and cool his burns webb said we could hear pilot shouting for help he and richards climbed into burning wreckage and rescued pilot who warned them that there were police dogs in cages in plane that might be dangerous if they were loose as their handlers were in rear of plane pilot asked webb and richards to help 10 men in tail of aircraft but as richards told a local newspaper this was just a mass of flames and we could not get near it richards found one dog alive in its cage and released it webb found another suffering from burns and hiding behind a farmyard an rspca inspector later arrived and took injured dog to a vet in abingdon one badly injured dog was put down six dogs were found dead in wreckage fire engines from raf abingdon and berkshire fire brigade station at didcot fought blaze ambulances took four injured survivors of crash to radcliffe infirmary in oxford they were raf men leonard andrews victor and henry ludlow from aircraft and civilian margaret stanton who had been trapped in her house another man was rescued alive but died on way to hospital oxford city police force deployed eight officers to clear traffic to help ambulances to reach infirmary later that day infirmary described three men as dangerously ill raf abingdon s chaplain rev stanley harrison and medical officer flying officer charles evans joined rescue an hour and a half after crash they rescued surviving raf police dog they continued rescue work for three hours and removed 14 bodies from wreckage an raf document states at one stage a calor gas cylinder bottle exploded near these officers and fire thereupon began to gain ground undeterred by this they continued their search of wreckage until it was clear that there could be no survivors thumb cwgc graves of three raf victims of crash in roman catholic churchyard of our lady and st edmund in abingdon deaths 10 of raf personnel killed in crash are buried at abingdon seven are in abingdon new cemetery in spring road other three are in churchyard of roman catholic church of our lady and st edmund in oxford road one survivor of crash who had suffered major burns later committed suicide investigation thumb blackburn beverley when it was at raf museum london a board of inquiry investigated crash and found it was caused by loss of power from nos 1 and 2 engines both mounted on port wing george ward told house of commons that four fuel tanks on port side of beverley feed into a collector box from which two port engines are fed from available evidence including inspections of part of aircraft s fuel system it is clear that a non return valve between no 1 port tank and collector box had been fitted in reverse and that fuel supply from nos 3 and 4 port tanks were switched off throughout flight ward continued saying that loss of power from no 1 was caused by it being shut down as a precautionary measure and fuel starvation to no 2 engine was caused by an incorrectly fitted non return valve in supply line from no 1 fuel tank no 2 fuel tank had been isolated and two smaller fuel tanks in port wing had not been selected during flight tradesman who had fitted valve and his supervisor were prosecuted and charged and technician was court martialled for negligence and punished with a reprimand board also noted that some fuel was available from two smaller tanks but they were not used during flight and that captain must bear some responsibility for not using those tanks ward said however that owing to nature of flight amount of fuel in two smaller tanks was not large and it can only be assumed that captain had no reason to believe that both port engines would not operate satisfactorily off two main port tanks individually captain was killed in accident and no allegations were brought against him or any of his crew aftermath in response to disaster at sutton wick non return valve was redesigned to make such an error impossible aviation author graham perry wrote that after crash airworthiness design standards were changed so that threads at either end of all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other items like a non return valve simply cannot now be assembled in wrong sense nevertheless perry wrote one would be amazed how many people have still tried to do so in forty seven years since most realising their mistake after looking in manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible awards for their parts in rescue rev harrison was made an obe flying officer evans was made an mbe and eric webb was awarded bem and an nfu medal for heroism raf praised harrison and evans for courage and resourcefulness of a high order refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among wreckage board of inquiry also praised a mrs smith of abingdon investigators praised efforts of berkshire constabulary retrieved 17 july 2009 monuments newark air museum on
