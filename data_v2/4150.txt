julia louis dreyfus character elaine benes makes a bet with jerry about being able to buy a gun alt a woman with black hair tied in a knot wearing a black dress at a crowded event staff writer larry charles had written a script for an episode entitled bet in episode which was also known as gun elaine would bet against jerry on ease of buying a handgun to protect herself episode s subplot revolved around jerry s neighbour kramer returning from a vacation in puerto rico claiming he had sex with a stewardess on his flight home george and jerry would remain skeptical and make a bet with him eventually george jerry and elaine would go to airport to check if kramer was telling truth in writing bet charles had attempted to make a funny dark themed episode sets for episode were built bobbi jo lathan was cast as flight attendant lucy merrit and ernie sabella was cast as gun salesman mo korn who was described in script as overweight greasy slow and low key however during read through of episode it was negatively received by cast and crew members both alexander and director tom cherones felt episode s gun content was too provocative when she read a scene that referenced assassinations of john f kennedy and william mckinley louis dreyfus turned to alexander and stated i m not gonna do this though they did not want to cast started rehearsing after twenty minutes they convinced cherones to talk to charles on his way to charles office cherones bumped into nbc executive glenn with whom he talked to charles eventually agreeing not to film episode commenting on episode charles stated you know it would have been an interesting show but we couldn t solve funny problem of it it never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and because of that balance was off and darkness kind of enveloped it and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been so it was disappointing but also understandable both lathan and sabella were given roles in later episodes lathan appeared as patti in season three episode stranded while sabella was cast as greasy naked guy in subway also for show s third season phone message series co creator larry david co wrote episode with seinfeld in two days as with cancellation of bet they had little time to write script george s storyline was largely based on david s personal experiences of leaving phone messages to women that would mean end of a relationship david had previously written a sketch for saturday night live regarding a man who went into his girlfriend s house to erase her answering machine sketch was never produced allowing david to use its storyline for seinfeld episode jerry s storyline was based on seinfeld s own predicaments as he extremely disliked cotton dockers commercial discussed in episode a few changes were made to first few drafts of script additional dialogue between george and jerry regarding dates during 1850s was removed for timing purposes during his date with donna jerry would mention his remark about ponies in earlier episode pony remark but this was later changed to remark about leaving a note when committing suicide initially kramer s first name was revealed in episode though information was removed from eventual script idea of revealing kramer s first name would be further exploited in season six episode switch gretchen german was cast as
