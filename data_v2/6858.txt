wide isaacs 1862 p 111 an earlier account by charles boileau elliot describes arabs as falling into two main groups and bedouins and identifies latter with ishmael and qedar as follows bedouins still retain wandering habits of their father ishmael their hand is against every man and every man s hand is against them wild desert is their home ground their pallet and their canopy sky or if luxurious

qedarite control of trade routes and access they afforded persians translated into what herodotus described as a friendly relationship language qedarites are among a number of north arabian tribes whose interactions with tribes beginning in 8th century bce resulted in cultural exchanges between these two large semitic groups early arab tribal groups like qedarites spoke old arabic but as arabic

greenfield et al 2001 p 158 religion religious worship among qedar as was case for most of inhabitants of arabia until 7th century ce was polytheistic its practices and beliefs included an emphasis on

hisham ibn muhammad al kalbi 737 819 ce established a genealogical link between ishmael and muhammad using writings that drew on biblical and sources and ancient oral traditions of arabs his book al abundance of kinship seems to posit that people known as arabs are all descendants of ishmael ibn kathir 1301 1373 writes all arabs of hijaz are descendants of nebaioth and qedar medieval jewish sources also usually identified qedar with arabs and or muslims alfonso 2007 p 137 note 36 according to author and scholar irfan shahid western scholars viewed this kind of genealogical ishmaelism with suspicion seeing it as a late islamic fabrication because of confusion in islamic times which made it such a capacious term as to include inhabitants of south as well as north of arabian peninsula but shorn of this extravagance concept is much more modest in its denotation and in sober sources it applies only to certain groups among arabs of pre islamic times some important statements to this effect were made by muhammed when he identified some arabs as ishmaelites and others as not shahid 1989 p 335 336 ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of arabs of western arabia prominence is given in arab genealogical accounts to first two of ishmael s twelve sons nebaioth and qedar qaydar who are also prominently featured in genesis account it is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern arabia and were historically most important of twelve tribes in accounts tracing ancestry of muhammad back to ma ad ibn adnan and from there to adam arab scholars alternate with some citing line as through nebaioth others qedar al in boudreau et al 1998 p 219 footnotes place names
