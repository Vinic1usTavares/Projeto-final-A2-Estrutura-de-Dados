reign of aelfwald in middle of 8th century yorke kings and kingdoms p 68 when east anglia was first mentioned by bede in his ecclesiastical history of english people it was a powerful kingdom ruled by raedwald died about 624 according to bede raedwald was recognised as exercising dominance or imperium over southern anglo saxon kingdoms a position that was assured when he gave his loyalty and support to edwin of northumbria who was at that time a fugitive at east anglian court and together they defeated aethelfrith of northumbria on banks of river idle a tributary of trent raedwald was converted to christianity in kent at invitation of king aethelberht but under influence of his pagan wife his church contained both a christian and a pagan altar upon his death in around 624 raedwald

edwin of northumbria and paulinus of york edwin s bishop were able to persuade eorpwald to accept an alien cult whose authority rested outside east anglia eorpwald may have been sponsored by king edwin at his baptism which would have resulted in edwin being acknowledged as eorpwald s lord east angles may also have been baptised as a people which would have undermined eorpwald s authority as

brother sigeberht and his kinsman ecgric scholars have been unable to determine regnal dates of several kings of this period including that of ricberht with any certainty kirby english kings p 66 higham surmises that ricberht s ability to rule for three years at a time when edwin was overlord among anglo saxons implies that ricberht was supported by east angles in overthrowing eorpwald whom they regarded as overly compliant towards northumbrian king it has been speculated by michael wood and other historians that ricberht may have been interred in sutton hoo ship burial near wuffingas centre of authority at but most experts consider raedwald to be a more likely candidate wood in search of dark ages p 66 martin carver has used evidence of what he identifies as iconic pagan practices
