thumb upright marcus tullius cicero author of consolatio consolatio consolation is a lost philosophical work written by marcus tullius cicero in year 45 bc work had been written to soothe his grief after death of his daughter tullia which had occurred in february of same year not much is known about work although it seems to have been inspired by greek philosopher crantor s ancient work de luctu on grief and its structure was probably similar to a series of letter correspondences between servius sulpicius rufus and cicero fragments of work survive having been quoted by lactantius and jerome makes note of work in a consolatory letter to heliodorus of altino a popular piece of writing until its loss consolatio is widely accepted as distinct work that transmitted earlier consolatio literary tradition to romans of late republic in 1583 italian scholar carlo sigonio claimed to have discovered a non fragmentary version of consolatio although most scholars now agree that this work was a fake with modern stylometric methods backing this up background marcus tullius cicero january 3 106 bc december 7 43 bc was an ancient roman philosopher and politician famous for his oratory skills he came from a wealthy municipal family of roman equestrian order and is widely considered one of rome s greatest orators and one of premier prose stylists during golden age of latin rawson 1975 p 303 haskell 1964 pp 300 301 forsyth et al 1999 pp 375 400 tullia august 5 79 bc or 78 bc february 45 bc cicero s daughter died in winter of 45 bc after giving birth to her second son this caused cicero to go into a period of deep mourning treggiari 2007 p 13 cole 2014 p 1 cicero decided to stay with his friend titus pomponius atticus for a time during which he perused atticus s library reading any and all books that dealt with overcoming grief mackendrick 1989 p 106 unsatisfied with what he found he relocated to his villa at where he composed consolatio it was during this time that he also wrote famed and now lost dialogue hortensius taylor 1963 p 488 cicero later opined that consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness 2012 p 94 cicero de divinatione 2 3 contents pliny elder quotes cicero in preface to his naturalis historia as saying i follow greek philosopher crantor in my consolatio in consolatione pliny elder naturalis historia preface 22 centuries later christian theologian jerome in a consolation letter to heliodorus of altino concerning death of st makes a similar reference writing that consolatio was heavily based on crantor s ancient work de luctu on grief some have suggested that cicero followed crantor exclusively or even principally when composing consolatio but david scourfield repudiates this view arguing it was more likely that cicero s consolatio simply agreed with crantor rather than slavishly duplicated his work paul mackendrick argues that general outline for consolatio can be deduced based both on structure used by servius sulpicius rufus in a consolation letter sent to cicero following tullia s death as well as structure of cicero s reply mackendrick 1989 p 107 from snippets that remain of work it would appear that piece was addressed to cicero himself a novel part of consolatio seems to be cicero s idea that tullia deserves to be deified as a god cicero notes that in order for his plan to work her deification must both be approved of by gods as well as roman public in order to win over public he writes that he will build tullia a memorial in a well known location cole 2014 pp 1 3 cicero also lists a number of famous individuals who have been deified to justify his proposed apotheosis of tullia only extant pieces of consolatio are fragments one of which was preserved by cicero himself in his tusculanae disputationes mackendrick 1989 p 108 seven other fragments were preserved by early christian author lactantius in his work institutiones divine institutes lactantius used excerpts from consolatio both to point out futility of paganism as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of christianity without them even realizing it lactantius criticized what cicero wrote but he also applauded cicero at times for bible says mackendrick 1989 pp however lines preserved by lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context mackendrick notes that lactantius was using partial quotation s in order to frame what cicero wrote so that lactantius could more easily refute his ideas another important reference to work can be found in aforementioned letter by jerome addressed to heliodorus jerome noted that consolatio contained references to men who showed equal fortitude in sorrow and war namely quintus fabius maximus cato elder quintus gaius calpurnius piso lucius junius brutus quintus augur quintus marcius rex publius licinius crassus dives and gnaeus aufidius orestes as well as members of metellus and marcellus families mackendrick 1989 pp legacy consolatio was of major importance and scourfield argues that it is distinct work that introduced greek consolatio tradition to romans of late republic scourfield 1993 pp 19 22 work may have survived well into 15th century st ambrose traversari claimed in his to have discovered a short work about consolation de consolatione at perugia italy in 1432 ad robinson 1893 p 197 forgery thumb now considered a forgery pseudo ciceronian consolatio was discovered by carlo sigonio in 1582 in 1583 italian scholar carlo sigonio claimed to have discovered a non fragmentary version of consolatio while this news was met with excitement at first scholars after reading work began to argue that manuscript was a fraud with humanist antonio riccoboni being among most vocal forsyth et al 1999 p 376 however sigonio continued to defend work until his death even mentioning in two different orations his belief in truthfulness of text scholar latino latini however later claimed in a letter that sigonio had admitted to forgery on his deathbed although truth of this statement is unknown by and large academic community concluded that version of consolatio discovered was not genuine and document is now known as pseudo ciceronian consolatio sage 1910 pp 7 9 25 46 despite gradual condemnation of work and accusation that sigonio had created it himself there were some holdouts robinson ellis in 1893 argued that pseudo ciceronian consolatio while probably not a genuine work of cicero s was not a forgery by sigonio he reasoned that because st ambrose traversari had claimed to find a copy of work so close to its rediscovery by sigonio in 1583 it was possible that sigonio had simply found text he then considered hypothesis also discussed by evan taylor sage sage 1910 p 26 that because pseudo ciceronian consolatio contained all of extant fragments of cicero that are to be found in lactantius s work actual consolatio had been lost in distant past and quietly replaced at some point by an imitation this falsely attributed work ellis wrote could have then been read by those late antiquity authors who quoted cicero such as lactantius augustine and jerome it was this false consolatio so hypothesis goes that was rediscovered by sigonio who also unwittingly believed it also to be genuine finally ellis argued that because sigonio was a man of high character who had spent much of his life editing fragments of cicero for sigonio to stoop to forgery would have been completely out of character in 1999 richard forsyth david holmes and emily tse used linguistic techniques to test origin of pseudo ciceronian consolatio forsyth holmes and tse focused their research on two types of latin cicero s writing and ciceronianism a style of new latin popular in fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that sought to emulate style of cicero three scholars argued that if pseudo ciceronian consolatio were devoid of ciceronianism that is to say new it could be accepted as a genuine work of cicero forsyth holmes and tse collected six classical latin authors viz cicero julius caesar cornelius nepos gaius sallustius crispus lucius annaeus seneca and publius cornelius tacitus and five new latin authors viz sigonio piero vettori marc antoine muret bernadino di loredan and riccoboni and compared them using stylometric methods three concluded that text of pseudo ciceronian consolatio is extremely uncharacteristic of cicero and indeed that text is much more likely to have been written during renaissance than in classical times forsyth et al 1999 p 376 study also provided evidence that pseudo ciceronian consolatio matched more closely with sigonio s rather than any of other new latin writers not he penned document forsyth et al 1999 p notes references bibliography category lost literature category philosophical works by cicero
