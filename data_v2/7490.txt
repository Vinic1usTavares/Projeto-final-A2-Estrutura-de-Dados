is introduced early on as a theme to capture a more riotous and disorganised reality and use of journal as novel s literary form is explicitly pointed to as developing this theme we keep a journal to entrap collection of selves that forms us individual human being narrator explains in an article in guardian boyd confirmed this thesis that we are an anthology a composite of many selves is a theme

heart blockquote boyd sets mountstuart s life within its context tracing grand arc of events during 20th century by depicting mountstuart as swept along in flow of history he serves in world war ii sees cultural revolution in 1950s and 60s and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around world rather than being re told in hindsight their importance in context historical events are seen through petty lens of every day living for example in an entry from 1920s mountstuart notes coffee with land fothergill at cadena she was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes we talked a little stiffly about mussolini and italy and i was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than i giles foden heart of matter guardian 20 april 2002 retrieved 5 september 2010 boyd said he was partially inspired by generation of english writers who matured between wars i am fascinated by life and work of that generation of english writers who were born at beginning of century and reached maturity by time of world war ii people like evelyn waugh and graham greene and anthony powell obviously but also less well known writers henry green lawrence durrell cyril connolly and william last two in particular lurk closely behind logan both real and imagined characters are blended into this context where historical personages are typically used to concentrate historical significance of a novel s plot mountstuart s encounters with them are superficial leaving only an impression of both parties small mindedness john mullan found conceit most effective during new york journal where boyd satirises figures in abstract expressionist movement during 1950s whose characters seem almost beyond invention genre and style novel is narrated in first person through a series of nine intimes kept by mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85 eder roger evelyn waugh kissed me new york times 16 february 2003 accessed 9 august 2010 french literary journals always published posthumously are often extremely candid accounts particularly of author s sexual life boyd himself a francophile includes masturbation prostitution and mountstuart s three marriages while boyd had earlier written work in form of memoir or biography a journal is different for a start it s written without benefit of hindsight so there isn t same feeling you get when you look back and add shape to a life there are huge chunks missing novel s grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism each journal covers a different period of mountstuart s life and they are usually geographically named school journal london i etc boyd varied narrator s tone in each to demonstrate changes in mountstuart s character in first london journal he is according to boyd a modernist aesthete becoming a world weary cynic in new york and finding serene and elegiac serenity in final french journal to support book s historical themes and documentary premise there is a feigned editorial apparatus an index listing real people and their relation to mountstuart alongside fictional characters an editor s introduction by boyd an authorial preface by mountstuart and a list of works attributed to mountstuart mullan john imaginary friends guardian 28 october 2006 accessed 25 september 2010 an additional stylistic feature is anonymous editor boyd who introduces book and offers explanatory footnotes cross references and attempts at dating since a journal is written from perspective of each day mountstuart s moods change as events affect him form lends itself to since author narrator inevitably cannot see overall structure of story mullan john notes to self guardian 21 october 2006 london accessed 9 august 2010 plot lines which fizzle and fade emphasise theme of multiple selves throughout life boyd adds other aspects to work such as parenthetical musings that are never answered to re enforce style his tone of voice gradually changes as he ages boyd wanted style to reflect major theme that we change and grow throughout life i wanted literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so voice subtly changes as you read on from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic to sage and serene octogenarian and so forth critical reception richard eder praised any human heart in new york times william boyd is multifaceted and inventive and he plays a deep game under his agile card tricks christopher tayler in london review of books called characterisation of mountstuart weak and wondered if he was merely a device through which boyd could write pastiche about 20th century writers boyd hustles you through to end despite all this but it s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making journey in atlantic monthly brooke allen liked mountstuart character he is far more generous forgiving and free than most of us he is also more amusing and more amused by life thus making

complimented opening sections as nicely layered with pretensions of a particular precocious kind of student but criticised predictability of mountstuart s walk on part in literary history and

history or emotion adams tim observer lunch with baader meinhoff 14 april 2002 accessed 10 august 2010 tom cox in daily telegraph disagreed he praised characterisation calling mountstuart a man whose fragile egotism and loose fitting story has you frequently forgetting you re reading fiction and even more frequently forgetting you re reading at all giles foden in guardian found new york art scene sections weakest saying they puncture realism boyd has so carefully built up in rest of novel michiko kakutani agreed that mountstuart s youth was well evoked but that description of his retirement and poverty was as carefully observed and emotionally resonant kakutani michiko a witness to century just looking out for himself 14 february 2003 new york times book review accessed 10 august 2010
