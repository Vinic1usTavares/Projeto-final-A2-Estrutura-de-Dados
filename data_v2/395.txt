thumb left 300px map of somerset coal canal somerset coal canal originally known as somersetshire coal canal was a narrow canal in england built around 1800 its route began in basins at paulton and timsbury ran to nearby camerton over two aqueducts at dunkerton through a tunnel at combe hay then via midford and monkton combe to limpley stoke where it joined kennet and avon canal this link gave somerset coalfield which at its peak contained 80 collieries access east toward london longest arm was long with 23 locks from midford an arm also ran via writhlington to radstock with a tunnel at wellow a feature of canal was variety of methods used at combe hay to overcome height differences between upper and lower reaches initially by use of caisson locks when this method failed an inclined plane trackway and finally a flight of 22 conventional locks radstock arm was never commercially successful and was replaced first with a tramway in 1815 and later incorporated into somerset and dorset joint railway paulton route flourished for nearly 100 years and was very profitable carrying high tonnages of coal for many decades this canal helped carry fuel that powered nearby city of bath by 1880s coal production declined as various pits either ran out of coal or were flooded and subsequently closed in 1896 main pump at dunkerton which maintained canal water level failed resultant lowering in level meant that only small loads could be transported which reduced revenue thus canal company could not afford a replacement pump canal became disused after 1898 and officially closed in 1902 being sold off to various railway companies who were expanding their networks in september 2014 restoration work began on canal section from paulton to radford with aim of restoring entire canal to navigation in future largest canal drydock in england has been revealed at paulton culverts and bridges nearby are being reinstated or rebuilt and about of canal from paulton to radford has been in water since summer 2015 history background thumb house at tucking mill next to canal reputedly lived in by william smith though this is disputed in 1763 coal was discovered in radstock and mining began in area however transport was a major problem because of poor state of roads this cost and potential for cheaper delivery of coal from south wales via monmouthshire canal led to proposal for a canal which could transport coal to bath and wiltshire initial surveys were conducted during 1793 by william jessop and william smith under direction of john rennie who presented report on 14 october 1793 estimating cost of construction of canal at ps80 000 smith who also worked at mearns pit at high littleton made original observations leading to his important stratification theory by observing dips in geological strata through which canal was cut simon winchester map that changed world william smith and birth of modern geology 2001 new york harpercollins smith became surveyor to company but was dismissed in april 1799 apparently because he had used his position as surveyor to buy a local house at advantageous terms clew 1970 38 he then set himself up in a private practice in bath but was re engaged by company in 1811 to provide advice when repairs became necessary to canal bed clew 1970 74 thumb derelict lock next to caisson house combe hay canal was authorised by an act of parliament entitled an act for making and maintaining a navigable canal with certain railways and stone roads from several collieries in county of somerset to communicate with intended kennet and avon canal in parish of bradford in county of wilts of 1794 and further detailed surveys were carried out by robert whitworth and john sutcliffe who was then appointed as chief engineer construction in may 1795 tenders were invited for first section to be built from meadows near or near paulton to in parish of camerton in june 1795 a contractor houghton son from shropshire started terminus at paulton meadows using local labour this first section of canal was completed on monday 1 october 1798 first load of coal along canal was delivered to bath via dunkerton some 14 collieries at timsbury paulton were connected to their respective basins in meadow terminus by tramways this involved construction of three tramway bridges over cam brook a further bridge at upper radford was required over canal at this point tramways connected withy mills and radford workings course of cam brook was modified at various places to protect canal from erosion in 1799 william whitmore and his partner norton offered to build a balance or geometrical lift without payment on condition that if successful they were to have ps17 300 and a royalty of 4 pence per ton of goods passed design of caisson lock at combe hay was not a success on 15 february 1798 first descent failed mr weldon inventor made one successful descent on 7 june and said i will undertake to pass 1 500 tons of goods through lock in 12 hrs tenders were invited on 28 june for further constructions two more attempts to use caisson lock took place on 11 april and 2 may only latter was successful by 22 august 1799 second rebuilding of caisson had been abandoned it was replaced by three locks and an inclined plane trackway but trackway was not successful either and company proposed to raise more money to finance building of a flight of 19 locks to replace it use of which would incur an additional toll of one shilling per ton on all traffic this was vigorously opposed by owners of kennet and avon canal and wilts and berks canal on grounds that price of coal to their customers would be too high after negotiation company obtained a new act of parliament on 30 april 1802 which authorised formation of a separate body called lock fund of somerset coal canal company with powers to raise sum of ps45 000 money was raised by kennet and avon wilts and berks and somerset coal canal each contributing ps15 000 and one shilling surcharge was to be levied until capital had been repaid after which it would cease l j dalby 2000 wilts and berks canal oakwood press act set tonnage rates to be charged thumb somerset coal canal at dundas

boats would be floated into a one ended lock gate closed and water drained this left boat resting on a cradle suspended by angled rods attached to a beam which took weight of boat one pound weights were then added to a pan with one pound being equivalent to one hundredweight until system was in equilibrium and weight was recorded weigh house at midford was one of only four known to have been built in england and wales operation canal opened in 1805 and was used for passenger traffic as well as coal in 1814 benedictine monks who came to downside abbey are said to have used canal for last stage of their journey another cargo carried by canal was limestone from combe down peak level of cargo carried was in 1838 at 138 403 tons resulting in over ps17 000 of tolls being paid cargoes of over 100 000 tons were common until 1870s when decline in output of coal from various somerset along with competition from railways dramatically reduced canal s profitability when main pump at dunkerton failed it was not replaced and there was not sufficient water for continual operation of locks canal went into liquidation in 1894 it closed in 1898 and was finally abandoned in 1904 when it was sold to great western railway for ps2 000 and used as a branch of bristol and north somerset railway closure caused problems across somerset coalfield especially to pits along paulton branch which had relied on canal for transportation radstock branch when radstock branch was constructed it was intended to link it to main line of paulton branch at midford which was at a lower level at this point lock fund created in 1802 was to have paid for construction of locks but because there was little regular traffic on branch company built one lock an aqueduct over midford brook and a short tramway to bridge gap this contributed to economic failure of branch and its replacement by a tramway in 1815 tramway was laid along former canal s towpath it was single line with passing places every

over route is which meant problems with supplying adequate water cam brook was an inadequate source of water above camerton and mills along it had water rights each narrow boat travelling through series of locks 22 of them each deep with a 25 ton load of coal caused 85 tons of water to be discharged into brook below locks as a result canal was designed with all 22 locks in one flight near combe hay and a pumping engine to raise water from cam this was first canal to entirely depend on pumping a potential solution to water supply problem was use of caisson locks as proposed by robert weldon three of which could replace 22 conventional locks because it wasted no water however technology had only been tried in a one third scale prototype each lock was long and deep and contained a closed wooden box which could take a barge this box moved up and down in deep pool of water which never left lock box was demonstrated to prince regent later george iv but had engineering problems and was never successful commercially or built elsewhere it was temporarily replaced with an inclined plane by benjamin outram who had successfully installed inclined planes at peak forest canal in derbyshire whilst 22 locks and a boulton watt steam pumping station capable of lifting 5 000 tons of water in 12 hours were built to latest design with metal plate clad wooden gates construction thumb

missing and abutments were found to be in poor condition an earth bund between abutments carried public footpath and stopped water draining from paulton and timsbury basins a new earth bund was installed about west of terminus bridge to stop water and allow work to continue on bridge during excavations a drainage culvert was discovered about west of terminus bridge work resumed in september
