with pure white plumage a pink bill orange legs and feet an unusually large keel and a horizontal stance with its body parallel to ground precise origins of breed are unclear but raising white ducks became popular in aylesbury buckinghamshire england in 18th century owing to demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts over 19th century selective breeding for size shape and colour led to aylesbury duck duck rearing became a major industry in aylesbury in 19th century ducks were bred on farms in surrounding countryside fertilised eggs were brought into town s duck end where local residents would rear ducklings in their homes opening of a railway to aylesbury in 1839 enabled cheap and quick transport to markets of london and duck rearing became highly profitable by 1860s duck rearing industry began to move out of aylesbury into surrounding towns and villages and industry in aylesbury itself began to decline in 1873 pekin duck was introduced to united kingdom although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of aylesbury duck pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise many breeders switched to pekin duck or to aylesbury pekin crosses by beginning of 20th century competition from pekin duck inbreeding and disease in pure bred aylesbury strain and rising cost of duck food meant aylesbury duck industry was in decline first world war badly damaged remaining duck industry in buckinghamshire wiping out small scale producers and leaving only a few large farms disruption caused by second world war further damaged industry by 1950s only one significant flock of aylesbury ducks remained in buckinghamshire and by 1966 there were no duck breeding or rearing businesses of any size remaining in aylesbury itself although there is only one surviving flock of pure aylesbury ducks in united kingdom and breed is critically endangered in united states aylesbury duck remains a symbol of town of aylesbury and appears on coat of arms of aylesbury and on club badge of aylesbury united origins and description precise origin of aylesbury duck is unclear before 18th century duck breeds were rarely recorded in england and common duck bred for farming was a domesticated form of wild mallard common duck varied in colour and as in wild white ducks would occasionally occur white ducks were particularly prized as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts in 18th century selective breeding of white common ducks led to a white domestic duck generally known as english white since at least 1690s ducks had been farmed in aylesbury and raising english whites became popular in aylesbury and surrounding villages by 1813 it was remarked that ducks form a material article at market from aylesbury and places adjacent they are white and as it seems of an early breed they are bred and brought up by poor people and sent to london by weekly carriers duck farmers of aylesbury went to great lengths to ensure ducks retained their white colouring keeping them clear of dirty water soil with a high iron content and bright sunlight all of which could ducks feathers over time selective breeding of english white for size and colour gradually led to development of aylesbury duck a rather large duck breed aylesbury duck has pure white plumage and bright orange legs and feet its legs are placed midway along body and it stands with its underside parallel to ground giving it a body described as boat shaped it has a relatively long and thin swan like neck and a long pink bill which comes straight out from head an aylesbury duckling incubates in egg for 28 days until eight weeks after hatching time of their first moult ducks and drakes females and males are almost indistinguishable after moulting males have two or three curved tail feathers and a fainter huskier quack than female by one year of age females and males grow to an average weight of respectively although males can reach around unlike rouen duck other popular meat variety in england in 19th century aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early november aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after hatching weigh up to large enough to eat but still young and extremely tender consequently their meat came onto market from february onwards after close of game season but before earliest spring chickens were on sale rouen ducks whose mallard like coloration made them less valuable lay eggs from early february and take six months to grow large enough to eat as a consequence aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in spring and summer and rouen ducks in autumn and winter aylesbury duck farming unlike most livestock farming in england at this time duck breeders and duck rearers of aylesbury formed two separate groups subscription required stock ducks i e ducks kept for breeding were kept on farms in countryside of aylesbury vale away from polluted air and water of town this kept ducks healthy and meant a higher number of fertile eggs stock ducks would be chosen from ducklings hatched in march with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females at any given time females would be kept for around a year before mating typically to an older male they would then generally be replaced to reduce problems of inbreeding stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during day and would swim in local ponds which although privately owned were treated as common property among duck breeders breeders would label their ducks with markings on neck or head stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects supplemented by greaves residue left after rendering of animal fat as ducks lay their eggs at night ducks would be brought indoors overnight right thumb 300px stock aylesbury ducks at weston turville circa 1900 alt pond with a large number of white ducks swimming in it and standing on grass around it female aylesbury ducks would not sit still for 28 days necessary for their eggs to hatch and as a consequence breeders would not allow mothers to sit on their own eggs instead fertilised eggs would be collected and transferred to duckers of aylesbury s duck end rearing duckers of aylesbury would buy eggs from breeders or be paid by a breeder to raise ducks on their behalf and would raise ducklings in their homes between november and august as a secondary source of income duckers were typically skilled labourers who invested surplus income in ducklings many of tasks related to rearing ducks would be carried out by women of household particularly care of newly hatched ducklings eggs would be divided into batches of 13 and placed under broody chickens in last week of four week incubation period eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water to soften shells and allow ducklings to hatch newly hatched aylesbury ducklings are timid and thrive best in small groups so duckers would divide them into groups of three or four ducklings each accompanied by a hen as ducklings grew older and gained confidence they would be kept in groups of around 30 originally ducks would be kept in every room in ducker s cottage but towards end of 19th century they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather aim of ducker was to get every duckling as fat as possible by age of eight weeks first moult age at which they would be killed for meat while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy in their first week after hatching ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs toast soaked in water boiled rice and beef liver from second week on this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves some larger scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to ducklings in place of greaves this high protein diet was supplemented with nettles cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins as with all poultry ducks require grit in their diet to break up food and make it digestible aylesbury ducklings drinking water was laced with grit from long marston and this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour around 85 of ducklings would survive this eight week rearing process to be sent to market while ducks are naturally aquatic swimming can be dangerous to young ducklings and it can also restrict a duck s growth thus although duckers would ensure ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing exception was shortly before slaughter when ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond as it helped them to feather properly although there were a few large scale duck rearing operations in aylesbury raising thousands of ducklings each season majority of aylesbury s duckers would raise between 400 and 1 000 ducklings each year because ducking was a secondary occupation it was not listed in aylesbury s census returns or directories and it is impossible to know how many people were engaged in it at any given time kelly s directory for 1864 does not list a single duck farmer in aylesbury but an 1885 book comments that duck end was one of poorer districts of aylesbury until end of 19th century it had no sewers or refuse collections area had a number of open ditches filled with stagnant water and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting and no running water faeces from duck ponds permeated local soil and seeped into cottages through cracks in floors slaughter and sale when ducklings were ready for slaughter duckers would generally kill them on their own premises slaughter would generally take place in morning to ensure ducks would be ready for market in evening to keep meat as white as possible ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads they were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of body from which feathers had been plucked plucking was generally carried out by women of household plucked carcasses would be sent to market and feathers would be sold direct to london dealers market for duck meat in aylesbury itself was small and ducks were generally sent to london for sale by 1750s richard recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from aylesbury to london every saturday and in late 18th and early 19th centuries ducks continued to be sent over chiltern hills to london by packhorse or cart on 15 june 1839 entrepreneur and former member of parliament for buckingham sir harry verney 2nd baronet opened aylesbury railway built under direction of robert stephenson it connected london and birmingham railway s cheddington railway station on west coast main line to aylesbury high street railway station in eastern aylesbury on 1 october 1863 wycombe railway also built a line to aylesbury from princes risborough railway station to a station on western side of aylesbury present day aylesbury railway station arrival of railway had a powerful impact on duck industry and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from aylesbury to smithfield market in london by 1850 a routine became established in which salesmen would provide duckers with labels duckers would mark their ducklings with labels of firm to whom they wished them to be sold in london railway companies would collect ducklings take them to stations ship them to london and deliver them to designated firms in return for a flat fee per bird by avoiding need for duckers to travel to market or london salesmen to collect ducklings this arrangement benefited all concerned and ducking became very profitable by 1870 duck industry was bringing over ps20 000 per year into aylesbury a typical ducker would make a profit of around ps80 ps200 per year developments in late 19th century in 1845 first national poultry show was held at zoological gardens in london one of classes of poultry exhibited was aylesbury or other white variety personal interest of queen victoria in poultry farming and its inclusion in great exhibition of 1851 further raised public interest in poultry from 1853 royal agricultural society and bath and west of england society two most prominent agricultural societies in england included poultry sections in their annual agricultural shows this in turn caused smaller local poultry shows to develop across country breeders would choose potential exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in march and april and they would be given a great deal of extra attention they would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to maximum weight and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible before show their legs and feet would be washed their bills trimmed with a knife and smooth and their feathers brushed with linseed oil while most breeders would give ducks a healthy meal before show to calm them some breeders would force feed ducks with sausage or worms to get them to as heavy a weight as possible exhibition standards judged an aylesbury duck primarily on size shape and colour this encouraged breeding of larger ducks with pronounced exaggerated keels and loose baggy skin by beginning of 20th century aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains one bred for appearance and one for meat pekin ducks thumb right pekin ducks are similar to aylesbury but with orange bills and a more upright posture alt five white ducks in 1873 pekin duck was introduced from china to britain for first time superficially similar in appearance to an aylesbury duck a pekin is white with orange legs and bill with its legs near rear giving it an upright stance while on land although not thought to have such a delicate flavour as aylesbury pekin was hardier a more prolific layer fattened more quickly subscription required and was roughly same size as an aylesbury at nine weeks aylesbury ducks meanwhile were becoming inbred meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and ducks were more susceptible to disease exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers poultry show judges also admired long neck and upright posture of pekin ducks over boat like stance of aylesbury some of breeders in aylesbury area began to cross pekin ducks with pure aylesbury strain although aylesbury pekin cross ducks did not have delicate flavour of pure aylesbury they were hardier and much cheaper to raise until mid 19th century duck rearing was concentrated on duck end but by 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in area particularly weston turville and haddenham contamination of aylesbury s soil by years of duck rearing and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices caused decline of duck rearing industry in duck end and by 1890s majority of aylesbury ducks were raised in villages rather than town itself population shifts and improved national rail network reduced need to rear ducks near london and large duck farms opened in lancashire norfolk and lincolnshire although number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow between 1890 and 1900 number of ducks raised in aylesbury area remained static and from 1900 it began to drop decline right upright thumb jemima puddle duck alt drawing of a large white duck and four ducklings by time beatrix potter s 1908 tale of jemima puddle duck about an aylesbury duck although set in cumbria caused renewed interest in breed aylesbury duck was in steep decline duckers of buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as incubator and inbreeding had dangerously weakened breed meanwhile cost of duck food had risen fourfold over 19th century and from 1873 onwards competition from pekin and pekin cross ducks was undercutting aylesbury ducks at marketplace first world war devastated remaining duckers of buckinghamshire price of duck food rose steeply while demand for luxury foodstuffs fell and wartime restructuring ended beneficial financial arrangements with railway companies by end of war small scale duck rearing in aylesbury vale had vanished with duck raising dominated by a few large duck farms shortages of duck food in second world war caused further disruption to industry and almost all duck farming in aylesbury vale ended a 1950 aylesbury duckling day campaign to boost reputation of aylesbury duck had little effect subscription required by end of 1950s last significant farms had closed other than a single flock in chesham owned by mr l t waller and by 1966 there
