andrianampoinimerina 1745 1810 ruled kingdom of imerina from 1787 until his death his reign was marked by reunification of imerina following 77 years of civil war and subsequent expansion of his kingdom into neighboring territories thereby initiating unification of madagascar under merina rule andrianampoinimerina is a cultural hero and holds near mythic status among merina people and is considered one of greatest military and political leaders in history of madagascar andrianampoinimerina took power upon deposing his uncle king andrianjafy who had ruled over imerina avarandrano northern imerina prior to andrianampoinimerina s reign imerina avarandrano had been locked in conflict with three other neighboring provinces of former kingdom of imerina that had last been unified under king andriamasinavalona a century before andrianampoinimerina established his capital at fortified town of ambohimanga a site of great spiritual cultural and political significance that was designated a unesco world heritage site in 2001 king s original royal lodgings can still be visited at ambohimanga today from this position he progressively extended his domain first over all imerina and then over greater highlands absorbing betsileo sihanaka bezanozano and bara territories having reigned for 23 years at time of his death andrianampoinimerina had successfully reunited imerina and vastly expanded merina kingdom with intent to ultimately unify all of madagascar under merina rule his son and heir radama i continued conquests andrianampoinimerina had begun and over next two decades largely achieved his father s vision early life birth andrianampoinimerina was born ramboasalamarazaka short form ramboasalama around 1745 in ikaloy in central madagascar to princess daughter of king andriambelomasina of imerina 1730 1770 and her husband an andriana noble of zafimamy royal family in independent kingdom of alahamadintany to north of imerina his mother s brother andrianjafy was named andriambelomasina s successor and was king of imerina northern quadrant of former kingdom of imerina from 1770 to 1787 ramboasalamarazaka was born during a period when conflict and famine afflicted imerina for almost a century from end of reign of king ralambo 1575 1600 to king andriamasinavalona 1675 1710 kingdom of imerina in madagascar s central highlands had generally enjoyed prosperity expansion and civil peace this stability and unity of imerina collapsed after andriamasinavalona divided kingdom among his four favorite sons leading to 77 years of civil war that weakened ability of subsequent princes to respond effectively to pressures of slave trading and a growing population merina kings had long intended to extend their kingdom to north by absorbing zafimamy kingdom of alahamadintany and zafimamy kings of alahamadintany had also wished to extend their land to south by absorbing merina kingdom marriage between ramboasalamarazaka s parents was a political alliance contracted as part of andriambelomasina s strategy to mitigate threat of invasions by alahamadintany zafimamy alliance to north marriage agreement stipulated that after reign of andriambelomasina s son andrianjafy throne would pass to his daughter s son ramboasalamarazaka alliance between these two royal families represented a fair and peaceful compromise prince born of this union would rule over both states and unify two kingdoms andrianampoinimerina s zafimamy ancestors practiced and therefore rarely mixed with descendants of legendary first inhabitants of madagascar vazimba however ramboasalamarazaka had partial vazimba ancestry on his mother s side through her antecedent king andriamanelo 1540 1575 son of vazimba queen rafohy 1530 1540 and her merina husband he was born during first quarter of moon of month sign of a highly auspicious birth according to popular belief following merina customs of time his parents gave him humble name ramboasalama ra salama healthy dog to protect him from attracting undesirable attention of jealous rivals or evil spirits before being changed in childhood to ramboasalamarazaka childhood and education ramboasalamarazaka spent his early childhood in his father s zafimamy court at ikaloy there he received a traditional education including mastery of a local board game believed to develop intelligence and ability to think strategically young nobles being groomed for leadership roles typically learned to perform a stylized form of public address including judicious use of ohabolana proverbs to persuasively make a point young merina princes also often learned to play valiha a bamboo tube zither then reserved for merina and zafimamy nobles around age of 12 ramboasalamarazaka continued his education under supervision of his grandfather king andriambelomasina at and royal court in ambohimanga merchant thumb andrianampoinimerina s house at ambohimanga as a young man ramboasalamarazaka worked as a merchant and may have also traded in slaves during this period he gained a reputation as a champion of commoner committed to defending them against raids by sakalava warriors and slave traders and fighting against corruption regarded as a self made man who did not rely on his privileges as a prince his independence temperament tenacity and sense of justice made him popular among commoners and slaves of ambohimanga his popularity stood in contrast to public discontentment with his uncle king andrianjafy who was viewed as a despotic and incompetent ruler ramboasalamarazaka frequently made promises to populace regarding his future reign which led andrianjafy perceived as a threat to his authority leading him to execute citizens of his territory who engaged his nephew in such promises contrary to his intentions this response only served to turn popular opinion against andrianjafy conflict with andrianjafy although andrianjafy may have initially intended for ramboasalamarazaka to succeed him this appears to have changed following birth of his son whom his wife persuaded him to name as successor in disregard of his father s earlier decree andrianjafy consequently made several attempts to have his nephew killed but on each occasion ramboasalamarazaka was warned by andrianjafy s brother and managed to avert plot in 1787 when ramboasalamarazaka was 42 years old conflict between men reached a turning point andrianjafy decided to send a group of assassins to ramboasalama s residence in ambohimanga andrianjafy s brother again took action and warned ramboasalamarazaka to flee but rather than leave ambohimanga ramboasalama followed advice of an elder who instructed him to sacrifice a ram to invoke ancestral protection elder then gathered twelve most respected men of ambohimanga and thirty soldiers and rallied them to enforce decree of andriambelomasina by overthrowing andrianjafy and swearing allegiance to ramboasalama after success of coup new king adopted his ruling name andrianampoinimerina support of tsimahafotsy inhabitants of ambohimanga ensured defense of city against efforts by andrianjafy to reclaim his capital and his authority andrianjafy rallied people of his home village of ilafy to fight against those of ambohimanga both sides were armed with spears and firearms an initial battle at saw ilafy army defeated both sides regrouped for a second confrontation at which took place at night and did not end in a definitive win for either side in morning andrianjafy moved his army north of anosy and two sides clashed again in a battle that lasted two days ilafy army lost skirmish and retreated to their village after losing these battles residents of ilafy decided to submit to andrianampoinimerina to rid themselves of andrianjafy people encouraged him to travel to antananarivo and alasora to seek allies in defense of their town once he had departed villagers barred town gates and announced their desire to enforce decree of andriambelomasina seeking support to recapture throne andrianjafy traveled to antananarivo alasora and to secure an alliance but each time he was rebuffed conflict came to an end in 1787 when andrianampoinimerina exiled his uncle varying sources report that shortly afterward andrianjafy either died in exile or was killed by andrianampoinimerina s followers reign and expansion of territory reunification of historic imerina continuing his conquests in 1790s andrianampoinimerina began establishing control over a comparatively large part of highlands of madagascar including twelve sacred hills of imerina andrianampoinimerina conquered antananarivo in 1793 and concluded treaties with kings of antananarivo and ambohidratrimo he shifted kingdom s political capital back to antananarivo in 1794 by 1795 he had gained allegiance and submission of all territories that had formed imerina at its largest extent under andriamasinavalona effectively achieving reunification of imerina former kings of antananarivo and ambohidratrimo periodically engaged in resistance against his authority in disregard of treaties they had concluded prompting andrianampoinimerina to launch renewed campaigns to eliminate both kings re pacification of antananarivo began in 1794 and achieved definitive success in 1797 with ambohidratrimo reconquered shortly afterward by 1800 he had absorbed several other previously independent sections of imerina into his kingdom he reinforced alliances with powerful nobles in conquered regions of imerina through marriage to local princesses and is said to have wed 12 women in total he placed each wife at a house built at each of twelve sacred hills after political capital of imerina was shifted back to antananarivo andrianampoinimerina declared ambohimanga to be spiritual capital of imerina conquest of greater madagascar thumbnail expansion of kingdom of imerina under andrianampoinimerina 1787 1810 latter half of andrianampoinimerina s reign from around 1800 was marked by an effort to unite island s 18 ethnic groups under his rule this effort began with sending of royal messengers bearing invitations to become vassal states under andrianampoinimerina s sovereignty or face a military conquest first focus of this expansion was territory that had historically been inhabited by merina people but had come under rule of other groups particularly including eastern lands held by sihanaka and bezanozano peoples andrianampoinimerina then consolidated merina power in neighboring southern central betsileo territories establishing military outposts to protect merina settlers as far south as mountains and kingdoms that united with imerina as a result of diplomatic efforts included betsileo around betsileo merina and of and western region of sakalava of and rejected these offers and actively resisted merina domination bezanozano territories likewise resisted although merina managed to preserve a tenuous hold over area gradual conquest of surrounding lands by andrianampoinimerina and his merina army was vigorously opposed by sakalava who remained a major threat to andrianampoinimerina and his people throughout his reign bands of sakalava mounted slave raids in imerina and brought captured merina to coast for sale to european slave traders sakalava armies mounted repeated incursions into imerina and nearly breached capital city on more than one occasion andrianampoinimerina launched several campaigns to pacify sakalava but none were successful he also sought to establish peace through marriages intended to form political alliances but without achieving lasting peace or an end to slave raids certain merina nobles and several members of royal family also posed a threat to andrianampoinimerina s rule after deposing andrianjafy fallen king made an attempt on andrianampoinimerina s life this assassination attempt was foiled by an informant who had learned about conspiracy by chance andrianampoinimerina rewarded informant by marrying his daughter to his son future king radama i andrianampoinimerina furthermore declared that any child from this union would be first in line of succession after radama marriage did not produce children however and following radama s death in 1828 this royal wife would rule madagascar for 33 years as queen ranavalona i s authority was also threatened by his adopted son who plotted to kill radama when these efforts failed he attempted to assassinate andrianampoinimerina but was discovered and executed governance of kingdom of imerina thumb upright left alt large wooden rectangular house with steeply peaked roof in thatch andrianampoinimerina shifted his political capital from ambohimanga back to its historic seat in antananarivo where he inhabited venerable besakana pictured and mahitsielafanjaka buildings within royal rova compound beginning in 1797 andrianampoinimerina ruled his expanding kingdom from antananarivo traditional capital of kingdom of imerina he is credited with major development and reorganization of city his vision for capital was to serve as a microcosm of his kingdom and a model of urban planning that would be replicated in each new territory in keeping with sacred merina symbolism associated with height space and cardinal orientation he retained royal compound rova of antananarivo at crest of highest hill in city and in center of urban space that expanded around it he also undertook significant expansion of sacred rova compound and improved its venerable buildings this included reconstruction in 1800 of besakana throne of kingdom built by king andrianjaka in early 1600s as first royal residence at antananarivo one of several houses used as residences by andrianampoinimerina at palace other principal residence being mahitsielafanjaka after he moved his capital from ambohimanga to antananarivo he implanted representatives of ethnic groups he had recently conquered in specified neighborhoods of city each merina social class had its designated districts slaves lived south of rova a disfavored direction in merina cosmology mainty royal servant class lived to southeast in important hova clans were allotted district to west of royal compound and each of seven sub classes of andriana nobles were assigned to a district to sacred north and northeast of palace within this broad district structure each clan was assigned a specific neighborhood in an orientation roughly corresponding to orientation of their home village vis a vis capital city in popular imagination of residents of modern day antananarivo city in time of andrianampoinimerina is envisioned as a perfect and harmonious urban space embodying best of merina ingenuity and spiritual significance legitimacy of andrianampoinimerina s reign was bolstered by his characterization of other merina rulers claims to power as fanjakana hova rule by hova commoners whose lineages were only weakly tied to line of succession relative to his own in addition like merina kings before him he consolidated power of royal idols and attributed success and legitimacy of his reign to proper respect shown toward these conduits of supernatural power he balanced this strengthening of supernatural and ancestral legitimacy of his kingship against inclusiveness of commoner class by making several hova from and tsimahafotsy clans into powerful and trusted advisers he also consulted a group of royal advisers of clan who were literate in script historically used on east coast to inscribe a series of ancient texts considered to contain powerful magic and specialized scientific and ritual knowledge population of imerina was governed through a mixture of traditional practices and innovative measures while all land technically belonged to sovereign its administration was carried out by andriana who were assigned a subdivision of land to govern these administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers land was cultivated by commoners who were given a parcel to farm based on size of family it was meant to feed and each family paid taxes to king in return andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children right to claim meat from butcher that had not been sold by day s end and allowing poor to eat cassava from others fields provided they took only what they could cook and consume on spot in this way basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met social organization hierarchy of merina andriana sub classes established in 16th century under andriamanelo was revised by andrianampoinimerina as it had been done by andriamasinavalona he decreed new rights and responsibilities for andriana including privilege of placing sculptures or images of black kite on their homes to indicate their noble status in order to strengthen relationships within clans and communities and to promote moderation and equitable distribution of resources andrianampoinimerina decreed that families should build larger monolithic stone tombs to hold remains of all family members and that construction of these tombs was to be undertaken as a shared responsibility among members of family to be entombed there modifications and expansions on several traditional royal rituals under andrianampoinimerina enabled him to develop a state religion in which he was central figure tradition of festival established by 17th century merina king ralambo was made a much larger event intended to symbolically renew nation and cosmic power that legitimized and strengthened andrianampoinimerina s reign as well as power of state this served to further unify his citizens while legitimizing and strengthening his rule public works long established royal merina tradition of labor as a form of tax was continued and expanded under andrianampoinimerina major public works were carried out under his reign including further expansion of irrigated paddy fields in plains surrounding antananarivo he devised systems for organizing work teams motivated their efforts by setting up competitions between teams and punished those who failed to contribute their due share of effort he mobilized groups of village musicians to entertain work teams and later employed them to travel among towns and villages across kingdom broadcasting news announcing new laws and promoting proper social behavior laws andrianampoinimerina developed a legal system that applied throughout territories he ruled he was first merina king to establish formal civil and penal codes latter ameliorated and transcribed by his son radama he declared twelve crimes to be capital offenses while many others entailed collective punishment for guilty party and his or her family members including forced labor in chains and being reduced to slave status these harsh penalties were intended to act as a strong disincentive to engage in antisocial acts consumption of alcohol marijuana and tobacco were also outlawed although they remained prevalent to judge infractions of his laws king often relied on tradition of whereby surviving ingestion of poison indicated an accused person s innocence economy thumbnail historic zoma market said to be largest outdoor market in world was established in analakely neighborhood of antananarivo by andrianampoinimerina and ran continuously until being disbanded in 1997 under andrianampoinimerina regulations were established to manage trading in slaves and other commodities estimates put number of slaves traded by king at around 1 800 per year mainly in exchange for firearms and principally to french merchants who sold them on to mauritius and reunion this brought order to kingdom s economy enriched crown and enabled king to monopolize trade in certain particularly lucrative goods thereby weakening opportunities for political rivals to amass enough wealth and influence to unseat him while this soured his relationship with certain andriana it increased his popularity among commoner and slave classes his practice of commonly deciding in favor of commoners in disputes with nobles further strengthened his image as a fair ruler andrianampoinimerina regulated commerce and economy by creating official markets and standardizing market scales and other units of measurement including length and volume king andrianampoinimerina established first marketplace in antananarivo on grounds today occupied by analakely market s tile roofed pavilions constructed in 1930s andrianampoinimerina decreed friday zoma as market day when merchants would come to analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols this sea of parasols extended throughout valley forming what has been called largest open air marketplace in world traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by ever growing zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate friday merchants to several other districts in 1997 prosperity for masses in imerina increased throughout andrianampoinimerina s reign leading to growth in population density military organization finally he established a citizen army called 100 000 soldiers men fit for military service were recruited to engage in andrianampoinimerina s campaigns of conquest between periods designated for public works projects these campaigns served to enrich imerina by capturing slaves for labor and service to merina andriana and hova classes or for sale or trade to coastal communities in exchange for firearms his military was equipped with sizeable stock of arms he procured from coastal traders in western madagascar death and succession andrianampoinimerina died in mahitsielafanjaka house on compound of rova of antananarivo on 6 july 1810 at age of 65 having fathered eleven sons and thirteen daughters by his many wives in vazimba tradition of merina kings before him body of andrianampoinimerina was placed in a canoe made of silver rather than customary hollowed out log and interred in one of royal tombs at ambohimanga shortly after french established a colonial presence on island in 1896 they destroyed andrianampoinimerina s original tomb in march 1897 removed his remains and relocated them to rova of antananarivo where they were interred in tomb of his son this was done in an effort to city of ambohimanga break spirit of resistance fighters who had been rebelling against french colonization for past year weaken popular belief in power of royal ancestors and relegate malagasy sovereignty under merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past andrianampoinimerina was succeeded by his 18 year old son radama i in order to fulfill his oath that child of his son radama would follow in line of succession andrianampoinimerina had his oldest son killed to prevent any contest for throne legacy historian ogot states andrianampoinimerina is regarded as most important of imerina s kings historian catherine fournet guerin notes he is an object of great admiration in popular imagination a french trader who had conducted business with him declared in 1808 he is without doubt richest most feared most enlightened and has largest kingdom of all kings of madagascar malagasy textbooks characterize him as a hero and originator of notion of a unified malagasy national identity primary source of information about reign of andrianampoinimerina is ny andriana eto a malagasy language book relating oral history of merina kings as collected by a jesuit missionary francois callet in late 19th century prior to eventual release of a french language translation in 1950s references to king in academic and popular writing during colonial period de emphasized his role as a conduit of traditional religious power and authority instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to colonial government as a vehicle for building upon and strengthening principles of good governance that he introduced beginning in 1970s historians began to focus more on spiritual aspects of his role as king and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of andrianampoinimerina and his reign innovations during reign of andrianampoinimerina were to have long standing consequences for structure of malagasy society in 19th century madagascar specialist francoise raison jourde attributes widespread conversions of masses following conversion to christianity of ranavalona ii in 1869 to precedent established by andrianampoinimerina of a state religion in which sovereign is head and people are expected to follow similarly andrianampoinimerina s decision to empower hova and two families of advisers in particular led over next fifty years to strengthening of hova middle class that formed backbone of merchant craftsman farming and administrative cadres by reign of radama ii hova power rivaled and ultimately exceeded power of nobles leading to aristocratic coup d etat that ended radama s reign and absolute power of monarch and established a joint system of government in which hova prime minister and his cabinet governed while sovereign
