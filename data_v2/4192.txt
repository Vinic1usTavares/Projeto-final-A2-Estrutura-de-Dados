loring air force base was a united states air force installation in northeastern maine near limestone and caribou in aroostook county it was one of largest bases of u s air force s strategic air command during its existence and was transferred to newly created air combat command in 1992 base s origins began in 1947 with an order for construction of an airfield by new england division of united states army corps of engineers chosen site in northeastern maine within both limestone township and caswell plantation was closest point in continental u s to europe providing high strategic value during cold war base was originally named limestone army air field and was renamed limestone air force base following establishment of air force in 1947 it was named in 1954 for major charles j loring jr usaf a medal of honor recipient during korean war from 1951 to 1962 it was co located next to caribou air force station loring was home to a civilian population many of whom were employed alongside active duty service members base included many amenities such as a hospital school and ski hill which facilitated adjustment to maine life by civilians 1991 base realignment and closure commission recommended that loring be closed and its aircraft and mission be distributed to other bases in nation base was closed in september 1994 after over forty years of service it was redeveloped by loring development authority as loring commerce centre an industrial and aviation park airfield is operated as loring international airport overview for majority of its operational lifetime loring was a heavy bomber aerial refueling and interception facility for military aircraft equipment and supplies first as part of strategic air command sac 1947 1992 then as part of succeeding air combat command acc 1992 1994 loring was planned in 1947 as limestone army air field and was designed with a capacity of over 100 b 36 peacemaker strategic bombers this plan was only partially completed due to budget constraints loring later became one of largest air bases of sac after b 36 was phased out b 52 stratofortress was based at loring first with d models then with b 52gs boeing kc 97 stratofreighter was also based there for a number of years until it was replaced by kc 135a stratotanker loring was home to many facilities that were a part of base or were nearby caribou air force station was weapons storage area that operated separately from loring until it was absorbed in 1961 caswell air force station operated to east but had a unit associated with loring before it became fully operational on base facilities included alert area which operated as a separate facility within loring due to crews being constantly stationed on alert double cantilever hangar was largest hangar at facility with capacity to hold six parked b 52s or five b 36s another nearby installation was communications annex 2 located in perham maine from 1955 to 1962 it was run by 2192nd communications squadron which operated from loring afb and site information one of loring s major secondary missions included serving as headquarters for 45th air division from 8 october 1954 to 18 january 1958 and on 20 november 1958 host wing at loring was 42d bombardment wing for all but a small portion of its early existence loring was primarily home to active duty units although this changed in 1980s when massachusetts air national guard s 101st fighter squadron sent a detachment to loring as base was closest in us to europe it also functioned as an important stopover point 1991 base realignment and closure commission recommended closure of loring afb and it was closed in september 1994 it was later reopened as loring commerce centre major units 42nd bomb wing thumb emblem of

1945 map of world war ii supply ferry routes over north atlantic ocean with location of loring being right above presque isle s dot loring afb was carved out of woods of maine beginning in late forties and officially dedicated in 1953 named after charles j loring jr who was killed in korean war closest air force base on east coast to europe it was originally built with a capacity of 100 b 36 peacemaker bombers and equipped with a runway loring was built on of land making it biggest sac base in country this in turn allowed for it to have largest capacity for weapon storage and for fuel storage in all of sac its overall capacity ranked second among all 21 sac bases weapons storage capacity was highest in all of sac 10 247 882 new net explosive weight and it was first in all of sac in fuel storage capacity 9 193 374 gallons fuel was delivered to base via a 200 mile pipeline to maine ramp space at loring exceeded 1 1 million square yards which made it second among all sac bases in total ramp space and first in excess ramp space furthermore it was one of two fully capable conventional weapons storage facilities in conus maintained by sac during cold war new u s air force bases were constructed along northern border of continental u s their most direct route to soviet union was through arctic circle these sites were high importance strategic bases for hosting long range missiles and aircraft in 1947 new england division of u s army corps of engineers chose a site in northeastern maine within both limestone township and caswell plantation remote site consisted mostly of dense forest shallow marshes and wild blueberry bogs on a slight plateau over town which helped keep it above fog most of time only a small part of base was suitable for farming so there was little impact on aroostook county s agricultural community additionally loring was not far from sources of materials for runway taxiway and parking apron construction most important benefit of site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in europe construction thumb early plans for loring note additional third runway that was planned only a part of which was built as a taxiway on 15 april 1947 construction commenced on limestone army air field first strategic air command base designed and built to host high speed aircraft including new b 36 peacemaker original plans for limestone called for two parallel north south runways a east west runway and accommodations for over 100 aircraft multimillion dollar project was not built to specifications of original army corps of engineers plan and only one north south runway was constructed on 23 may a 17 million contract was awarded to two companies to complete first phase of construction this included north south runway a parallel taxiway taxiway j a parking apron arch hangar a base operations building a control tower a power plant a 250 person barracks which would later become building 6000 a water supply system and a railroad spur to base now part of montreal maine and atlantic railway one of first structures was arch hangar at time it was largest monolithic arch roof structure in us and one of largest hangars in world construction of hangar was also groundbreaking including a foundation set on bedrock extensive footing structures intricate formwork and a 340 foot arch span runway was another major construction task airfield in northern maine was subject to freeze thaw cycles and had bogs and various types of groundcover 2 1 million cubic yards of material was removed foundation of runway was constructed to a depth of of a flexible bituminous concrete pavement this was all done on a runway that was in length and wide month of june 1950 began 44 years of constant activity at limestone on 10th 7 officers and 78 airmen of limestone detachment arrived as tenant unit during construction two days later an aircraft from oklahoma arrived on 15th limited operations began at limestone as cold war tensions began to heat up next day a b 36 peacemaker arrived and later departed 1 july brought re designation of limestone detachment as 4215th base service squadron after korean war broke out decision was made to increase squadron s size to 28 officers 340 airmen and 20 civilians august brought first permanently assigned aircraft a c 47 skytrain and more aircraft using base as a stopover between states and europe thumb a cross section of runway at loring showing depth to which material was built war brought increased funding to limestone in 1951 eight additional hangars were constructed at southwestern end of runway as well as a addition to northern end of runway department of defense allocated funds for north river depot a weapons storage facility to northwest of base it later became caribou air force station and was absorbed into facility in 1960s end of year brought completion of a communications facility a hospital three barracks a school an officers club a bakery and a briefing and training building base was one of first constructed after world war ii and also one of first to retain as much surrounding vegetation as possible in case there was a need to camouflage airfield and surrounding facilities it avoided traditional grid system for roads hangars were built for additional aircraft at base including double cantilever hangar one of first built by air force in response to a demand for more efficient maintenance space it could house five b 36 peacemakers and six b 52 stratofortresses and nine planned concrete arch hangars were no longer needed runway was resurfaced in 1955 in anticipation of arrival of b 52 stratofortress in 1956 eighteen additional nose dock hangars hangars which could contain nose and wings of aircraft allowing for maintenance to cockpit area by crew without need to use larger hangars were built in 1956 to northwest of runway near main parking area along with parking areas and taxiways for these hangars early history thumb emblem of 42d bomb wing on 8 february 1953 curtis e lemay commander of sac visited base to review construction s progress during this visit he indicated that limestone was operationally ready later that month command capabilities were formally transferred to sac ending an almost six year command by army corps of engineers furthermore personnel of 4215th base service squadron were reassigned to 42d bombardment wing which was reactivated and assigned to 8th air force on 23 february limestone air force base officially became operational during first few months wing was not assigned any aircraft and thus worked with other units who were in possession of b 36 peacemaker in march and april base began preparing for operations of b 36 which arrived later in april this gave newly activated 69th bombardment squadron a full complement of aircraft by end of august number had increased to 27 bombers 322 officers 313 airmen and 350 civilians additionally more buildings were constructed on base making it more of a home for airmen and their families january 1954 brought declaration of 42nd being capable of implementing its emergency war plan on 1 october base was renamed after charles loring jr and became loring air force base one week later 45th air division was activated at loring and designated primary base unit it was also designated that month as primary staging location for fighter aircraft flying out of continental united states to and from europe loring had 63 permanent aircraft assigned and air traffic was significantly increased as cold war progressed so did need for new aircraft and techniques first kc 97 stratofreighter arrived at loring with activation of 42d air refueling squadron in january 1955 b 36 s were not actually equipped to perform aerial refueling so planes supported other units until arrival of b 52 in 1956 eventually 21 tankers were based at loring along with 30 air crews by 1955 base consisted of 42d 69th 70th and 75th bombardment squadrons a hospital became operational next january a b 52 landed at airfield as part of a cold weather testing program five months later first stratofortress state of maine was permanently stationed at loring in november 1956 air force used base for publicity on 10 november soviet union threatened to oust british and french troops from middle east days after end of suez crisis after a response by president dwight d eisenhower to united nations a reporter with associated press visited castle air force base in california after sac was alerted to support whatever action u s might take reporter was unable to find out classified information and instead invented maintenance records of fleet that painted a dismal picture on 24 and 25 november four b 52 s of 93rd bombardment wing and 42nd flew nonstop around perimeter of north america in operation quick kick which covered in 31 hours 30 minutes sac noted flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours if four inflight refuelings had been done by fast jet powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller driven kc 97 knaack 1988 p 244 after flight ended planes landed at friendship international airport operation distracted public attention from reporter s story base was also location of an experimental system of steam pipes in 1957 to test viability of using steam to melt snow on runways pipes were spaced at different intervals in experiment that same year first kc 135 stratotanker christened aroostook queen arrived at loring by december all of kc had left and by april 1958 20 kc had arrived allowing 42nd air refueling squadron to reach full operational capacity in may later that year an alert force was created at loring consisting of six b 52 s following year in response to a conflict in lebanon entire wing was placed on alert an alert force was established at loring afb in october 1957 wing began supporting force with six b 52s in january 1958 in response to a conflict in lebanon alert force was expanded to include entire bombardment wing in july 1958 when sac bomber force went to full alert status sac s overall goal was achieved in 1960 on 11 march 1958 base personnel were first members of air force to land a b 52 in a wheels up configuration at westover afb near springfield massachusetts after being lifted up and onto its wheels plane was flown to kelly afb at san antonio texas for a complete overhaul and inspection before it was returned to 42nd loring was also home to an administrations support base of a green pine communications crew from naval station argentia detachment did not even officially exist on base even though it was located on top floor of bachelors officers quarters and consisted of six men assigned aircraft thumb 210px f of 83d fis at loring in 1972 various

12 kills a united states army air defense command first operation head start operation head start was conducted at base from september to december 1958 it helped to demonstrate that a continuous airborne alert could be maintained successfully before each flight a briefing was held alerting crewmembers to basic world events as well as safety criteria at least 15 hours before takeoff crew would thoroughly pre flight their aircraft inadvertently this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre flight routines every six hours a bomber would take off with live warheads and continue on a pre determined path over greenland and eastern canada a trip that ended 20 hours later frequently foxtrot no message required messages were sent to bomber from strategic air command headquarters at offutt air force base keeping crews alert while entering landing pattern crash trucks would travel to runway and await landing this was standard procedure for all head start landings after landing crew was interrogated prior to being released so that maintenance intelligence and other crews could be alerted to performance of plane and other items that crew might have noticed during their flight after release they would typically go to physical conditioning room for a steam bath and operation head start eventually lead to operation chrome dome chrome dome was an operation where bombers would be in constant airborne alert and loiter at points just outside soviet union second half of cold war thumb airmen from 42nd munitions maintenance squadron prepare to load a mark 60

conventional operational readiness inspection although it is unknown when it was opened loring was host to a conventional enhanced release training bomb range which was located adjacent to runway loring was one of four strategic air command bases with a range of this type and it was used frequently base was also located next to condor 1 and condor 2 airspace which allowed for low level training routes and training opportunities within restricted airspace allowed training to be accomplished one disadvantage of location of loring was its distance from strategic training route complex and bombing ranges in nevada and utah ranges out west were only location where b 52s were allowed to drop live munitions although sac training only required crews to drop live munitions twice a year on these ranges in 1974 president richard nixon stopped at loring on 3 july in air force one sam as he returned from a summit in moscow where he and leonid had signed threshold test ban treaty in a speech in front of 5 000 people in double cantilever hangar he talked about importance of treaty president and mrs nixon were welcomed home by vice president gerald r ford who flew from washington his daughter julie nixon eisenhower was also in attendance nixon resigned from office five weeks later on 11 march 1976 sac headquarters announced that 42d bombardment wing would be inactivated citing poor condition of loring s facilities in 1976 it was estimated that loring needed up to 300 million in facilities improvements between 1976 and 1979 considerable debate took place over strategic importance of loring resulting in a reversal of air force decision to close loring when decision to keep loring afb open was made in 1979 congress committed itself to upgrading loring s facilities after 1981 nearly 300 million in military construction and operations and maintenance funds were spent to upgrade facilities congressman tip o neill of massachusetts and senator william cohen of maine were firm supporters of base during time when it was proposed to be closed during time that loring was proposed for closure region experienced economic uncertainty once air force made its intent known in 1976 property values plummeted and people delayed buying homes fearing that they would need to relocate reduction in base of around 80 meant that possibly 60 of aroostook county would need to relocate according to county officials a 25 000 study commissioned by department of labor and conducted at northeastern university calculated that region had lost over 14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty on 5 september 1983 members of 42d air refueling squadron escorted a crippled f 4e phantom ii over atlantic ocean after it experienced loss of an engine for its actions crew e 113 received mackay trophy for refueling it four times and towing it with its refueling boom in 1988 air force decided to close three of its nuclear weapons stations at its sac bases in addition to loring other bases around world were scaled back as b 1b lancer was now predicted to become mainstay of nuclear defense for country loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing that same year fears began to surface that loring would be an on list of 1988 base realignment and closure commission as a result community began to rally around base which at time included 3 800 military personnel 1 000 civilian employees generated an 80 million payroll previous year and was subject of 34 million in construction services in 1981 loring s bombers were placed on alert after soviet submarines were spotted off coast of region base was briefly mentioned in 1983 movie wargames although film erroneously listed loring as being home to 43rd bombardment wing in 1982 base was hit by two earthquakes which damaged base hospital and caused cracks to appear on walls of control tower 5th fighter interceptor squadron based at minot afb in north dakota maintained a detachment of three f 15

runway one that had been in loring s original plans was created on taxiway j as a pre launch survivability runway this made loring one of three sac bases with two runways in 1989 it was proposed to list loring on environmental protection agency s national priorities list this was due to presence of waste oil fuel solvents and pesticides in soil additionally burning of waste also created problems in addition to use of landfills in old gravel pits on site fire training area also needed clean up as materials were burned until 1974 on that site loring was officially added to list in february 1990 during operation desert storm loring s tankers were responsible for refueling aircraft transiting atlantic it was also used as a stopover for aircraft travelling to persian gulf region due to its vital position base was also vital because it allowed planes to be maintained planes which sometimes would be unable to reach their destination without maintenance between 2 august 1990 and 10 may 1991 more than 1 700 aircraft transiting between america and persian gulf region landed at loring these included c 141 starlifter c 5 galaxy c 130 hercules c 21a a 4 skyhawk a 10 thunderbolt ii boeing

control tower a member of 2192nd communications squadron was on duty when he picked up craft on radar nearing base after trying to contact unidentified aircraft to warn it that it was approaching a restricted area aircraft entered airspace over nuclear weapons storage area and hovered over it at an altitude of later lowering to commander of 42d bombardment wing colonel robert e chapman arrived 15 minutes later at weapons storage area and police units were ordered in as well at this time he also declared a security option 3 at 2045 hrs another person on duty in control tower received a call to track mysterious craft on radar for next 40 minutes it was observed circling around weapons storage area when it suddenly vanished as though it had landed or dropped below radar witnesses later observed it flying away towards grand falls new brunswick twelve miles to east messages were sent to national military command center air force chief of staff and strategic air command headquarters at offutt air force base base continued to remain on a high state of alert until following morning as efforts to identify unidentified aircraft through maine state police local police departments and houlton federal aviation administration office remained elusive next night at 1945 hrs a craft similar to one night before approached base in addition to being tracked on radar it hovered around area for 30 minutes with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter additionally it hovered above weapons storage area at same altitude as night before at this time possibly another object it is unclear if it was same one as over weapons storage area but it is possible was spotted over flightline cigar shaped object was described as hovering in mid air jerking around and turning on and off its lights once during blackout it traveled from flightline to northern end of runway according to one service member object was chased and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off ground during this time it was determined that object was four car lengths long once again object was tracked on radar taking off towards new brunswick teletype messages were again sent to higher commands with no explanation being found one teletype sent on november from loring s office of special investigations detachment to national military command center and osi headquarters reported another unidentified helicopter sighted at low level over loring afb over past two nights 31 october 1 november it also referred to intruder as an unknown entity additionally captain richard r an operations officer in 42nd security police squadron sps stated advised that there had been three verified sightings of an unidentified a c aircraft flying at low level over and in vicinity of lafb during this period an initial sighting was made by a member of 42nd who was on duty at 23 14 hours another member spotted object near east gate going from east to west it has been learned that another member of 2192nd communications squadron working at caswell radar station had been contacted by base commander to look out towards base and report what he sees that member responded i see a helicopter with people out of it to quote him i never saw a ufo but i did see a helicopter this incident was a base readiness security drill that has been passed off as a ufo sighting brac 1991 and closure thumb 240px flightline at loring in 1968 and alert area which stood down in 1991 in 1991 secretary of defense dick cheney upon recommendation of secretary of air force donald b rice identified loring and five other sac bases for closure through brac commission commission recommended that 42d bomb wing be disestablished and b 52gs transferred to bomb wing at k i sawyer afb near marquette michigan kc 135 aircraft were realigned to usaf reserve and other active units justification for closure of loring was that air force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support number of bomber and tanker aircraft in defense department s structure plan base was evaluated against eight selection criteria and a large number of specific to air force bases and missions even though loring was in good condition and had strong community support it ranked low in criteria when compared to twenty other bases in strategic category one of things that hurt loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base as well as its distance from bombing ranges commission did note that facilities at loring were above average and cost to close loring would be low latter of which contributed to its closure commission also projected an impact on future of community 22 000 people were projected to leave region with 9 900 direct and indirect jobs affected and a loss of over 92 million of regional income this was in contrast to a regional population of over 49 100 available jobs of 33 320 and an annual income of 755 million net savings by end of 1997 from closing base was 182 million or about 61 8 million annually as cold war ended so did mission of sac and it was disestablished on 1 june 1992 last b 52 departed loring in november 1993 and ceremonies were held in february 1994 to celebrate end of flying mission following month saw last kc 135 depart and after 41 years loring afb officially closed on 30 september 1994 accidents and incidents thumb a b 47b stratojet on display at mighty
