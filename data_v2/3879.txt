1st army group was a royal yugoslav army formation mobilised prior to german led axis invasion of yugoslavia in april 1941 during world war ii it consisted of 4th army 7th army and 1st cavalry division which was army group reserve it was responsible for defence of northwestern yugoslavia with 4th army defending eastern sector along yugoslav hungarian border and 7th army defending western sector along borders with germany and italy like all yugoslav formations at time 1st army group had serious deficiencies in both mobility and firepower despite concerns over a possible axis invasion orders for general mobilisation of royal yugoslav army were not issued by government until 3 april 1941 out of fear this would offend adolf hitler and precipitate war when invasion commenced on 6 april component formations of 1st army group were only partially mobilised and on first day germans seized bridges over drava river in both sectors and several mountain passes in 7th army sector in 4th army sector formation and expansion of german bridgeheads across drava were facilitated by fifth column elements of croat nationalist ustase revolts by croat soldiers broke out in all three divisions of 4th army in first few days causing significant disruption to mobilisation and deployment 1st army group was also weakened by fifth column activities within its major units and chief of staff and chief of operations of headquarters of 1st army group aided both ustase and slovene separatists in 4th and 7th army sectors respectively revolts within 4th army were of great concern to commander of 7th army diviziski deneral dusan trifunovic but army group commander armijski deneral milorad petrovic did not permit him to withdraw from border areas until night of 7 8 april which was followed by german capture of maribor as they continued to expand their bridgeheads 4th army also began to withdraw southwards on 9 april and on 10 april it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation in face of two determined armoured thrusts by xxxxvi motorised corps one of which captured zagreb that evening italian offensive operations also began with thrusts towards ljubljana and down adriatic coast capturing over 30 000 yugoslav troops near delnice when fifth column elements arrested staffs of 1st army group 4th army and 7th army on 11 april 1st army group effectively ceased to exist on 12 april a german armoured column linked up with italians near adriatic coast encircling remnants of withdrawing 7th army remnants of 4th army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern bosnia but were quickly brushed aside by german armour as it drove towards sarajevo yugoslav supreme command unconditionally surrendered on 18 april background thumb left a map showing location of yugoslavia in europe alt map highlighting location of yugoslavia kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was created with merger of serbia montenegro and south slav inhabited areas of austria hungary on 1 december 1918 in immediate aftermath of world war i army of kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was established to defend new state it was formed around nucleus of victorious royal serbian army as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by austria hungary many former austro hungarian officers and soldiers became members of new army from beginning much like other aspects of public life in new kingdom army was dominated by ethnic serbs who saw it as a means by which to secure serb political hegemony army s development was hampered by kingdom s poor economy and this continued during 1920s in 1929 king alexander changed name of country to kingdom of yugoslavia at which time army was renamed royal yugoslav army vkj army budget remained tight and as tensions rose across europe during 1930s it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries consequently at time world war ii broke out in september 1939 vkj had several serious weaknesses which included reliance on draught animals for transport and large size of its formations infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 000 27 000 men as compared to contemporary british infantry divisions of half that strength these characteristics resulted in slow unwieldy formations and inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even very large yugoslav formations had very limited firepower generals with mindsets better suited to trench warfare of world war i were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist fast moving combined arms approach used by germans in their invasions of poland and france weaknesses of vkj in strategy structure equipment mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within yugoslavia resulting from two decades of serb hegemony and attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by central government attempts to address disunity came too late to ensure that vkj was a cohesive force fifth column activity was also a serious concern not only from croatian nationalist ustase but also from country s slovene and ethnic german minorities formation and composition yugoslav war plans saw headquarters of 1st army group being raised at time of mobilisation it was to be commanded by armijski deneral milorad petrovic and was to control 4th army commanded by armijski deneral petar nedeljkovic 7th army commanded by diviziski deneral dusan trifunovic and 1st cavalry division 4th army was organised and mobilised on a geographic basis from peacetime 4th army district on mobilisation it would consist of three divisions a brigade strength infantry detachment one horsed cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment and was supported by artillery anti aircraft artillery border guards and air reconnaissance elements of royal yugoslav army air force vvkj troops of 4th army included a high percentage of croats 7th army did not have a corresponding peacetime army district and like headquarters of 1st army group was to be formed at time of mobilisation it would consist of two divisions two brigade strength mountain detachments and a brigade strength infantry detachment with field and anti aircraft artillery support and also had vvkj air reconnaissance assets available 7th army included a high proportion of slovenes but also some ethnic germans 1st cavalry division was a horsed cavalry formation that existed as part of peacetime army although significant parts of peacetime division were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised 1st army group did not control any army group level support units mobilisation and deployment plan after unrelenting political pressure from adolf hitler yugoslavia signed tripartite pact on 25 march 1941 on 27 march a military coup d etat overthrew government that had signed pact and a new government was formed under commander of vvkj armijski deneral dusan simovic a general mobilisation was not initiated by new government until 3 april 1941 out of fear of offending hitler and thus precipitating war however on same day as coup hitler issued fuhrer directive 25 that called for yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state on 3 april fuhrer directive 26 was issued detailing plan of attack and command structure for german led axis invasion which was to commence on 6 april deployment plan for 1st army group saw 4th army deployed in a cordon behind drava between varazdin and slatina with formations centred around towns of ivanec varazdin koprivnica and virovitica 7th army deployment plan saw its formations placed in a cordon along border region from adriatic coast near senj north to kranj in julian alps and along german border to maribor it was envisaged that 1st cavalry division would be located in and around zagreb as reserve for 1st army group yugoslav historian velimir terzic describes mobilisation of all formations of 1st army group on 6 april as only partial and notes that there was a poor response to mobilisation orders for both men and animals to right of 1st army group was 2nd army of 2nd army group with army group boundary running from just east of slatina through pozega towards banja luka on left flank of 1st army group adriatic coast was defended by coastal defence command operations 6 9 april 4th army sector german army headquarters wanted to capture bridges over drava intact and from 1 april had issued orders to generaloberst maximilian von weichs s 2nd army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing bridge at barcs and railway bridge at zakany by coup de main as a result limited objective attacks were launched along line of drava by xxxxvi motorised corps of general der panzertruppe heinrich von vietinghoff despite fact that they were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 april in early hours of 6 april 1941 units of 4th army were located at their mobilisation centres or were marching toward hungarian border on extreme left flank of 4th army general der infanterie hans wolfgang reinhard s li infantry corps seized undamaged bridge over mura river at gornja radgona and yugoslav border troops in prekmurje region were attacked by troops advancing across german border and began withdrawing south into medimurje region germans troops also crossed hungarian border and attacked border troops at dolnja lendava just north of mura shortly after this further attacks were made along drava between and in area of 27th infantry division savska 27th id with intention of securing crossings over river but they were unsuccessful li infantry corps cleared most of prekmurje up to murska sobota and during day and a bicycle mounted detachment of generalmajor benignus dippold s 183rd infantry division captured murska sobota without encountering resistance during day luftwaffe german air force bombed and strafed yugoslav positions and troops on march by afternoon german troops had captured dolnja lendava and by evening it had become clear to germans that resistance at yugoslav border was weak xxxxvi motorised corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over mura at mursko sredisce and letenye and over drava at zakany and barcs these local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within largely croat 4th army who refused to resist germans they considered their liberators from serbian oppression during interwar period in afternoon of 6 april german aircraft caught air reconnaissance assets of 4th army on ground at velika gorica destroying most of them continuing mobilisation and concentration of 4th army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by ustase some units stopped mobilising or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas during day yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over mura at letenye mursko sredisce and kotoriba and over drava at zakany these attempts were only partially successful due to influence of ustase propaganda and of demolition orders by chief of staff of 27th id yugoslav radio network in 4th army area was sabotaged by ustase on 6 april and radio communications within 4th army remained poor throughout fighting zakany bridgehead thumb a damaged bridge over drava with a german soldier in foreground alt a black and white photograph looking

positions to stop this german penetration and petrovic ordered nedeljkovic to mount a counter attack against bridgehead by nightfall counter attack had not materialised defenders had withdrawn to koprivnica and petrovic had ordered nedeljkovic to counter attack on following morning also on 7 april few remaining reconnaissance aircraft of 4th army mounted attacks on a bridge over drava at zakany on 8 april xxxxvi motorised corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand its bridgehead at zakany on morning of 8 april 27th id was deployed around koprivnica with some army level artillery and cavalry support and a cavalry regiment detached from 1st cavalry division counter attack was eventually launched in afternoon but was abortive with only cavalry units maintaining contact with germans cavalry held line throughout night of 8 9 april despite heavy german artillery fire significant ustase influenced desertions occurred during day on 9 april xxxxvi motorised corps completed its preparations for full scale offensive action by further expanding its bridgehead at zakany cavalry units continued to fight germans but left sector of 27th id front began to crumble there was a deal of discussion between commanders from regimental level up to petrovic about discharging croat troops and withdrawing to a line south of sava river but despite orders to contrary some commanders began to discharge some or all of their personnel and most troops began to retreat before german advances others received false messages directing them to withdraw in afternoon even hard pressed cavalry units began to withdraw and germans captured koprivnica without resistance german capture of town was made easier due to revolts by croat troops against serb officers in 27th id mura bridgeheads early on 7 april reconnaissance units of xxxxvi motorised corps crossed mura at letenye and mursko sredisce and captured cakovec ustase propaganda led bulk of two regiments from 42nd infantry division murska 42nd id to revolt only two battalions deployed to their allocated positions in face of this german advance yugoslav border troops withdrew towards drava following day in areas of 42nd id and detachment ormozki on left flank of 4th army germans cleared territory north of drava and border guard units were withdrawn south of river on this day 39th infantry regiment was transferred to 42nd id from detachment ormozki and 36th infantry regiment of former joined 27th id mura sector was quiet on 9 april 42nd id took 39th infantry regiment under command but another of its infantry regiments and border guards in divisional sector began to disintegrate due to desertions with deteriorating situation on right flank of 42nd id 4th army headquarters ordered it and detachment

units in regimental strength began to cross drava near barcs and established a second bridgehead in sector of 40th infantry division slavonska 40th id affected by propaganda from ustase border troops abandoned their positions and withdrew to virovitica fifth column activities within units of 4th army were fomented by ustase which facilitated german establishment of bridgehead at barcs and resulted in a number of significant revolts within units 108th infantry regiment of 40th id which had mobilised in bjelovar was marching towards virovitica to take up positions on night of 7 8 april croats of 108th regiment revolted arrested their serb officers non commissioned officers and soldiers regiment then marched back towards bjelovar revolt of 108th regiment meant that entire frontage of division had to be covered by a single regiment during night patrols were sent towards german bridgehead but ustase sympathisers misled them into believing germans were already across drava at barcs in strength germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at barcs overnight by late evening on 7 april petrovic s reports to yugoslav supreme command noted that 4th army was exhausted and its morale had been degraded significantly and that nedeljkovic concurred with his commander s assessment on 8 april german xxxxvi motorised corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand barcs bridgehead a german regiment broke through border troops in sector of 40th id and approached virovitica at this point entire divisional sector was defended by divisional cavalry squadron which had been transported there in requisitioned cars due to lack of horses two understrength and wavering battalions arrived at pcelic southwest of virovitica by noon rebels of 108th infantry regiment were approaching bjelovar where they were joined by elements of 42nd infantry regiment and other units of 40th id when nedeljkovic became aware of their approach he ordered local gendarmerie commander to maintain order but was advised this would not be possible as local conscripts would not report for duty headquarters of 4th army reported presence of rebelling units to headquarters 1st army group and it was suggested that vvkj could bomb them 8th bomber regiment at rovine was even warned to carry out a bombing mission against rebels but idea was subsequently abandoned instead it was decided to request that leader of croatian peasant party vladko macek intervene with rebels on that day josip broz tito and central committee of communist party of yugoslavia then located in zagreb along with central committee of communist party of croatia sent a delegation to headquarters of 4th army urging them to issue arms to workers to help defend zagreb pavle gregoric who was a member of both central committees went to 4th army headquarters twice and was able to speak briefly with nedeljkovic but could not convince him to do so on that same day macek who had returned to zagreb after briefly joining simovic s post coup d etat government agreed to send an emissary to 108th infantry regiment urging them to obey their officers but they did not respond to his appeal later in day two trucks of rebels arrived at 4th army headquarters in bjelovar with intention of killing staff headquarters guard force prevented this but operations staff immediately withdrew from bjelovar to popovaca after mutinous troops issued several unanswered ultimatums around 8 000 of them attacked bjelovar assisted by fifth columnists within city city then surrendered and many yugoslav officers and soldiers were captured by rebels when nedeljkovic heard of fall of city he called mayor of bjelovar julije makanec and threatened to bomb city if prisoners were not immediately released detained officers from 4th army headquarters and 108th infantry regiment were then sent to zagreb about 16 00 nedeljkovic informed ban of croatia ivan subasic of revolt but subasic was powerless to influence events about 18 00 makanec proclaimed that bjelovar was part of an independent croatian state on morning of 9 april german bridgehead at barcs had expanded to north of virovitica following up

11 15 nedeljkovic arrived at divisional headquarters and shortly afterwards ordered division to launch a counter attack on german bridgehead at barcs at dawn following day nedeljkovic also visited commander of 17th id on right flank of 4th army to arrange support from that division during pending attack however because majority of that division s troops had yet to arrive from bosnia all it was able to do was advance its left flank west of slatina 40th id spent remainder of day preparing for counter attack but was hindered by german artillery and air attacks in an indication of state of

because their fighters were based too far away after having been grounded for most of day by poor weather in afternoon yugoslav bombers flew missions against airfields and railway stations across

might become necessary if situation on immediate right flank of 7th army deteriorated further but idea was opposed by slovene chief of staff of headquarters of 1st army group armijski deneral leon
