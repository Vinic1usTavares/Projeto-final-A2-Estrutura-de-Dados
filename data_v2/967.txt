kisses her hand she walks out of office and smiles as she waits for an elevator production episode was co written by semi chellas and matthew weiner and directed by phil abraham weiner said in august 2012 that he intended for peggy s departure from scdp to be in other woman which is centered on joan episode is literally about quantification and value of women in workplace and relationship of their sexuality to it i knew that on a subconscious level at writing stage because of way stories went together as these stories fold in together it starts to become about that but it was always about what you have to do to get ahead in a very simple way and opportunities to get ahead nonlinear narrative involving joan s storyline and don s jaguar pitch was a solution to how to tell story according to weiner ordering of those events really was a problem and we got to a point where we can either show don doing pitch or show joan being with guy but we can t do them both he said explaining that he felt if don gives pitch after audience has seen joan do this no one is going to listen to a word that he says it doesn t matter how good it is audience is not going to believe he could have won chellas had this great idea this elliptical thing which we really loaded up with cues so that you would know at end that don was too late seeing joan in there taking necklace off and joan s mother taking don s hat into room where joan was and then joan putting on green robe and coming out seeing that behind scenes moment second time really cemented it weiner said this allowed them to show joan going through with it 24 hours beforehand and then show don giving this pitch that audience is convinced is a great pitch then you slowly dissolve back to reality of don coming in to work pretty happy joan asking how it went and roger having this dead response it was one of his good ones and don wondering why joan s not more excited abraham spoke about shooting a scene of episode in august 2012 while discussing prostitution plot christina hendricks said this is a very confusing situation for joan and for everyone involved first off it s just completely insulting second of all it s quite an opportunity then all of a sudden you put money involved or opportunity involved or you put a label on it then it becomes a scary road to go down hendricks said that joan s motivation was protection for her child hendricks felt that joan saw herself as an equal in a way to other partners after going through with deal as joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment vincent kartheiser called storyline an example of an amoral business tactic kartheiser described pete as doing what he thinks he needs to do to get account i don t know if that s always such a good thing but it s common in business and i think in that situation pete represents that type of businessman matthew weiner and jared harris both characterized lane s decision as two fold he gave joan best advice for her and for himself jon hamm praised prostitution sequence as very elegant paired with don s pitch to jaguar this idea of something beautiful that you could possess that you could own it s one thing when you re talking about a car it s something else when you re talking about a human being elisabeth moss said she was not told by weiner that peggy would be leaving scdp until we were shooting episode 10 one right before it it was unusual that he didn t tell me he usually tells me what s happening pitches me things to ask me how they sound moss initial reaction was just one of feeling like there was really no other logical way to go for her after everything that had happened for five years she can t just keep butting her head up against that wall she s becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under don moss also said i will thank weiner forever for not telling me it would have made my life harder i knew about peggy s baby in season one i fought against it to play it as she was living it feeling it and not be in my head not knowing peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself to really feel peggy s growing frustration with don all season according to moss peggy has capability of being a don draper and there can t be two of them in office goodbye scene between don and peggy was a difficult one to shoot moss said that scene was a really really tough scene to do they didn t tell me they were going to do this but they told jon to hold my hand and not let it go then he did and i lost it every single one of those tears were absolutely real she wants to stay with all of her heart she does not want to leave but she knows she has to hamm said there was respect understanding and admiration between those two characters this is exact right time for her to leave references to other media peggy pitches a lady godiva themed ad for chevalier blanc herb mixes metaphors about sheik of araby and helen of troy during his assignation with joan peter reads goodnight moon to his baby and later that night complains to trudy there are no goodnight noises where they live reception critical reception thumb right episode s storyline involving joan holloway christina hendricks pictured was heavily scrutinised by commentators episode received much acclaim from television journalists storyline involving joan s prostituting herself to secure jaguar account for sterling cooper draper pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification alan sepinwall fought with himself over execution of prostitution story in this episode asking if you buy that partners would be willing to sell joan and that joan would feel same way then this is an all time great episode of series but if you don t then it s weiner and company making characters act against their natures to fit theme sepinwall described story as something that so fundamentally changes way you view a number of major characters and show that uses them that it has to be just about perfect to work and maybe not even then emily vanderwerff opined that other woman shouldn t work it s so obviously constructed to be a message episode and message is far from subtle no matter what we try to do to make them equal men are always going to turn women into objects on some level because that s just how men perceive them vanderwerff compared it to episode employee of month of sopranos even going so far as to call other woman a stronger episode weiner was surprised by reaction to joan s storyline in august 2012 hamm said other woman was his favorite episode of fifth season of mad men and spoke about reaction to joan s storyline final scene in which peggy leaves both don and agency was pinpointed by critics as a standout sequence maureen ryan said scene between don and peggy was tremendous but jon hamm and elisabeth moss are always magnificent together it s no coincidence that their final pose don at peggy s waist kissing her hand recalled don s brutal reconciliation with megan a few weeks ago kneeling begging her to stay with him in august 2012 moss said final scene was her favorite of season it would ve been so easy to have it be tears and trauma and music but it s so simple almost over before you know it it brings you to a dark sad place then gives you this slap in face when she turns to elevator and smiles matt weiner and i didn t feel it was a sad thing it says to audience no you don t get to cry all night about this accolades
