that musician producer guy sigsworth wrote for his wife he asked singer jem archer to collaborate with him and during their first collaborative session they wrote a song called silly thing inspired by sigsworth s wife he said i never write love songs but i was moved to write one for her i ve never had a problematic relationship with her there s not been a lot of drama but i wanted to write

grind ben ratliff from rolling stone compared it negatively to like a prayer and commented it is much closer to what she s become good at idea of transfiguration through love declaring that difference in 2003 is she doesn t have ambition stylus magazine also compared it negatively to like a prayer calling it an off hand denouncement of religion and stating that same old song over 10 years later
