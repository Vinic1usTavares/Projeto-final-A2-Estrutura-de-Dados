eclipse was co developed by koei tecmo grasshopper manufacture and nintendo software planning development koei tecmo was in charge of gameplay and atmosphere grasshopper manufacture were put in charge of character motion and other unspecified aspects of development while nintendo managed general production makoto shibata and keisuke kikuchi series creators and respective director and producer of previous games in series returned to their respective posts in addition grasshopper manufacture s goichi suda acted as a co director co writer and designer suda was initially reluctant to work on project due to his intense dislike for ghosts and horror games according to a later interview with kikuchi he was first inspired when he saw potential in wii hardware and was first to propose project to nintendo main development goal for mask of lunar eclipse was feeling fear with player s body with gameplay functions closely tied into wii hardware among these were feeding sounds through wii remote s speaker and creating effects using rumble function an adjustment they made was to camera perspective while it had been placed at a distance in previous games it was shifted to an over shoulder third person view so control of torch was more realistic this raised concerns as to pace of character s movement taking into account similar criticisms from fans of earlier games characters speed was increased this aspect was undergoing revision until quite late into development when designing game s main setting team moved away from traditional enclosed japanese mansions from previous games in favor of somewhere that blended eastern and western architectural tastes to create different gameplay opportunities described in game as a meiji era hotel traditional mansion settings were also included with more locations being present than in previous games color yellow was chosen as game s image color while key words used to describe plot were memory moon and mask subtitle refers to mask that is key to kagura dance ritual mask in turn tied into story themes of phases of moon nature of memory and music during development shibata and kikuchi felt that grasshopper and nintendo s involvement helped them reevaluate series formula and try out new things after development kikuchi said that three companies varying ideas on project made development a complete and utter mess though it ultimately worked out well characters were designed by sawaki who had previously worked in that capacity on okami and el ascension of metatron music was composed by masafumi takada and ichikawa as with previous two games mask of lunar eclipse features songs by japanese singer tsuki amano theme song zero tuning and ending theme noise release mask of lunar eclipse was first revealed in january 2008 at a tecmo press conference it was first series title to be developed and released for a nintendo console it was released on july 31 2008 its release was timed to coincide with a traditional time in japan for people to tell each other ghost stories upon release game featured several bugs affecting player progress through game as revealed in a message to fans from nintendo while no north american release was planned a european release was in works and was briefly outed by a french gaming magazine after leak nintendo stated that a european release had been planned but since then localization had been cancelled in addition to nintendo no other third party publisher would publish game overseas leaving mask of lunar eclipse as a japan exclusive title after nintendo s announcement a three person team decided to create a fan translation of game development process was compared by them to a frankenstein s monster referring to how they needed to assess data construct a development schedule for translation patch going through theories about file structure then creating a tool to access game s data files modification program was then tested on super smash bros brawl by a dedicated tester then sent back for refinement they worked hard to preserve atmosphere of original game along with attempting to make translation as true as possible without being overly verbose to help translate text they posted script in segments on internet forums then later restricted access to work due to quality concerns during this time they found several competent translators who were able to do final 20 of script translation it took several months for entire process of extracting text translation then patching in translated text to be completed patch ended up being quite large as game designers had split game into hundreds of different data archives and suitable accommodations and adjustments needed to be made for this fan translation was released on january 19 2010 patch was designed to work on any wii device bypassing console s region locking and included a newly made costume for main character while receiving no official localized title it has commonly been dubbed fatal
