common toad european toad or in anglophone parts of europe simply toad bufo bufo from latin bufo toad is an amphibian found throughout most of europe with exception of ireland iceland and some mediterranean islands in western part of north asia and in a small portion of northwest africa it is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of toads and which form a species complex toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during day it becomes active at dusk and spends night hunting for invertebrates on which it feeds it moves with a slow ungainly walk or short jumps and has greyish brown skin covered with wart like lumps although toads are usually solitary animals in breeding season large numbers of toads converge on certain breeding ponds where males compete to mate with females eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in water and later hatch out into tadpoles after several months of growth and development these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads juveniles emerge from water and remain largely terrestrial for rest of their lives common toad seems to be in decline in part of its range but overall is listed as being of least concern in iucn red list of threatened species it is threatened by habitat loss especially by drainage of its breeding sites and some toads get killed on roads as they make their annual migrations it has long been associated in popular culture and literature with witchcraft taxonomy thumb left alt shoulder girdle skeleton showing shoulder girdle common toad was first given name rana bufo by swedish biologist carl linnaeus in 10th edition of systema naturae in 1758 in this work he placed all frogs and toads in single genus rana it later became apparent that this genus should be divided and in 1768 austrian naturalist josephus nicolaus laurenti placed common toad in genus bufo naming it bufo bufo toads in this genus are included in family bufonidae true toads various subspecies of b bufo have been recognized over years caucasian toad is found in mountainous regions of caucasus and was at one time classified as b b it has a larger genome and differs from b bufo morphologically and is now accepted as bufo verrucosissimus spiny toad was classified as b b spinosus it is found in france iberian peninsula and maghreb and grows to a larger size and has a skin than its more northern counterparts with which it intergrades it is now accepted as bufo spinosus gredos toad b b is restricted to sierra de gredos a mountain range in central spain it has exceptionally large paratoid glands and its colour tends to be blotched rather than uniform it is now considered to be a synonym of bufo spinosus b bufo is part of a species complex a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated several modern species are believed to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times these are spiny toad b spinosus caucasian toad b verrucosissimus and japanese common toad b japonicus european common toad bufo bufo seems to have arisen more recently it is believed that range of ancestral form extended into asia but that isolation between eastern and western species complexes occurred as a result of development of central asian deserts during middle miocene exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear a serological investigation into toad populations in turkey undertaken in 2001 examined blood serum proteins of bufo verrucosissimus and bufo spinosus it found that differences between two were not significant and that therefore former should be synonymized with latter a study published in 2012 examined phylogenetic relationships between eurasian and north african species in bufo bufo group and indicated a long evolutionary history for group nine to thirteen million years ago bufo a recently described species from south azerbaijan and iran split from main lineage further divisions occurred with bufo spinosus splitting off about five million years ago when pyrenees were being uplifted an event which isolated populations in iberian peninsula from those in rest of europe remaining european lineage split into bufo bufo and bufo verrucosissimus less than three million years ago during pleistocene very occasionally common toad hybridizes with natterjack toad bufo calamita or european green toad bufo viridis description common toad can reach about in length females are normally stouter than males and southern specimens tend to be larger than northern ones head is broad with a wide mouth below terminal snout which has two small nostrils there are no teeth bulbous protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit shaped pupils just behind eyes are two bulging regions paratoid glands which are positioned obliquely they contain a noxious substance bufotoxin which is used to deter potential predators head joins body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac body is broad and squat and positioned close to ground fore limbs are short with toes of fore feet turning inwards at breeding time male develops nuptial pads on first three fingers he uses these to grasp female when mating hind legs are short relative to other frogs legs and hind feet have long toes there is no tail skin is dry and covered with small wart like lumps colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown olive brown or greyish brown sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade common toad tends to be sexually dimorphic with females being browner and males greyer underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches other species with which common toad could be confused include natterjack toad bufo calamita and european green toad bufo viridis former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while latter has a distinctive mottled pattern paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in common toad common frog rana temporaria is also similar in appearance but it has a less rounded snout damp smooth skin and usually moves by leaping common toads can live for many years and have survived for fifty years in captivity in wild common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years their age can be determined by counting number of annual growth rings in bones of their phalanges distribution and habitat after common frog rana temporaria edible frog pelophylax esculentus and smooth newt vulgaris common toad is fourth most common amphibian in europe it is found throughout continent with exception of iceland cold northern parts of scandinavia ireland and a number of mediterranean islands these include malta crete corsica sardinia and balearic islands its easterly range extends to irkutsk in siberia and its southerly range includes parts of northwestern africa in northern mountain ranges of morocco algeria and tunisia a closely related variant lives in eastern asia including japan common toad is found at altitudes of up to in southern part of its range it is largely found in forested areas with coniferous deciduous and mixed woodland especially in wet locations it also inhabits open countryside fields copses parks and gardens and often occurs in dry areas well away from standing water behaviour and lifecycle left thumb alt a common toad adopts a defensive stance a common toad adopts a defensive stance thumb left grass snake eating adult common toad czech republic common toad usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short shuffling jumps involving all four legs it spends day concealed in a lair that it has hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous it emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in dark while hunting it is most active in wet weather by morning it has returned to its base and may occupy same place for several months it is voracious and eats woodlice slugs beetles caterpillars flies earthworms and even small mice small fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of tongue while larger items are grabbed with jaws having no teeth it swallows food whole in a series of gulps it does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small dark coloured moving object it encounters at night a research study showed that it would snap at a moving piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything periodically common toad sheds its skin this comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed when attacked common toad adopts a characteristic stance inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered its chief means of defence lies in foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin this contains a toxin called and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs rats and mink and even domestic cats birds that feed on toads include herons crows and birds of prey crows have been observed to puncture skin with their beak and then peck out animal s liver thus avoiding toxin tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not great crested newt aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae diving beetles and water boatmen these usually avoid noxious secretion by puncturing tadpole s skin and sucking out its juices thumb upright alt infected with larvae of lucilia bufonivora infected with larvae of lucilia bufonivora poland a parasitic fly lucilia bufonivora attacks adult common toads it lays its eggs on toad s skin and when these hatch larvae crawl into toad s nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences european fingernail clam is unusual in that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot it sometimes clings to toe of a common toad and this is believed to be one of means by which it disperses to new locations in 2007 researchers using a remotely operated underwater vehicle to survey loch ness scotland observed a common toad moving along bottom of lake at a depth of they were surprised to find that an air breathing animal could survive in such a location annual life cycle of common toad is divided into 3 periods winter sleep time of mating and feeding period reproduction thumb left alt amplexus amplexus common toad emerges from hibernation in spring and there is a mass migration towards breeding sites toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable adults use same location year after year and over 80 of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to pond at which they were spawned they find their way to these by using a suite of orientation cues including olfactory and magnetic cues but also visual cues help guide their journeys toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices have been found to be able to locate their chosen breeding pond when displacement exceeded three kilometres two miles thumb mating ball multiple amplexus males arrive first and remain in location for several weeks while females only stay long enough to mate and spawn rather than fighting for right to mate with a female male toads may settle disputes by means of pitch of their voice croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess nevertheless fights occur in some instances in a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one it was found that 38 of males won right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds a swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41 of females did not come to breeding pond in spring and missed a year before reproducing again thumb alt egg strings of common toad egg strings belgium males mount females backs grasping them with their fore limbs under armpits in a grip that is known as amplexus males are enthusiastic will try to grasp fish or inanimate objects and often mount backs of other males sometimes several toads form a heap each male trying to grasp female at base it is a stressful period and mortality is high among breeding toads a successful male stays in amplexus for several days and as female lays a long double string of small black eggs he fertilises them with his sperm as pair wander piggyback around shallow edges of pond gelatinous egg strings which may contain 3000 to 6000 eggs and be in length get tangled in plant stalks strings of eggs absorb water and swell in size and small tadpoles hatch out after two to three weeks at first they cling to remains of strings and feed on jelly they later attach themselves to underside of leaves of water weed before becoming free swimming tadpoles at first look similar to those of common frog rana temporaria but they are a darker colour being blackish above and dark grey below they can be distinguished from tadpoles of other species by fact that mouth is same width as space between eyes and this is twice as large as distance between nostrils over course of a few weeks their legs develop and their tail gradually gets reabsorbed by twelve weeks of age they are miniature toads measuring about long and ready to leave pond development and growth thumb left alt tadpoles of common toad tadpoles some with hind legs germany common toad reaches maturity at three to seven years old but there is great variability between populations juveniles are often parasitised by lung nematode this slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds even when they have heavy worm burdens large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens after several months of heavy worm infection some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles their parasite induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died another study investigated whether use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects development of common toad tadpoles toadlets were kept in dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths it was found that at certain concentrations which were well above any normally found in field growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated but at others there was no significant difference between experimental tadpoles and controls nevertheless certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among experimental animals a comparison was made between growth rate of newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes specimens studied being from norway germany switzerland netherlands and france at first growth rates for males and females was identical by time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21 of initial rate and they had reached 95 of their expected adult size some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time adjusting for differences in temperature and length of growing season toads grew and matured at much same rate from four colder localities these juveniles reached maturity after 1 09 years for males and 1 55 years for females however young toads from lowland france grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1 77 years for males and 2 49 years for females before reaching maturity winter sleep common toads winter in various holes in ground sometimes in basements often in droves with other amphibians rarely they spend winter in flowing waters with common frogs and green frogs conservation iucn red list of threatened species considers common toad as being of least concern this is because it has a wide distribution and is over most of its range a common species it is not particularly threatened by habitat loss because it is adaptable and is found in deciduous and coniferous forests scrubland meadows parks and gardens it prefers damp areas with dense foliage major threats it faces include loss of habitat locally drainage of wetlands where it breeds agricultural activities pollution and mortality on roads chytridiomycosis an infectious disease of amphibians has been reported in common toads in spain and united kingdom and may affect some populations there are parts of its range where common toad seems to be in decline in spain increased aridity and habitat loss have led to a diminution in numbers and it is regarded as near threatened a population in sierra de gredos mountain range is facing predation by otters and increased competition from frog pelophylax both otter and frog seem to be extending their ranges to higher altitudes common toad cannot be legally sold or traded in united kingdom but there is a slow decline in toad numbers and it has therefore been declared a biodiversity action plan priority species in russia it is considered to be a rare species in republic republic autonomous and irkutsk oblast but during 1990s it became more abundant in moscow oblast it has been found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and isolated by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment it was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments roadkill thumb alt tunnel for toads tunnel under road for toads germany many toads are killed by traffic while migrating to their breeding grounds in europe they have highest rate of mortality from roadkill among amphibians many of deaths take place on stretches of road where streams flow underneath showing that migration routes often follow water courses in some places in germany belgium great britain northern italy and poland special tunnels have been constructed so that toads can cross under roads in safety in other places local wildlife groups run toad patrols carrying amphibians across roads at busy crossing points in buckets toads start moving at dusk and for them to travel far temperature needs to remain above on a warm wet night they may continue moving all night but if it cools down they may stop earlier an estimate was made of significance of roadkill in toad populations in netherlands number of females killed in spring migration on a quiet country road ten vehicles per hour was compared with number of strings of eggs laid in nearby fens a 30 mortality rate was found with rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order bufotoxin main toxic substance found in parotoid gland and skin of common toad is called bufotoxin it was first isolated by heinrich wieland and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later meanwhile other workers succeeded in isolating same compound and its parent steroid bufotalin from japanese toad bufo japonicus by 1986 researchers at arizona state university had succeeded in synthesizing toad venom constituents bufotalin and bufotoxin chemical formula of bufotoxin is its physical effects resemble those of digitalis which in small doses increases strength with which heart muscle contracts and which is used in treatment of congestive heart failure skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals including humans clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes mouth nose and throat cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms paralysis and seizures increased salivation vomiting cyanosis and hallucinations there is no known anti venom treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions prevention of absorption and to monitor condition atropine phenytoin and lidocaine may prove useful in its management cultural significance thumb upright alt devil s coat of arms devil s coat of arms toad has long been considered to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world this may have its origins in fact that it is at home both on land and in water it may cause repugnance because of its drab wart like skin its slow movements and way it emerges from some dark hole in europe in middle ages toad was associated with devil for whom a coat of arms was invented emblazoned with three toads it was known that toad could poison people and as witch s familiar it was thought to possess magical powers even ordinary people made use of dried toads their bile faeces and blood in some areas finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present in basque country familiars were believed to be toads wearing elegant robes these were herded by children who were being trained as witches between 1610 and 1612 spanish inquisitor alonso de salazar frias investigated witchcraft in region and searched houses of suspected witches for dressed toads he found none these witches were reputed to use undomesticated toads as ingredients in their liniments and brews an english folk tale tells how an old woman a supposed witch cursed her landlord and all his possessions when he demanded unpaid rent for her cottage soon afterwards a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse toad was thrown into fire but escaped with severe burns meanwhile old witch s cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt by next day both toad and witch had died and it was found that woman s burns exactly mirrored those of toad thumb left alt witch feeding toads 1579 woodcut showing a witch feeding her toad familiars saliva of toad was considered poisonous and was known as sweltered venom and it was believed that it could spit or vomit poisonous fire toads were associated with devils and demons and in paradise lost john milton depicted satan as a toad when he poured poison into eve s ear first witch in shakespeare s macbeth gave instructions on using a toad in concoction of spells it was also believed that there was a jewel inside a toad s head a that when worn as a necklace or ring would warn wearer of attempts to poison them shakespeare mentioned this in as you like it upright thumb alt mr toad mr toad as illustrated by paul 1913 mr toad esq is one of main characters in children s novel wind in willows by kenneth grahame this has been dramatized by several authors including a a milne who called his play toad of toad hall mr toad is a conceited
