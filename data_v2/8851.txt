series was shown as a christmas special on 26 december 2016 on bbc two bill second episode of third series and first of a run of five episodes followed a few months later on 21 february 2017 writing and filming inspiration for bill came when shearsmith and pemberton creators of inside no 9 saw a group arguing over a bill at a muswell hill restaurant writers had an office in area and had lunch at same restaurant every day while writing programme s third series group was made up of three older people two women and a man pemberton said that unexpectedly they were arguing about wanting to pay it and we just came out and thought could that be one episode and then it s about sustaining that one idea for him when you re in writing phase you can see anything in day to day life that could spark your imagination after seeing this dispute writers immediately returned to their office to begin writing another inspiration according to shearsmith was yasmina reza s play art which like bill involves escalating arguments between friends richard bean s stage version of 1987 film house of games meanwhile was identified by shearsmith as sharing an intensity with more violent moments of bill much of script was originally written prior to decision to include twists in episode s closing minutes and some parts that were written were not filmed this included characters playing a word based drinking game with limoncello limoncello remained a part of narrative however and formed basis of a joke that was one of shearsmith s favourites from series a quip that thickly accented waitress was likely to bring a lemon and a cello rather than glasses of limoncello for pemberton and shearsmith episode was particularly claustrophobic and in this sense it mirrored sardines and la couchette first episodes of first and second series of inside no 9 respectively episode was filmed in a restaurant nightclub in hendon london location which was close to pemberton and shearsmith s homes was found by inside no 9 producer adam tandy bill is set in north of england at night this introduced particular filming challenges takes had to be re shot or edited if a london bus was visible out of restaurant s windows and some takes including many of character craig as his chair faced away from restaurant s windows could only be done later in working day otherwise daylight would be visible on screen cast

to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series bill starred shearsmith as archie pemberton as malcolm jason watkins as kevin philip glenister as craig ellie white as anya and callum coates as tim for his role pemberton wore an eddie large inspired wig but had his own beard he also wore padding to appear larger pemberton explained that he and shearsmith work hard to make roles attractive to accomplished actors claiming that glenister had hoped he would not like script looking for an excuse to turn down a week s work in his busy schedule pemberton and glenister had known each other for many years prior to bill they shared a mutual friend and glenister had appeared in productions for pemberton s theatre company 606 theatre glenister and watkins too had worked together on a play read through in past prior to filming watkins had not met white a less well known performer who was sought out by pemberton and shearsmith due to her appearance in people time an acclaimed pilot that was shown as part of bbc three s comedy feeds watkins had previously starred in shearsmith and pemberton s black comedy television programme psychoville pair say that though they generally have a rule against reusing actors from psychoville in inside no 9 so as to keep surprising and avoid familiarity they broke it because watkins is brilliant he was not only actor for which writers broke this rule performers were also reused in trial of elizabeth gadge and cold comfort for example pemberton highlighted working with watkins again as one of highlights of series watkins said he was attracted to inside no 9 by chance to work with pemberton and shearsmith again he described episode as like a beautifully constructed little play for television with a great mix of characters and surprising plots his character meanwhile he called put upon and pathetic and petty plot anya closes a restaurant where four men northerners archie malcolm and kevin are entertaining londoner craig have finished a post badminton meal after a misunderstanding between craig and thickly accented anya malcolm takes bill but he and archie both wish to pay craig insists that he will pay as he is leaving and wealthier than others three argue archie being unable to pay as card machine lacks paper malcolm suggests that bill should be split three ways northerners treating craig but kevin claims to be poorest archie malcolm and craig thrust cards at anya until kevin offers to pay he counts cash as anya fetches drinks craig thanks others for making his trip bearable and offers to pay restarting argument dispute becomes about malcolm s position as badminton club secretary and malcolm reveals that archie has spent time in prison anya arrives with drinks and craig paying bill speaks of craving excitement only to have his card declined he phones his au pair for a card keen she not look in wrong drawer but malcolm snatches phone he is about to pay but archie stops him archie reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour a distressed malcolm leaves table only to return furious archie was lying a heated debate ensues and four men wrestle over bill until

archie has called a prison contact who will remove body clean up will cost ps200 000 it is needed tonight in cash meaning only craig can pay he calls his au pair but treads on anya s hand and she yells kevin declares plan a failure archie malcolm kevin and anya had been hustling craig kevin now in control demands craig s phone craig refuses but is locked in restaurant in a final scene a waiter closes restaurant while hustlers archie malcolm kevin and anya entertain well dressed tim archie requests bill and waiter is revealed to be craig who has joined hustlers to satiate his cravings for excitement analysis bill opens with mundane image of men eating at a restaurant and arguing about bill but then in words of one critic takes that familiar scenario and pushes it to impressively baroque extremes in a reversal of norm all diners want to pay whole bill rather than wanting to limit their payment in this dispute bill explores themes of masculinity losing face competitiveness passive aggression and rivalry andrew billen writing in times compared this aspect of episode to television series mad dogs which had also starred glenister one critic suggested that glenister s character in mad dogs and craig in bill are similar characters tell well rehearsed anecdotes and jokes while craig is all flash cash and inappropriate comments to waitress pemberton s malcolm for michael hogan of daily telegraph appeared to have wandered in from a mike leigh production several critics commented on his striking hairpiece all four of men are unpleasant people english north south divide is a key feature of plot and humour with many references to north south caricatures craig is unfamiliar with northern phrases used by archie malcolm and kevin including piss mints and a tight fisted wanker craig is wealthier than other characters and mocks them with stereotypes about northerners as poor and stupid for one critic significance of north south divide in episode means that it could have been called revenge of northerners after revelation in closing minutes of bill character of episode changes biggest changes come about in watkins s kevin and white s anya kevin changes from a timid penny pincher referred to as professor apparently in jest to a menacing criminal mastermind anya initially reminiscent of manuel of fawlty towers or a character from allo allo faces criticism from her co conspirators for taking her characterisation too far allowing writers for one critic to have their cake and eat it any exaggerated characterisation is fault of character not writers script also acknowledge plot s silliness in an almost fourth wall breaking piece of dialogue when shearsmith s archie declares that characters plan was too elaborate for one commentator bill was closest episode of inside no 9 to league of gentlemen an earlier project of shearsmith and pemberton s due to its use of gallows humour and back and forth dialogue critics also compared episode to television series hustle to work of director quentin tarantino including 1992 film reservoir dogs and to roald dahl s 1948 short story man from south this latter story was adapted for television series tales of unexpected a key influence on inside no 9 as a whole and by tarantino for 1995 anthology film four rooms meanwhile premise was compared to that of chinese restaurant a 1991 episode of seinfeld reception bill was generally positively received by critics being given ratings of five out of five by mike ward of daily express four out of five by hogan daily telegraph and freelance journalist dan owen and three out of five by andrew billen of times it was praised as a tight gloriously stressful half hour hugely enjoyable an intricate wonderfully well executed tale and terrific fun mark butler writing for inews co uk said that while there had been inside no 9 episodes with greater atmosphere invention or ideas this episode as a 30 minute exercise in darkly comic suspense did trick it was not for butler among best episodes after conclusion of fourth series he identified bill as 20th best episode out of 24 comedy critic bruce dessau described bill as quite a low key opener for series proper ian hyland writing in daily mirror considered bill a competitor with 12 days of christine for distinction of best episode of inside no 9 ever episode was praised as genuinely funny with a range of different kinds of humour praise was also directed at morales both louisa mellor den of geek and owen commenting on his ability to give impression of movement even while episode revolved mostly around four men sitting at a table critics commended performances dessau called cast uniformly excellent and owen said that script was brilliantly performed ellen e jones writing for london evening standard praised both glenister and watkins hogan did likewise but argued that watkins stealthily stole show owen suggested that in episode watkins again proved why he s one of most underrated comic actors around right now mellor identified watkins and white as offering strongest performances hogan praised white for offering estimable support while billen identified white as performer who stole half hour story for mellor was strong shocks have intended impact and whole half hour works a treat she commended good writing and excellent structure hogan considered episode ingeniously plotted and owen called it delightfully written timing was also praised critics were less convinced by revelation at end of episode though butler initially called it satisfying and surprising he later characterised overly elaborate ending as lowering quality of episode ending was criticised as lacking in meaning and as prosaically disappointing for billen reveal made episode s premise less interesting and for owen characters were too quick to admit defeat final scene in particular was criticised some commentators suggesting that if thought about too much it was not fully convincing it was described as arguably unnecessary and as offering episode s only punch that failed to connect writers guild award at 2018 writers guild awards administered by writers guild of great britain
