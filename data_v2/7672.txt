bookkeeper working for a small produce commission firm called hewitt tuttle he worked long hours and delighted as he later recalled in all methods and systems of office he was particularly adept at calculating transportation costs which served him well later in his career much of rockefeller s duties involved negotiating with barge canal owners ship captains and freight agents in these negotiations he learned that posted transportation rates that were believed to be fixed could be altered depending on conditions and timing of freight and through use of rebates to preferred shippers rockefeller was also given duties of collecting debts when hewitt instructed him to do so instead of using his father s method of presence to collect debts rockefeller relied on a persistent pestering approach rockefeller received 16 a month for his three month apprenticeship during his first year he received 31 a month which was increased to 50 a month his final year provided him 58 a month as a youth rockefeller reportedly said that his two great ambitions were to make 100 000 equivalent to in dollars and to live 100 years business partnership and civil war service in 1859 rockefeller went into produce commission business with a partner maurice b clark and they raised 4 000 in dollars in capital clark initiated idea of partnership and offered 2 000 towards goal rockefeller had only 800 saved up at time and so borrowed 1 000 from his father big bill rockefeller at 10 percent interest rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there making money each year of his career in their first and second years of business clark rockefeller netted 4 400 on nearly half a million dollars in business and 17 000 worth of profit respectively and their profits soared with outbreak of civil war when union army called for massive amounts of food and supplies when civil war was nearing a close and with prospect of those war time profits ending clark rockefeller looked toward refining of crude oil while his brother frank fought in civil war rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers he gave money to union cause as did many rich northerners who avoided combat rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for president abraham lincoln and supported then new republican party as he said god gave me money and he did not apologize for it he felt at ease and righteous following methodist preacher john wesley s dictum gain all you can save all you can and give all you can at that time federal government was subsidizing oil prices driving price up from 35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13 75 burton w folsom myth of robber barons chapter 5 john d rockefeller and oil industry this created an oil drilling glut with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes most failed but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient they would blow holes in ground and gather up oil as they could often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in place of water williamson and daum american petroleum industry pp 82 194 a market existed for refined oil in form of kerosene coal had previously been used to extract kerosene but its tedious extraction process and high price prevented broad use even with high costs of freight transportation and a government levy during civil war government levied a tax of twenty cents a gallon on refined oil profits on refined product were large price of refined oil in 1863 was around 13 a barrel with a profit margin of around 5 to 8 a barrel capital expenditures for a refinery at that time were small around 1 000 to 1 500 and requiring only a few men to operate in this environment of wasteful boom partners switched from foodstuffs to oil building an oil refinery in 1863 in flats then cleveland s burgeoning industrial area refinery was directly owned by andrews clark company which was composed of clark rockefeller chemist samuel andrews and m b clark s two brothers commercial oil business was then in its infancy whale oil had become too expensive for masses and a cheaper general purpose lighting fuel was needed while other refineries would keep 60 of oil product that became kerosene but dump other 40 in rivers and massive sludge piles nevins rockefeller 1 183 85 197 8 rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever using gasoline to fuel refinery and selling rest as lubricating oil petroleum jelly and paraffin wax and other by products tar was used for paving naphtha shipped to gas plants likewise rockefeller s refineries hired their own plumbers cutting cost of pipe laying in half barrels that cost 2 50 each ended up only 0 96 when rockefeller bought wood and had them built for himself in february 1865 in what was later described by oil industry historian daniel yergin as a critical action rockefeller bought out clark brothers for 72 500 equivalent to in dollars at auction and established firm of rockefeller andrews rockefeller said it was day that determined my career he was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and great expansion westward fostered by growth of railroads and an oil fueled economy he borrowed heavily reinvested profits adapted rapidly to changing markets and fielded observers to track quickly expanding industry beginning in oil business in 1866 william rockefeller jr john s brother built another refinery in cleveland and brought john into partnership in 1867 henry morrison flagler became a partner and firm of rockefeller andrews flagler was established by 1868 with rockefeller continuing practices of borrowing and reinvesting profits controlling costs and using refineries waste company owned two cleveland refineries and a marketing subsidiary in new york it was largest oil refinery in world rockefeller andrews flagler was predecessor of standard oil company standard oil founding and early growth thumb upright john d rockefeller ca 1875 by end of american civil war cleveland was one of five main refining centers in u s besides pittsburgh pennsylvania new york and region in northwestern pennsylvania where most of oil originated by 1869 there was triple kerosene refining capacity than needed to supply market and capacity remained in excess for many years on january 10 1870 rockefeller abolished partnership of rockefeller andrews flagler forming standard oil of ohio continuing to apply his work ethic and efficiency rockefeller quickly expanded company to be most profitable refiner in ohio likewise it became one of largest shippers of oil and kerosene in country railroads competed fiercely for traffic and in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates formed south improvement company offering special deals to bulk customers like standard oil outside main oil centers cartel offered preferential treatment as a high volume shipper which included not just steep discounts rebates of up to 50 for their product but rebates for shipment of competing products part of this scheme was announcement of sharply increased freight charges this touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners including boycotts and vandalism which led to discovery of standard oil s part in deal a major new york refiner charles pratt and company headed by charles pratt and henry h rogers led opposition to this plan and railroads soon backed off pennsylvania revoked cartel s charter and non preferential rates were restored for time being while competitors may have been unhappy rockefeller s efforts did bring american consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by products before 1870 oil light was only for wealthy provided by expensive whale oil during next decade kerosene became commonly available to working and middle classes undeterred though vilified for first time by press rockefeller continued with his self reinforcing cycle of buying least efficient competing refiners improving efficiency of his operations pressing for discounts on oil shipments undercutting his competition making secret deals raising investment pools and buying rivals out in less than four months in 1872 in what was later known as cleveland conquest or cleveland massacre standard oil absorbed 22 of its 26 cleveland competitors eventually even his former antagonists pratt and rogers saw futility of continuing to compete against standard oil in 1874 they made a secret agreement with rockefeller to be acquired thumb standard oil trust certificate 1896 pratt and rogers became rockefeller s partners rogers in particular became one of rockefeller s key men in formation of standard oil trust pratt s son charles millard pratt became secretary of standard oil for many of his competitors rockefeller had merely to show them his books so they could see what they were up against and then make them a decent offer if they refused his offer he told them he would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction however he did not intend to eliminate competition entirely in fact his partner pratt said of that accusation competitors we must have if we absorb them it surely will bring up another instead of wanting to eliminate them rockefeller saw himself as industry s savior an angel of mercy absorbing weak and making industry as a whole stronger more efficient and more competitive standard was growing horizontally and vertically it added its own pipelines tank cars and home delivery network it kept oil prices low to stave off competitors made its products affordable to average household and to increase market penetration sometimes sold below cost it developed over 300 oil based products from tar to paint to petroleum jelly to chewing gum by end of 1870s standard was refining over 90 of oil in u s rockefeller had already become a millionaire 1 million is equivalent to in dollars thumb share of standard oil company issued may 1 1878 udo historische amerikanische p 68 74 in 1877 standard clashed with thomas a scott president of pennsylvania railroad standard s chief hauler rockefeller envisioned pipelines as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them railroad seeing standard s incursion into transportation and pipeline fields struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and pipelines standard countered held back its shipments and with help of other railroads started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest rockefeller prevailed and railroad sold its oil interests to standard in aftermath of that battle commonwealth of pennsylvania indicted rockefeller in 1879 on charges of monopolizing oil trade starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of standard oil s business practices rockefeller was under great strain during 1870s and 1880s when he was carrying out his plan of consolidation and integration and being attacked by press he complained that he could not stay asleep most nights rockefeller later commented all fortune that i have made has not served to compensate me for anxiety of that period monopoly thumb 200px

rockefeller although it always had hundreds of competitors standard oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in united states through horizontal integration ending up with about 90 of us market in kerosene industry company replaced old distribution system with its own vertical system it supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought fuel to local markets and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers thus bypassing existing network of wholesale jobbers despite improving quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to public price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80 over life of company standard oil s business practices created intense controversy standard s most potent weapons against competitors were differential pricing and secret transportation rebates firm was attacked by journalists and politicians throughout its existence in part for these monopolistic methods giving momentum to antitrust movement by 1880 according to new york world standard oil was most cruel impudent pitiless and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country to critics rockefeller replied in a business so large as ours some things are likely to be done which we cannot approve we correct them as soon as they come to our knowledge at that time many legislatures had made it difficult to incorporate in one state and operate in another as a result rockefeller and his associates owned dozens of separate corporations each of which operated in just one state management of whole enterprise was rather unwieldy in 1882 rockefeller s lawyers created an innovative form of corporation to centralize their holdings giving birth to standard oil trust trust was a corporation of corporations and entity s size and wealth drew much attention nine trustees including rockefeller ran 41 companies in trust public and press were immediately suspicious of this new legal entity and other businesses seized upon idea and emulated it further inflaming public sentiment standard oil had gained an aura of invincibility always prevailing against competitors critics and political enemies it had become richest biggest most feared business in world seemingly immune to boom and bust of business cycle consistently making profits year after year thumb 200px big corporations such as standard oil made large contributions to mckinley s presidential campaign company s vast american empire included 20 000 domestic wells 4 000 miles of pipeline 5 000 tank cars and over 100 000 employees its share of world oil refining topped out above 90 but slowly dropped to about 80 for rest of century despite formation of trust and its perceived immunity from all competition by 1880s standard oil had passed its peak of power over world oil market rockefeller finally gave up his dream of controlling all world s oil refining he admitted later we realized that public sentiment would be against us if we actually refined all oil over time foreign competition and new finds abroad eroded his dominance in early 1880s rockefeller created one of his most important innovations rather than try to influence price of crude oil directly standard oil had been exercising indirect control by altering oil storage charges to suit market conditions rockefeller then ordered issuance of certificates against oil stored in its pipelines these certificates became traded by speculators thus creating first oil futures market which effectively set spot market prices from then on national petroleum exchange opened in manhattan in late 1882 to facilitate trading of oil futures thumb 200px left fear of monopolies trusts is shown in this attack on rockefeller s standard oil company thumb 200px left rockefeller as an industrial emperor 1901 cartoon from puck magazine although 85 of world crude production was still coming from pennsylvania in 1880s oil from wells drilled in russia and asia began to reach world market robert nobel had established his own refining enterprise in abundant and cheaper russian oil fields including region s first pipeline and world s first oil tanker paris rothschilds jumped into fray providing financing additional fields were discovered in burma and java even more critical invention of light bulb gradually began to erode dominance of kerosene for illumination standard oil adapted by developing a european presence expanding into natural gas production in u s and then producing gasoline for automobiles which until then had been considered a waste product standard oil moved its headquarters to new york city at 26 broadway and rockefeller became a central figure in city s business community he bought a residence in 1884 on 54th street near mansions of other magnates such as william henry vanderbilt despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity rockefeller took new elevated train to his downtown office daily in 1887 congress created interstate commerce commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight but by then standard depended more on pipeline transport more threatening to standard s power was sherman antitrust act of 1890 originally used to control unions but later central to breakup of standard oil trust ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state antitrust laws and finally forced a separation of standard oil of ohio from rest of company in 1892 first step in dissolution of trust thumb right judge kenesaw mountain landis wags his pen at john d rockefeller who is sitting in witness stand during standard oil case on july 6 1907 in 1890s rockefeller expanded into iron ore and ore transportation forcing a collision with steel magnate andrew carnegie and their competition became a major subject of newspapers and cartoonists he went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in ohio indiana and west virginia as original pennsylvania oil fields began to play out amid frenetic expansion rockefeller began to think of retirement daily management of trust was turned over to john dustin archbold and rockefeller bought a new estate pocantico hills north of new york city turning more time to leisure activities including new sports of bicycling and golf upon his ascent to presidency theodore roosevelt initiated dozens of suits under sherman antitrust act and coaxed reforms out of congress in 1901 u s steel then controlled by j pierpont morgan having bought andrew carnegie s steel assets offered to buy standard s iron interests as well a deal brokered by henry clay frick exchanged standard s iron interests for u s steel stock and gave rockefeller and his son membership on company s board of directors in full retirement at age 63 rockefeller earned over 58 million in investments in 1902 one of most effective attacks on rockefeller and his firm was 1904 publication of history of standard oil company by ida tarbell a leading muckraker she documented company s espionage price wars heavy handed marketing tactics and courtroom evasions although her work prompted a huge backlash against company tarbell stated she was surprised at its magnitude i never had an animus against their size and wealth never objected to their corporate form i was willing that they should combine and grow as big and wealthy as they could but only by legitimate means but they had never played fair and that ruined their greatness for me tarbell s father had been driven out of oil business during south improvement company affair rockefeller called her miss in private but held back in public saying only not a word about that misguided woman he began a publicity campaign to put his company and himself in a better light though he had long maintained a policy of active silence with press he decided to make himself more accessible and responded with conciliatory comments such as capital and labor are both wild forces which require intelligent legislation to hold them in restriction he wrote and published his memoirs beginning in 1908 critics found his writing to be sanitized and disingenuous and thought that statements such as underlying essential element of success in business is to follow established laws of high class dealing seemed to be at odds with his true business methods rockefeller and his son continued to consolidate their oil interests as best they could until new jersey in 1909 changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re creation of trust in form of a single holding company rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock at last in 1911 supreme court of united states found standard oil company of new jersey in violation of sherman antitrust act by then trust still had a 70 market share of refined oil market but only 14 of u s crude oil supply court ruled that trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies these included among many others continental oil which became conoco now part of conocophillips standard of indiana which became amoco now part of bp standard of california which became chevron standard of new jersey which became esso and later exxon now part of exxonmobil standard of new york which became mobil now part of exxonmobil and standard of ohio which became sohio now part of bp pennzoil and chevron have remained separate companies rockefeller who had rarely sold shares held over 25 of standard s stock at time of breakup he and all of other stockholders received proportionate shares in each of 34 companies in aftermath rockefeller s control over oil industry was somewhat reduced but over next 10 years breakup also proved immensely profitable for him companies combined net worth rose fivefold

included president of cf i a spokesman for coal operators rockefeller s operative lamont montgomery bowers remained in background few miners actually belonged to union or participated in strike call

burned resulting in 15 women and children who hid in tents at camp being burned to death costs to both mine operators and union were high this incident brought unwanted national attention to colorado

february 1915 there was destitution in coal fields with help of funds from rockefeller foundation relief programs were organized by colorado committee on unemployment and relief a state agency created

united states commission on industrial relations conducted extensive hearings singling out john d rockefeller jr and rockefellers relationship with bowers for special attention bowers was relieved of duty and wellborn restored to control in 1915 then industrial relations improved rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized seriousness of event when testifying on ludlow massacre and asked what action he would have taken as director john d rockefeller jr stated i would have taken no action i would have deplored necessity which compelled officers of company to resort to such measures to
