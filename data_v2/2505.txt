entoprocta whose name means anus inside or kamptozoa is a phylum of mostly sessile aquatic animals ranging from long mature individuals are goblet shaped on relatively long stalks they have a crown of solid tentacles whose cilia generate water currents that draw food particles towards mouth and both mouth and anus lie inside crown superficially similar bryozoa ectoprocta have anus outside a crown of hollow tentacles most families of entoprocts are colonial and all but 2 of 150 species are marine a few solitary species can move slowly some species eject unfertilized ova into water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch and some of these species use placenta like organs to nourish developing eggs after hatching larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface there they metamorphose and larval gut rotates by up to 180deg so that mouth and anus face upwards both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning solitary species grow clones in space between tentacles and then release them when developed while colonial ones produce new members from stalks or from corridor like stolons fossils of entoprocts are very rare and earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from late jurassic most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of trochozoa which also includes molluscs and annelids however a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans names entoprocta coined in 1870 means anus inside alternative name kamptozoa meaning bent or curved animals prefix is explained at was assigned in 1929 some authors use entoprocta while others prefer kamptozoa description most species are colonial and their members are known as zooids since they are not fully independent animals zooids are typically long but range from long distinguishing features entoprocts are superficially like bryozoans ectoprocts as both groups have a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents that draw food particles towards mouth however they have different feeding mechanisms and internal anatomy and ectoprocts undergo a metamorphosis from larva to adult that destroys most of larval tissues their colonies also have a founder zooid which is different from its daughters summary of distinguishing features entoprocta bryozoa ectoprocta tentacles solid hollow feeding current

other zooids round unlike normal zooids metamorphosis to adult retains most larval structures destroys most larval structures excretory organs protonephridia none zooids thumb 200px body of a mature entoproct zooid has a goblet like structure with a calyx mounted on a relatively long stalk that attaches to a surface rim of calyx bears a crown of 8 to 30 solid tentacles which are extensions of body wall base of crown of tentacles is surrounded by a membrane that partially covers tentacles when they retract mouth and anus lie on opposite sides of atrium space enclosed by crown of tentacles and both can be closed by sphincter muscles gut is u shaped curving down towards base of calyx where it broadens to form stomach this is lined with a membrane consisting of a single layer of cells each of which has multiple cilia thumb left pedicellina magnified x 27 stalks of colonial species arise from shared attachment plates or from a network of stolons tubes that run across a surface in solitary species stalk ends in a muscular sucker or a flexible foot or is cemented to a surface stalk is muscular and produces a characteristic nodding motion in some species it is segmented some solitary species can move either by creeping on muscular foot or by somersaulting body wall consists of epidermis and an external cuticle which consists mainly of criss cross collagen fibers epidermis contains only a single layer of cells each of which bears multiple cilia hairs and microvilli tiny pleats that penetrate through cuticle stolons and stalks of colonial species have thicker cuticles stiffened with chitin there is no coelom internal fluid filled cavity lined with peritoneum and other internal organs are embedded in connective tissue that lies between stomach and base of crown of tentacles nervous system runs through connective tissue and just below epidermis and is controlled by a pair of ganglia nerves run from these to calyx tentacles and stalk and to sense organs in all these areas feeding digestion excretion circulation and respiration a band of cells each with multiple cilia runs along sides of tentacles connecting each tentacle to its neighbors except that there is a gap in band nearest anus a separate band of cilia grows along a groove that runs close to inner side of base of crown with a narrow extension up inner surface of each tentacle cilia on sides of tentacles create a current that flows into crown at bases of tentacles and exits above center of crown these cilia pass food particles to cilia on inner surface of tentacles and inner produce a downward current that drives particles into and around groove and then to mouth entoprocts generally use one or both of ciliary sieving in which one band of cilia creates feeding current and another traps food particles sieve and downstream collecting in which food particles are trapped as they are about to exit past them in entoprocts downstream collecting is carried out by same bands of cilia that generate current larvae also use downstream collecting but use a separate set of cilia to trap food particles in addition glands in tentacles secrete sticky threads that capture large particles a non colonial species reported from around antarctic peninsula in 1993 has cells that superficially resemble cnidocytes of cnidaria and fire sticky threads these unusual cells lie around mouth and may provide an additional means of capturing prey stomach and intestine are lined with microvilli which are thought to absorb nutrients anus which opens inside crown ejects solid wastes into outgoing current after tentacles have filtered food out of water in some families it is raised on a cone above level of groove that conducts food to mouth most species have a pair of protonephridia which extract soluble wastes from internal fluids and eliminate them through pores near mouth however freshwater species urnatella gracilis has multiple in calyx and stalk zooids absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide by diffusion which works well for small animals reproduction and life cycle most species are simultaneous hermaphrodites but some switch from male to female as they mature while individuals of some species remain of same sex all their lives individuals have one or two pairs of gonads placed between atrium and stomach and opening into a single gonopore in atrium eggs are thought to be fertilized in ovaries most species release eggs that hatch into planktonic larvae but a few brood their eggs in gonopore those that brood small eggs nourish them by a placenta like organ while larvae of species with larger eggs live on stored yolk development of fertilized egg into a larva follows a typical pattern cells divide by spiral cleavage and mesoderm develops from a specific cell labelled 4d in early embryo there is no coelom at any stage in some species larva is a trochophore which is planktonic and feeds on floating food particles by using two bands of cilia round its equator to sweep food into mouth which uses more cilia to drive them into stomach which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through anus in some species of genera loxosomella and loxosoma larva produces one or two buds that separate and form new individuals while trochophore disintegrates however most produce a larva with sensory tufts at top and front a pair of pigment cup ocelli little eyes a pair of protonephridia and a large cilia bearing foot at bottom after settling foot and frontal tuft attach to surface larvae of most species undergo a complex metamorphosis and internal organs may rotate by up to 180deg so that mouth and anus both point upwards all species can produce clones by budding colonial species produce new zooids from or from stalks and can form large colonies in this way in solitary species clones form on floor of atrium and are released when their organs are developed taxonomy phylum consists of about 150 recognized species grouped into 4

stolons present yes no colonies grow on shared baseplate not colonial segmented stems yes no evolutionary history fossil record thumb right 120px mid cambrian dinomischus was once hailed as earliest fossil entoproct but classification is uncertain since entoprocts are small and soft bodied fossils have been extremely rare in 1977 simon conway morris provided first description of dinomischus a sessile animal with calyx stalk and holdfast found in canada s burgess shale which was formed about morris regarded this animal as earliest known entoproct since its mouth and anus lay inside a ring of structures above calyx but noted that these structures were flat and rather stiff while tentacles of modern entoprocts are flexible and have a round cross section in 1992 j a todd and p d taylor concluded that dinomischus was not an entoproct because it did not have typical rounded flexible tentacles and fossils showed no other features that clearly resembled those of entoprocts in their opinion earliest fossil entoprocts were specimens they found from late jurassic rocks in england these resemble modern colonial genus barentsia in many ways including upright zooids linked by a network of stolons encrusting surface to which colony is attached straight stalks joined to stolons by bulky sockets with transverse bands of wrinkles overall size and proportions similar to that of modern species of barentsia another species cotyledion tylodes first described in 1999 was larger than extant entoprocts reaching 8 56 mm in height and unlike modern species was armored with sclerites scale like structures c tylodes did have a similar sessile lifestyle to modern entoprocts identified fossils of c tylodes were found in 520 million year old rocks from southern china this places early entoprocts in period of cambrian explosion sid perkins fossils of enigmatic sea creature emerge january 17 2013 maotianshan shales fossil cotyledion tylodes has been reevaluated as being an ancient sclerite bearing entoproct originally having been identified as a putative echinoderm this entoproct interpretation of cotyledion however has been questioned by mark mcmenamin who considers it best interpreted as a stem group echinoderm based on morphology of its stem sclerites family tree when entoprocts were discovered in nineteenth century they and bryozoans ectoprocts were regarded as classes within phylum bryozoa because both groups were sessile animals that filter fed by means of a crown of tentacles that bore cilia however from 1869 onwards increasing awareness of differences including position of entoproct anus inside feeding structure and difference in early pattern of division of cells in their embryos caused scientists to regard two groups as separate phyla bryozoa then became just an alternative name for ectoprocts in which anus is outside feeding organ however studies by one team in 2007 and 2008 argue for sinking entoprocta into bryozoa as a class and resurrecting ectoprocta as a name for currently identified bryozoans consensus of studies from 1996 onwards has been that entoprocts are part of trochozoa a protostome superphylum whose members are united in having as their most basic larval form trochophore type trochozoa also include molluscs annelids flatworms and others however scientists disagree about which phylum is mostly closely related to within an analysis in 2008 re introduced pre 1869 meaning of term bryozoa for a group in which entoprocts and ectoprocts are each other s closest relatives ecology distribution and habitats all species are sessile while great majority are marine two species live in freshwater loxosomatoides reported in 2004 in central thailand and urnatella gracilis found in all continents except antarctica colonial species are found in all oceans living on rocks shells algae and underwater buildings solitary species which are marine live on other animals that feed by producing water currents such as sponges ectoprocts and sessile annelids majority of species live no deeper than 50 meters but a few species are found in deep ocean a new inside anus found very deep interaction with other organisms some species of nudibranchs sea slugs particularly those of genus as well as flatworms prey on entoprocts small colonies of freshwater entoproct urnatella gracilis have been found living on aquatic larvae of cornutus ectoprocts gain a means of dispersal protection from predators and possibly a source of water that is rich in oxygen and nutrients as colonies often live next to gills of larval flies in white sea non colonial entoproct loxosomella prefers to live attached to bryozoan colonies mainly on edges of colonies or in chimneys gaps by which large bryozoan colonies expel water from which they have sieved food observation suggests that both entoprocts and bryozoans benefit from association each enhances water flow that other needs for feeding and longer cilia of entoprocts may help them to capture different food from that caught by bryozoans so that animals do not compete for same food entoprocts are small and have been little studied by zoologists hence it is difficult to determine whether a specimen belongs to a species that already occurs in same area or is an invader possibly as a result of human activities references further reading external links information on
