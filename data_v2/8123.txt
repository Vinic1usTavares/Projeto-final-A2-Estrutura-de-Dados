valerii who shoots a number six to free him writing thumb ronald d moore episode writer and series creator in 2013 preparing for production of battlestar galacticas first season writer and series creator ronald d moore wrote a short list of potential storylines one of which was fleet jumps every 33 minutes because cylons are relentlessly pursuing them crew gets no sleep conferring with fellow executive producer david eick two decided that this story would be best way to kick off season moore described writing 33 as a great experience he wrote whole script without a story outline or much structure excited to begin first episode of first season and start first year already at end of road moore wrote episode over his christmas break before series was officially picked up he later claimed that this aspect was what made episode one of more fun projects that he wrote all of first season david eick found episode to be a standalone concept that did not require having seen miniseries to understand it because miniseries ended at a very happy place starting series in middle of a crisis without explanation and showing audience that actually while you audience were away really bad things have been happening made for a much more intriguing and interesting story 33s complex storyline was a harbinger for episodes to come and laid groundwork with network and audiences alike moore explained on his blog that number 33 had no hidden meaning or significance only that he felt it sufficiently long to allow minor functions like showering or cat napping but was too short to allow anybody to gain any meaningful sleep and recharge their batteries further moore intentionally gave number no meaning to avoid creating and inserting unnecessary technobabble into a drama driven episode production thumb left david eick co executive producer in 2007 33 was director michael rymer s first television episode he accepted job without reading script saying that based on his writing experience 33 went well beyond his expectations and excited him bear mccreary originally composed musical theme boomer theme for this episode it was later expanded for use with athena character before becoming hera theme for character hera agathon in fourth season episode in a stream of stars joel ransom was director of photography for miniseries but when eick learned he was unavailable for series he turned to stephen mcnutt with whom he had worked on american gothic in interim mcnutt had moved on to shooting in high definition video this was fortuitous for production team because while ransom had filmed miniseries on 35 mm film production team was switching to high definition video for series executive producer david eick opined that 33 was silver bullet that ultimately tipped scales in their favor and convinced sci fi channel to pick up series network s biggest concern in picking up series was that battlestar galactica would fall victim to same trappings of space opera as other television properties star trek andromeda stargate two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in episode s dvd commentary first 33 went into gaius baltar s james callis mind and visited his house on caprica shot in lions bay british columbia being swept away by blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was not sort of imagery expected of space opera type shows second was going back to devastated caprica and following up with helo s story as sleep deprivation was a major plot point of episode actor edward james olmos william adama liaised with an expert on subject and crew to best depict actual effects realistically following up director michael rymer gave each main cast member a specific symptom to emphasize to avoid repetition on screen to aid a realistic portrayal olmos and several other cast members took their study a step further by restricting their sleep patterns to about three hours a night in episode s dvd commentary moore and rymer related how there were endless discussion about clocks to feature in this episode concerns over digital versus analog size and shape ratio of digital to analog clocks whether they should run forwards or backwards and whether any labels should be stenciled or hand drawn were all brought up david eick also noted that as of commentary s recording clock at felix gaeta s juliani station still had its 33 label affixed editing first cut of 33 was ten minutes too long despite this production crew took extra care not to eliminate human moments in their efforts to trim episode these included a shot of galen tyrol douglas and cally henderson clyne walking across galacticas hangar bay a shot of crewman oyarzun giving a bedraggled look over shoulder of another crewmember and a shot of mcclure walking through galacticas remembrance corridor in a question and answer session moore revealed a scene written for but cut from episode in cut scene recurring prop in characters briefing room was to have been explicitly introduced and explained prop remained in series but its backstory was cut there was a scene cut from 33 where we saw laura being given her copy of photo along with a card that said it was taken on roof of capitol building on during attack photo was inspired by famous shot of fire fighters raising flag at ground zero that became iconic i thought colonies would have their own version of this a snapshot taken in moment that becomes a symbol of day they can never forget and of all they had lost photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion as he stands on rooftop over looking devastation of his city while colonial flag waves at edge of frame inscription below photo on laura s plaque reads lest we forget in itself a reference to inscription on watch presented to john wayne s character in she wore a yellow ribbon other cut scenes included one shot in pilots head showing pilots wrecked and exhausted with an exchange between starbuck and apollo as well as several shots of commander adama olmos gagging and vomiting because of acid reflux brought on by sleep deprivation another line of olmos an ad lib about suicides in fleet was cut so as not to alienate audiences by being too dark as originally written and shot when apollo jamie bamber fires on olympic carrier it was made clear that he sees people inside moore wrote scene to be strong and clear that characters were making decision to fire on passenger liner in full awareness of consequences to illustrate and emphasize uncompromising nature of show this was an enormous fight between moore and network with latter feeling this was another scene that was too dark and had potential to turn away audiences network further implied that if scene were left intact they may have been compelled to air episodes out of order to placate network moore and eick changed ending of episode and cheated instead when apollo flies by olympic carrier it is unclear whether or not there is anybody inside in a small act of defiance visual effects supervisor gary snuck in small indeterminate movement behind one or two of olympic carriers windows on behalf of production and writing teams episode also originally ended with helo s escape from cylons on caprica again tasked by network to keep episode from being too dark moore wrote in an additional scene president roslin mary mcdonnell learning of newborn upon which to end episode on a hopeful note release and reception 33 first aired in united kingdom on and in united states on almost three months
