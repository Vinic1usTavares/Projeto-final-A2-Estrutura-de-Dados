writing thumb right 170px alt a man is speaking into a microphone episode was written by darin morgan making it his second writing credit for series this episode was second of four episodes written for series by darin morgan during its initial run morgan had previously written second season episode humbug which was a stylistic break from series norm being more overtly humorous after working on said episode morgan worried that he had written script wrong way and so he decided to write a more traditional x files story next time he wrote an episode to get inspiration morgan watched first season episode beyond sea which features an unreliable criminal who claims to have psychic powers morgan was struck by story and its tone and sought to write a script that emulated its overall feel hurwitz and knowles 2008 p 74 initially morgan was leery about focusing too much on humor so he decided to make his episode very dark in end however he decided to lighten some of mood by adding in some jokes edwards 1996 p 145 tone of episode was also affected by morgan suffering from depression which led to him developing a plot in which main character kills himself in end episode focuses heavily on free will and fatalistic that morgan was drawn due to his frustration with task of plotting episode stories morgan later explained that way bruckman and killer interact was really easy to plot but makes story seem complicated while working on script morgan realized that while mulder is supposed to be intelligent were he to talk to a normal person in real life he would come across as paranoid or insane writer was thus inspired to shake up mulder s image in episode by making him fallible and foolish this approach is illustrated by how mulder views bruckman only as a phenomenon and not as a person whereas scully views titular character as a human first and foremost bruckman s cryptic prediction that scully would not die sent fans into a frenzy due to its implications morgan claimed that bruckman knew full well how scully would die but decided to withhold information simply because he liked her however many interpreted line to mean that scully could not actually die and was in essence immortal frank spotnitz later argued that this sub plot was bookended by sixth season episode tithonus which showed scully starting to die only to have her come back fulfilling bruckman s prophecy spotnitz later called this ending very satisfying meisler 2000 p 118 however in 2011 spotnitz seemed to suggest that scully was in fact immortal this interpretation was seemingly verified by series creator chris carter in a 2014 reddit ama bruckman s quip about fox mulder dying by autoerotic asphyxiation was inspired both by previous references in series to mulder s enjoyment of pornography as well as a book that morgan had read about homicide investigations morgan later noted that while bruckman s line may have been prophetic he added it simply to be funny thumb buster
