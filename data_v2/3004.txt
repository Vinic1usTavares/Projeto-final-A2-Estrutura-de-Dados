out as gay after embarking on a dangerous affair with his boss brendan brady emmett j scanlan ste saw a nicer side to brendan and they formed an unusual friendship which eventually led to having a wild lads night out and a drunken kiss brendan rejected ste giving into passion later they kiss again but storyline took a dark twist when ste was beaten badly during an interview series producer paul marquess he described it as a long running storyline adding it is dark to begin with lessons that ste learns are ultimately positive and life affirming he also felt it was about not being afraid of who you are and ste was refreshingly accepting of his feelings towards a man richardson revealed he was shocked to discover details of plot he felt it was interesting to see how ste coped with being victim of domestic violence ste comes out to ex girlfriend amy first during their conversation ste reveals amy was only girl he really had feelings for and that his confusion over his sexuality was not reason for him abusing her during their relationship ste is very relieved by amy s good reaction amy is one who discovers that brendan is hitting ste and she tells ste to break it off reminding him of how it was when he was hitting her richardson admitted his initial fears of portrayal because he felt it was a taboo subject he had difficulties portraying it initially this was because he was not familiar with subject storyline had not been tackled in british soap opera before and richardson felt ste was making television history he then explained how storyline differs from other soap operas because ste doesn t question his sexuality and it s not about a struggle it s about domestic abuse in a gay relationship richardson also stated because of plots dark nature he hoped viewers would be drawn into it he branded storyline as unpredictable because viewers never know if brendan was going kiss or hit ste a spokesperson for hollyoaks confirmed that ste didn t realise how much power and control brendan was wielding over him this was because ste was still coming to terms with his sexuality ste felt a connection he never felt before because he hadn t had another male partner brendan manipulated ste into believing he was to blame for brendan s anger representative said this was why he ended up apologising storyline also aimed to shock viewers with dark depths brendan would go to in order to control ste marquess later stated that brendan s past would be explained and that everyone should remember it was ste who used to hit amy first adding so it s a dark and interwoven story made all more complicated by introduction of a new love interest for ste relationship with noah baxter in early 2011 marquess revealed that ste would have a new boyfriend this would help create another classic triangle storyline it was then revealed that new gay character noah baxter law thompson would befriend ste noah s friend cindy cunningham stephanie waring decides to help pair start a

and endured tough times doug s past romances were with females with pivotal one being jenny brennan explained that hollyoaks were not just turning doug gay doug what type of love he had for jenny but
