hygeberht died after 803 was bishop of lichfield from 779 and archbishop of lichfield after elevation of lichfield to an archdiocese some time after 787 during reign of powerful mercian king offa little is known of hygeberht s background although he was probably a native of mercia offa succeeded in having lichfield elevated to an archbishopric but rise in lichfield s status was unpopular with canterbury other southern english archbishopric offa was probably motivated by a desire to increase status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom s ecclesiastical affairs from control of another kingdom s archbishopric and possibly need to secure coronation of offa s successor which archbishop of canterbury had opposed after offa s death his distant relative coenwulf became king and petitioned pope to have lichfield returned to a simple bishopric pope agreed to do so in 803 by which time hygeberht was no longer even considered a bishop he is listed as an abbot at council that oversaw demotion of lichfield in 803 date of his death is unknown background nothing is known of hygeberht s ancestry or his upbringing but given his close ties to kingdom of mercia he was probably a mercian by birth he became bishop of lichfield in 779 williams hygeberht oxford dictionary of national biography at a mercian council he attended that year at he was styled electus or bishop elect latham revised medieval latin word list pp 162 and 370 two years later he witnessed a charter of offa s concerning an ecclesiastical claim on a church in worcester godfrey archbishopric studies in church history pp 147 148 perhaps as early as 786 creation of a mercian archbishopric was being discussed at offa s court a letter to papacy written by coenwulf who succeeded offa s son ecgfrith to mercian throne claimed that offa s motives were his dislike of jaenberht archbishop of canterbury and of men of kent witney period of mercian rule archaeologia cantiana p 89 at council of chelsea held in 787 offa secured creation of an archbishopric for his kingdom centred on diocese of lichfield in modern staffordshire stenton anglo saxon england p 218 offa may have justified move by suggesting that jaenberht planned to allow frankish king charlemagne to use a landing site in kent if latter decided to invade kirby earliest english kings p 142 although this is only known from a 13th century writer matthew paris brooks early history of church of canterbury pp 115 116 another concern was probably that of prestige as having main mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase kingdom s status ortenberg anglo saxon church english church and papacy pp 50 53 an archbishopric in mercia would also reinforce kingdom s independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on canterbury in kingdom of kent which offa had recently brought under mercian control kirby making of early england p 64 jaenberht supported kentish king egbert ii who was not known as a firm supporter of offa s an archbishop at canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to offa would be an impediment to offa s ability to establish overlordship of kent and other areas of england by elevating another archbishop offa would reduce political power of archbishops of canterbury cubitt anglo saxon church councils p 232 elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented in 735 papacy had elevated another anglo saxon bishopric to an archbishopric when became first archbishop of york godfrey studies in church history p 145 council of chelsea two different versions of anglo saxon chronicle record proceedings of council peterborough manuscript version e of chronicle records council under year 785 although events took place in 787 and states that here there was a contentious synod at chelsea and archbishop jaenberht relinquished some part of his bishopric and hygeberht was chosen by king offa and ecgfrith consecrated as king swanton trans and ed anglo saxon chronicle pp 53 55 canterbury manuscript version f has council under 785 also and describes council as a full synod sat at but otherwise relates much same events swanton trans and ed anglo saxon chronicle p 52 historian nicholas brooks sees coupling of elevation of lichfield with consecration of ecgfrith who was offa s son as significant he argues that offa desired to have ecgfrith consecrated as his successor during offa s lifetime but was unable to get jaenberht to agree and this was another factor in creation of lichfield as an archbishopric brooks early history of church of canterbury pp 118 119 hygeberht consecrated ecgfrith after hygeberht s elevation to archiepiscopal status offa vowed at council to donate 365 mancuses each year to papacy to provide for poor people in rome and to provide lights for st peter s basilica stated to be a thanks offering for his victories c j godfrey has argued that donation was really in return for papal approval of offa s scheme to elevate diocese of lichfield to an archdiocese whatever offa s motivation historians have generally seen gift as beginning of peter s pence an annual tax paid to rome by english church godfrey archbishopric studies in church history p 147 although it appears that council of chelsea approved lichfield s elevation to an archdiocese hygeberht who was present remained a bishop at its conclusion he signed council s report still as a bishop there is no indication that he played any significant part in council nor in actions that led to him becoming an archbishop archbishop left

received a pallium symbol of an archbishop s authority from pope hadrian i fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 218 in one surviving charter of 788 hygeberht is listed with title of bishop but another from late 788 gives him title of archbishop more charters from 789 and 792 also give him title of archbishop and he continued to be named as such on charters until 799 throughout early part of hygeberht s episcopate jaenberht of canterbury was senior archbishop and enjoyed precedence although after jaenberht s death in 792 hygeberht became foremost prelate in southern england it is unknown if jaenberht ever acknowledged hygeberht s elevation as an archbishop but there is no evidence that jaenberht contested division of his archiepiscopal see and creation of another archbishopric hygeberht consecrated jaenberht s successor aethelhard after offa consulted alcuin of york about proper procedure stenton anglo saxon england p 225 footnote 1 hygeberht then was considered senior prelate in south of england as shown by him being listed before aethelhard in any charters they both appear on brooks early history of church of canterbury p 120 canterbury retained as suffragans or subordinates bishops of winchester sherborne selsey rochester and london dioceses of worcester hereford leicester lindsey dommoc and elmham were transferred to lichfield kirby earliest english kings p 144 this listing however comes from gesta pontificum anglorum of later medieval chronicler william of malmesbury written in about 1120 although division is logical william confuses hygeberht with hygeberht s successor ealdwulf and does not give a source for his list which suggest that it may be untrustworthy creation of a third archbishopric was controversial and community at canterbury cathedral seems never to have accepted hygeberht as an archbishop historian d p kirby speculates that there were always some in mercian kingdom who disapproved of elevation of lichfield to an archdiocese kirby earliest english kings p 143 during hygeberht s archbishopric joint synods for provinces of lichfield and canterbury were held presided over by both archbishops these gatherings were canonically irregular as usual procedure was for each province to hold its own synod reasons for holding joint councils are unclear they may have been a manifestation of offa s desire to supervise entire southern church or an attempt by archbishops of canterbury to retain some authority over province of lichfield cubitt anglo saxon church councils p 218 offa died in july 796 and his son ecgfrith 141 days later coenwulf a distant relative succeeded to mercian throne after ecgfrith s death kirby earliest english kings p 148 soon after his accession coenwulf sought to replace two archdioceses with one at london stenton anglo saxon england p 226 arguing that pope gregory i s original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at london instead of at canterbury in 797 and 798 coenwulf sent envoys to rome to pope leo iii suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at london for aethelhard king s envoys laid blame for problems encountered with lichfield archdiocese on pope hadrian i s incompetence displeased by criticism of papacy leo ruled against king s plan in 801 coenwulf put down a kentish rebellion allowing him to once more assert his authority in canterbury and control archbishopric finally in 802 pope leo iii granted that hadrian s decision was invalid after english clergy told him it had been achieved by offa s misrepresentation leo returned all jurisdiction to canterbury a decision announced by aethelhard at council of clovesho in 803 stenton anglo saxon england pp 227 228 resignation and death hygeberht had resigned his see before lichfield was demoted back to a bishopric kirby earliest english kings pp 144 145 he was still named as archbishop in 799 but evidence suggests that he no longer controlled all of suffragan bishops that he once had possibly he was replaced at lichfield his successor ealdwulf attended a council in 801 and was named bishop in council s records by time that aethelhard held another council at clovesho in 803 hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop and appears at that council as an abbot brooks early history of church of canterbury pp 125 126 which abbey he was abbot of and his exact date of death are unknown hygeberht s contemporary at canterbury aethelhard was first archbishop of canterbury to require an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected historian eric
