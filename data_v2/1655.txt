on recommendation of armidales commanding officer lieutenant commander david richards and announced in a supplement to london gazette on 29 june 1943 however many hold opinion that sheean s gallantry devotion to duty and self sacrifice were worthy of victoria cross with author robert macklin stating his actions were in highest tradition of australian military and comparing them with those of
