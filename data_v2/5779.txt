lepage failing to qualify early practice speeds approached nascar had mandated before qualifier that holes in cars restrictor plates be reduced by later conceding that rule may have affected some teams more than others according to gilliland they threw a curveball at us this morning with restrictor plate and engine builder doug yates wasn t worried at all he put super tune on it and thing ran great earnhardt called reduction in speed unnecessary track is safe i don t feel late change in plate size is a very fair situation for everybody once you re up around 190s what s two miles an hour i don t see what big deal is speed average is up because corner speed remains better with new asphalt as far as running in a straight line we re no faster than we ve always run here despite mandated

that lap burton in fifth had a flat left rear tire and lost a lap field then formed a single line with most remaining in that formation for rest of race on final lap johnson and vickers left turn two with johnson moving out of line to pass earnhardt when vickers tried to move out with johnson to provide drafting assistance he clipped johnson s right rear quarter panel johnson clipped earnhardt sending both drivers into infield yellow flag went out and field was frozen in place with order of finish determined by where drivers were when caution began this gave vickers victory first of his career although he was booed by crowd post race comments vickers appeared in victory lane to celebrate his first career win in front of crowd earning 228 850 for victory earnhardt was quick to forgive him for last lap accident he didn t wreck anyone on purpose he was trying to push 48 i don t think he thought oh here s my chance to knock them both out he just got excited trying to push 48 johnson was less sanguine we had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate i was real patient until white flag was up i got a good run inside 8 and got a lot of help from behind too much help knowing situation we re all in i would hope someone would be a little more patient johnson s crew chief chad knaus was annoyed i just don t think vickers has talent to understand what he has underneath him vickers who would leave hendrick motorsports in 2007 for red bull racing team said i would expect them to be a little upset jimmie is my friend my teammate and he is running for a championship but he knows just as well as i do that if i wasn t bump drafting he never would have had a shot to pass junior additionally he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving third place finisher kurt busch argued vickers was in a catch 22 situation he was trying to help his teammate it just didn t turn out that way vickers was doing best he could to help 48 he just didn t anticipate 8 car blocking as long as he did vickers would later receive additional security during next race weekend result kept burton in lead in drivers championship after race jeff gordon who was involved in lap 137 accident was less optimistic about his championship chances this pretty much does it for us as far as i m concerned for championship you knew exactly that something like that was going to happen in manufacturers championship chevrolet increased its point total to 231 dodge moved into second place with 180 and ford was a close third with 179 race took three hours
