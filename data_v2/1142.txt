festivities for a royal wedding at court of duke vincenzo gonzaga in mantua all music is lost apart from extended recitative known as ariadne s lament libretto which survives complete was written in eight scenes by ottavio rinuccini who used ovid s heroides and other classical sources to relate story of ariadne s abandonment by theseus on island of naxos and her subsequent elevation as bride to god bacchus opera was composed under severe pressure of time composer later said that effort of creating it almost killed him initial performance produced with lavish and innovative special effects was highly praised and work was equally well received in venice when it was revived under composer s direction in 1640 as inaugural work for teatro san moise rinuccini s libretto is available in a number of editions music of lamento survives because it was published by monteverdi in several different versions independently from opera this fragment became a highly influential musical work and was widely imitated expressive lament became an integral feature of italian opera for much of 17th century in recent years lamento has become popular as a concert and recital piece and has been

during that time significant developments were taking place in world of musical theatre in 1598 work generally recognised as first in new genre of opera jacopo peri s dafne was performed in florence carter 2002 p 24 duke was quick to recognise potential of this new musical form and its potential for bringing prestige to those willing to sponsor it ringer p 16 as part of his duties to gonzaga court monteverdi was often required to compose or arrange music for staged performances these works included a fully fledged opera l orfeo written to a libretto by alessandro striggio younger and presented before court on 24 february 1607 this performance pleased duke who ordered a repeat showing for 1 march fabbri pp 63 64 a contemporary account records that piece could not have been done better music observing due propriety serves poetry so well that nothing more beautiful is to be heard anywhere fenlon correspondence pp 167 72 monteverdi was then required to write several pieces for performance at wedding of duke s son and heir francesco planned for early may 1608 ringer p 91 these included a musical prologue for battista guarini s play l and a setting of dramatic ballet il ballo delle dance of ungrateful ladies with a text by ottavio rinuccini there was also to be an opera though it was not initially certain that monteverdi would provide this other works under consideration were peri s le nozze di peleo e marriage of and thetis with a libretto by francesco and a new setting of dafne by marco da gagliano in event former was rejected and latter designated for performance at 1607 08 carnival duke decreed that wedding opera should be based on myth of arianna ariadne and that rinuccini should write text monteverdi was instructed to provide music fabbri pp 77 82 creation libretto at time of his commission for l arianna rinuccini was probably most experienced and distinguished of all librettists his writing career stretched back to 1579 when he had written verses for florentine court entertainment d he had become widely known through his verse contributions to celebrated for girolamo s play la pilgrim woman performed in may 1589 at wedding of ferdinando i de medici and christina of lorraine grout p 27 according to gagliano rinuccini was a primary influence in emergence of opera as a genre he adapted conventions of his contemporary lyric poets to produce librettos for two of earliest operas dafne and euridice latter set to music by both peri and giulio caccini carter 2002 p 17 thumb upright left 175px claudio monteverdi c 1630 for his arianna libretto rinuccini drew on a variety of classical sources notably tenth book of ovid s heroides parts of carmina of catullus and section in virgil s epic aeneid dealing with dido s abandonment by aeneas he also used aspects of more recent literary works ludovico ariosto s orlando furioso torquato s and giovanni andrea dell s 1561 translation of ovid s metamorphoses fabbri p 96 libretto was extended during rehearsals when carlo de rossi a member of duke s court reported duchess eleonora s complaint that piece was very dry and needed to be enriched with further action fabbri pp 81 82 libretto published in venice in 1622 takes form of a prologue and eight scenes although other arrangements of text have been suggested for example musicologist bojan has posited an alternative of a prologue and five scenes composition monteverdi probably began composing in late october or early november 1607 since rinuccini s arrival in mantua can be dated to 23 october with rehearsals due to begin in new year monteverdi composed work in a hurry and under considerable pressure nearly 20 years later he was still complaining in a letter to striggio of hardships he had been made to suffer it was shortness of time that brought me almost to death s door in writing l arianna stevens ed pp 311 13 monteverdi had apparently completed score by early january and rehearsals began however his work was not over as he was required to write further music when work was extended after rossi s intervention among material added or lengthened were early scene between venus and cupid and jupiter s blessing from heaven at end of opera carter 2002 p 208 in march 1608 well into rehearsal period opera s scheduled performance was jeopardised by death from smallpox of leading soprano caterina martinelli fortunately a replacement was to hand a renowned actress and singer virginia ramponi andreini known professionally as la florinda who was performing in mantua a courtier antonio costantini later reported that she learned part of arianna in six days carter 2002 p 202 musicologist tim carter suggests that arianna s lament may have been added to opera at this late stage to exploit la florinda s well known vocal capabilities carter 2002 p 93 roles casting for opera s premiere is uncertain while participation of singers such as la florinda and francesco rasi can be established sources have speculated on involvement of other singers there are several versions of published libretto list of roles is taken from publication by gherardo iseppo imberti venice 1622 in italian cast 28 may rasi

her disloyalty to her father but declares her love for theseus she departs to find shelter for night after which a fishermen s chorus compares her eyes with stars of heaven theseus alone with his

as bacchus promises ariadne immortality in heaven and a crown of stars performance history premiere mantua 1608 date of gonzaga wedding was repeatedly postponed because of diplomatic problems which delayed bride s arrival in mantua until 24 may wedding festivities began four days later fabbri pp 85 87 l arianna was performed on 28 may 1608 first of several spectacular entertainments a large temporary theatre had been built for occasion according to court s chronicler federico follino this held 6 000 people a figure which carter deems unlikely carter 2002 pp 82 83 whatever its size arena could not hold everyone who wished to be present follino s account records that although duke had strictly limited numbers from his household entitled to be there many distinguished foreign visitors could not be seated and were obliged to crowd around doors although contained within a single stage set production was lavish with 300 men employed to manipulate stage machinery redlich p 91 follino s report described set as a wild rocky place in midst of waves which in furthest part of prospect could be seen always in motion as action began apollo was revealed sitting on a very beautiful cloud which moving down little by little reached in a short space of time stage and disappeared in a moment thereafter all performers proved excellent in art of singing every part succeeded more than wondrously follino s enthusiasm was echoed in other reports made by dignitaries to their own courts ambassador for house of este who referred to work as a comedy in music mentioned in particular andreini s performance which in her lament made many weep and that of francesco rasi who as bacchus sang divinely fabbri p 92 monteverdi s fellow composer marco da gagliano wrote that monteverdi s music had moved entire audience to tears redlich pp 101 03 in all opera lasted for two and a half hours revival venice 1639 40 thumb upright front page of 1623 venice edition of lamento d ariana sic despite positive reception accorded to l arianna at its premiere duke did not request a second showing as he had with l orfeo previous year ringer p 40 next hint of a performance of l arianna is in 1614 when medici court in florence requested a copy of score presumably with intention of staging it there is however no record of any such performance there fabbri p 144 early in 1620 striggio asked monteverdi to send him music for a projected performance in mantua as part of celebration for duchess caterina s birthday monteverdi went to trouble and expense of preparing a new manuscript with revisions had he had more time he informed striggio he would have revised work more thoroughly carter 2002 p 168 hearing nothing further from mantuan court monteverdi wrote to striggio on 18 april 1620 offering to help with staging a month or so later however he learned that duchess s celebrations had been scaled back and that there had been no performance of l arianna fabbri p 175 there is some evidence to suggest a possible performance in dubrovnik in or some time after 1620 a croatian translation of libretto was published in ancona in 1633 however only known revival of work came in venice in 1640 public theatre opera had come to city in march 1637 when new teatro san opened with a performance of l andromeda by francesco ringer p 130 popularity of this and other works led to more theatres converting their facilities for opera l arianna was chosen to inaugurate teatro san moise as an opera house during 1639 40 carnival precise date of this performance is not recorded a revised version of libretto had been published in 1639 with substantial cuts and revisions from 1608 version to remove passages too specifically linked to mantuan wedding fabbri pp 250 51 composer who was by then 73 years old had acquired considerable prestige in venice having been director of music at st mark s basilica since 1613 dedication in revised and republished libretto describes him as most celebrated apollo of century and highest intelligence of heavens of humanity p 18 opera was received with great enthusiasm by a venetian audience already familiar with lament which had been published in city in 1623 carter 2002 p 299 within a few weeks theatre replaced l arianna with monteverdi s new opera il ritorno d ulisse in patria which proved an even greater success ringer pp 135 36 loss after venice revival of 1639 40 there are no further records of performances of l arianna rinuccini s libretto which was published on several occasions during monteverdi s lifetime has survived intact but opera s music disappeared some time after 1640 with exception of ariadne s scene 6 lament known as lamento d arianna in loss of its music opera shares fate of most of monteverdi s theatrical works including six of his other nine operas carter s explanation for high rate of attrition is that memories were short and large scale musical works often had limited currency beyond their immediate circumstances such music was rarely published and quickly discarded carter 2002 p 2002 pp 299 306 lamento d arianna thumb 280px first two pages of first edition of lamento published by in venice in 1623 lament was saved from oblivion by monteverdi s decision to publish it independently from opera first in 1614 as a five voice madrigal monteverdi 1614 then in 1623 as a monody monteverdi 1623 and finally in 1641 as a sacred hymn lamento della madonna monteverdi 1641 pp 56 60 five voice adaptation was included in composer s sixth book of madrigals there is evidence that this arrangement was made at suggestion of an unnamed venetian gentleman who thought that melody would benefit from counterpoint fabbri pp 140 41 in 1868 lament was published in paris and in 1910 italian composer ottorino respighi issued an edited orchestral transcription carter 2002 p 5 in her analysis of lament musicologist suzanne cusick asserts that a large extent monteverdi s fame and historical status rested for centuries on universal appreciation of his achievement in celebrated lament which was among most emulated and therefore influential works of early 17th century in cusick s view monteverdi creat ed lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera that would become crucial almost genre defining to full scale public operas of 17th century venice and she concludes by noting that women of mantua would have recognised transformations enacted in lament as representative of their own life stories monteverdi she believes sought to represent in music eventual triumph of female piety over promiscuity arianna s gradual loss of her passionate self in lament constitutes a public musical chastening of this incautious woman who dared to choose her own mate in her study recitative soliloquy margaret murata records that laments of this kind became a staple feature of operas until about 1650 thereafter more rarely until total triumph of aria around 1670 murata p 45 mark ringer in his analysis of monteverdi s musical drama suggests that lament defines monteverdi s innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which two and a half centuries later prelude and liebestod in tristan und isolde announced wagner s discovery of new expressive frontiers ringer pp 96 98 in its operatic context lament takes form of an extended recitative of more than 70 vocal lines delivered in five sections divided by choral comments some of wording is prefigured in immediately preceding scene in which first envoy describes arianna s plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen lament depicts arianna s various emotional reactions to her abandonment sorrow anger fear self pity desolation and a sense of futility cusick draws attention to manner in which monteverdi is able to match in music rhetorical and syntactical gestures in rinuccini s text opening repeated words lasciatemi morire let me die are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which ringer describes as an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain monteverdi was one of first users of this musical device what follows says ringer has a range and depth comparable to shakespeare s most searching soliloquies words lasciatemi morire are followed by o teseo o teseo mio o theseus my theseus two phrases represent arianna s contrasting emotions of despair and longing throughout lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness until final iteration of o teseo after which a descending line brings lament to a quiet conclusion among other composers who adopted format and style of arianna s lament were francesco cavalli whose opera le nozze di teti e di peleo contains three such pieces francesco costa who included a setting of rinuccini s text in his madrigal collection d arianna and sigismondo d india who wrote several laments in 1620s after version of arianna s lament was published in 1623 carter 2002 pp 217 18 monteverdi himself used expressive lament format in each of his two late operas il ritorno d ulisse in patria and l incoronazione di poppea for respective characters of penelope and in 1641 monteverdi adapted arianna s lament into a sacred song with a latin text della madonna incipit iam mi fili which he included in selva morale e last of his works published during his lifetime ringer p 95 recordings lamento d arianna many recordings are available of both five voice madrigal and solo voice version of lamento solo recordings include several versions which use a tenor or baritone voice among leading singers who have issued recordings are sopranos
