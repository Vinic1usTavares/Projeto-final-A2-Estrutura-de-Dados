last theorem is a 2008 science fiction novel by arthur c clarke and frederik pohl it was first published in united kingdom by in july 2008 and in united states by del rey books in august 2008 book is about a young sri lankan mathematician who finds a short proof of fermat s last theorem while an alien invasion of earth is in progress novel began as clarke s but when ill health and a psychological or possibly neurological form of writer s block prevented him from making progress he handed over his notes and incomplete manuscript to pohl who in close consultation with clarke completed novel clarke reviewed final manuscript in early march 2008 just days before he died in general last theorem was not well received by critics entertainment weekly in their review of novel said that uneven pacing and tone mar an intriguing cautionary tale los angeles times wondered how stable manuscript was when it was published adding that it does nothing to burnish legacy of either of its authors san francisco chronicle however described novel as a fitting valedictory for clarke and a reminder of pohl s great relevance to a genre he has championed for more than 70 years background science fiction grand masters arthur c clarke and frederik pohl collaborated for first time on last theorem novel initially was clarke s and he began working on it in early 2004 but in 2006 at age of 88 ill health brought on by complications from post polio syndrome and writer s block impeded his progress and he asked pohl for help pohl explained arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and didn t know how to write any of books he had contracted stories had just gone out of his head clarke gave pohl a 40 50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes and over next two years pohl wrote book pohl said that everything in novel is something he either suggested or wrote or i discussed with him some of clarke s notes were so obscure that even clarke himself could not understand them pohl only two years younger than clarke had health problems of his own he could no longer type and wrote book out in longhand leaving it up to his wife to translate his indecipherable scribbles clarke reviewed and approved final manuscript of last theorem in early march 2008 just days before he died pohl died five years later in september 2013 thumb left arthur c clarke at his home in colombo sri lanka march 2005 some of concepts that appear in last theorem originally appeared in clarke s earlier works space elevator that is built in sri lanka originally featured in fountains of paradise 1979 where it was also built in sri lanka then ceylon because elevator will work only on or near equator clarke moved ceylon south to equator in fountains of paradise and equator north to sri lanka in last theorem solar powered space yacht race was first featured in a short story of clarke s wind from sun 1964 and concept of a mysterious elder race deciding our fate in this case grand galactics has appeared in several of clarke s previous novels including childhood s end 1953 and space odyssey series 1968 1997 some of pohl s earlier themes also appear here including his human machine hybrid which featured in man plus 1976 thumb right frederik pohl at j lloyd eaton science fiction conference may 2008 clarke wrote over 30 science fiction novels and over 100 works of short fiction winning both hugo and nebula awards several times he moved to sri lanka then ceylon in 1956 and remained there for rest of his life one of his greatest wishes was for peace in sri lanka last theorem is set in his adopted country and pohl said that tensions between sinhalese sri lankan government and tamil liberation army tamil tigers were major inspirations for novel pohl s writing career spans 70 years and includes over 50 science fiction novels and numerous short stories he also won both hugo and nebula awards several times one of pohl s fascinations has been mathematics in particular number theory he would often spend his spare time playing with prime numbers and even tried to write a formula for generating primes but he did invent several mathematical parlour tricks some of which are featured in last theorem plot summary last theorem is set in sri lanka in early to mid 21st century and follows life of a mathematician ranjit subramanian while studying at colombo university he becomes obsessed with fermat s last theorem a conjecture made by pierre de fermat in 1637 for which he claimed to have conceived a proof that he never wrote down proof eluded mathematicians across world for over 350 years until in 1995 british mathematician andrew wiles published a 100 page proof of theorem but not everyone was satisfied with wiles s proof because it used twentieth century mathematical techniques not available in fermat s time in novel s back story extraterrestrial grand galactics are alarmed when they detect photon shock waves from nuclear bomb detonations on earth grand galactics monitor and control destinies of a number of high performance races and order one of these races nine limbeds to send cease and desist messages to earth when these messages have no effect grand galactics order another race one point fives to launch an armada to earth to exterminate undesirable species back on earth regional conflicts escalate and united nations struggles to contain them in sri lanka ranjit unwittingly boards a cruise ship that is hijacked by pirates when unknown security forces free ship ranjit is arrested on suspicion of terrorism for six months he is interrogated and tortured but he cannot supply information his captors want so he is locked up and forgotten for a further 18 months during this period of incarceration ranjit dwells on fermat s last theorem and after several months solves it with a three page proof later ranjit is rescued by a friend from university gamini bandara who will not reveal whom he is working for or where ranjit was held captive ranjit submits his proof for publication and achieves worldwide fame he marries myra de soyza an artificial intelligence specialist and embarks on a speaking tour of world in united states he is briefly recruited by cia to work on cryptography gamini later reveals that he is working for pax per fidem peace through transparency an undercover united nations organization established to bring about world peace to achieve this end pax per fidem has developed silent thunder a non lethal emp nuclear superweapon that renders all electrical equipment in its path inoperable silent thunder is deployed in north korea and later in south america and regional conflicts subside gamini invites ranjit to join pax per fidem but authoritarian nature of pax per fidem and its new world order worry ranjit and myra and ranjit turns down offer he does however accept a position on advisory board of an international consortium building a space elevator in sri lanka chosen because of its position on equator as one point five fleet enters solar system nine limbeds orbit and observe earth in cigar shaped craft sparking numerous ufo sightings a grand galactic member who happens to be passing by stops to observe effects of silent thunder and returns to grand galactic collective who immediately suspend one point fives s destruct orders pending further investigation space elevator is completed and for first time people and materials can be lifted into earth orbit without need of rockets natasha ranjit and myra s daughter competes in first solar powered space yacht race from earth to moon orbit but soon after start of race natasha s yacht malfunctions and she is abducted by nine limbeds who use a projection of her to interrogate prominent people on earth including ranjit and gamini about silent thunder satisfied that earth has reformed natasha is returned and nine limbeds broadcast a message to earth in which they announce that grand galactics have decided not to sterilize earth and that one point fives with their machine stored navigators cannot return home and will land and occupy unused areas of earth one point fives land in desolate qattara depression in libyan desert which they find quite habitable compared to their ruined homeworld americans send b 52 bombers to attack one point fives base but aliens electronically disable aircraft causing them to crash short of their target when us president demands reparations one point fives provide gold distilled from seawater by way of compensation with grand galactics absent aliens make decisions for themselves one point fives provide earth with new forms of power and machine stored reveal mind uploading technology when myra dies in a scuba diving accident her mind is uploaded into cyberspace with ranjit joining her later after 13 000 years grand galactics finally return to earth and are astounded to see how fast planet has developed they had always interfered with evolution of sentient species they had discovered believing they could not be trusted to evolve on their own impressed with earth s progress grand galactic relieve themselves of burden of watching over intelligent life and hand task over to earth characters sri lankans these characters come from three of sri lanka s ethnic groups sinhalese tamils and portuguese burghers ranjit subramanian tamil a mathematical prodigy and son of a hindu priest he achieves worldwide fame

demonic looking race whose neglect of their planet left it uninhabitable forcing them to upload themselves into memory of machines used by grand galactics as ship navigators and to backup other races reception and analysis in spite of publicity last theorem received that it was arthur c clarke s last novel and that it was written by two science fiction grand masters in general it has not been well received by critics entertainment weekly in their review said that uneven pacing and tone mar an intriguing cautionary tale this collaboration completed before clarke s death last march would ve made a better solo project for either author washington post said that last theorem reads like a dog eared album of favorite themes from yesteryear referring to clarke and pohl topics from authors earlier works thomas m wagner at sf reviews wrote that last theorem is a book i really resent not liking because there s so much about it that deserves to be liked he said that first two thirds is so good it almost but doesn t quite make up for nonsense that overtakes whole affair at climax wagner felt that meeting of two disparate storytelling sensibilities was far less harmonious and compatible than clarke and pohl may have imagined wagner summed up by saying that last theorem is not simply an uneven novel it s a deeply disjointed one a book that introduces a host of wonderful ideas and sympathetic believable characters only to decide it doesn t trust them to carry off story in end ultimately falling back disastrously on dated and dubious formula sheila merritt at scifi dimensions said that while it should have been a fine tribute and a fitting farewell to this master of science fiction it turned out to be an easy book to put down she said that plot meanders in fits and starts and that book is too long for story it tells ed park of los angeles times enjoyed first third of book but said that for rest its winning and winking self consciousness evaporates he wondered how stable manuscript was when it was published and added that it does nothing to burnish legacy of either of its authors a common criticism amongst many reviewers was that in spite of its title no connection is made between fermat s last theorem and alien invasion alex at mathematical fiction complained about errors in some of author s descriptions of mathematical problems and in particular their unfair treatment of wiles s proof of fermat s last theorem some reviewers felt that characters had not been developed sufficiently michael sims of washington post said that these characters are so thin you can see through them aliens are depicted as cartoon like figures and ranjit does not appear to be affected by his lengthy incarceration interrogation and torture some critics also felt that book ended somewhat precipitously that after aliens arrived crisis was resolved too quickly giving impression that there was at least a good long chapter missing not all reviews however were negative nader elhefnawy at strange horizons described book as an interesting experiment he said that pohl deserves credit for capturing clarke s voice and that clarke also deserves credit for doing something completely different while he would not recommend book to readers new to clarke s work elhefnawy said that fans would not regret reading book mark yon at sff world said that while this is not one of clarke s best works it is still very good he said that even though it is a collaboration book is still recognisably clarke with same humour same enthusiasm great flashes of inspiration big ideas and same curious positivism that underlines most of sir arthur s work there is a joy throughout here a joy of learning of opening up new opportunities and experiences and a love of mathematics and science michael berry at san francisco chronicle said that novel does a stellar job of conveying some of intellectual fun that can be had by manipulating math he said that sri lanka clarke s home for most of his life is brought vividly to life and that despite some minor flaws last theorem is a fitting valedictory for clarke one of science fiction s most acclaimed authors and a reminder of pohl s great relevance to a genre he has championed for more than 70 years see also fermat s last theorem in fiction space elevators in fiction notes references work cited external links category 2008
