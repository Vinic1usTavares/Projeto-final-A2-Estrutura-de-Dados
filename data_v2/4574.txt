crossed too many wetlands route 55 freeway like many other highways in new jersey once had solar powered emergency call boxes every mile about 1 6 km use of call boxes became limited due to increasing popularity of cell phones to save on maintenance costs njdot removed these call boxes in 2005 despite fact that southern extension was held up for decades it was revisited due to disturbing images of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in 2005 in gulf states route 55 could have been extended in order to provide a proper evacuation route for cape may peninsula and surrounding area in addition
