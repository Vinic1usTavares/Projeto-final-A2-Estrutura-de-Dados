a day in life is a song by english rock band beatles that was released as final track of their 1967 album sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band credited to lennon mccartney verses were mainly written by john lennon with paul mccartney primarily contributing song s middle section it is widely regarded as one of finest and most important works in popular music history lennon s lyrics were mainly inspired by contemporary newspaper articles including a report on death of guinness heir tara browne recording includes two passages of orchestral that were partly improvised in avant garde style in song s middle segment mccartney recalls his younger years which included riding bus smoking and going to class following second crescendo song ends with a sustained chord played on several keyboards that rings for over forty seconds a reputed drug reference in line i d love to turn you on resulted in song initially being banned from broadcast by bbc ending chord is one most famous in music history and inspired creation of deep note audio trademark for thx film company jeff beck barry gibb fall and phish are among artists who have covered song background john lennon wrote melody and most of lyrics to verses of a day in life in mid january 1967 soon afterwards he presented song to paul mccartney who contributed a middle eight section in a 1970 interview lennon discussed their collaboration on song according to author ian macdonald a day in life was strongly informed by lennon s lsd inspired revelations in that song concerned reality only to extent that this had been revealed by lsd to be largely in eye of beholder having long resisted lennon and george harrison s insistence that he join them and ringo starr in trying lsd mccartney took drug for first time in late 1966 this experience contributed to beatles willingness to experiment on sgt pepper and to lennon and mccartney returning to a level of collaboration that had been absent for several years lyrics tara browne music critic tim riley says that in a day in life lennon uses same lyrical device introduced in strawberry fields forever whereby free form lyrics allow a greater freedom of expression and create a supernatural calm according to lennon inspiration for first two verses was death of tara browne 21 year old heir to guinness fortune who had crashed his lotus elan on 18 december 1966 in redcliffe gardens earl s court browne had been a friend of lennon and mccartney and had instigated mccartney s first experience with lsd lennon adapted song s verse lyrics from a story in 17 january 1967 edition of daily mail which reported ruling on a custody action over browne s two young children during a writing session at mccartney s house in north london lennon and mccartney fine tuned lyrics using an approach that author howard sounes likens to cut up technique popularised by william burroughs i didn t copy accident lennon said tara didn t blow his mind out but it was in my mind when i was writing that verse details of accident in song not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at scene were similarly part of fiction mccartney expounded on subject verse about politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together it has been attributed to tara browne guinness heir which i don t believe is case certainly as we were writing it i was not attributing it to tara in my head in john s head it might have been in my head i was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who d stopped at some traffic lights and didn t notice that lights had changed blew his mind was purely a drugs reference nothing to do with a car crash 4 000 holes lennon wrote song s final verse inspired by a far near news brief in same 17 january edition of daily mail that had inspired first two verses under headline holes in our roads brief stated there are 4 000 holes in road in blackburn lancashire or one twenty sixth of a hole per person according to a council survey if blackburn is typical there are two million holes in britain s roads and 300 000 in london thumb in his lyrics lennon mentions royal albert hall a symbol of victorian era london and a concert venue usually associated with classical music performances story had been sold to daily mail in manchester by ron kennedy of star news agency in blackburn kennedy had noticed a lancashire evening telegraph story about road excavations and in a telephone call to borough engineer s department had checked annual number of holes in road lennon had a problem with words of final verse however not being able to think of how to connect now they know how many holes it takes to and albert hall his friend terry doran suggested that holes would fill albert hall and lyric was eventually used drug culture mccartney said about line i d love to turn you on which concludes both verse sections this was time of tim leary s turn on tune in drop out and we wrote i d love to turn you on john and i gave each other a knowing look uh huh it s a drug song you know that don t you george martin beatles producer commented that he had always suspected that line found my way upstairs and had a smoke was a drug reference recalling how beatles would disappear and have a little puff presumably of marijuana but not in front of him when martin was doing his tv programme on pepper mccartney recalled later he asked me do you know what caused pepper i said in one word george drugs pot and george said no no but you weren t on it all time yes we were sgt pepper was a drug album other reference points author neil sinyard attributed third verse line english army had just won war to lennon s role in film how i won war which he had filmed during september and october 1966 sinyard said it s hard to think of verse without automatically associating it with richard lester s film middle eight that mccartney provided for a day in life was a short piano piece he had been working on independently with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a dream mccartney had written piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years which included riding 82 bus to school smoking and going to class this theme beatles youth in north of england matched that of penny lane a street in liverpool and strawberry fields forever an orphanage behind lennon s house two songs written for album but were released instead as a double a side single musical structure and development basic track beatles began recording song with a working title of in life of at emi s studio two on 19 january 1967 line up as they rehearsed track was lennon on piano mccartney on hammond organ harrison on acoustic guitar and starr on congas band then taped four takes of rhythm track by which point lennon had switched to acoustic guitar and mccartney to piano with harrison now playing maracas as a link between end of second verse and start of mccartney s middle eight band included a 24 bar bridge at first beatles were not sure how to fill this link section at conclusion of session on 19 january transition consisted of a simple repeated piano chord and voice of assistant mal evans counting out bars evans voice was treated with gradually increasing amounts of echo 24 bar bridge ended with sound of an alarm clock triggered by evans although original intent was to edit out ringing alarm clock when section was filled in it complemented mccartney s piece which begins with line woke up fell out of bed so decision was made to keep sound a second transition follows mccartney s final line of middle eight i went into a dream this transition consists of vocalised aah s reinforcing dream aspect and provides link to song s final verse track was refined with remixing and additional parts added on 20 january and 3 february during latter session mccartney and starr re recorded their contributions on bass guitar and drums respectively starr later highlighted his fills on song as typical of an approach whereby i try to become an instrument play mood of song for example four thousand holes in blackburn lancashire boom ba bom i try to show that mood as on 1966 track rain music journalist ben edmonds recognises starr s playing as reflective of his empathy with lennon s songwriting in edmonds description drumming on a day in life transcends timekeeping to embody psychedelic drift mysterious surprising without losing sight of its rhythmic role orchestra thumb left song s orchestral segments reflect influence of avant garde composers such as karlheinz stockhausen left at an awards ceremony in amsterdam in october 1969 orchestral portions of a day in life reflect lennon and mccartney s interest in work of avant garde composers such as karlheinz stockhausen luciano berio and john cage to fill empty 24 bar middle section lennon s request to george martin was that orchestra should provide a tremendous build up from nothing up to something absolutely like end of world mccartney suggested having musicians improvise over segment to allay concerns that classically trained musicians would be unable to do this martin wrote a loose score for section using rhythm implied by lennon s staggered intonation on words turn you on score was an extended atonal crescendo that encouraged musicians to improvise within defined framework orchestral part was recorded on 10 february 1967 in studio one at emi studios with martin and mccartney conducting a 40 piece orchestra recording session was completed at a total cost of equivalent to ps in for players an extravagance at time martin later described explaining his score to puzzled orchestra mccartney had originally wanted a 90 piece orchestra but this proved impossible instead semi improvised segment was recorded multiple times filling a separate four track tape machine and four different recordings were overdubbed into a single massive crescendo results were successful in final edit of song orchestral bridge is reprised after final verse beatles hosted orchestral session as a 1960s style happening with guests including mick jagger marianne faithfull keith richards brian jones donovan pattie boyd michael nesmith and members of psychedelic design collective fool overseen by tony bramwell of nems enterprises event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised reflecting beatles taste for experimentation and avant garde orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire this resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick on nipples martin recalled that lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw while a bassoon player placed a balloon on end of his instrument at end of night four beatles and some of their guests overdubbed an extended humming sound to close song an idea that they later discarded according to beatles historian mark lewisohn tapes from this 10 february orchestral session reveal guests breaking into loud applause following second orchestral passage among emi staff attending event one recalled how ron richards hollies producer was stunned by music he had heard in lewisohn s description richards sat with his head in his hands saying i just can t believe it i give up martin later offered his own opinion of orchestral session part of me said we re being a bit self indulgent here other part of me said it s bloody marvellous final chord thumb alt studio two abbey road studios a grand piano in emi s studio two where closing piano chord was recorded on 22 february 1967 following final orchestral crescendo song ends with one of most famous final chords in music history overdubbed in place of vocal experiment from 10 february this chord was added during a session at emi s studio two on 22 february lennon mccartney starr and evans shared three different pianos with martin on a harmonium and all played an e major chord simultaneously chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing recording sound level as vibration faded out towards end of chord recording level was so high that listeners can hear sounds of studio including rustling papers and a squeaking chair in author jonathan gould s commentary on a day in life he describes final chord as a forty second meditation on finality that leaves each member of audience listening with a new kind of attention and awareness to sound of nothing at all also present at session was david crosby of byrds he recalled his reaction to hearing completed song man i was a dish rag i was floored it took me several minutes to be able to talk after that due to multiple takes required to perfect orchestral cacophony and final chord total time spent recording a day in life was 34 hours by contrast beatles debut album please please me had been recorded in its entirety in only 10 hours 45 minutes high pitched tone and run out groove following a day in life on sgt pepper album as first released on lp in uk and years later worldwide on cd is a high frequency 15 kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced beatles studio babble tone is same pitch as a dog whistle at upper limit of human hearing but within range that dogs and cats can hear this addition was part of beatles humour and was suggested by lennon studio babble titled in session notes edit for lp end and recorded on 21 april 1967 two months after mono and stereo masters for a day in life had been finalised was added to run out groove of initial british pressing two or three seconds of gibberish looped back into itself endlessly on any record player not equipped with an automatic phonograph arm return some listeners discerned words among vocal gibberish including lennon saying been so high followed by mccartney s response never could be any other way us copies of album lacked high pitched tone and studio babble variations on sgt pepper album start of a day in life is cross faded with applause at end of previous track sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band reprise on beatles 1967 1970 compilation lp crossfade is cut off and track begins abruptly after start of original recording but on soundtrack album imagine john lennon and cd versions of 1967 1970 song starts cleanly with no applause effects anthology 2 album released in 1996 featured a composite remix of a day in life including elements from first two takes representing song at its early pre orchestral stage while anthology 3 included a version of end that concludes by having last note fade into final chord of a day in life reversed then played forwards version on 2006 soundtrack remix album love has song starting with lennon s intro of sugar plum fairy with strings being more prominent during crescendos in 2017 a handful of outtakes from recording sessions including first take were included on two disc and six disc versions of 50th anniversary edition of sgt pepper six disc version of that edition also included on a disc of mono mixes a previously unreleased early demo mix of song in its pre orchestral stage as of 30 january bbc radio ban song became controversial for its supposed references to drugs on 20 may 1967 during bbc light programme s preview of sgt pepper album disc jockey kenny everett was prevented from playing a day in life bbc announced that it would not broadcast song due to line i d love to turn you on which according to corporation advocated drug use other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include found my way upstairs and had a smoke somebody spoke and i went into a dream a spokesman for bbc stated we have listened to this song over and over again and we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug taking at time lennon and mccartney denied that there were drug references in a day in life and publicly complained about ban at a dinner party at home of their manager brian epstein celebrating their album s release lennon said that song was simply about a crash and its victim and called line in question most innocent of phrases mccartney later said this was only one in album written as a deliberate provocation a stick that in your pipe but what we want is to turn you on to truth rather than pot paul mccartney s guide to beatles songbook los angeles times 14 january 1968 b19 beatles nevertheless aligned themselves with drug culture in britain by paying for at mccartney s instigation a full page advertisement in times in which along with 60 other signatories they and epstein denounced law against marijuana as immoral in principle and unworkable in practice in addition on 19 june mccartney confirmed to an itn reporter further to his statement in a recent life magazine interview that he had taken lsd described by macdonald as a careless admission it led to condemnation of mccartney in british press recalling outcry caused by publication of lennon s more popular than jesus remark in us in 1966 bbc ban on song was eventually lifted on 13 march 1972 recognition and reception recalling release of sgt pepper in his 1977 book beatles forever nicholas schaffner wrote that nothing quite like a day in life had been attempted before in so called popular music in terms of song s use of dynamics and tricks of rhythm and of space and stereo effect and its deft intermingling of scenes from dream reality and shades in between schaffner said that in context of 1967 track was so visually evocative it seemed more like a film than a mere song except that pictures were all in our heads richard goldstein of new york times called song a deadly earnest excursion in emotive music with a chilling lyric that stands as one of most important lennon mccartney compositions and an historic pop event in his praise for track he drew comparisons between its lyrics and work of t s eliot and likened its music to wagner in a contemporary music critics poll published by jazz pop magazine a day in life won in categories of best pop song and best pop arrangement in his appraisal of song musicologist walter everett states that as on band s revolver album most monumental piece on sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band was lennon s he identifies track s most striking feature as its mysterious and poetic approach to serious topics that come together in a larger direct message to its listeners an embodiment of central ideal for which beatles stood that a truly meaningful life can be had only when one is aware of one s self and one s surroundings and overcomes status quo beatles biographer philip norman describes a day in life as a masterpiece and cites it as an example of how sgt pepper certainly was john s freak out referring to 1966 album by mothers of invention as closing track on sgt pepper song was object of intense scrutiny and commentary in ian macdonald s description it has been interpreted as a sober return to real world after drunken fantasy of pepperland as a conceptual statement about structure of pop album or artifice of studio or falsity of recorded performance as an evocation of a bad lsd trip as a pop waste land even as a morbid celebration of death a day in life became one of beatles most influential songs and is now considered by many to be band s greatest work paul in his book rockin down highway cars and people that made rock roll called track one of most ambitious influential and groundbreaking works in pop music history according to musicologist john covach a day in life is perhaps one of most important single tracks in history of rock music clocking in at only four minutes and forty five seconds it must surely be among shortest epic pieces in rock in his review of 50th anniversary edition of sgt pepper for rolling stone mikal gilmore says that a day in life and harrison s within you without you are only songs on album that transcend its legacy as a gestalt a whole that was greater than sum of its parts james a moorer has said that both a day in life and a fugue in b minor by bach were his sources of inspiration for deep note audio trademark he created for thx film company song s
