francis birch august 22 1903 january 30 1992 was an american geophysicist he is considered one of founders of solid earth geophysics he is also known for his part in atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki during world war ii birch participated in manhattan project working on design and development of gun type nuclear weapon known as little boy he oversaw its manufacture and went to tinian to supervise its assembly and loading into enola gay boeing b 29 superfortress tasked with dropping bomb a graduate of harvard university birch began working on geophysics as a research assistant he subsequently spent his entire career at harvard working in field becoming an associate professor of geology in 1943 a professor in 1946 and sturgis hooper professor of geology in 1949 and professor emeritus in 1974 birch published over 100 papers he developed what is now known as birch murnaghan equation of state in 1947 in 1952 he demonstrated that earth s mantle is chiefly composed of silicate minerals with an inner and outer core of molten iron in two 1961 papers on compressional wave velocities he established what is now called birch s law early life albert francis birch was born in washington d c on august 22 1903 son of george albert birch who was involved in banking and real estate and mary birch a church choir singer and soloist at st matthew s cathedral in washington d c he had three younger brothers david who became a banker john who became a diplomat and robert who became a songwriter he was educated at washington d c schools and western high school where he joined high school cadets in 1916 in 1920 birch entered harvard university on a scholarship while there he served in harvard s reserve officers training corps field artillery battalion he graduated magna cum laude in 1924 and received his bachelor of science s b degree in electrical engineering birch went to work in engineering department of new york telephone company he applied for and received an american field service fellowship in 1926 which he used to travel to strasbourg and study at university of strasbourg s institut de physique under tutelage of pierre weiss there he wrote or co wrote four papers in french on topics such as paramagnetic properties of potassium cyanide and magnetic moment of cu ions on returning to united states in 1928 birch went back to harvard to pursue physics he was awarded his master of arts a m degree in 1929 and then commenced work on his 1932 doctor of philosophy ph d degree under supervision of percy bridgman who would receive nobel prize for physics in 1946 for his thesis birch measured vapor liquid critical point of mercury he determined this as 1460 20 degc and 1640 50 kg cm2 results he published in 1932 in physical review around this time there was an increased interest in geophysics at harvard university and reginald aldworth daly established a committee for experimental geology and geophysics that included bridgman astronomer harlow shapley geologists louis and d h mclaughlin and chemist g p baxter william another one of bridgman s ph d students was hired as committee s research associate but having little interest in study of rocks he resigned in 1932 position was then offered to birch who had little interest or experience in geology either but with advent of great depression jobs were hard to find and he accepted on july 15 1933 birch married barbara channing a bryn mawr college alumna and a collateral descendant of theologian william ellery channing they had three children anne francis frank sylvanus and mary narcissa frank later became a professor of geophysics at university of new hampshire world war ii thumb right birch left works on little boy bomb while norman f ramsey right looks on in 1942 during world war ii birch took a leave of absence from harvard in order to work at massachusetts institute of technology radiation laboratory which was developing radar he worked on proximity fuze a radar triggered fuze that would explode a shell in proximity of a target following year he accepted a commission in united states navy as a lieutenant commander and was posted to bureau of ships in washington d c later that year he was assigned to manhattan project and moved with his family to los alamos new mexico there he joined los alamos laboratory s ordnance o division which was under command of another naval officer captain william s parsons initially goal of o division was to design a gun type nuclear weapon known as thin man this proved to be impractical due to contamination of reactor bred plutonium with plutonium 240 and in february 1944 division switched its attention to development of little boy a smaller device using uranium 235 birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full scale mock ups of device birch supervised manufacture of little boy and went to tinian to supervise its assembly and loading it onto enola gay boeing b 29 superfortress tasked with dropping bomb he devised double plug system that allowed for actually arming bomb after enola gay took off so that if it crashed there would not be a nuclear explosion he was awarded legion of merit his citation read post war birch returned to harvard after war ended having been promoted to associate professor of geology in 1943 while he was away he would remain at harvard for rest of his career becoming a professor in 1946 and sturgis hooper professor of geology in 1949 and professor emeritus in 1974 professor birch published over 100 papers he served as president of geological society of america in 1964 and was awarded their penrose medal in 1969 edwin 1982 gsa memoir 155 geological society of america life history of a learned society boulder colorado geological society of america memoir 155 168 p in 1947 he adapted isothermal murnaghan equation of state which had been developed for infinitesimal strain for finite strain developing what is now known as birch murnaghan equation of state albert francis birch is known for his experimental work on properties of earth forming minerals at high pressure and temperature in 1952 he published a well known paper in journal of geophysical research where he demonstrated that mantle is chiefly composed of silicate minerals upper and lower mantle are separated by a thin transition zone associated with silicate phase transitions and inner and outer core are alloys of crystalline and molten iron his conclusions are still accepted as correct today most famous portion of paper however is a humorous footnote he included in introduction unwary readers should take warning that ordinary language undergoes modification to a high pressure form when applied to interior of earth a few examples of equivalents follow high pressure form ordinary meaning certain dubious undoubtedly perhaps positive proof vague suggestion unanswerable argument trivial objection pure iron uncertain mixture of all elements in 1961 birch published two papers on compressional wave velocities establishing a linear relation of compressional wave velocity vp of rocks and minerals of a constant average atomic weight with density as this relationship became known as birch s law birch was elected to national academy of sciences in 1950 and served as president of geological society of america in 1963 and 1964 he received numerous honors in his career including geological society of america s arthur l day medal on 1950 and penrose medal in 1969 american geophysical union s william bowie medal in 1960 national medal of science from president lyndon johnson in 1967 prize shared with sir edward bullard in 1968 gold medal of royal astronomical society in 1973 and international association for advancement of high pressure research s bridgman medal in 1983 since 1992 american geophysical union s section has sponsored a francis birch lecture given at its annual meeting by a noted researcher in this field birch died of prostate cancer at his home in cambridge massachusetts on january 30 1992 he was survived by wife barbara his three children and his three brothers his papers are in harvard university archives notes
