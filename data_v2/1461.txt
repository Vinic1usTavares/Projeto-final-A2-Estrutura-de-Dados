celebrities and sport figures such as former mexican footballer jared borgetti and boxing champion omar chavez party also hosted a number of musical groups including banda la el mariachi de los cabos and former leading vocalist of banda el recodo at around 8 00 p m that day a black colored suv entered private property and parked near entrance of ballroom in front seats of car according to eye witness reports were two men in back seat was a man dressed as a clown who descended from vehicle and headed towards door that led to kitchen once inside ballroom clown identified francisco rafael at center of room and began to walk towards him when clown was about 1 m 3 3 ft close he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to ground killing him on scene as former drug lord lay dead near entrance assassin ran through a rear exit while attendees yelled fell to ground and hid under tables four more shots were heard outside ballroom shortly after attack according to eyewitnesses clown had done this to scare off one of francisco rafael s sons who was chasing him suspect then fled crime scene in black colored suv and headed towards highway first to arrive at crime scene were municipal authorities of los cabos followed by mexican armed forces and federal and state police forces upon arrival of authorities francisco rafael s wife in between tears informed them of former drug lord s identity autopsy revealed that francisco rafael died of severe traumatic brain injury from shots in thorax and head with a fn five seven pistol murder of francisco rafael initially fell under state jurisdiction because he was not wanted by federal government when he was killed therefore murder investigation was started by baja california sur authorities and not by office of general prosecutor pgr however pgr joined case after it was requested by state authorities funeral on 19 october 2013 baja california sur state police escorted corpse of francisco rafael and his family members to port of body was then shipped by boat to his home state of sinaloa it was initially reported by media that his corpse was to be cremated in mazatlan however his remains were taken to city of los mochis in municipality of ahome for cremation on 20 october 2013 aftermath and investigation roughly twenty four hours after death of francisco rafael mexican federal police arrested manuel aguirre galindo alias el caballo horse a founder of tijuana cartel and a high ranking leader and money launderer who had been a fugitive for more than 20 years in mexico city it is unknown who notified authorities of his whereabouts but they allege that they were either notified by a rival gang or by members of arellano felix clan among hypotheses presented by zeta a tijuana based magazine known for its investigative reports on tijuana cartel are as followed 1 shortly after murder of francisco rafael police interrogated his family and several of party invitees who may have information that led to aguirre galindo s arrest given that drug lord was allegedly responsible for providing security to francisco rafael 2 other hypothesis is that aguirre galindo s location was tipped by members of tijuana cartel who were mad at him for failing to protect francisco rafael right 140px thumb screenshot from a video depicting alleged assassin seconds prior to murder motives behind murder case are officially unknown but mexican authorities believe that given circumstances and players involved suspected source of fire was organized crime and that motives possibly stemmed from unpaid old debts and old authorities are working with two separate lines of investigation 1 first line alleges that francisco rafael was killed by members of beltran leyva cartel a drug trafficking organization that fights for control of smuggling routes in baja california peninsula against sinaloa cartel 2 second line alleges that francisco rafael was killed by members of sinaloa cartel specifically on orders of el chapo guzman cartel s leader el chapo was nearly captured by mexican federal police in los cabos in march 2012 after an anonymous call informed dea that drug lord was possibility hiding in three properties investigators allege that francisco rafael although he was no longer involved in organized crime might have tipped authorities to his whereabouts and incurred el chapo s wrath they also believe that attack might have been carried out by a local drug dealing group in los cabos main suspect of this allegation is a man named javier lopez rivera or javier acosta lopez alias el javier and or el javi supposed leader of this crime cell in this line of investigation authorities believe that drug dealer sent two of his men to pick up assassin who had arrived from sinaloa at los cabos international airport two of three men involved in murder case they allege go by aliases cain and el according to mexican authorities murder plot was possibly carried out with collaboration of tijuana cartel because no security measures were taken during party and because entrances were open to public when they are usually closed for private events investigation was further complicated by fact that many of invitees fearing for their lives fled from scene when francisco rafael was killed by clown out of 80 to 100 attendees only 20 of them stayed many of them family members and employees of banquet hall when authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized assassin or any other physical features none of them were able to give any details some stated that they did not even pay attention to clown when he entered crime scene while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what clown was wearing remembering only that assassin was wearing a blue stripped or purple shirt a multicolored wig and a red clown nose on 7 november 2013 a person who was at murder scene uploaded a 1 04 minute video on youtube showing scene before francisco rafael was killed video starts with former vocalist of banda el recodo singing el senor de las canas a song by vicente fernandez alongside a mariachi group as film progresses camera turns to sides and shows former footballer jared borgetti sitting at a table with rocio del carmen lizarraga wife of francisco rafael towards last seconds of video a bald looking man passes through back of tables in front of camera and apparently gives a hand signal to assassin before walking away then a man dressed as a clown presumed assassin passes through crowd and heads towards francisco rafael seconds later one shot was heard most of invitees were not aware of what had happened and music continued shortly afterwards four more shots were heard from rear following second round of shots music stopped and invitees started screaming video only captured a few seconds after last four shots before concluding baja california sur authorities believe that bald looking man that appeared on video shortly before clown and apparently gave him a hand signal is involved in murder plot eyewitnesses who sat at a table with suspect stated that they did not know who he was but that they saw him greet francisco rafael during party suspect reportedly made three phone calls during party and sent several text messages investigators believe that man was possibly communicating with assassin authorities are investigating text messages and phone calls made that day in area through database with surface of video authorities were able to also gather more information about assassin and murder they were able to identify other invitees including former cruz azul footballer hector lopez video allowed authorities to identify physical characteristics of assassin including his skin color approximate height and color of his clothing authorities are investigating whether any purchases made in custom or fabric stores in area might lead them to murderers in january 2014 pgr stated that alleged mastermind of murder was possibly jose rodrigo arechiga gamboa alias el chino antrax leader of los antrax an armed squadron of sinaloa cartel agency revealed through several photographs that francisco rafael and arechiga gamboa met at fight promotion event of boxers omar chavez and joachim in los cabos two days prior to murder pgr hypothesized that murder was possibly stemmed from francisco rafael s involvement in money laundering activities and as a message from los antrax to show that they were in charge of organized crime in los cabos they also believe that ismael el mayo a top leader of sinaloa cartel might have ordered attack state authorities identified two other possible murderers noe castro alias r1 arechiga gamboa s right hand man in los cabos and a man known by his alias they also conducted studies to conclude if arechiga gamboa fit physical descriptions of man featured in video see also mexican drug war sources footnotes
