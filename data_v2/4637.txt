leona harriet woods august 9 1919 november 10 1986 later known as leona woods marshall and leona woods marshall libby was an american physicist who helped build first nuclear reactor and first atomic bomb at age 23 she was youngest and only female member of team which built and experimented with world s first nuclear reactor then called a pile chicago pile 1 in a project led by her mentor enrico fermi in particular woods was instrumental in construction and then utilization of geiger counters for analysis during experimentation she was only woman present when reactor went critical she worked with fermi on manhattan project and together with her first husband john marshall she subsequently helped solve problem of xenon poisoning at hanford plutonium production site and supervised construction and operation of hanford s plutonium production reactors after war she became a fellow at fermi s institute for nuclear studies she later worked at institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey brookhaven national laboratory and new york university where she became a professor in 1962 her research involved high energy physics astrophysics and cosmology in 1966 she divorced marshall and married nobel laureate willard libby she became a professor at university of colorado and a staff member at rand corporation in later life she became interested in ecological and environmental issues and she devised a method of using isotope ratios in tree rings to study climate change she was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing harmful bacteria early life leona harriet woods was born on a farm in la grange illinois on august 9 1919 second of five children of arno woods a lawyer and his wife mary leona holderness woods she had two sisters and two brothers she graduated from lyons township high school in la grange at 14 and received her bs in chemistry from university of chicago in 1938 at age of 18 after passing her qualifying exams in chemistry she approached nobel prize for physics laureate james franck about being his graduate student having been impressed by a talk he gave in 1939 on brillouin zones franck accepted but told her that when he was young his professor had warned him that as a jewish academic he would starve to death franck therefore warned woods that you are a woman and you will starve to death despite fact that franck did not look malnourished she took warning seriously and decided to instead become a graduate student of robert mulliken who would one day become a nobel laureate himself mulliken allowed her to choose her own research problem and edited final version before it appeared in physical review her doctoral thesis on silicon oxide bands prepared under supervision of mulliken and polish chemist stanislaw was accepted in 1943 mulliken she later recalled had twice told her that perhaps not all he taught me was wasted his students she noted agree that this is his highest praise manhattan project by 1942 when she was finishing writing up her thesis she was youngest and last of mulliken s pre war students and was working alone because all her fellow students had become involved with war work she met herbert anderson who was working for enrico fermi two would go swimming together in lake michigan every afternoon at 5 pm anderson discovered that woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research and as soon as her phd was finished he hired her to work with boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux fermi s group constructed a nuclear reactor known as chicago pile 1 under stands of stagg field university s abandoned football stadium where woods had once played squash walter zinn did not want a woman involved in dirty work of placing graphite blocks but woods had plenty of work to do with detectors and thermocouples and used a small stack of graphite of her own to measure effects of a radium beryllium source on manganese foil to obtain a measure of neutron cross section in order to calibrate detectors woods was only woman present when reactor went critical asking fermi when do we become scared left thumb 360px in this 1946 photo of chicago pile team woods is only woman fourth from left in middle row laura fermi remembered woods as a tall young girl built like an athlete who could do a man s job and do it well she was only woman physicist in enrico s group at that time her mother who was also endowed with inexhaustible energy was running a small farm near chicago almost by herself to relieve mrs woods of some work leona divided her time between atoms and potatoes like many scientists working on project woods affected a casual attitude towards danger posed by radiation after a morning with willard libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal woods absorbed about 200 and her white blood cell count halved doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells a proposition that woods was skeptical of she considered that important thing was that solder was done correctly when team moved to their new home at argonne woods had a dormitory all to herself woods married john marshall in july 1943 soon after she fell pregnant while she told enrico fermi they agreed not to let walter zinn know for fear that he would insist that she leave reactor building she covered up her pregnant belly with her baggy denim work clothes she rode to work each day on an unheated army bus arriving each morning barely in time to vomit before starting day s work child a boy called peter was born in 1944 she returned to work a few days later a team from argonne was on hand for powering up first reactor at hanford site where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs they watched reactor in shifts with john marshall and others on day shift enrico fermi and leona marshall on night shift ending at midnight and don hughes and john wheeler on swing shift while marshalls were babysitting reactor in hanford they left peter with leona s mother reactor was powered up successfully but after a few hours power level dropped and reactor shut down leona speculated that a water leak was problem rather than a radioactive poison however during night operators were able to power reactor up again only to have it once more die away timings now pointed to a radioactive poison after working through numbers with slide rules and hand calculators they determined neutron cross section of poison which turned out to be xenon 135 fortunately dupont engineers had equipped reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes than physicists had called for and by loading them up they managed to get reactor started asked many years later about how she felt about her involvement in manhattan project she said post war career after war leona marshall returned to university of chicago where she became a fellow at fermi s institute for nuclear studies working with chicago pile 3 heavy water reactor she found a way to 100 percent spin polarize neutron beams and determined refractive index of neutrons for various materials her second child john marshall iii was born in 1949 she became an assistant professor in 1953 after fermi died in 1954 marshalls separated john marshall returned to los alamos laboratory while leona now effectively a single mother became a fellow at institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey in 1957 following year she became a fellow at brookhaven national laboratory at a time when focus of research in physics was shifting away from nucleus and towards elementary particles in 1960 she joined new york university as an associate professor of physics she became a professor in 1962 three years later she became a professor at university of colorado researching high energy physics astrophysics and cosmology she then became a staff member at rand corporation where she worked until 1976 in 1966 she divorced john marshall and married willard libby who had won nobel prize in 1960 she later joined him at ucla where she became a visiting professor of environmental studies engineering engineering archaeology mechanical aerospace and nuclear engineering in 1973 now known as leona marshall libby she became interested in ecological and environmental issues and she devised a method of using isotope ratios of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 carbon 13 to carbon 12 and deuterium to hydrogen in tree rings to study changes in temperature and rainfall patterns hundreds of years before records were kept opening door to study of climate change like willard libby she was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing off harmful bacteria and advocated that legal and regulatory restrictions on its use be relaxed she proposed that instead of it being sprayed with malathion fruit affected by mediterranean fruit fly could be treated with gamma rays she was a prolific author publishing over 200 scientific papers while at rand she wrote a paper on creation of an atmosphere for moon 1969 her works include autobiographical uranium people 1979 a history of early atomic research after libby died in 1980 she edited his papers with rainer berger and published life work of nobel laureate willard libby 1982 her last paper on quasi stellar objects appeared in 1984 she died at st john s medical center in santa monica california on november 10 1986 from an anesthesia induced stroke she was survived by her sons peter and john and four grandchildren she also had two stepdaughters janet eva libby and susan charlotte libby from her
