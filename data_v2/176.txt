river welland is a lowland river in east of england some long it drains part of midlands eastwards to wash river rises in hothorpe hills at sibbertoft in northamptonshire then flows generally northeast to market harborough stamford and spalding to reach wash near fosdyke it is a major waterway across part of fens called south holland and is one of fenland rivers which were laid out with washlands there are two channels between widely spaced embankments with intention that flood waters would have space in which to spread while tide in estuary prevented free egress however after floods of 1947 new works such as coronation channel were constructed to control flooding in spalding and washes are no longer used solely as pasture but may be used for arable farming significant improvements were made to river in 1660s when a new cut with 10 locks was constructed between stamford and market deeping and two locks were built on river section below market deeping canal section was known as stamford canal and was longest canal with locks in britain when it was built river provided final outlet to sea for land drainage schemes implemented in seventeenth century although they were not completely successful until a steam powered pumping station was built at pode hole in 1827 navigation on upper river including stamford canal had ceased by 1863 but spalding remained an active port until end of second world war environment agency is navigation authority for river which is navigable as far upstream as crowland and with very shallow draught to west deeping bridge where further progress is hindered by derelict lock around weir traditional head of navigation was wharf road in stamford management of lower river has been intimately tied up with drainage of deeping fen and river remains important to welland and deepings internal drainage board for whom it provides final conduit to sea for pumped water wildlife in river varies along its length faster headwaters being a habitat for trout and slower lower reaches for perch estuary conditions and flat landscapes beyond fosdyke favour wading birds and migratory species geography river welland with its tributaries form a river system with a catchment area of within this area of waterway are designated as main river and are therefore managed for flood control by environment agency under river welland catchment flood management plan of this total below spalding are tidal and have sea walls to protect adjacent land from flooding while are fresh water but run through low lying land and are therefore embanked within catchment area are below sea level and would be flooded without such defences basin runs in a broadly south west to north east direction with an extension to north around west glen and east glen rivers underlying geology consists of lias clays at western end of catchment with lincolnshire limestone in centre including valleys of glen eastern third is mostly alluvial soils and it is this part that relies on artificial pumping to prevent flooding rainfall over area varies between per year which is quite light and because land is efficiently drained during winter months there are few reserves making area prone to drought in summer months for much of its length welland forms county boundary between northamptonshire and leicestershire or rutland and lower down between lincolnshire and cambridgeshire course welland rises in hothorpe hills in parish of sibbertoft northamptonshire and it issues at spring croft church street sibbertoft sits astride one of principal watersheds in england within small stream forms border between northamptonshire and leicestershire it flows westwards before looping round passing through grounds of hothorpe hall in now a conference centre to flow generally eastwards through lubenham to market harborough ordnance survey 1 25000 map one of driveways to thorpe lubenham hall is carried over river by an early nineteenth century ashlar bridge which is a grade ii listed structure to east of lubenham river passes old lubenham hall part of an h plan house built in late sixteenth century and modified in early eighteenth century king charles i is believed to have stayed there before battle of naseby three arms of a square moat surround house and site is a scheduled ancient monument market harborough to stamford county border leaves river on west side of market harborough as town is wholly in leicestershire and picks it up again on east side river jordan joins welland in centre of market harborough flowing northwards to railway station langton brook and brook join from west near welham county border meanders from side to side across relatively straight sections of river suggesting that channel has been engineered a three arched bridge built in 1881 of fine ashlar masonry with a causeway to south carries welham to weston by welland road over river while a four arched bridge dating from early nineteenth century carries ashley to medbourne road macmillan way a long distance footpath crosses on its way from abbotsbury in dorset to boston lincolnshire medbourne brook joins from north after which river approaches a dismantled railway and is joined by stoke albany brook approaching from south river remains on south side of railway while county border follows a meandering course to north of it but rejoins river near bringhurst to cottingham road bridge over river is plain but to north of it is an eighteenth century causeway some long which is made of stone and pierced by seven large arches and numerous smaller arches for drainage pipes causeway has two large semi circular passing places on its western side welland passes to north of corby near rockingham and then to south of caldecott where it becomes county border between northamptonshire and rutland and eye brook which has been dammed to form reservoir joins from north as it flows past river forms two channels with county border following smaller northern channel it is crossed by welland viaduct with its 82 brick arches which was completed in 1879 and carries oakham to kettering line over valley apart from viaducts carrying suburban lines into london it is longest railway viaduct to be built in britain uppingham brook flows eastwards from uppingham to join on north bank and jurassic way long distance footpath crosses river at turtle bridge this probably dates from fourteenth century although it was widened in 1793 and a parapet has been added subsequently on road from to wakerley there is a medieval bridge with five pointed arches which was widened in eighteenth century gretton brook flows from south to join river near duddington where there is a well known mill building of earliest known date 1664 a limestone ashlar bridge with four arches crosses river dating from fifteenth century but widened in 1919 after river passes under a railway bridge at its flow is swelled by river chater county border again leaves river to west of stamford while below town river forms border between lincolnshire and cambridgeshire stamford to spalding just before stamford great north road now labelled a1 crosses river and a pumping station on north bank at stamford meadows has pumped large quantities of water to rutland water reservoir since its construction in 1975 stamford was lowest point at which river could be forded so roman ermine street crossed welland there a16 road crosses river by a three arched stone bridge designed by edward browning in 1845 below it albert bridge is made of iron with stone piers and was erected by stamford town council in july 1881 to replace an earlier bridge which was washed away in a flood beyond stamford river passes site and ruins of benedictine st leonard s priory hudd s mill marks point at which stamford canal left river present mill building dates from 1751 and 1771 river which canal crossed on level joins from north and remains of canal follow river on its north bank below uffington county border follows old course of river first to south to tallington and then to north while main course now flows along maxey cut to old course consists of two streams fed by sluices from maxey cut which meander to deepings eastern stream supplied power to lolham and maxey mills while western stream did same for tallington mill which dates from around 1700 west deeping mill and s mill which still retains its seventeenth century undershot waterwheel modified in 19th century to poncelet s improved design and only surviving waterwheel of its type in lincolnshire at western edge of market deeping two streams join and they are also joined by greatford cut which has carried diverted waters of west glen river since early 1950s this section is crossed by king street which follows course of a roman road where it crosses maxey cut to south of original channels there are a series of 14 arches which comprise lolham bridges they are grouped into five structures to cross channels in area and were funded by county of northamptonshire in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries longest span is and cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording county s involvement to north an early nineteenth century stone rubble arched bridge carries road over a drainage ditch near lolham mill while an eighteenth century bridge probably rebuilt in following century crosses mill stream another pair of early nineteenth century bridges built of coursed limestone with ashlar dressings carry road over northernmost channel bridge at deeping gate carries date 1651 and is a grade ii listed stone structure with three round arches after remains of deeping high lock and deeping low lock there is a junction where old course maxey cut south drain and folly river also a drain meet river is officially navigable below this point through crowland and cowbit to edge of spalding river is laid out with washlands which were historically used as pasture because river was allowed to flood land when tidal levels prevented water discharging into sea river is bounded on north and west by a bank while new river a drainage channel to south and east of it is bounded by another bank land between channels forms crowland high wash crowland fodder lots and cowbit wash southern bank is variously named corporation bank wash bank and barrier bank these wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis although building of coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete spalding to wash thumb left coronation channel and marsh road sluice spalding thumb left last bridge over welland which carries a17 before it goes out into wash at fosdyke passing through spalding where most of flow is diverted through coronation channel town is protected by marsh road sluice and a sea lock to east below town it is approached by vernatt s drain which runs parallel to river carrying water pumped from deeping fen and is crossed by a16 road bridge nearby is pinchbeck marsh pumping station which houses last beam engine and scoop wheel to be used in fens for land drainage it was built in 1833 and ran until 1952 when it was replaced by electric pumps it now forms part of a museum of land drainage run by welland and deepings internal drainage board in partnership with south holland district council vernatt s drain passes through a sluice to join river while sluice that protects entrance to river glen is navigable to allow boats to reach tongue end some upstream from its mouth there are pumping stations for sea dike and lords drain and outfalls of eau and five towns drainage channels before final bridge at fosdyke is reached after it is joined by holbeach river it is bordered by salt marshes and finally flows into wash at cots in fosdyke wash beyond river banks much of fertile arable land is composed of marine silt which suits bulb growing for which spalding is famous commercial growing of bulbs was pioneered in 1880s with first large scale tulip fields introduced by sam in 1907 at its peak in 1939 there were of bulb fields and 3000 tons of flowers were exported through spalding railway station tulips were grown on around in 1965 but this had reduced to less than by 1999 points on course history thumb welland in spate at duddington showing its capacity for flooding adjoining meadows origin of name for river is unknown but appears to be pre english in old english form was weolud and may have changed to middle english form due to folk etymology or scandinavian influence welland weolud is first mentioned in anglo saxon chronicle for 921 ad richard de who was lord of deeping fen during reign of william conqueror erected a strong embankment to prevent flooding of meadows adjoining river which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden during reign of henry iii 1207 1272 complaints were made that of two channels below crowland one to spalding was more favourable to passage of barges but abbot of crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees in fourteenth century spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair river causing damage to king s liege people but argued that because it was tidal at this point it was an arm of sea and so they were not responsible river was one of earlier rivers to be granted an act of parliament for improvements to allow navigation to stamford act was granted in reign of elizabeth i in 1571 and detailed how stamford had prospered as a result of river but also stated that mills built between stamford and deeping had resulted in it no longer being navigable as they had diverted water powers were granted to restore river using either old channel or new one although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this there is no evidence that any work was carried out under terms of act thumb left remains of low locks at deeping st james powers were revived in 1620 when stamford corporation was given permission by commission of sewers to build a new artificial cut which would run from eastern edge of stamford near hudd s mill to market deeping where it would rejoin river decision was ratified in 1623 by a grant of james i and corporation expected to have work completed by 1627 however they were unable to find a suitable contractor to carry out work and failed to reach agreement on terms with david cecil in 1636 and two other potential contractors after that finally in 1664 an alderman from stamford called daniel wigmore took job he built cut and 12 locks which included high lock and low lock on river at deeping st james at a cost of ps5 000 in return for his expenditure he was given lease of tolls for next 80 years for which he paid a rent of one shilling five pence cut known as stamford canal is one of earliest post roman canals in england it opened in 1670 around 100 years before start of industrial revolution which brought about golden age for canals in britain when built it was longest canal with locks in britain and was very busy with barges carrying flour malt coal timber and limestone people of market deeping deeping gate and deeping st james together with other villages along river presented a petition to elizabeth i requesting that fens should be drained as banks of river and of neighbouring glen were in a poor state of repair they suggested that thomas lovell should undertake work which he did at a cost of ps12 000 for which he received of land which was reclaimed as a result of work unrest in early 1600s resulted in most of works being destroyed but in 1632 a group of adventurers led by earl of bedford were granted permission to drain deeping fen south fen and crowland work included making welland deeper and wider from deeping st james to its outfall beyond spalding and construction of side drains these included a drain running from pode hole to below spalding which is still known as vernatt s drain after one of adventurers called sir philibert vernatti although declared completed in 1637 efficient drainage would have to wait until construction of pode hole pumping station in 1827 at crowland river used to split into two channels one broadly following present course of river and other joining old south ea to reach river nene near wisbech dugdale writing in 1662 described spalding channel as a most slow course river no longer flows through crowland but unique triangular trinity bridge which spanned junction remains in centre of town spalding had been a port from before any of river improvements were made townspeople had refused to repair river during reign of henry iii as they claimed it was part of sea here its importance as a port increased with river improvements and stamford canal and although it did not have a customs house by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at quays and warehouses exports included oats rape oil hides and wool with a much greater variety of imports including stone timber coal groceries glass and beeswax more exotic imports included french and spanish wines and some of first imports of tea coffee and chocolate deeping fen drainage of deeping fen was again addressed in 1664 when deeping fen act awarded earl of manchester and others of land in return for drainage works they were also obliged to maintain banks of river to ensure that both welland and glen were kept clean and free flowing and to ensure that no tolls were charged for navigation on any part of river below east deeping inadequacy of outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task they tried renting out land they had been granted but many tenants were unable to pay rent due to poor state of drainage which reduced crop yields in april 1729 deeping fen adventurers received a letter from captain john perry expressing opinion that only way to improve drainage was to improve river outfalls and proposing construction of scouring sluices on river at spalding on vernatt s drain at its outfall and on river glen at surfleet perry was an engineer of some repute who had set standard for engineering reports in 1727 when he published his recommendations for north level of fens his plans were approved and adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly in payment for work he sold one third of land to finance project and began work in 1730 cowbit sluice on welland had six wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel at high tide water was penned in cowbit wash between banks which were set well back from main channel bed of river below sluice was loosened by dragging wooden rollers with iron spikes over it at low tide sluice gates were opened and flow scoured out silt for some downstream a navigation lock was constructed beside sluice so that vessels could still gain access to river above perry died in february 1733 and was buried in spalding churchyard lock lasted until it was removed by welland commissioners in 1813 perry was succeeded by john grundy sr who published a paper in 1734 on flow in open drains he calculated theoretic flow rates and then used observation in field to modify results he oversaw a programme of repairs to deeping bank which ran for along north and west side of river while john scribo was employed to do same for country bank which ran for on south and east grundy made river deeper above spalding and also constructed a sluice and reservoir at mouth of glen reservoir covered and provided water to scour channel below sluice his son john grundy jr took over after death of his father in 1748 and spent nearly ps10 000 on bank repairs between then and 1764 he rebuilt perry s sluice soon after 1750 with taller doors and a set of tide gates to prevent tide moving upstream and rebuilt navigation lock in 1754 after 1764 thomas hogard became surveyor of works but grundy continued to act as a consultant engineer hogard devised a scheme to cut a new channel from junction of welland and glen to wyberton on estuary of river witham below boston at end of cut there would be a huge sluice and a navigation lock adventurers asked thomas tofield for a second opinion who suggested a shorter cut from spalding to fosdyke they requested help from grundy who proposed a cut to fosdyke and that outfall of vernatt s drain should be moved downstream improvements to drain were carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1774 and an act was obtained in 1794 to sanction wyberton cut although work was not carried out and grundy s cut was built under a new act of 1801 several prominent civil engineer considered problems of deeping fen and river outfall at end of 1700s two reports were produced one by george maxwell and second by edward hare who had been assisted by william jessop and john rennie they formed basis for deeping fen act of 1801 channel above spalding was made deeper north bank was made stronger and north and south drove drains were enlarged through fen one of rennie s recommendations had been to replace windmills which drove drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at pode hole but this was not implemented after reports by rennie and thomas pear in 1815 and by rennie alone in 1818 and 1820 provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823 trustees appointed by 1801 act continued to manage deeping fen until they were replaced in 1939 by deeping fen spalding and pinchbeck internal drainage board subsequently renamed welland deepings internal drainage board outfall plans to re route outfall along a new channel which would meet river witham at scalp near boston were authorised in 1794 but money could not be raised at time due to financial crisis caused by french wars grundy s shorter channel had been finished by 1810 improving both drainage and navigation james walker reported in 1835 on further improvements making recommendation that river below spalding should be constrained between high banks so that scouring action of water would dredge its own channel rather than excavating which he estimated would cost ps70 000 he suggested using fascines made of thorn branches around which silt would be deposited such a scheme would only cost ps13 000 and work went on for many years effects of embankments had resulted in bed of river below fosdyke being around lower by 1845 in 1867 river welland outfall act enabled trustees to raise money to repair walls where tide had washed away some of fill behind fascines a dredger was employed between 1889 and 1890 which had been invented by a mr harrison superintendent of works with passing of land drainage act 1930 welland catchment board was created they had spent ps91 537 on outfall by 1937 towards end of second world war e g taverner chief engineer for drainage board devised a plan to relieve flooding in spalding by creating a bypass channel and building greatford cut to divert waters of west glen river into welland upstream of market deeping scheme cost 000 with much of work being carried out by w c french and coronation channel around spalding was opened in september 1953 fulney lock was constructed at same time to exclude tide from upper river as was maxey cut an embanked channel that bypasses villages of market deeping deeping gate and deeping st james during 1960s and 1970s several sections of river above stamford were made straighter and deeper to reduce risk of flooding of agricultural land to address habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work welland rivers trust a limited company and charitable trust was set up in 2010 they are seeking to direct regeneration of river by co ordinating various organisations which are known collectively as welland valley partnership they published a major document outlining their proposals in february 2013 navigation thumb bridge connecting deeping st james and deeping gate crosses old course of river welland river as far as stamford was used by romans for navigation as it formed part of a system including car dyke which ran along western edge of fens and crossed river near modern folly river navigation to stamford was improved by canal boats used on canal were small lighters around wide capable of carrying from seven to fourteen tons and normally worked in trains of four vessels with arrival of railways river trade declined midland railway reached peterborough in 1846 and opened their line to melton mowbray passing through stamford in 1848 carriage of coal on upper river stopped and locks deteriorated by april 1863 all traffic had ceased and stamford corporation tried to sell line at auction but failed because their ownership of it was disputed trade on lower river was carried in barges and keels during early 1800s as trade was increasing so river was simultaneously silting up around 1800 vessels carrying 60 tons could reach port facilities at spalding however by 1820s ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as river silting had worsened trade records indicate that in 1829 vessels carried just under 20 000 tons to and from spalding and by 1835 this had increased to over 34 000 tons there was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels and with later improvements carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837 barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use port because river was maintained for drainage some commercial traffic continued despite railways and tolls of were collected on 11 690 tons in 1888 coal for spalding gasworks arrived by boat until early 1900s and last regular trade was carriage of corn hay and straw from spalding to fosdyke where cargo was transferred to larger ships all commercial carrying had ceased by end of second world war thumb left spalding water taxi in july 2005 a water taxi service was launched in spalding its route is from just off spalding s high street upstream along river turning onto coronation channel and going to springfields outlet shopping festival gardens and back spalding water taxi vessels of and drawing can still proceed along estuary at high water and can travel inland as far as fulney lock they cannot pass through lock as it is only and at normal summer water levels can accommodate boats drawing river is officially navigable to point at which folly river joins it but length of boats allowed on this section is restricted to long considerably less than lock dimensions would suggest navigation on this stretch was severely restricted by four mile bar footbridge which provided just of headroom but this was increased when a new single span arched bridge was installed in early 2007 by lincolnshire waterways partnership smaller boats such as canoes which can be carried around obstructions can continue up to stamford but they must use old course of river through deepings rather than maxey cut thumb barge and passing yacht between fosdyke and wash below spalding there were no restrictions on headroom which allowed small coasters to reach town bridge at fosdyke was a swing bridge to comply with provisions of fosdyke bridge act of 1870 demise of such traffic allowed it to be replaced by a fixed bridge with headroom of but powers of original act had to be rescinded and port of fosdyke act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen redundant wharfs at fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft lock at fulney has three sets of gates two pointing towards sea and a third between them which points upriver lock can thus only be used when level below it is higher than level above it and as tide falls intermediate gate closes to prevent its use principle of there being no tolls for use of river was established by 1664 act of parliament this was reversed by 1794 act which imposed high tolls until they were reduced by provisions of an act of parliament obtained in 1824 river is now managed by environment agency between stamford and just below fosdyke bridge and a licence is required to use it from there to wash it was managed by port of fosdyke authority but since they went into administration environment agency have also managed section from fosdyke bridge to below holbeach river wildlife river in its upper reaches supports a wild brown trout population and occasional grayling chub and perch dominate middle reaches around stamford with pike perch zander roach bream rudd gudgeon and eels inhabiting lower lengths around spalding a collaboration between welland rivers trust wild trout trust and environment agency has resulted in construction of a rock ramp to allow migrating sea trout to pass up river beyond weir on maxey cut which was acting as a barrier some 300 tons of rock with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer were used to create ramp finer material ensures that water mainly flows over ramp rather than through it ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up river and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads large numbers of swans and geese use river around crowland and out to sea smaller populations of each can be seen around stamford meadows and further upstream in 2015 a common grey seal found its way from wash up river and spent a few weeks sleeping in gardens next to river in deeping st james seal was spotted further downstream in spalding as it eventually made its way back to sea on south bank of river below fosdyke bridge lincolnshire wildlife trust have established moulton marsh nature reserve on a strip of land where soil was excavated to raise banks in 1981 habitat is provided by some broad leafed woodland covering several salt water lagoons and tidal scrapes covering and of saltmarsh a variety of birds can be seen including little grebe and water rail which spend winter on lagoons while scrapes which consist of shallow pools and muddy shorelines are visited by common redshank and little egret between river mouth and river witham a large expanse of saltmarsh provides breeding grounds for common redshank eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in summer and eurasian wigeon mallard common shelduck and common teal in winter birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on flocks of linnet and twite while mudflats support dunlin whimbrel and
