uzair is most often identified with biblical ezra modern historians have described reference as enigmatic since such views have not been found in jewish sources islamic scholars have interpreted quranic reference in different ways with some explaining that it alluded to a specific group of jews according to ibn kathir uzair lived between times of king solomon and time of zachariah father of john baptist some quranic commentators viewed uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach people forgotten laws of god he is sometimes identified as protagonist in quranic story of man who slept for a hundred years 2 259 some islamic scholars held uzayr to be one of prophets however islamic tradition also reports that god expunged uzayr from list of prophets because he refused to believe in predestination ibn hazm al samaw al and other scholars put forth view that uzair or one of his disciples falsified torah and this claim became a common theme in islamic polemics against bible many aspects of later islamic narratives show similarity to vision of ezra an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to muslim readers classical muslim scholars who were aware of jewish and christian denials of belief in of ezra explained that it was only one jew or a small group of jews who worshipped uzayr or that verse refers to extreme admiration of jews for their doctors of law

call christ a son of allah that is a saying from their mouth in this they but imitate what unbelievers of old used to say may allah destroy them how they are deluded away from truth this verse is situated in a context of theological disputes with jewish community of medina quran emphasizes absolute divinity of god and warns against associating any being with him shirk it further condemns jewish and christian leaders of time for deceiving masses into taking their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of god in casting doubt on claims about divine status of uzayr

brother beside me there is no god i have no son book of ezra which judaism accepts as a chronicle of life of ezra and which predates muhammad and qur an by around 1000 years gives ezra s human lineage

quranic verse on ezra appears in one of maimonides s discussions about relationship between judaism and islam where he says they muslims lie about us jews and falsely attribute to us statement that god has a son abraham geiger founder of reform judaism remarked following concerning claim that jews believed ezra to be son of god according to assertion of muhammad jews held ezra to be son of god this is certainly a mere misunderstanding which arose from great esteem in which ezra was undoubtedly held this esteem is expressed in following passage ezra would have been worthy to have made known law if moses had not come before him truly muhammad sought to cast suspicion on jews faith in unity of god and thought he had here found a good opportunity of so doing abraham geiger s book judaism

from ancient times to their eclipse under islam columbia sc university of south carolina press 1988 2nd edn 2009 scholar gordon darnell newby notes following on topic of uzair angel metatron and bene elohim lit sons of god we can deduce that inhabitants of hijaz during muhammad s time knew portions at least of 3 enoch in association with jews angels over which metatron becomes chief are identified in enoch traditions as sons of god bene elohim watchers fallen ones as of flood in 1 enoch and 4 ezra term son of god can be applied to messiah but most often it is applied to righteous men of whom jewish tradition holds there to be no more righteous than ones god elected to translate to heaven alive it is easy then to imagine that among jews of hijaz who were apparently involved in mystical speculations associated with merkabah ezra because of traditions of his translation because of his piety and particularly because he was equated with enoch as scribe of god could be termed one of bene elohim and of course he would fit description of religious leader one of of qur an 9 31 whom jews had exalted according to reuven firestone there is evidence of groups of jews venerating ezra to an extent greater than mainstream judaism which fits with interpretation that verse merely speaks of a small group of jews book 2 esdras a non canonical book attributed to babylonian captivity associates a near divine or angelic status to ezra mark and michael have also hypothesized existence of an arabian jewish sect whose veneration of ezra bordered on deification 1906 jewish encyclopedia states in koran ix 30 jews are charged with worshiping ezra uzair as son of god a malevolent metaphor for great respect which was paid by jews to memory of ezra as restorer of law and from which ezra legends of apocryphal literature ii xxxiv 37 49 originated as to how they developed in mohammedan legends see hayat al hayawan i 304 305 it is hard to bring into harmony with this fact related by jacob saphir eben i 99 that jews of south arabia have a pronounced aversion for memory of ezra and even exclude his name from their category of proper names alternative readings of name some scholars proposed emendations of received spelling of name paul casanova and steven m wasserstrom read name as uzayl zyl a variant of enoch 6 8 or azazel leviticus 16 8 who is identified in jewish as leader of fallen angels called sons of god in genesis 6 2 j finkel instead reads name as aziz potentate connecting it to phrase thou art my son in psalms 2 7 in islamic literature at considers possibility of quranic uzair not being ezra but azariah instead relying on ibn and identifying a confusion committed by muslim exegetes she declares there is from muslim traditionalists a confusion between two distinct characters ezra et azariah h thus it is possible that quranic uzayr could find its origin in azariah s one references category prophets of islam category biblical people in islam category at tawba
