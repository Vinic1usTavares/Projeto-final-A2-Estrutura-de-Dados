composition two years before when he was promoted to concertmaster at weimar court writing one cantata per month to be performed in court chapel in ducal schloss text of and of most other cantatas

work for two vocal parts alto and tenor a four part choir and a baroque chamber ensemble of recorders strings and continuo in alto recitative movement 4 accompanied by all instruments bach creates images of sleep of waking up and of funeral bells latter in recorders and pizzicato of strings while libretto was published in a collection in 1715 bach probably did not perform it until 27 september 1716 due to a period of public mourning of six months in duchy of weimar from august 1715 bach revived cantata when he was thomaskantor in leipzig but not for his cantata cycles which included three new works for 16th sunday after trinity he performed with minor changes between 1737 and 1746 he also assigned it to occasion of purification a feast with a similar topic background thumb upright alt interior of church schlosskirche is painted viewed along nave towards altar showing two balconies and organ on a third level above altar schlosskirche in weimar born in 1685 bach established his reputation as an outstanding organist while in his teens he moved to weimar in 1708 to take up a position as court organist to co reigning dukes wilhelm ernst and ernst august of saxe weimar he had already begun to compose cantatas at his previous posts at arnstadt and muhlhausen and his reasons for moving included disappointment with standard of singing at churches where he had worked he was appointed concertmaster of weimar court capelle on 2 march 1714 in that position he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works specifically he was tasked with providing cantatas for schlosskirche palace church on a monthly schedule which would result in a complete annual cycle for liturgical year within four years while bach had composed vocal music only for special occasions until his promotion chance to regularly compose and perform a new work resulted in a program into which bach threw himself wholeheartedly as bach scholar christoph wolff notes cantatas of 1716 cantatas which were probably first performed in 1716 used texts by weimar court poet salomon franck published in his collections 1715 and 1717 fewer cantatas have survived from this period than from years before possibly some were lost and possibly some proposed cantatas were never written reflecting bach s loss of interest from start of liturgical year on first sunday in advent bach composed prolifically he wrote works for three consecutive sundays in advent prompted probably by death of kapellmeister johann samuel drese on 1 december 1716 when bach s hope to become drese s successor was not realized he ceased to compose cantatas for weimar court these works were performed by bach as concertmaster in 1716 according to wolff and alfred durr an authority on bach s cantatas bach s cantatas in 1716 date occasion bwv incipit text source 2nd sunday after epiphany 155 franck 1715 16th sunday after trinity 161 franck 1715 20th sunday after trinity 162 franck 1715 2nd sunday in

epistle to ephesians about strengthening of faith in congregation of ephesus and from gospel of luke about raising from dead of young man from nain in bach s time story pointed at resurrection of dead expressed in words of desire to die soon franck s text was published in in 1715 he included as closing chorale fourth stanza of hymn 1611 by christoph knoll franck wrote a libretto full of biblical references including in first movement feeding on honey from lion s mouth based on durr summarizes that franck wrote a deeply felt personal confession of longing for jesus bach scholar richard d p jones notes that cantata is one of most richly inspired of all bach s weimar cantatas and sees text as a part of inspiration with its mystical longing for union with christ performances thumb upright alt disputed portrait of young bach with brown curled hair dressed festively portrait of young bach disputed bach led first performance but its date has been debated durr concluded initially in first edition of his book die kantaten von johann sebastian bach of 1971 that cantata was first performed on 6 october 1715 but this date fell in a period of public mourning in weimar in august 1715 brother of duke ernst august died only 18 years old and duke proclaimed six months of mourning in duchy of weimar cantata performances were resumed sooner with 21st sunday after trinity on 10 november 1715 now first performance of work is generally accepted as same occasion following year when 16th sunday after trinity fell on 27 september 1716 by wolff publisher carus verlag and durr in revised and translated edition of 2006 richard d p jones notes in his book creative development of johann sebastian bach that technical novelties also suggest that cantata was composed in 1716 according to a recent study in 1723 his first year as thomaskantor in leipzig bach composed a new cantata for 16th sunday after trinity a year later he wrote a chorale cantata for his second cantata cycle and for his third cantata cycle there he composed he revived in leipzig but only later in a version dated sometime between 1737 and 1746 with minor changes to scoring he even performed it for a different liturgical occasion feast of purification of mary on 2 february prescribed readings for purification included simeon s canticle nunc dimittis which with its line now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace has a similar theme music structure and scoring cantata is structured in six movements a series of alternating arias and recitatives leads to a chorus and a concluding chorale as with several other cantatas based on words by franck it is scored for a small ensemble alto soloist a tenor soloist t a four part choir and a baroque chamber ensemble of two recorders fl two violins vl viola va organ org and basso continuo bc title page reads simply auf den sontag nach for sixteenth sunday after trinity duration is given as 19 minutes one structural element is anticipation of closing chorale in first movement where chorale melody is used as a cantus firmus bach also used this approach to unify structure in two other weimar cantatas and he later used juxtaposition of a chorale cantus firmus against vocal music on a grand scale in his st matthew passion in both opening chorus and movement concluding part i use of recorders in is reminiscent of early cantata actus tragicus at leipzig performances of cantata first verse of chorale was probably sung by a soprano instead of using an instrumental rendition of chorale tune in first aria cantata was transposed from c major to e flat major at leipzig where recorders may have been replaced by transverse flutes in following table of movements scoring and keys are given for version performed in weimar in 1716 keys and time signatures are taken from durr using c symbol for common time 4 4 instruments are shown separately for winds and strings while continuo playing throughout is not shown movements a phrygian chorale melody well known as melody of provides musical theme of cantata appearing in movement one in both its original form and alto line derived from it themes of two other arias are taken from same melody providing formal unity same melody appears five times in chorales of bach s st matthew passion 1 opening aria for alto come o sweet hour of death or come thou sweet hour of parting is accompanied by recorders they move in ritornello in parallel thirds and sixths organ serves not only as a bass instrument but supplies chorale melody in weimar bach seems to have expected congregation to know words of first stanza of knoll s hymn jones points out that cantus firmus of organ seems objective in contrast to subjective display of personal feeling of voice and complexity of other parts in a later performance in leipzig a soprano sang stanza with organ 2 tenor recitative world your pleasure is a burden begins as a secco recitative but ends in an arioso as words paraphrase a biblical verse from to ich habe lust bei christo bald zu weiden ich habe lust von dieser welt zu i desire to pasture soon with christ i desire to depart from this world durr notes that development from secco to arioso is frequent in bach s early cantatas and is here especially motivated to highlight biblical paraphrase 3 aria for tenor my longing is to embrace my savior is first movement with strings adding depth to emotional expression it returns to hope for union with jesus of first movement expressed in an agitated way with for longing and flowing motifs for embracing middle section is mostly accompanied by continuo only but at times interjected by strings playing longing motifs 4 alto recitative end has already come is accompanied by all instruments creating images of sleep in a downward movement ending in long notes awakening in fast movement upwards and funeral bells in recorders and pizzicato of strings musicologist tadashi isoyama notes in this movement anticipation of death appears to be fulfilled and alto s declamation welcoming death and ringing of funeral bells is filled with a pathos amounting almost to obsession 5 first choral movement 5 if it is my god s will is marked aria by franck bach set it for four parts using song like homophony wolff compares style to thuringian motets of around 1700 first part is not repeated da capo in keeping with last words may this be my last word while a textual da capo is impossible bach composed a musical da capo giving movement a structure of abb a durr notes that arnold schering has drawn attention to increasing rapture 6 closing chorale body indeed in earth is illuminated by a fifth part of two recorders playing a lively counterpoint in unison soaring descant of recorders has been interpreted as creating image of flesh transfigured summary wolff summarizes cantata 161 is one of most delicate and jewel like products of bach s years in weimar writing in up to ten parts is extraordinarily subtle recorders additionally contribute in no small way to emotion and positive feelings associated with sweet hour of death jones writes bach s arrival at full maturity by about middle of his weimar period 1713 17 is attested by stylistic and technical assurance and consistently high standard of his writing at that time he counts cantata as one of several that reached a level of mastery unsurpassed in later years along with
