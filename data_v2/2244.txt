regina elena class was a group of four pre dreadnought battleships built for italian regia marina between 1901 and 1908 class comprised four ships lead ship and designed by vittorio cuniberti they were armed with a main battery of two guns and twelve guns and were capable of a top speed of they were fastest battleships in world at time of their commissioning faster even than british turbine powered ships saw service during italo turkish war of 1911 1912 with ottoman empire they frequently supported italian ground forces during campaigns in north africa and islands of eastern mediterranean sea they served during world war i in which italy participated from 1915 to 1918 but they saw no combat as a result of cautious policies adopted by italian and austro hungarian navies all four ships were discarded between 1923 and 1926 and broken up for scrap design starting in 1899 vittorio cuniberti began design work on a warship armed with a uniform battery of twelve guns armored with thick belt armor and capable of a top speed of on a displacement of this proved to be genesis of cuniberti s later designs which culminated in british all big gun when 1899 design project was not accepted cuniberti turned his attention to a new design requirement for a battleship faster than all british and french battleships and stronger than armored cruisers fielded by both navies this resulted in a modified version of his earlier design what came to be regina elena class gardiner pp 336 p 81 general characteristics and machinery left thumb line drawing of regina elena class

combat load ships had a crew of 742 764 officers and enlisted men ships were initially fitted with two masts but after refits early in their careers regina elenas and foremasts were removed gardiner p

ships and 28 babcock wilcox boilers in last two split between three boiler rooms boilers were trunked into three tall funnels ships propulsion system provided a top speed in excess of napoli fastest member of class reached on her speed trials ships had a range of approximately at at time of their completion they were fastest battleships in world faster even than steam turbine powered hms dreadnought armament and armor thumb vittorio forward gun turret regina elenas were armed with two 40 caliber guns placed in two single gun turrets one forward and one aft turrets were placed well clear of superstructure giving them a wide arc of fire close to 300 degrees of rotation electric power was used for training and elevation of turrets and ammunition handling lighter main battery compared to other pre dreadnought type battleships that typically carried twice as many heavy guns was criticized by some observers but dr philip alger writing in proceedings of united states naval institute noted that it should be borne in mind that a pair of guns in a turret do not make twice as good shooting as a single gun and that given limited displacement of design it was wisest choice that could be made alger p 344 fire control for guns was provided by barr and stroud rangefinders mounted on conning tower alger p 345 ammunition magazines were fitted with refrigeration systems to minimize risk of accidental explosions alger p 346 ships were also equipped with twelve 45 cal guns in six twin turrets amidships which also used electrical operation central turrets were placed a deck higher than others to permit them firing directly ahead and astern close range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen 40 cal guns though roma and napoli both had an additional eight guns of this caliber all four ships were also equipped with two torpedo tubes placed in hull below waterline ships were protected with krupp cemented steel manufactured in terni main belt was thick amidships reduced to abreast of main battery turrets and thick at bow and stern deck was thick conning tower was protected by of armor plating main battery guns had thick plating and 8
