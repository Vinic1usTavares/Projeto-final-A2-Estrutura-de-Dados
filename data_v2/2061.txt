1899 kentucky gubernatorial election was held on november 7 1899 to choose 33rd governor of kentucky incumbent republican william o connell bradley was term limited and unable to seek re election after a contentious and chaotic nominating convention at music hall in louisville democratic party chose state senator william goebel as its nominee a dissident faction of party styling themselves honest election democrats were angered by goebel s political tactics at music hall convention and later held their own nominating convention they chose former governor john y brown as their nominee republicans nominated state attorney general william s taylor although governor bradley favored another candidate and lent taylor little support in ensuing campaign in general election taylor won by a vote of 193 714 to 191 331 brown garnered 12 040 votes more than difference between taylor and goebel election results were challenged on grounds of voter fraud but surprisingly state board of elections created by a law goebel had sponsored and stocked with pro goebel commissioners certified taylor s victory an incensed democratic majority in kentucky general assembly created a committee to investigate charges of voter fraud even as armed citizens from heavily republican eastern kentucky poured into state capital under auspices of keeping democrats from stealing election before investigative committee could report goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering state capitol on january 30 1900 as goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds committee issued its report recommending that general assembly invalidate enough votes to give election to goebel report was accepted taylor was deposed and goebel was sworn into office on january 31 he died three days later on february 2 lieutenant governor j c w beckham ascended to office of governor and he and taylor waged a protracted court battle over governorship beckham won case on appeal and taylor fled to indiana to escape prosecution as an accomplice in goebel s murder a total of sixteen people were charged in connection with assassination five went to trial two of those were acquitted each of remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors identity of goebel s assassin remains a mystery background in 1895 gubernatorial election kentucky elected its first ever republican governor william o bradley bradley was able to capitalize both on divisions within democratic party over issue of free silver and on presence of a strong third party candidate populist thomas s pettit to secure victory in general election by just under 9 000 votes this election marked beginning of nearly thirty years of true two party competition in kentucky politics harrison in a new history of kentucky pp 267 268 a powerful democratic foe of bradley had begun his rise to power in kentucky senate kenton county s william goebel became leader of a new group of young democrats who were seen as enemies of large corporations particularly louisville and nashville railroad and friends of working man goebel was known as aloof and calculating unmarried and with few close friends of either gender he was singularly driven by political power harrison in a new history of kentucky pp 268 269 goebel was chosen president pro tem of senate for 1898 legislative session on february 1 1898 he sponsored a measure later called goebel election law kleber goebel election law p 378 law created a board of election commissioners appointed by general assembly who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of kentucky s counties and were empowered to decide disputed elections because general assembly was heavily democratic law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self serving to goebel it was opposed even by some democrats harrison in a new history of kentucky p 270 nevertheless goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override governor bradley s veto making bill law as leader of party goebel essentially hand picked members of election commission hughes p 7 he chose three staunch democrats w s pryor former chief justice of kentucky court of appeals w t ellis former u s representative from daviess county and c b poyntz former head of state railroad commission republicans organized a test case against law but court of appeals found it constitutional hughes p 8 democratic nominating convention three democratic candidates had announced intentions to run for governor in 1899 goebel former kentucky attorney general p wat hardin and former congressman william j stone kleber music hall convention p 666 hardin a native of mercer county had backing of louisville and nashville railroad lyon county s stone had backing of state s agricultural interests goebel generally had backing of urban voters going into party s nominating convention hardin was favorite to win nomination knowing that combining forces was only way to prevent hardin s nomination representatives of goebel and stone met on june 19 1899 to work out a deal tapp p 418 according to urey woodson a goebel representative at meeting two sides signed an agreement whereby half of louisville delegation which was committed to goebel would vote for stone both men agreed that should one of them be defeated or withdraw from race they would encourage their delegates to vote for other rather than support hardin democratic nominating convention began on june 20 at music hall on market street in louisville first order of business was to nominate a convention chairman ollie m james a supporter of stone nominated judge david redwine when woodson seconded nomination deal between stone and goebel became apparent to all hardin supporters nominated william h sweeney but stone goebel alliance elected redwine tapp p 419 membership of several county delegations was challenged these cases would be decided by credentials committee this committee was also stacked against hardin his supporters made up just four of thirteen members prolonged deliberations by credentials committee caused delegates to become restless and hundreds of people both delegates and non delegates entered music hall attempting to disrupt convention when redwine summoned louisville city police to hall to maintain order hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics kleber music hall convention p 667 credentials committee finally issued its report on june 23 of twenty eight cases where delegates were contested twenty six of them were decided in favor of goebel or stone supporters formal nominations began following day hardin felt as though he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy although some loyal delegates continued to vote for him tapp p 420 delegate john stockdale rhea nominated stone stone believed his agreement with goebel meant with hardin s withdrawal goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for stone maintaining a unified party that understanding vanished when another delegate nominated goebel stone was further incensed when all of louisville delegation voted for goebel instead of being split between stone and goebel as two men had previously agreed in retaliation some stone supporters began to back hardin seeing breakdown of stone goebel alliance hardin reversed his withdrawal tapp p 421 after numerous ballots convention was deadlocked on night of june 24 with each candidate receiving about one third of votes hughes p 32 no deliberations were held on sunday june 25 and when delegates reconvened on monday june 26 hall was filled with police per redwine s request rhea requested that police be removed to prevent intimidation but redwine ruled motion out of order another delegate appealed redwine s decision and in violation of parliamentary rule redwine ruled appeal out of order angered by redwine s obviously biased rulings delegates for stone and hardin then began trying to disrupt convention by blowing horns singing yelling and standing on chairs although voting was attempted many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on when voting such as it was ended chair announced that goebel had a majority of votes cast but goebel sent word to redwine that he would accept nomination only if he received an absolute majority of delegates tapp p 422 further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted and meeting adjourned for day on morning of june 27 hall was orderly stone and hardin both called for convention to adjourn sine die again redwine ruled this motion and subsequent appeal of his decision out of order leaders for stone and hardin announced they would not disrupt proceedings as they had previous day and that they would abide by convention s decision as voting proceeded stone and hardin unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance against goebel and balloting was deadlocked for twenty four consecutive ballots delegates agreed to drop third place candidate on next ballot that turned out to be stone votes of urban centers previously divided between stone and goebel now went entirely to goebel while rural western counties that had supported stone went to hardin tapp p 423 vote remained close but as alphabetical roll call proceeded goebel secured votes of stone s union county delegation giving him nomination following vote hardin and stone leaders pledged their support to goebel though some did so in qualified terms for lieutenant governor democrats nominated j c w beckham who at age 29 was not yet legally old enough to assume governorship if called on to do so goebel questioned selection of beckham because beckham s native nelson county had voted for hardin and was largely controlled by political boss ben johnson but goebel s allies convinced him that beckham would be loyal to his program among other nominees was ex confederate soldier robert j breckinridge jr for attorney general tapp p 424 this nomination helped placate numerous ex confederates in party since goebel s father had fought for union it was not enough however to persuade breckinridge s brother former congressman w c p breckinridge to support ticket republican nominating convention potential republican gubernatorial candidates were initially few hughes p 50 some were not interested in being on defense against inevitable democratic attacks on bradley administration still others were intimidated by prospect of being defeated by machinery of goebel election law party leaders were encouraged however by deep democratic divisions at music hall convention tapp p 425 sitting attorney general william s taylor was first to announce his candidacy and soon secured support of republican senator william deboe later candidates included hopkins county judge clifton j pratt and sitting state auditor sam h stone former was choice of governor bradley while latter was supported by lexington herald editor sam j roberts taylor like goebel was a skilled political organizer he was able to create a strong political machine amongst county delegations and seemed favorite to win nomination republican nominating convention convened on july 12 in lexington kentucky hughes p 52 angry that his party had not more seriously considered his candidate governor bradley did not attend black leaders in party threatened to follow bradley and organize their own nominating convention as they believed taylor represented lily white branch of party taylor attempted to hold party together by making one of black leaders permanent secretary of convention and promising to appoint other black leaders to his cabinet if elected he also tried to bring bradley back to convention by promising to nominate bradley s nephew edwin p morrow for secretary of state bradley refused offer in face of taylor s superior organization auditor stone announced that he desired to see a united party and moved that taylor be nominated unanimously judge pratt seconded motion hughes p 53 other notable nominations were john marshall for lieutenant governor caleb powers for secretary of state and judge pratt for attorney general tapp p 426 honest election democrats some democrats remained unsatisfied with outcome of music hall convention after a period of silence candidate william stone publicly detailed arrangement he believed he had with goebel and how goebel had broken it although goebel s allies attempted to defend him against charges stone s story was soon corroborated by former congressman w c owens owens called on democrats to vote for republican candidate and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by goebel could give him governorship hughes pp 44 46 a group of louisville democrats supporters of u s senator jo blackburn made first formal calls for a new convention a short time after a large meeting at mount sterling gave movement a definite form they called for a meeting in lexington on august 2 to organize details of a new convention at subsequent mass meetings it was announced that former governor john y brown would accept nomination of a second convention should one be held as brown had been thought to be a supporter of goebel this announcement caused no small stir among democrats representatives of sixty counties attended august 2 meeting in lexington resolutions endorsing democratic platform from 1896 democratic national convention and candidacy of william jennings bryan in 1900 were adopted then ex governor brown addressed crowd finally representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on august 16 hughes pp 46 47 60 representatives from 108 of kentucky s 120 counties attended convention hughes p 68 among attendees were editors of lexington herald louisville evening post and louisville dispatch former congressman owens former speaker of kentucky house of representatives harvey myers jr and political bosses william john and theodore hallam tapp p 428 convention nominated an entire slate of candidates for state office with former governor brown at head they also put forward a platform condemning music hall convention goebel election law and presidential administration of william mckinley hughes p 69 campaign goebel s campaign staff included senator jo blackburn former governor james b mccreary and political boss percy haly goebel opened his campaign on august 12 in mayfield a city in heavily democratic jackson purchase region of state he attacked louisville and nashville railroad and charged that wealthy corporate interests from outside state were attempting to influence choice of kentucky s governor tapp pp 429 430 taylor opened his campaign on august 22 in london a republican stronghold in eastern kentucky tapp p 430 among his supporters were senator deboe congressman samuel pugh caleb powers and former republican gubernatorial candidate thomas z morrow who was also brother in law of governor bradley hughes p p 432 taylor stressed economic prosperity brought about during mckinley administration he reminded crowd that republicans had not supported enslavement of blacks and stated they would not now support what he called political enslavement that would result from electing goebel brown opened his campaign in bowling green on august 26 hughes p 70 because of his age and ill health he made no more than one speech per week hughes p 77 nevertheless he toured commonwealth questioning sincerity of goebel s free silver views he continued to attack music hall convention asking whether past great democrats such as john c breckinridge and lazarus w powell would have supported events that took place there he also derided goebel election law as creating an oligarchy brown s limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters although ex confederates were generally a safe voting bloc for democrats goebel could not heavily rely on them because of his father s ties to union also in 1895 goebel had killed john sanford an ex confederate in a duel stemming from a personal dispute between two men this made him particularly odious to brown supporter theodore hallum a friend of sanford s who said of goebel at a campaign rally in bowling green w hen democratic party of kentucky in convention assembled sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yellow dog for governorship of this great state i will support him but lower than that you shall not drag me tapp p 433 goebel tried to mitigate his lukewarm support from ex confederates by courting black vote long given to republicans though he had to do so carefully to avoid further alienating his own party base unlike other democrats goebel had not voted on separate coach bill a law that required blacks and whites to use segregated railroad facilities most blacks opposed bill and goebel tried to remain silent on issue but when pressed he admitted in a campaign event in that he supported bill and would oppose its repeal likewise taylor had tried to dodge issue of separate coach bill to avoid upsetting lily white branch of his party but a week after goebel took a position in favor of bill taylor came out against it this marked a turning point in campaign as blacks at first cool toward taylor now actively supported him tapp pp 434 436 thumb left alt a man in his early forties with receding black hair facing right and wearing a black bow tie black coat and white shirt william jennings bryan bolstered goebel s campaign with a tour of state dying populist party had also nominated a full slate of candidates for state offices eroding some of goebel s populist base although populist party platform was similar to goebel s it also explicitly condemned goebel election law thomas pettit populist candidate from 1895 gubernatorial election campaigned for goebel but many of other leaders in party did not with his support slipping on every side goebel appealed to william jennings bryan to come to state and campaign for him known as great commoner bryan was immensely popular with kentuckians particularly democrats and populists after refusing initial requests bryan finally came to state and in three days crisscrossed state with goebel to stir up support bryan s visit helped solidify democrats behind goebel and took significant support from brown ticket tapp pp 436 437 no sooner had bryan left state than governor bradley reversed course and began stumping for taylor though he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from democratic attacks louisville courier journal editor henry watterson suggested that bradley was seeking to enlist taylor s support for his anticipated senatorial bid bradley kicked off his tour of state in louisville charging that democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all state s best men had deserted him as evidence he cited goebel s lack of support from democrat john g carlisle his former ally as well as senator william lindsay w c p breckinridge john y brown theodore hallum w c owens wat hardin and william stone he also encouraged blacks not to desert republican party he contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with democrats support of separate coach bill bradley and republican leader and later governor augustus e willson toured state on behalf of republican ticket often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for taylor tapp pp 437 439 in final two weeks of campaign brown was injured in an accident and became a wheelchair user this was a severe blow to an already faltering campaign and it became clear race would primarily be between goebel and taylor both men spent last days of campaign in louisville knowing that with its sizable population it would be key to election goebel continued his attack on louisville and nashville railroad supporting striking laborers from railroad and charging that republican party was controlled by trusts both republicans and democrats warned of possibility that election fraud and violence would be perpetrated by other side louisville mayor charles p weaver a goebel democrat added 500 recruits to city s police force just before election leading to charges that voter intimidation would occur in that city governor bradley countered by ordering state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across state on election day headline of courier journal proclaimed bayonet rule tapp pp 439 440 election and aftermath for all claims about potential for violence election day november 7 remained mostly calm across state tapp p 440 fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide voting returns were slow and on election night race was still too close to call when official tally was announced taylor had won by a vote of 193 714 to 191 331 brown had garnered 12 040 votes and populist candidate blair had captured 2 936 had goebel been able to win votes that went to either of third party candidates he could have saved election for democrats charges of fraud began even before official returns were announced tapp p 441 in nelson county 1 200 ballots listed republican candidate as w p taylor instead of w s taylor democrats claimed these votes should be invalidated in knox and johnson counties voters complained of thin tissue ballots that allowed voter s choices to be seen through them one democratic political boss even called for entire louisville vote to be invalidated because state militia had intimidated voters there taylor had won by about 3 000 votes in louisville republicans gained an early victory when court of appeals ruled that nelson county vote should stand tapp p 443 final result of election however would be decided by board of elections created by goebel election law newspapers across state both democratic and republican called for board s decision to be accepted as final tensions grew as date for board s hearings drew near and small bands of armed men from heavily republican eastern kentucky began to arrive in frankfort state capital just before board s decision was announced number of armed mountain men was estimated at 500 although board was thought to be controlled by goebel it rendered a surprise 2 1 decision to let announced vote tally stand klotter goebel assassination p 377 board s majority opinion claimed they did not have any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses tapp p 444 taylor was inaugurated on december 12 1899 democrats were outraged party leaders met on december 14 and called on goebel and beckham to contest election goebel had been inclined to let result stand and seek a seat in u s senate in 1901 but he heeded wishes of his party s leaders and contested board s decision allie young chairman of state democratic party called a caucus of democratic members of general assembly to be held on january 1 1900 as a result of caucus j c s blackburn was nominated for a seat in u s senate goebel was nominated as president pro tem of kentucky senate and south trimble was nominated as speaker of house when general assembly convened each democratic nominee was elected party possessing heavy majorities in both houses lieutenant governor marshall presented a list of committees to senate but that body voted 19 17 to set aside this list and approve a list provided by goebel instead similarly in house list of committees presented by speaker trimble and approved by that body enumerated forty committees none of them with a republican majority hughes pp 157 167 174 goebel s

challenges voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them harrison in a new history of kentucky p 271 members of committee were drawn at random although drawing was likely rigged only one republican joined ten democrats on committee chance dictated that committee should have contained four or five republicans tapp p 445 joint committee on rules recommended that contest committee report at pleasure of general assembly that debate was limited once findings were presented and that report be voted on in a joint session of assembly hughes p 174 rules further provided that speaker of house would preside over this joint session instead of lieutenant governor as was customary republican minority fought these provisions but democratic majority passed them over their opposition goebel s assassination republicans around state expected committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make goebel governor additional armed men from eastern kentucky filled capital tapp p 446 taylor recognizing that slightest incident could lead to violence ordered men home and many of them complied still two or three hundred remained awaiting election committee s findings others remained as witnesses set to testify before contest committee hughes p 188 some of these republican witnesses were arrested by local police who were mostly goebel partisans governor taylor issued pardons for some of them citing their claims police had robbed them upon their arrest to avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon many of republican partisans began wearing their guns openly adding to tensions in city but effectively reducing number of arrests by local police hughes p 189 thumb left alt a man crumpled in a heap near a fountain in front of a building with

majority report that claimed goebel and beckham had received most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices a little over an hour after committee s meeting governor taylor declared a state of insurrection and called out state militia he called legislature into special session not in frankfort but in heavily republican london which he insisted was a safer location defiant democratic legislators refused to heed call to london but when they attempted to convene first in state capitol and later in other public locations in frankfort they found doors barred by armed citizens on january 31 1900 they convened secretly in a frankfort hotel with no republicans present and voted to certify findings of contest committee invalidating enough votes to make goebel governor goebel was sworn in and immediately ordered state militia to stand down he also ordered general assembly to reconvene in frankfort republican militia refused to disband and a rival democratic militia formed across lawn of state capitol civil war seemed possible taylor apprised president mckinley of situation in kentucky he stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops and mckinley assured a delegation of kentucky s federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort republican legislators made preparations to heed taylor s call to convene in london on february 5 meanwhile in order to resolve any doubts about legitimacy of their earlier meeting democratic legislators met at state house no longer being denied entrance by state militia and again voted to adopt majority report declaring goebel and beckham winners of election both men again took oath of office hughes pp 233 235 239 as a test to see if his gubernatorial authority was still recognized taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in knott county pardon was signed by proper county officials but officers at penitentiary refused to release man it was feared taylor would dispatch state militia to remove prisoner but no further attempts were made to secure his release continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for capture of goebel s unknown assailant responding that he was not authorized to make an offer in absence of a request to do so by officials in franklin county he offered a 500 reward from his own money hughes pp 233 236 goebel died of his wounds on february 3 he remains only american governor ever assassinated while in office with goebel most controversial figure in

floor of a building next to state capitol however much of testimony against accused men was conflicting and some of it was later proven to be perjured most of state s judges were democratic supporters of goebel and juries were packed with partisan democrats appellate courts however were largely republican and convictions returned by lower courts were often overturned with cases being remanded for new trials howard was tried and convicted in september 1900 january 1902 and april 1903 his final appeal failed and he was sentenced to life in prison powers was also convicted three times in july
