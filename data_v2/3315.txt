green head ant rhytidoponera metallica also known as green ant or metallic pony ant is a species of ant that is endemic to australia it was described by british entomologist frederick smith in 1858 as a member of genus rhytidoponera in subfamily ectatomminae these ants measure between queens and workers look similar differing only in size with males being smallest they are well known for their distinctive metallic appearance which varies from green to purple or even reddish violet among most widespread of all insects in australia green head ants are found in almost every australian state but are absent in tasmania they have also been introduced in new zealand where several populations have been established this species lives in many habitats including deserts forests woodland and urban areas they nest underground below logs stones twigs and shrubs or in decayed wooden stumps and are sometimes found living in termite mounds they are among first insects to be found in burnt off areas after embers have stopped smouldering rain presents no threat to colonies as long as it is a light shower in continuous sunshine green head ant is diurnal active throughout day preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap sucking insects they play an important role in seed dispersal scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species predators include short beaked echidna tachyglossus aculeatus and a number of bird species green head ant workers are gamergates meaning they can reproduce with winged males with workers taking over reproductive role queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies nuptial flight begins in spring with males mating with one or two females queens that establish their own colonies are semi claustral going out and foraging to support their young another way colonies are formed is through budding where a subset of colony leaves main colony for an alternative nest site green head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans however they can also be beneficial to humans acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles moths and termites taxonomy thumbnail left illustration of a worker by w w froggatt 1907 green head ant was first described in 1858 by british entomologist frederick smith in his catalogue of insects in collection of british museum part vi under binomial name ponera metallica based on two syntypes a worker and a queen he collected in adelaide south australia these specimens were later reviewed in 1958 with designation of a lectotype from syntypes but it is unclear which specimen was designated material is currently housed in natural history museum in london in 1862 austrian entomologist gustav mayr moved species from genus ponera and placed it in rhytidoponera as ectatomma rhytidoponera which at time was a newly erected subgenus of ectatomma mayr s original reclassification was short lived as in 1863 he moved ant from rhytidoponera to ectatomma in 1897 italian entomologist carlo emery named ant rhytidoponera metallica and in 1911 designated it as type species of a subgenus of rhytidoponera ant was however mistakenly identified as type species of rhytidoponera by some scientists taxonomy of green head ant and other species related to it forming r metallica species group were a source of confusion due to high geographic variations in green head ant and similar looking species having been treated as forms occurrence of multiple morphs these forms have been described under different names through inadequate characterisations in 1958 american entomologist william brown jr synonymised rhytidoponera caeciliae rhytidoponera pulchra rhytidoponera purpurascens and rhytidoponera varians with green head ant after reviewing ants in a 1958 journal article taxon r purpurascens was named after its dark purple appearance by william morton wheeler but r metallica tends to appear purple around regions where wheeler originally collected r purpurascens after examining collected specimens brown also noted no morphological differences between r pulchra and r caeciliae species r varians was described from specimens collected in darlington western australia american entomologist walter cecil crawley stated that subspecies differs from r metallica by its smaller size and faded metallic colour varying from yellow brown in most specimens to a metallic green on head thorax and gaster with no evidence of purple colouring an examination of r varians showed that superficial punctures of gastric dorsum are coarser than usual but these variants are found not only around original collection site but also throughout southern regions of australia such feature may occur naturally which disallows r varians to be considered as a separate population from r metallica under present classification green head ant is a member of genus rhytidoponera in tribe subfamily ectatomminae it is a member of family formicidae belonging to order hymenoptera an order of insects containing ants bees and wasps other than its name green head ant it is commonly known as metallic pony ant or green ant in queensland however this may be confusing as residents living in northern queensland call green tree ant oecophylla smaragdina green ants description in general green head ants are monomorphic occurs in a single form measuring in length and varying in colour ranging from green blue to green purple their exoskeletons are hard and heavily armoured with a single segmented waist queens measure with head thorax and abdomen exhibiting various metallic colours head is usually green behind eyes and ferruginous rust in colour at front with a less obvious purple tint between colours antennae are ferruginous and eyes are ovate shape resembling an egg head is emarginate having a notched tip or edge from its posterior view and also rugose along with thorax and node a segment between mesosoma and gaster these body parts are covered with large punctures basal segment of abdomen has transversely curved grooves which run across body colour of thorax is usually greenish wings are they have a glassy appearance and veins of wings are brick red colour legs and apex are ferruginous and abdomen is purple workers and queens closely resemble each other making two castes hard to distinguish but workers differ in having a compressed and elongated thorax and an abdomen that is predominately green tinted workers are also slightly smaller than queens measuring males are smaller than workers and queens measuring and appear to be black and fuscous dark and sombre tarsus is fuscous and mandibles are rugose in contrast to workers and queens funicular joints are shorter sculpture is denser on head and thorax number of punctures is less than that of other castes and postpetiole is coarser first segment of gaster is transversely roughened and hair on legs is less dense genitalia of male is consistent with other composed of an outer middle and inner pair of valves thumbnail left a worker at 5x life size demonstrating metallic colour predominant metallic colour is green but can vary by region ranging from metallic green to purple in flinders ranges of south australia and alice springs colour of ants shifts from typical green to a dark purple colour in areas with more rainfall such as new south wales tablelands and victorian savannahs green head ants are mostly green with purplish tints seen on sides of mesosoma in northern regions of new south wales and queensland alitrunk is reddish violet which shades into golden around lower portions of pleura green colour is either limited or completely absent in this case most populations have a bright green gaster except for those living in central desert in some areas examined near brisbane two different colour forms were discovered within a single colony one possibility is that two colour forms may represent two sibling species but this cannot be confirmed because of lack of evidence in far north queensland populations appear to be dull green and distinct to those living in south but it is unknown how ants in far north and south hook up at western and southern regions of atherton tableland with this said it is unknown if far north populations are actually a different species in addition to colour variation there are morphological differences among populations for example size and shape of head and petiole length of appendages and other sculptural details of body may all vary sub mature larvae measure and appear similar to sub mature r cristata larvae they can be distinguished by a less swollen abdomen and shorter body hairs measuring on thorax and abdomen somite they measure on flagelliform and ventral portion of abdominal somites they measure hairs on head have short denticles and antennae have three apical sensilla each containing a somewhat bulky spinule young larvae are much smaller than sub mature larvae at long they appear similar to sub mature larvae but diameter differs gradually decreasing from fifth somite to anterior end hairs measure with longest found on flagelliform and on all somites hairs on somites however become sparse tips of hairs on head are simple or frayed and overall hairs measure both antennae have a and three apical sensilla that resemble a spinule mandibles are sub triangular with a curved apex apical and subapical teeth are sharp and short but proximal tooth is blunt unlike mature larvae proximal tooth is not divided into two portions distribution and habitat thumbnail occurrences of green head ant as reported to atlas of living australia green head ant is among most widespread of all insects endemic to australia ant is found throughout victoria new south wales australian capital territory and south australia it can be found in most areas of western australia but is less common in north and is present in lower regions of northern territory and east of queensland they are not present in tasmania green head ant is an introduced species to new zealand and was first seen in 1959 populations of ant were probably introduced into country on cargoes of timber a number of other rhytidoponera species were most likely introduced same way populations have been established in napier as ants were collected in town between 2001 and 2003 nests were previously found in suburb of penrose in auckland and mount maunganui but no specimens have been collected there since 1960s habitat of green head ant varies ranging from desert heath open forests urban areas and woodland these ants mainly live in moderate wooded or open areas but they are abundant in lawns and gardens in cities nests have been found in dry and wet sclerophyll woodland mallee savannah woodland on roadsides and in native vegetation green head ants are mostly found at altitudes of between above sea level workers construct small and loosely integrated nests underground or in decaying wooden stumps they may also nest in termite mounds of amitermes laurensis these nests are commonly found beneath grass roots or under logs stones twigs or at base of shrubs green head ants can nest in disturbed areas and as a result colonies of these ants are rather common in urban areas they are among first insects to be seen foraging for food in areas where bushfires have occurred and in some cases they return right after embers have stopped smouldering rain also presents no threat to green head ants as long as it is a light shower in continuous sunshine behaviour and ecology colonies show variation as to favoured nest location with some for example avoiding nesting under small rocks and preferring larger ones which apparently promote colony growth promotion of colony growth is associated with territory size border disputes increase of alates fertile females and males colony survival and stable worker production colony growth under smaller rocks is slow and restricted a colony that increases in size requires a larger space to accommodate such growth and extra brood and workers despite this green head ants do not discriminate among rocks according to their thickness or temperature instead they choose a rock based on its ground cover dimensions distance of a rock is also important colonies move no more than to a rock they prefer this suggests that cost of moving to a suitable nesting site outweighs benefits of moving to a larger rock a large expenditure of energy is required for a move scouts must first find a suitable site brood must be transported safely and colony is exposed to an increased risk of predation nest abandonment by green head ant varies but peaks during summer like other temperate species activity in colonies is greatly reduced during colder months which may be reason there is a high proportion of nest abandonment during summer nests abandoned by green head ants are unlikely to be invaded by other species so nest invasions are an unlikely cause of nest vacation structural breakdown of a nest and competition with other neighbouring colonies is also unlikely but a possible factor is seasonal production of food sources and food competition foraging diet and predators thumbnail worker collecting a small flower green head ant is a diurnal species that is active throughout day quickly foraging on either ground or vegetation they are scavengers predators and seed eaters generally having a broad diet of animal material insects small arthropods honeydew from sap sucking insects and seeds workers usually prey on beetles moths and termites using their stingers to kill them by injecting venom removal of capitula structure similar to an elaiosome from goliath eggs reduces chances of them being collected by green head ants that carry them back into their nests in areas where meat ant iridomyrmex purpureus is dominant green head ant is not affected by its presence and is still successful in finding food sources as green head ants are primitive general predators in contrast to more advanced species which forage in groups and always communicate via trail pheromones they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants they rely heavily on any food source and impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to their peaceful coexistence with dominant species including meat ants experiments suggest that specific diets can result in differentiated mortality rates among colonies in one experiment three captive colonies were given three different diets one colony was given bhatkar and whitcomb diet an artificial diet consisting of whole raw eggs honey and vitamin mineral capsules another was given honey water and drosophila flies while third colony was given a standardised artificial diet of digestible carbohydrates two colonies that were given standardised artificial diet and honey water and flies were shown to raise more brood with a lower mortality in workers in contrast to colony that received bhatkar and whitcomb diet green head ant is a seed eating species showing a preference for seeds with low mechanical defence properties with stronger seeds being rarely eaten they are known to collect non seeds and disperse seeds of myrtle wattle acacia myrtifolia golden wattle acacia coastal wattle acacia sophorae sweet wattle acacia suaveolens and juniper wattle acacia green head ants relocate almost half of seeds they feed on approximately away from their nests in both unburned and burned habitats in some cases seeds of adriana are dispersed much farther green head ant accounts for 93 of all ants that collect these seeds and can disperse them as far as one study shows that green head ant along with longiceps removed highest number of seeds and discarded them on top of their nest with a few remaining several centimetres under nest most seeds dispersed by green head ant and a longiceps are eventually eaten by pheidole ants since seeds have a higher survival rate if they are not collected by pheidole these two ants are more beneficial to seeds than pheidole seeds in green head ant nests rarely germinate foraging factors such as time spent outside and distance travelled by workers has been correlated to colony size workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less time outside whereas those in larger colonies spend more time outside and at greater distances from their nest such results have also been seen in western honey bee apis mellifera but unlike honey bees workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads decreased foraging time may reduce risk of predation and save energy for example limited energy in r aurata is a result of time spent looking for food sources rather than collection of food items shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources as these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates chance of a worker encountering others is improved by marking ground with trail pheromones this behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise encounter rate with nestmates however when workers are transporting small to large crickets marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower retrieval time for other ants workers can quickly readjust their foraging activity in accordance with food quality thumbnail left black house ants ochetellus glaber attacking a worker large green head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism where younger workers act as nurses and tend to brood and older workers go out and forage in smaller colonies age caste polyethism does not occur with nursing and foraging initiated by both younger and older workers these results show that ageing is not mechanism that drives labour among colonies emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies is a result of worker specialisation workers in small colonies usually tend to brood much more than those in larger colonies but this is due to differentiated social environment between small and large societies in contrast old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time and those in small colonies forage less a predatory species such as green head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment even if there is a larger foraging force this means that workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly which makes a colony react faster task allocation patterns referring to way that tasks are chosen are different in small and large colonies which may determine contact rate green head ants are prey for a number of predators including assassin bugs and short beaked echidna tachyglossus aculeatus in faeces of which have been found worker ants birds also eat these ants including australian white ibis black kite milvus migrans masked lapwing vanellus miles and australian owlet nightjar aegotheles cristatus workers and larvae can be infected by parasites examined workers were seen with late stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces in some nests of green head ant some myrmecophilous insects such as beetle longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies life cycle and reproduction thumbnail queen right in captivity with larvae pupae and a worker green head ant males are produced irregularly throughout year and are low flying ants recorded nuptial flights begin between september to november at temperatures of 20 25 degc 68 77 degf when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest sometimes however males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside green head ant is a gamergate species which means that males can successfully mate with workers these workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into air observation has shown workers first attacking males when two first encounter each other followed by male mounting worker by grasping it in cervical region with its mandibles successfully attaching itself both ants usually rest when they mate but sometimes workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after thereby disengaging with male on a few occasions workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag male eventually dislodging it copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in morning with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute most pairs mate once but others may copulate with each other twice in some cases males will successfully mate with two workers and some pairs may return to their nest while mating green head ant is known for its rarity of virgin queens with some nests occasionally producing winged females queens are able to establish their own colonies in captivity but out in wild they have never been seen to establish a colony suggesting that species is losing its queen caste majority of observations show males mating with workers but not queens one factor further suggesting loss of queen caste is that green head ant is going through an evolutionary process where queens are a rare morphological form with little significance so workers usually replace queens and take on reproductive role queens still undertake role of nuptial flight as some have been seen mating with males they are known to release a sex pheromone from gland an exocrine gland found between last two abdominal segments wingless reproductive females queens emerge from their nest and like workers their head onto ground and elevate their gaster from which membrane at back of abdomen extends queens then release sex pheromones which attracts males who frantically search for queens through agitated locomotion males may attempt to copulate with workers that did not call for them suggesting that workers might be able to release these pheromones when a male makes contact with a queen male touches her with his antennae and grasps female s thorax with his mandibles a queen is ready to mate when she turns her abdomen to side where male will search for genitalia with his copulatory apparatus parts of organ involved with copulation pair may copulate for several minutes thumbnail workers fighting those living in queenless societies may compete for dominance colony founding is mostly initiated by a fertilised worker that establishes herself in a closed cell from which she sometimes emerges to forage for food observations show that most workers establishing their own colonies follow typical behaviour of a ponerine ant laying eggs and rearing their larvae however brood in captive colonies founded by workers only emerges as males such a case would mean that a new colony is probably formed by a number of workers leaving their parent nest of which a few individuals are fertilised this process is called budding also called satelliting or fractionating where a subset of colony leave main colony for an alternative nest site this may not be case entirely as some queens can establish their own colonies inseminated queens can successfully establish a colony in non claustral conditions as in founded by a single queen that hunts for food to feed her young but development of a colony straight after colony founding is very slow whereas other rhytidoponera species tend to grow faster there is also a clear sign of division of labour between queens and workers upon death of a queen workers may sometimes compete and exhibit sexual calling behaviour which means that workers are able to reproduce in queenless nests despite near absence of queens long range dispersal with winged queens may still be an option colonies start small but can rapidly expand to point they are considered mature genetic patterns suggest that green head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies relatedness among workers is also very low and there is a high proportion of gamergate ants if gamergates are all unrelated number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine all of these gamergates contribute to reproduction of young average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction most of time however gamergates are generally unrelated and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of relatedness in many colonies workers and gamergates police young females which prevents them from reproducing relationship with humans green head ant possesses a highly potent sting that can be painful but is short lived an icepack or commercially available spray can be used to relieve pain but individuals experiencing an allergic reaction are normally taken to hospital for treatment venom is powerful enough to cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans in a 2011 australian ant allergy venom study of which objective was to determine what native australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis it was shown that 34 participants reacted to venom of green head ant rest of participants reacted to myrmecia venom in particular 176 to m alone study concluded that four main groups of australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis green head ant was only ant that was not a myrmecia species to cause allergic reactions in participating individuals green head ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry despite its potential danger to sensitive humans green head ants can be beneficial they can serve as a form of pest control by killing agricultural pests such as beetle and moth larvae and termites references cited literature external links category ectatomminae category
