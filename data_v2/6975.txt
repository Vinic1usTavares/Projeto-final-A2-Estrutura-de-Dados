they were under beast s control ood sphere is in same solar system as sense sphere location for 1964 serial sensorites sensorites and ood are visually and mentally similar production episode was written by keith temple and directed by graeme harper executive producer russell t davies had envisioned ood s return because their previous appearance 2006 two part story impossible planet and satan pit had been overshadowed by appearance of devil davies subsequently provided temple with a brief for episode which included term ice planet and storyline of a business selling ood as a commodity temple s drafts of episode were described as too dark and too old doctor who temple stated on episode s commentary that his early draft was a six part serial in 45 minutes temple and davies thought that episode was not a fun reappearance of an old monster instead they felt that there was an actual story to tell temple emphasised in his script that doctor overlooked ood under shadow of devil and character had to see his shortcomings temple s script also emphasised ood s slavery both temple and lead actor david tennant commented that existence of a species born to serve was complicated latter stating complications with richard dawkins selfish gene theory donna s role in episode was to further humanise doctor and her opinion of ood changing from her initial disgust at their appearance to empathy for them was important to episode and her character development susie liggat cited writing as part of doctor who s importance she thought story about liberating oppressed people could be applied domestically or globally episode s antagonist klineman halpen is portrayed by tim mcinnerny davies considered his character a middle manager who s out of his depth a perfect villain temple described him as narcissistic preening and ruthless without sentiment mcinnerny said it s always nice to play a bastard i m glad halpen s a three dimensional bastard that makes him interesting temple epitomised halpen in a scene where he kills an operative for activist group friends of ood davies and tennant felt that his disgusting and gothic edgar allan poe fate would be undeserved otherwise filming for episode took place in august 2007 opening and closing outdoor scenes were filmed in quarry in brecon beacons external scenes of complex at aberthaw cement works and scenes in battery farm were filmed in a hangar at raf saint athan cgi was used sparingly in production snow was paper snow adhered by water and ood heads contained complex animatronics mcinnerny wore a prosthetic mask with two layers for his transformation scene though production team s best boy provided motion capture for computer generated profile of appendages coming out of his mouth when this needed to be refilmed and mcinnerny was unavailable reception planet of ood was most watched programme in its timeslot with 7 5 million viewers episode was second most watched programme of day beaten by britain s got talent and was twelfth most watched programme of week episode s appreciation index was 87 considered excellent scott matthewman writing for stage gave a mixed review of episode he thought that pretty much only surprise in way humans who made up ood corporation were presented came as pr girl solana ayesha escaped with doctor and donna only to betray their position by calling for guards and revelation that ryder adrian rawlins has been working to infiltrate corporation is thrown away as quickly as it is revealed however he thought donna was becoming fast one of strongest and most well rounded companions in series history and there were some nice interpretations of ood s natural development caitlin moran of times thought episode was really really good one that will have you staring at your screen and asking once again how can something so good be happening so early on a saturday night in my own front room she enjoyed scene where doctor and donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture saying that tate really really isn t that bad when she says we don t have slaves ben rawson jones of digital spy gave episode five stars out of five rawson jones opened his review by saying doctor who can occasionally transcend properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant beautiful epiphany and greater sense of world they inhabit citing donna s reaction on seeing uncultivated ood as moving part of episode he thought episode as a whole exemplifies just how powerful and emotive doctor who can be when writing direction and performance are all harmonious and complete their own ood like circle and was appreciative of acting episode s only flaw was when donna said why do you say miss do i look single but was otherwise an extremely impressive contemplative examination of abhorrent nature of humanity references external links category horsehead nebula in fiction category tenth doctor episodes category 2008 british television episodes
