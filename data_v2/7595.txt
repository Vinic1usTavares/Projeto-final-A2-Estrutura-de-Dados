tokyo millennium to eradicate demons and prepare for thousand year kingdom plot is influenced by choices player makes throughout game determining their moral alignment game was created to not have direct connections to first shin megami tensei to ensure that it was interesting independently this led character designer kazuma kaneko to create concept of a story vaguely based on shin megami tensei future reviewers enjoyed gameplay and lowered difficulty compared to prior game some appreciated plot and themes but some thought that certain themes while fresh at time of release felt cliched in retrospect gameplay thumb left player fights demons in first person here they have two humans and one allied demon in their party in shin megami tensei ii player takes role of gladiator hawk who is

messiah and commits ultimate sin by killing yhvh freeing humanity development thumb atlus visited taira no masakado s grave pictured and hariti s temple during pre production to get cleansed shin megami tensei ii was developed by atlus for super famicom it was directed by kouji okada produced by hideyuki yokoyama and written by ryutaro ito with music composed by tsukasa masuko kazuma kaneko designed game s characters but was also involved in planning phase during game s pre production development staff visited hariti s temple in and taira no masakado s grave to cleanse themselves they had done this before first during development of first shin megami tensei after one of staff members got robbed they decided to do it regularly inspiration to do this came from go nagai who was said to have exorcised a spirit with help of hariti while writing manga devilman during game s planning it was decided that it should not be directly connected to shin megami tensei ensuring that it would hold interest independent from first game because of this kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on shin megami tensei s future at first he imagined it to take place ten years after first game as he thought that would be roughly amount of time needed for society to rebuild but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later kaneko disagreed saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years and that he could not even imagine what world would look like a hundred years into future or what it had been like during meiji period two had different ideas about timeline of series but eventually decided to set game several decades after shin megami tensei they made use of tree of life as a central theme of story according to kaneko reason for choosing judeo christian god yhvh as game s antagonist was that he saw yhvh as base for all other gods around world having observed common motives throughout different mythologies such as flood and creation of world he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology which had been changed as people took it with them leading to modern day myths he thought original mythology would be old testament and therefore considered yhvh base of all gods despite casting yhvh as antagonist kaneko noted that he did not intend for yhvh to be evil incarnate in megami tensei character design aleph was created to embody shin megami tensei ii world which is reflected in his character design he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with and carries swords guns and armor for use in battle his computer was designed to look compact and visor was designed to be wireless to show that game takes place in future kaneko decided to not give aleph a personality partially because he is controlled by player and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being created by center s scientists beth and daleth were designed to look similar to first shin megami tensei heroine and hero using colors blue and green respectively lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman as kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries player rather than being evil he designed lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve winged angel but gave him six wings instead for a total of twelve across his appearances in shin megami tensei and shin megami tensei ii several characters were based on real people aleph s mentor okamoto was named after owner of building atlus occupied during game s development matsumoto was named after ito s first landlord in tokyo and was named after an nhk reporter additionally red bear was named after evil organization from superhero film sentai some character designs were created with super famicom hardware limitations in mind kaneko designed three different poses for twelve heavenly generals which were combined in various ways with graphics for different heads and held items along with different color palettes resulting in twelve different combinations he thought this acceptable as generals were a group and were meant to look cohesive reception famitsu writers appreciated amount of freedom player has in their reviews of playstation and game boy advance versions they said that gameplay still holds up they found demon fusion system to be excellent and fun and did not think it felt outdated kurt kalata and cristopher j snelgrove of hardcore gaming 101 appreciated game s lowered difficulty compared to that of first shin megami tensei kalata and snelgrove did not think game s story started with same pizzazz as shin megami tensei they thought that amnesiac savior is a lame cliche and that idea that western religion is evil has been worn out they did however also say that shin megami tensei ii came out before these elements were overused and that they undoubtedly were fresh at time in his book game magic a designer s guide to magic systems in theory and practice jeff howard used shin megami tensei ii as an example of a video game with allusions to kabbalah with its use of hebrew letters as character names he said that this contributes to atmosphere and gives a feeling of depth or mystery famitsu appreciated game s grand and unique theme its profound dark worldview and scenario chris at square enix music online disliked game s music he called it worst in whole series and said that music pieces tend to be monotone and based on repetition of nothingness he said that slowly building ambient pieces such as title demo title and memory recovery are effective in context but that they are too simple and repetitive to be enjoyable as stand alone music he did however find pieces disco and casino both humorous and catchy kyle miller and damian thomas both writing for rpgfan were more positive to music miller found soundtrack well made but worse than that of first shin megami tensei pieces he liked most were heretic mansion and some battle themes he also liked casino which he found catchy and thought worked as an effective contrast to dread of other pieces thomas found soundtrack to be excellent and said that while several pieces are short they have solid melodies kalata and snelgrove appreciated music that is played during battles famitsu thought playstation version s graphics looked cheap notes references external links official ios and android website category 1994
