with yuna s public announcement of her intention to battle sin development thumb right comparison between graphics from original final fantasy x left and remaster right idea for a remaster originated from a reunion of games original development team and voice cast during making of final fantasy type 0 character designer tetsuya nomura associate producer hideki imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate tenth anniversary of x producer yoshinori kitase s personal motivation was to have people too young to have played games experience them as his son was only old enough to know characters of tidus and yuna from dissidia final fantasy and its prequel another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play games since they were not compatible with majority of playstation 3 models and neither available on playstation network unlike games from original playstation like final fantasy vii and ix nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of x and x 2 approved but actual development process was delayed because much of team was still busy with creation of final fantasy xiii remaster was first announced at tokyo game show 2011 where it was assumed that game would release to commemorate xs tenth anniversary bulk of remastering work was outsourced to shanghai based studio virtuos square enix s internal staff was responsible for reassembling original assets and helped with a part of redoing high definition data among returning original team members were motomu toriyama yusuke naora matsuda and masaki kobayashi who supervised production x 2 art director shintaro takai remained in same role for both remastered games chinese side of development was headed by managing director pan feng team encountered problems in porting games to playstation 3 and vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to playstation 2 hardware loss and repair of some of original assets posed another hurdle with kitase commenting that it might have been easier to recreate data from ground up playstation 3 version supports display resolutions of 720p and 1080p former with and latter without anti aliasing while vita version runs at pixels graphical features such as water effects and lighting were improved other changes include addition of bloom move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing developers revised 3d models for both games most models merely received new textures but those of playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4 3 to a 16 9 screen ratio process of which required lots of art and programming for example widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot these instances had to be corrected both prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped at top and bottom to fit new screen ratio however they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in playstation 2 version gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to standard of a high definition game which was harder than team thought sixty tracks of original final fantasy x soundtrack by nobuo uematsu masashi hamauzu and junya nakano were rearranged hamauzu and nakano took charge of most of revised music with tsutomu narita and ryo yamazaki also making select arrangements soundtrack for final fantasy x 2 by noriko matsueda and takahito eguchi was carried over from original playstation 2 version for credits of hd remaster scenario writer kazushige nojima wrote audio drama final fantasy x will as an appendix taking place two years after x 2 nojima and nomura felt that it was a good opportunity to expand upon universe of x they opted for audio drama format as team did not want to create a solid visual impression instead intending to leave it up to interpretation team wanted audio drama to be direct opposite to upbeat feel and happy ending of x 2 this wish for a more melancholy atmosphere resulted in them bringing sin main antagonistic force in x back into story as team wanted to keep it involved in a similar fashion to sephiroth main antagonist of final fantasy vii and its companion media drama s open ending was also intentional as kitase wanted to leave something up to player s imagination release final fantasy x x 2 hd remaster was released as a collection for playstation 3 and as separate releases of each game for playstation vita alongside standard playstation vita releases in japan there was a twin pack that bundled both games and a resolution box collection which additionally contained handheld console a dual release was decided against for vita versions due to limited storage capacity of cartridges play arts kai figurines of tidus and yuna were produced and original soundtracks were re released two new ultimania guide books were published for each game nojima wrote tie in novel final fantasy x 2 5 eien no daisho that bridges gap between last mission and final fantasy x will a collector s edition of playstation 3 version was exclusively released in north america via square enix s online store it contained both games an artwork book a blu ray disc for rearranged soundtrack and five artwork

uneven or losing their impact renaudin said that while soundtrack was crisper fans of original might not immediately notice acoustic alterations eternal calm last mission and will received mixed responses caires called last mission a good little distraction but called will incomprehensible sullivan didn t enjoy eternal calm or last mission while finding will incredibly weird and confusing
