adlertag eagle day hough and richards 2007 p 154 murray 1983 p 50 bungay 2000 p 203 1993 p 28 mason 1969 p 236 was first day of unternehmen adlerangriff operation eagle attack which was codename of a military operation by nazi germany s luftwaffe german air force to destroy british royal air force raf by june 1940 allies had been defeated in western europe and scandinavia rather than come to terms with germany britain rejected all overtures for a negotiated peace during battle of britain hitler gave german armed forces wehrmacht a directive directive no 16 that ordered provisional preparations for invasion of britain trevor roper 2004 pp 74 79 this operation was codenamed operation sea lion unternehmen seelowe before this could be carried out air superiority or air supremacy was required luftwaffe was to destroy raf in order to prevent it from attacking invasion fleet or providing protection for royal navy s home fleet which might attempt to prevent a landing by sea on 1 august hitler gave luftwaffes commander in chief reichsmarschall empire marshal hermann goring and oberkommando der luftwaffe high command of air force a directive directive no 17 to launch air assault essential target was raf fighter command service s destruction would deny british their air superiority asset throughout july and early august germans made preparations for adlertag date of assault was postponed several times because of bad weather eventually it was carried out on 13 august 1940 german attacks on 13 august inflicted significant damage and casualties on ground but marred by poor intelligence and communication they did not make a significant impression on fighter command s ability to defend british air space bungay 2000 p 210 goring had promised hitler that adlertag and adlerangriff would achieve results required within days or at worst weeks mackay 2003 p 71 it had meant to be beginning of end of raf fighter command but adlertag and following operations failed to destroy raf or gain necessary local air superiority bungay 2000 p 210 as a result operation sea lion was postponed indefinitely background strategic overview after declaration of war on nazi germany by britain and france in aftermath of german invasion of poland nine months of stalemate took place along western front after polish campaign in october 1939 planners of oberkommando der luftwaffe luftwaffe high command and oberkommando der wehrmacht supreme command of armed forces turned their attentions to western europe healy 2007 pp 3 5 german offensive named unternehmen gelb operation yellow and also known as manstein plan began in west on 10 may 1940 central campaign battle of france ended in allied defeat and destruction of main french army forces british expeditionary force escaped during battle of dunkirk but wehrmacht captured paris on 14 june and overran 2 3 of france french surrendered on 25 june 1940 hooton 2007 pp 47 48 p 77 p 86 with western europe neutralised okl and okw turned their attention to britain which was now home to allied base of operations in europe hitler hoped britain would negotiate for an armistice for which he was prepared to offer generous terms tentative offers made by hitler were rejected by churchill coalition government parker 2000 pp 98 99 hitler now ordered luftwaffe and kriegsmarine to prepare for an amphibious assault of britain codenamed operation sealion luftwaffe was to eliminate enemy air power and kriegsmarine was ordered to make all necessary preparations for transporting heer army across english channel luftwaffe s task came first once raf had been rendered impotent goring and hitler hoped that an invasion would be unnecessary murray 1983 p 45 if this proved not to be case luftwaffe would then support army and prevent royal navy interdicting german sea traffic hooton 1997 p 17 18 parker 2000 p 93 goring named offensive against raf as operation eagle attack adlerangriff hooton 2010 p 75 background early battles losses of spring campaign had weakened luftwaffe before battle of britain service was forced to wait until it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against raf could be made murray 1983 p 44 therefore first phase of german air offensive took place over english channel it rarely involved attacks against raf airfields inland but encouraged raf units to engage in battle by attacking british channel convoys these operations would last from 10 july 8 august 1940 james 2000 p 17 attacks against shipping were not successful only was sunk mine laying from aircraft had proved more profitable sinking james 2000 p 43 impact on fighter command was minimal it had lost 74 fighter pilots killed or missing and 48 wounded in july and its strength rose to 1 429 by 3 august by that date it was only short of 124 pilots james 2000 p 45 in second phase of attacks shipping coastal airfields radar and stations south of london were attacked during 8 18 august luftwaffe gradually increased frequency of attacks german bombers also raided targets as far north as liverpool during night hours james 2000 pp 49 62 first major raid inland and against raf airfields came on 12 august raf hawkinge lympne manston and radar stations at pevensey rye and dover were to be destroyed portsmouth docks were also targeted james 2000 pp 63 64 70 results of raids were mixed radar station at ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged but not destroyed all were in working order by following morning attacks against harbour and raf stations had failed to destroy them all were not in fully working order by end of day but were back in action following morning unknown to german intelligence lympne itself was not even an operational station this sort of intelligence blunder contributed to failure of adlertag james 2000 p 70 germans had not achieved a degree of success commensurate with their exertions nevertheless in belief they were having considerable effect on fighter command they prepared to launch their all out assault on raf following day james 2000 p 71 by 12 august german air strength had reached acceptable levels after bringing its serviceable rates up luftwaffe began adlertag with 71 percent of its bomber force 85 percent of its bf 109 units and 83 percent of its bf 110 units operational murray 1983 p 51 luftwaffe preparations intelligence thumb right 200px alt a map of great britain showing range of its radar ranges reach out into north sea english channel and over northern france radar covered indicated air space faulty intelligence was component that was mostly responsible for failure of adlertag while gap between british and germans was not yet wide in this regard british were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence breaking of enigma machine and poor luftwaffe signals discipline allowed british easy access to german communications traffic impact of ultra on battle of britain is a matter of dispute with official histories claiming there was no direct impact whatever truth ultra and y service in particular gave british an increasingly accurate picture of german order of battle deployments murray 1983 p 47 joseph schmid was commander of luftwaffe s military intelligence branch abteilung 5 as chief ic throughout this time schmid s reports made a series of errors in july 1940 schmid grossly overestimated strengths of luftwaffe and underestimated raf most serious mistakes were made concerning radar airfield identification and production sites schmid asserted that number of operational airfields in southern england were severely limited estimated that british could produce only 180 330 fighters per month true figure was 496 and that figure would decrease indicating that raf could not sustain a long battle of attrition schmid also claimed command at all levels was rigid and inflexible with fighters being tied to home bases in his list of omissions schmid failed to mention raf maintenance and organisation operations which put back damaged aircraft with rapid effect he anticipated a short battle crucially schmid failed to mention radar at all bungay 2000 pp 187 188 hooton 1994 pp 19 20 ray 2009 pp 46 47 lack of sustained and concentrated attacks on radar left it free to help direct deployment of raf units at opportune moments its continued warnings of incoming raids were a crucial benefit to fighter command luftwaffe also had poor intelligence on type of raf airfields it made repeated errors often airfields as fighter command bases which turned out to belong to raf coastal command and raf bomber command on adlertag most of targets on luftwaffes list if destroyed would not have impaired fighter command in slightest mason 1969 pp 236 237 targets and order of battle

implemented by dowding himself use of radio direction finding rdf or radar was at his behest and its use supplemented by information by royal observer corps roc was crucial to raf s ability to efficiently intercept incoming enemy aircraft technology was named rdf with misleading intent vague description would disguise full nature of system to enemy if its existence ever became known hough and richards 2007 p 51 parker 2000 p 117 first indications of incoming air raids were received by chain home radio direction finding rdf facilities which were located along coastlines of britain in most circumstances rdf could pick up formations of luftwaffe aircraft as they organised over their own airfields in northern france and belgium once raiding aircraft moved inland formations were also plotted by roc information from rdf and observer corps were sent through to main operations room of fighter command headquarters at raf bentley priory plots were assessed to determine whether they were hostile or friendly if hostile information was sent to main operations room which was in a large underground bunker bungay 2000 pp 61 69 plotting raids here course information of each raid was plotted by women s auxiliary air force waaf who received information by telephone parker 2000 p 123 additional intelligence was provided by y service radio posts which monitored enemy radio

large table which had a map of britain overlaid and squared off with a british modified grid as plots of raiding aircraft moved counters were pushed across map by magnetic rakes this system enabled

onward even though bf 110s turned back return leg would take kg 2 across no 11 group s territory which could have been disastrous without fighter escort but owing to observer corps misjudging direction of bombers owing to low lying cloud collier 1980 p 51 and radar not picking up direction of german bombers waaf plotted course of raid incorrectly and raf failed to prevent target being

had maintained attacks on airfields in south eastern england which they had started previous day on 12 august most of kentish airfields had been attacked and on 13 august germans concentrated on second line airfields south of london concentration on detling and eastchurch was a failure as both were coastal command stations and bore no relation to fighter command germans may have reasoned that if bases such as manston hawkinge and lympne were neutralised through attacks on 12 august then fighter command may have had to move onto these airfields in fact bombing of 12 august had failed to knock out these strips and adlertag had failed to destroy or render detling or eastchurch nonoperational james 2000 p 79 owing to poor intelligence weather conditions and raf resistance attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful overclaiming overclaiming in aerial warfare is not uncommon during battle of britain and indeed rest of second world war both sides claimed to have shot down and destroyed more enemy aircraft on ground and in air than they had in reality raf fighter command claimed 78 german aircraft shot down on 13 august 1940 bungay 2000 p 211 another source states that official raf claims amounted to 64 bishop 2010 p 179 actual german losses amounted to 2000 p 371 48 aircraft destroyed and 39 severely damaged conversely luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 70 hawker hurricanes and spitfires in air and a further 18 blenheim bombers in air alone this was an exaggeration of about 300 percent addison and crang 2000 p 58 terraine 1985 p 186 another 84 raf fighters were claimed on ground bungay 2000 p 210 actual raf losses in air amounted to 13 fighters and 11 bombers with 47 aircraft of various kinds on ground bungay 2000 p 211 battle of britain failure of adlertag did not deter luftwaffe from continuing its campaign assault against raf airfields continued throughout august and into september 1940 battles involved large numbers of aircraft and heavy losses on both sides luftwaffe failed to develop any focused strategy for defeating raf fighter command at first it attempted to destroy raf bases then switched to strategic bombing by day and night it tried to achieve destruction of several british industries at same time switching from bombing aircraft factories to attacking supporting industries import or distribution networks such as coastal ports an attempt was even made against unrelated targets such as destroying morale of british population murray 1983 p 54 failure of luftwaffe to identify radar chain and distinguish raf fighter bases from those of other raf commands undermined its ability to destroy british fighter defences luftwaffe underestimated british radar and they had not realised its importance in british operational system parker 2000 p 311 bungay 2000 pp 68 69 to contrary okl believed that radar stations would benefit german effort by sending raf forces into large scale air battles for luftwaffe to
