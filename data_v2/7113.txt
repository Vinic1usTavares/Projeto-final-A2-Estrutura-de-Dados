effective than others robert canning of ign wrote that main portion of this episode was quite funny even if ending lacked bite similarly margaret lyons of entertainment weekly found that episode was another strong showing for 30 rock although jenna s plotline was pretty tired tv squad s bob sassone was similarly positive about bubble calling it another good episode james poniewozik of time also responded favorably to episode with exception of jenna storyline writing that it was first one in a long time that i enjoyed almost completely without reservation jenna s subplot was off but it was barely a blip television columnist alan sepinwall for star ledger disliked bubble concept reporting t he idea that attractive people get away with things that more average looking can t is an old joke even on 30 rock with cerie but nonetheless enjoyed variations of joke saying they were well conceived sepinwall concluded this was one of funniest 30 rock s of season zap2it s rick porter was also favorable to bubble in his recap opining that 30 rock gave us a very well done episode as with lyons and poniewozik porter felt jenna s story didn t really click but liked scene with jenna and her stylist team firing off words to describe jenna s beauty as scathingly funny a v club s nathan rabin enjoyed hamm s role as drew reporting that his character initially seemed too good to be true but show gradually revealed him to be imperfect and even fucked up enough to be plausible hamm subplot was very funny and well executed sepinwall also praised hamm writing finally it took three episodes but tina fey who wrote this one let jon hamm be funny on his way out door not all reviews were positive matt mitovich of tv guide wrote i must be honest this a story was ridiculous and not in hysterical way when i first read about drew getting by on his good looks i thought we d witness occasional favoritism but horrid doctor skills and flailing at very public sport of tennis and his obliviousness to it all hamm got a turkey of an exit story sorry references external links category 2009 american television episodes category 30 rock season 3 episodes category television episodes
