sajmiste concentration camp was a nazi concentration and extermination camp during world war ii it was located at former belgrade fairground site near town of zemun in independent state of croatia ndh camp was organized and operated by ss einsatzgruppen units stationed in occupied serbia it became operational in september 1941 and was officially opened on 28 october of that year germans dubbed it jewish camp in zemun at end of 1941 and beginning of 1942 thousands of jewish women children and old men were brought to camp along with 500 jewish men and 292 romani women and children most of whom were from nis smederevo and sabac women and children were placed in makeshift barracks and suffered during numerous influenza epidemics kept in squalid conditions they were provided with inadequate amounts of food and many froze to death during winter of 1941 42 between march and may 1942 germans used a gas van sent from berlin to kill thousands of jewish inmates with gassings complete it was renamed zemun concentration camp and served to hold one last group of jews who were arrested upon surrender of italy in september 1943 during this time it also held captured yugoslav partisans chetniks sympathizers of greek and albanian resistance movements and serb peasants from villages in other parts of ndh an estimated 32 000 prisoners mostly serbs passed through camp during this period 10 600 of whom were killed or died due to hunger and disease conditions in sajmiste were so poor that some began comparing it to jasenovac and other large concentration camps throughout europe in 1943 and 1944 evidence of atrocities committed in camp was destroyed by units of ss standartenfuhrer paul blobel and thousands of corpses were exhumed from mass graves and incinerated in may 1944 germans transferred control of camp over to ndh and it was closed that july estimates of number of deaths at sajmiste range from 20 000 to 23 000 with number of jewish deaths estimated at 7 000 to 10 000 it is thought that half of all serbian jews perished at camp most of germans responsible for operation of camp were captured and brought to trial several were extradited to yugoslavia and executed camp commander herbert andorfer and his deputy edgar enge were arrested in 1960s after many years of hiding both were given short prison sentences in west germany and austria respectively though enge never served any time given his old age and poor health background thumb left belgrade fair before world war ii site that became sajmiste concentration camp during world war ii had originally been an exhibition centre built by belgrade municipality in 1937 in an attempt to attract international commerce to city centre s modernist pavilions featured elaborate displays of industrial progress and design from european countries including germany its architectural centerpiece was a large tower which was used by philips to transmit earliest television broadcasts in europe much of centre stood empty and unused until axis invasion of yugoslavia in april 1941 country was dismembered following invasion with serbia being reduced to serbia proper northern part of kosovo around kosovska mitrovica and banat which was occupied by germans and placed under administration of a german military government milan nedic a pre war politician who was known to have pro axis leanings was then selected by germans to lead collaborationist government of national salvation in territory of military commander in serbia civilian administration in country was headed by ss gruppenfuhrer harald turner who commanded einsatzgruppen originally led by ss standartenfuhrer wilhelm fuchs and later by ss gruppenfuhrer august meyszner with ss standartenfuhrer emanuel schafer as his deputy group was responsible for ensuring internal security fighting opponents of occupation and dealing with jews thumb a map showing axis occupation of yugoslavia from 1941 43 alt map showing partition of yugoslavia 1941 43 meanwhile extreme croat nationalist and fascist ante pavelic who had been in exile in benito mussolini s italy was appointed poglavnik leader of an ustase led croatian state independent state of croatia often called ndh from ndh combined almost all of modern day croatia all of modern day bosnia and herzegovina and parts of modern day serbia into an italian german quasi protectorate ndh authorities led by ustase militia subsequently implemented genocidal policies against serb jewish and romani populations living within borders of new state zemun town where sajmiste fairgrounds were located was ceded to ndh occupation of zemun during which non croats such as serbs jews and roma were relentlessly persecuted by ustase would last until late 1944 by this point more than 25 percent of zemun s pre war population of 65 000 had perished a large scale uprising erupted in serbia following axis invasion of soviet union in june 1941 although they took no part in rebellion jews were targeted for retaliatory execution by germans germans soon implemented a number of anti jewish laws and by end of august 1941 all serbian jewish males were interned in concentration camps primarily at in belgrade history establishment thumb right jews were rounded up by germans after axis invasion of yugoslavia in fall of 1941 turner ordered that all jewish women and children in serbia be concentrated in a camp at first germans considered creating a ghetto for jews in gypsy quarter of belgrade but this idea was quickly dismissed due to area being considered too filthy and when several other plans to intern jewish and romani populations of belgrade failed a concentration camp was established on a peninsula surrounded on three sides by sava river and located in full view of belgrade s central terazije square camp was positioned in a manner which made escape almost impossible it was located near administrative and police centres as well as belgrade central railway station which allowed for efficient transport of jews to camp from many towns in region its purpose was to detain jewish women and children that germans claimed endangered public safety and wehrmacht germans dubbed sajmiste jewish camp in zemun camp was intended to hold as many as 500 000 people captured from rebels areas across occupied yugoslavia name semlin was derived from german word for former austro hungarian frontier town of zemun where camp was located despite being located on territory of ndh it was controlled by german military police apparatus in occupied serbia ndh authorities did not object to its establishment and told germans that it could be located on ndh territory as long as its guards were german rather than serb soon after camp was established ss scharfuhrer edgar enge of belgrade gestapo became its commander initially campgrounds held about 500 male jewish inmates who were given task of running camp s so called self administration and were made responsible for distributing food dividing up labour and organizing a jewish guard force which patrolled along camp exterior of camp however was guarded on a rotation basis by twenty five members of reserve police battalion 64 by october all male jewish inmates and most male romani inmates were killed most were executed in four major waves with frequent killings occurring in mid september and between 9 and 11 october on each occasion inmates were told that they were being transported to a camp in austria with better labour conditions but were instead taken to in banat or to a firing range on outskirts of belgrade where they were killed sajmiste officially opened on a wider scale on 28 october 1941 last of initial male jewish inmates were killed on 11 november judenlager semlin thumb left a gas van similar to one used in sajmiste at end of 1941 and beginning of 1942 approximately 7 000 jewish women children and old men were brought to camp along with a further 500 jewish men and 292 romani women and children most of these people were from outlying serbian towns primarily nis smederevo and sabac women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated and whose windows were shattered due to german bombing raids carried out during invasion of yugoslavia originally constructed as fair pavilions largest of these barracks held up to 5 000 prisoners inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics slept on wet straw or bare floorboards and were provided with inadequate amounts of food starvation was widespread and jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to serbian authorities for more food to be provided to camp consequently a high number of detainees especially children died in late 1941 and early 1942 with many inmates freezing to death in one of coldest winters on record romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their jewish counterparts they also slept on straw in an unheated hall but were kept separate from non romani prisoners majority of romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention most jewish inmates remained detained with exception of ten jewish women who were married to christian men in january 1942 ss untersturmfuhrer herbert andorfer was appointed to replace inexperienced enge as commander of camp enge was subsequently made andorfer s deputy that month german military authorities demanded camp be cleared of jews in order to accommodate growing number of captives taken in battles with partisans by february camp held about 6 500 inmates ten percent of whom were romani in early march andorfer was informed that a gas van had been sent to camp from berlin sauer van had been delivered upon request of german military administration chief in serbia harald turner stricken with guilt over having to play a central role in murder of jewish inmates some of whom he had developed good relations with andorfer requested a transfer this was denied in order to ensure quickness and efficiency of gassings he made announcements intended to convince prisoners that they were going to be transferred to another better equipped camp he went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them many detainees registered for supposed transfer hoping to escape camp s terrible living conditions inmates who had volunteered to leave previous evening climbed into van next day in groups of between 50 and 80 drivers of van ss meier and gotz distributed candy to children in order to win their affection afterwards doors of van were sealed shut van then followed a small car driven by andorfer and enge before crossing border into german occupied serbia it was here that one of drivers exited van and crawled underneath it diverting its exhaust into interior of vehicle and killing inmates with carbon monoxide gas van was then taken to avala firing range where corpses were dumped into mass graves freshly dug by serbian and romani prisoners such gassings became routine and gas van arrived every day except sunday rumours quickly circulated about gassings with news reaching german troops stationed in belgrade and even some serbians consequently gas van was nicknamed soul killer by serb population exposed to these rumours it is thought that gassings took lives of as many as 8 000 inmates mostly women and children seven serbian prisoners that had participated in unloading murdered inmates from van were shot after gassings stopped but gravedigger a serb named vladimir milutinovic survived eighty one or eighty two trenches were prepared and i helped dig all of them he recalled at least 100 people fit into each trench these ones were only for those suffocated in truck we dug a different set for those who were shot few inmates remained in camp after gassings stopped mostly non jewish women who had been married to jews they were released several days later after being sworn to secrecy apart from sajmiste inmates 500 patients and staff of belgrade jewish hospital as well as jewish prisoners from nearby banjica concentration camp were also killed in gas van last jewish prisoner in sajmiste was killed on 8 may 1942 and gas van used at camp was returned to berlin on 9 june 1942 it received a technical upgrade there and was then transferred to belarus where it was used to gas jews in minsk shortly after leading extermination of jewish inmates in sajmiste andorfer and enge were assigned different security police roles andorfer later received an iron cross 2nd class for running camp and won a promotion semlin with extermination of original jewish inmates completed camp was renamed zemun concentration camp and served to hold one last group of jews who were arrested upon surrender of italy in september 1943 it also held captured yugoslav partisans chetniks sympathizers of greek and albanian resistance movements and serb peasants from villages in croatian ustase controlled regions of and kozara where they had been detained in jasenovac concentration camp conditions deteriorated to such an extent that some began comparing it to jasenovac and other large concentration camps throughout europe camp became main transit point for yugoslav prisoners and detainees on their way to labour locations and concentration camps in germany an estimated 32 000 mostly serb prisoners passed through sajmiste during this period 10 600 of whom were killed or died due to hunger and disease alarmed by fact that campgrounds could easily be seen from across sava in late 1943 new german ambassador to serbia proposed that camp be moved deeper into ndh territory because its continuing existence before eyes of people of belgrade was politically intolerable for reasons of public feeling his requests were ignored by german authorities by end of 1943 germans made an effort to erase all traces of atrocities committed in camp by burning records incinerating corpses and destroying other pieces of evidence this task was undertaken by ss standartenfuhrer paul blobel who arrived in belgrade in november 1943 upon arrival he ordered head of local gestapo ss sturmbannfuhrer bruno sattler to form a special detachment that was to be responsible for exhumation and burning of bodies detachment was led by lieutenant erich grunwald and composed of ten security policemen and 48 military policemen digging battalions were composed of 100 serbian and jewish prisoners exhumations occurred from december 1943 to april 1944 and thousands of bodies were burned all prisoners that were present during exhumations were shot except for three serbs who managed to escape allied aircraft bombed sajmiste on 17 april 1944 killing about 100 inmates and inflicting heavy damage to camp itself on 17 may 1944 germans transferred control of camp over to ndh it was closed that july aftermath and legacy thumb right a monument commemorating victims of camp after war yugoslavia s new communist government announced that 100 000 people had passed through sajmiste between 1941 and 1944 half of whom were killed yugoslav state war crimes commission later estimated that as many as 40 000 may have been killed in camp including 7 000 jews according to helsinki committee for human rights in serbia death toll was exaggerated by communists for political purposes and real number of inmates was about 50 000 with 20 000 killed it is estimated that half of all serbian jews perished in camp staro sajmiste memorial cites 23 000 fatalities of which 10 000 were jewish most of those responsible for camp s operation were captured and brought to trial following war many prominent german officials including turner fuchs and meyszner were extradited to yugoslavia by allies and subsequently executed andorfer escaped to venezuela with assistance of roman catholic church he returned to austria in 1960s and was subsequently apprehended and tried on minor charge of being an accessory to murder for which he was sentenced to 2 1 2 years imprisonment andorfer s deputy enge was apprehended in 1960s and sentenced to 1 1 2 years imprisonment he avoided serving his sentence due to his old age and poor health guards suspected of executing prisoners were never tried though they served as eyewitnesses in several trials in west germany sajmiste stood abandoned until 1948 when it was transformed into a youth workers headquarters during construction of new belgrade memorial belgrade jews murdered during holocaust including those at sajmiste were not commemorated by yugoslavia s post war communist government until 30 years after war ended old sajmiste fairgrounds are marked by small plaques and a monument to commemorate those detained or killed in camp plaques were dedicated in 1974 and 1984 respectively in 1987 sajmiste fairgrounds were granted cultural landmark status by government of yugoslavia a monument high and created by artist miodrag popovic was erected on banks of sava on 22 april 1995 marking 50 years of victory over nazism and serbian holocaust remembrance day no memorial centres or museums have ever been built on former campgrounds campgrounds are now used to house low income residents in february 1992 as provided by detailed urban plan neighborhood was to be fully reconstructed to its pre war look an idea opposed by some architects with added memorial and commemorative objects entire complex was to be transformed into one large memorial but it all remained on paper idea was constantly present gaining media and political momentum in 2010s but as of 2018 nothing has been actually done in november 2018 it was announced that a monument to humanitarian diana budisavljevic will be placed along quay next to already existing memorial budisavljevic saved 15 000 children 12 000 of which survived from perishing in concentration camps in independent state of croatia operated by ustase regime during world war ii city decided to erect a monument in her memory already in october 2015 but only now set location monument was to be finished and dedicated in second half of 2019 no work has been done regarding this project and in november 2019 city announced monument to budisavljevic will be erected across sava in old section of city controversies croatian author knezevic caused considerable controversy in may 1993 when he suggested that serbs not germans had been responsible for running camp this claim was vehemently denied by jewish historians and belgrade s jewish community neglected and desolate complex housed in time some prominent artists painters and sculptors as former fair buildings were awarded to them as their ateliers also some other facilities moved in over time like kafanas and gyms but major public controversy arose in april 2019 when it was announced that a privately owned kindergarten will be open in one of buildings investor milorad purchased building simic pavilion in 1998 but court later voided contract which didn t prevent him from using venue as a disco club gallery restaurant and gym since then a fierce public debate ensued including city administration asking for state government to re think about permit government claiming that there is no legal cause to stop it jewish and parents organizations which are against it and investor who blames state of trying to rob him debate also pointed again to 75 years long inability of state to arrange complex properly philosophical assessment ljiljana blagojevic professor and architect said that staro sajmiste is town of collective with also dreamed of final solution jovana also and architect said that staro sajmiste is unique phenomenon in world as no other localities merged symbols of prosperity and downfall in such a unique and tragic way she identified locality with pierre nora s term lieux de memoire a place where memory persists even though locality changed its appearance and stopped being a de memoire real environment of a memory writer david wrote it s a place that doesn t simply humiliate by its inhumanity but also by its complete exposing to belgrade which silently watched it from across river notes bibliography journals external links semlin judenlager in serbian public
