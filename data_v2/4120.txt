episode of glee not just this season but in history of series while ausiello praised episode as a standout hour tim stack of entertainment weekly also viewed episode in advance and was similarly impressed he wrote that it was one of series best episodes ever a number of critics who viewed episode when it aired were equally taken with asian f atlantic kevin fallon called it glee best ever while others including erica futterman of rolling stone and abby west of entertainment weekly said it was best one of new third season vanity fair brett berk wrote this week s episode stands out as one of most cohesive and well acted in series s pantheon though he wondered what had happened to show s humorous side something also noted by futterman who found it to be a significant problem glee s own identity crisis of not knowing whether or not it s a sitcom has made it hard to get deeply invested in its characters amy reiter of los angeles times wrote that producers hit every note emotional musical character plot as squarely as rachel berry auditioning for a coveted role and episode had emotional truth character growth new revelations and really good musical numbers kind that seem to emerge organically from plot and deepen and advance it aoltv crystal bell said episode delivered on setup in previous i am unicorn outing and said it definitely seems to echo glory days of first season tv guide later included asian f in its list of 2011 s top tv episodes others were not as impressed although he praised fantastic performances by harry shum as mike chang and jayma mays as emma anthony benigno of faster times criticized hackneyed storytelling that moves nobody forward and ign robert canning noted that show s inconsistent character development was on display though he gave episode his best grade so far in season a great 8 out of 10 samantha urban of dallas morning news likened asian f to a half hearted meal while she said subplots featuring mike and emma worked really well main storyline featuring mercedes was offensive in how lazily it was executed mercedes storyline was met with widely divergent reactions though her musical numbers were generally given high marks in addition to urban many reviewers were unhappy with return of rachel versus mercedes rivalry including bell who lamented that it had been done every season nearly as many expressed hope that mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in first booty camp scene including vicki hyman of star ledger buddytv john kubicek and west benigno felt mercedes was acting wildly out of character in episode michael slezak of tvline was also puzzled at her change and asked when has mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and new directions mvp seriously nobody s going to cut her slack for a bad week canning agreed and wrote schue s tough love with mercedes came out of left field and felt it added to inconsistency of these characters even though it ultimately made sense in context of setup for it s all over time james poniewozik wrote that having story turn on her resentment at being overlooked by glee club is an apt meta touch since she s been overlooked by show for some time now emily vanderwerff of a v club was most enthusiastic about her storyline and called it best part of episode it was all about how she now feels appreciated because she has a boyfriend sigh and so she s willing to take on rachel for role of maria and actually beat her and push for what she feels is rightfully hers which involves more respect from new directions mike chang s first major storyline was most widely praised of episode west said shum really showed his acting chops and urban thought plot worked well though she heaped scorn on notion that any college would consider glee club a detriment in an application mike s cool performance was very well received berk called it a spectacular audition and bell said it was one of highlights of episode she also noted that episode really solidified mike and tina s relationship though she also pointed out that tina was most neglected member of entire cast mike s scenes in dance studio were even more highly praised than cool first when mike dances alone and imagines tina and his dad in room with him was described as really beautiful by benigno fallon characterized it as a standout scene performer dances out his life frustrations pirouetting as catharsis until he realizes that only place he feels happy is on stage it s a trademark glee moment hyman agreed and wrote when he ducked into studio and started dancing by himself without music it reminded me of how special a show glee can be lesley goldberg of hollywood reporter lauded subsequent scene in studio with his mother as most touching part of storyline and more than one reviewer admitted shedding tears including reiter poniewozik stated that will and emma storyline again shows how glee handles adults much worse than teens and added there s no reason this couldn t have been a rewarding plot hyman called it a bizarre subplot and berk stated that patent absurdity of ginger eugenics of emma s parents felt out of whack tonally with rest of episode vanderwerff felt that story failed to work despite featuring don most and valerie mahaffey doing their very best canning thought most s role as emma s racist ginger supremacist father was perhaps greatest bit of casting i ve seen on television all year urban thought subplot worked really well though she added that there were missteps brittany s campaign rally flash mob complete with her performance of run world girls was a huge favorite poniewozik called it an excellent brittany dance showcase hyman was critical of ridiculousness of rachel s run for senior class president a development urban said made absolutely zero sense vanderwerff lauded montage of kids finding out who was cast in west side story and said it might be best thing show has ever done amy lee of huffington post wrote football team is dancing again this can only be good urban mentioned that seeing cool performed by football players made her realize that we haven t seen karofsky this season benigno was more direct where hell is karofsky music and performances thumb left upright heather morris pictured as brittany gives a standout performance of run world girls in this episode episode s musical performances were generally well received though a few reviewers including benigno chafed at continued emphasis on broadway both of major dance numbers came in for considerable praise and run world girls garnered most superlatives fallon wrote brittany s performance of run world girls was thrilling it was most adrenaline pumping musical number series has produced intricately choreographed expertly shot and edited perfectly woven into story and performed exquisitely by heather morris vanderwerff enjoyed ginormous production number built around it quite a bit and wall street journal raymund flandez called it a stellar performance kubicek stated this was unbelievably superb easily my favorite performance of entire season futterman noted that brittany s vocals are nowhere near power of beyonce s but they re just fine for this performance real focus of which is dancing mercedes featured in three of episode s musical numbers flandez said of her solo she blew jennifer hudson s spotlight out of this world benigno wrote that it was great but added that it was not much of a stretch for amber riley to hit this one berk praised her amazing voice and gave performance four stars out of five and goldberg characterized rendition as flawless other reviewers were more critical including vanderwerff who said that this was only song in episode that really didn t work slezak felt that arrangement used was not distinct enough from original though he gave performance a b as did west who wrote mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking in her maria off with rachel benigno said they both kill it characterized it as easy but fun and gave it an a as did slezak and west latter of whom didn t feel that mercedes was clear winner but thought both singers were fantastic kubicek thought that mercedes clearly won and flandez maintained that she clearly outshone her rival and continued you just believe so much of what she sings berk agreed and contrasted two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars two stars for rachel who sang this like barry manilow four for mercedes who sang this like she lived it futterman had a slightly different take rachel puts on a diva front but inside she s scared and nervous while mercedes is just a diva however hyman thought that two were evenly matched while canning and billboard rae votta both thought rachel was victor votta stated while show wants us to believe otherwise rachel clearly mercedes it s all over from dreamgirls received most enthusiastic commentary including an a from west who wrote mercedes was at her best in this performance a sentiment echoed by benigno when he awarded song an a hyman called it pretty awesome and flandez a cleverly amusing take while futterman said mercedes fully embraces her inner effie white and that song was on par with best of glee s broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements she also praised first group showtune new directions have done and added we want more votta characterized it as a flawless fantasy homage and stated it s perfect use of non realism of glee and power of musical theater to express a storyline kubicek agreed it was like a real musical in these regards and praised mike s short solo and west liked segment where santana confronts mercedes in number slezak was not enthusiastic about rendition and wrote that he wished that scene gelled better than it did and questioned why mercedes was character effie while all other members of new directions were themselves he gave number a c votta wrote of cool that for mike chang s first solo it s impressive and added maybe he should play tony instead of blaine slezak also thought he should have been considered for tony since it was performed with such verve and swagger and charisma even so he conceded that mike and shum was not strongest singer an assessment echoed in decent singer characterizations from hyman and kubicek and former called performance a fine job while latter wrote that mike chang is total package flandez said mike s singing wasn t so terrible but while lee said his is not by any means a wonderful voice she also said he still pirouettes with kind of easy grace that makes each move a joy to watch futterman wrote he s got smooth dance moves down but most impressively his slick vocals are on point hitting nice rises and falls at certain moments but mostly staying real cool as song calls for and berk gave performance five of five stars fix you received least warm reception of songs in episode benigno criticized it for being exactly like original though he gave it a b and noted that last bit is kind of chillingly good in matthew morrison s hands flandez felt that show s version pales in imitation to original futterman thought it was thematically appropriate but not schuester s finest singing moment and lee stated that song does not fit morrison s range comfortably kevin p sullivan of mtv called it a surprisingly tragic and moving rendition but kubicek characterized it as an emotionally manipulative song and west did not like implied condescension of will singing song to emma and gave it a b though she thought morrison sounded good and it was a good way to close out show in december 2012 tv guide listed rendition as one of glee worst performances chart history two of six cover versions released as singles debuted on billboard hot 100 fix you debuted at number fifty three and run world girls at number ninety one peak chart positions for season 3 singles in united states fix you and run world girls fix you debuted at number seventy six on billboard canadian hot 100 and was one song from episode to appear on that chart both fix you and run world girls
