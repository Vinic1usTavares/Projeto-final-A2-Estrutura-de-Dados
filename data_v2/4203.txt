marbury v madison 5 u s 1 cranch 137 1803 was a u s supreme court case that established principle of judicial review in united states meaning that american courts have power to strike down laws statutes and some government actions that violate constitution of united states decided in 1803 marbury remains single most important decision in american constitutional law court s landmark decision established that u s constitution is actual law not just a statement of political principles and ideals and helped define boundary between constitutionally separate executive and judicial branches of american form of government case originated from an incident that occurred as part of political and ideological rivalry between outgoing president john adams who espoused pro business and pro national government ideals of alexander hamilton and federalist party and incoming president thomas jefferson who favored agriculture and decentralization and led democratic republican party adams had lost u s presidential election of 1800 to jefferson and in march 1801 just two days before his term as president ended adams appointed several dozen federalist party supporters to new circuit judge and justice of peace positions in an attempt to frustrate jefferson and his supporters in democratic republican party u s senate quickly confirmed adams s appointments but upon adams departure and jefferson s inauguration a few of new judges commissions still had not been delivered jefferson believed commissions were void because they had not been delivered in time and instructed his new secretary of state james madison not to deliver them one of men whose commissions had not been delivered in time was william marbury a maryland businessman who had been a strong supporter of adams and federalists in late 1801 after madison had repeatedly refused to deliver his commission marbury filed a lawsuit in supreme court asking court to issue a writ of mandamus forcing madison to deliver his commission in an opinion written by chief justice john marshall court held firstly that madison s refusal to deliver marbury s commission was illegal and secondly that it was normally proper for a court in such situations to order government official in question to deliver commission however in marbury s case court did not order madison to comply examining law congress had passed that gave supreme court jurisdiction over types of cases like marbury s marshall found that it had expanded definition of supreme court s jurisdiction beyond what was originally set down in u s constitution marshall then struck down law announcing that american courts have power to invalidate laws that they find to violate constitution because this meant court had no jurisdiction over case it could not issue writ that marbury had requested background in fiercely contested u s presidential election of 1800 three major candidates were thomas jefferson aaron burr and incumbent president john adams adams was aligned with pro business and pro national government politics of alexander hamilton and federalist party while jefferson and burr were part of opposing democratic republican party which favored agriculture and decentralization american public opinion had gradually turned against federalists in months prior to election mainly due to their use of controversial alien and sedition acts as well as growing tensions with great britain with whom federalists favored close ties jefferson easily won popular vote but only narrowly defeated adams in electoral college as results of election became clear in early 1801 adams and federalists became determined to exercise their influence in weeks remaining before jefferson took office and did all they could to fill federal offices with anti jeffersonians who were loyal to federalists on march 2 1801 just two days before his presidential term ended adams nominated nearly 60 federalist supporters to circuit judge and justice of peace positions federalist controlled congress had newly created with judiciary act of 1801 these last minute jefferson s supporters derisively referred to as midnight judges included william marbury a prosperous businessman from maryland an ardent federalist marbury was active in maryland politics and had been a vigorous supporter of adams presidency following day march 3 senate approved adams s nominations en masse appointees commissions were immediately written out then signed by adams and sealed by his secretary of state john marshall who had been named new chief justice of supreme court in january but continued also serving as secretary of state for remainder of adams s term marshall then dispatched his younger brother james markham marshall to deliver commissions to appointees with only one day left before jefferson s inauguration james marshall was able to deliver most of commissions but a marbury not delivered day after march 4 1801 thomas jefferson was sworn in and became third president of united states as soon as he was able jefferson instructed his new secretary of state james madison to withhold undelivered appointments in jefferson s opinion commissions were void because they had not been delivered in time without commissions appointees were unable to assume offices and duties to which they had been appointed over next several months madison continually refused to deliver marbury s commission to him finally in december 1801 marbury filed suit against madison in u s supreme court asking court to issue a writ of mandamus forcing madison to deliver his commission this lawsuit resulted in case of marbury v madison decision thumb an engraving of chief justice john marshall made by charles balthazar julien de saint memin in 1808 on february 24 1803 court rendered a unanimous 4 0 decision against marbury court s decision was delayed by one year because in retaliation for adams appointment of midnight judges jefferson and new democratic republican congressmen successfully passed a bill that canceled supreme court s 1802 term and so all pending marbury v not decided until 1803 court s opinion was written by chief justice john marshall marshall structured court s opinion around a series of three questions that marshall answered in turn first did marbury have a right to his commission second if marbury had a right to his commission was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it third if there was such a remedy could supreme court legally issue it marbury s commission court quickly answered first two questions affirmatively first marshall wrote that marbury had a right to his commission because all appropriate procedures were followed commission had been properly signed and sealed madison contended that commissions were void if not delivered but court disagreed and said that delivery of commission was merely a custom not an essential element of commission itself because marbury s commission was valid marshall wrote madison s withholding of it was violative of a vested legal right on marbury s part marbury s legal remedy turning to second question court said that laws clearly afforded marbury a remedy marshall wrote that it is a general and indisputable rule that where there is a legal right there is also a legal remedy by suit or action at law whenever that right is invaded a rule derived from traditional roman legal maxim ubi jus ibi where there is a legal right there is also a legal remedy which was well established in early anglo american common law in what american legal scholar akhil amar has called one of most important and inspiring passages of opinion marshall wrote very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in right of every individual to claim protection of laws whenever he receives an injury marshall then confirmed that a writ of type of court order that commands a government official to perform an act he or she is legally required to proper remedy for marbury s situation specific issue however was whether a court which was part of judicial branch of government could give marbury a remedy against madison who as secretary of state was part of executive branch of government court held that so long as remedy involved a mandatory duty to a specific person and not a political matter left to discretion courts could provide legal remedy in a now well known line of opinion that borrows a phrase john adams had drafted in 1779 for massachusetts state constitution marshall wrote government of united states has been emphatically termed a government of laws and not of men quoting marbury 5 u s at 163 supreme court jurisdiction thumb right upright 1 25 u s capitol home of u s congress and also where u s supreme court convened from 1801 until opening of supreme court building in 1935 u s senate commission on art office of senate curator old supreme court chamber 1810 1860 s pub 113 3 this brought marshall to most important issue of opinion propriety of supreme court s jurisdiction over matter which would determine whether or not court had power to issue writ marbury requested this issue depended entirely on how court interpreted text of a law congress had passed that dealt with supreme court s original and appellate jurisdictions as marshall explains in opinion under a court has power to be first to hear and decide a case under a party to an instituted decision appeals to a higher court which has power to revise and correct previous decision congress had passed judiciary act of 1789 to establish american federal court system since article iii of u s constitution only specifies that there is to be a supreme court and leaves rest of federal judicial power to reside in such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish quoting u s constitution article iii section 1 judiciary act contained a section that defines areas in which supreme court has original jurisdiction and areas in which it has appellate jurisdiction marbury had argued that this section gave supreme court authority to issue writs of mandamus when hearing cases under original jurisdiction not just appellate jurisdiction although language on power to issue writs of mandamus appears with sentence on appellate jurisdiction rather than with earlier sentences on original jurisdiction a semicolon separates it from specific clause on appellate jurisdiction section itself does not make clear whether mandamus clause was intended to be read as part of appellate sentence or on its opinion marshall quoted only end of law s wording can plausibly be read either way in end marshall agreed with marbury and interpreted section 13 of judiciary act to authorize mandamus on original jurisdiction however marshall then noted that this authorization clashed with article iii of constitution which establishes judicial branch of u s government section 2 of article iii defines nature of supreme court s original and appellate jurisdiction this section says that supreme court only has original jurisdiction over cases where a u s state is a party to a lawsuit or where a lawsuit involves foreign dignitaries neither of these categories covered marbury s justice of peace commission and so according to constitution court could only have heard marbury s case while exercising appellate jurisdiction however marshall had interpreted judiciary act to have given court original jurisdiction over matter this meant that judicial act apparently took initial scope of supreme court s original was limited to cases either directly involving states or involving foreign expanded it to include issuing writs of mandamus marshall ruled that congress cannot increase supreme court s original jurisdiction as it was set down in constitution and therefore that relevant portion of section 13 of judiciary act violated article iii of constitution judicial review and striking down law thumb upright 1 6 inscription on wall of supreme court building from marbury v madison in which chief justice john marshall outlined concept of judicial review after ruling that it conflicted with constitution marshall struck down relevant portion of judiciary act in u s supreme court s first ever declaration of power of judicial review marshall ruled that american federal courts have power to refuse to give any effect to congressional legislation that is inconsistent with their interpretation of move known as striking down laws u s constitution does not explicitly give american judiciary power of judicial review nevertheless marshall s opinion gives a number of reasons in support of judiciary s possession of power first marshall reasoned that written nature of constitution inherently established judicial review in a line borrowed from alexander hamilton s essay federalist no 78 marshall wrote powers of legislature are defined and limited and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten constitution is written quoting marbury 5 u s at 176 he continued next marshall stated that deciding constitutionality of laws it applies is an inherent part of american judiciary s role in what has become most famous and frequently quoted line of opinion marshall wrote marshall reasoned that constitution places limits on american government s powers and that those limits would be meaningless unless they were subject to judicial review and enforcement he reasoned that constitution s provisions limiting congress s as export tax clause or prohibitions on bills of attainder and ex post facto that in some cases judges would be forced to choose between enforcing constitution or following congress in his opinion dilemma was not difficult question whether an act repugnant to constitution can become law of land is a question deeply interesting to united states but happily not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest marbury 5 u s at 176 quoted in he held virtually as a matter of iron logic that in event of conflict between constitution and statutory laws passed by congress constitutional law must be supreme again borrowing from federalist no 78 marshall stated third marshall stated that denying supremacy of constitution over congress s acts would mean that courts must close their eyes on constitution and see only law quoting marbury 5 u s at 178 he reasoned that this in turn would make congress omnipotent since none of laws it passed would ever be invalid marshall then gave several other reasons in favor of judicial review he argued that authorization in article iii of constitution that court can decide cases arising under this constitution implied that court had power to strike down laws conflicting with constitution this marshall wrote meant that founders were willing to have american judiciary use and interpret constitution when judging cases he also argued that federal judges oaths of office in which they swear to discharge their duties impartially and agreeably to constitution and laws of united states requires them to support constitution lastly marshall argued that judicial review is implied in article vi of constitution since it declares supreme law of united states to be not constitution and laws of united states in general but rather constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof marshall concluded court s opinion analysis political dilemma thumb right upright 0 9 chief justice john marshall as painted by henry inman in 1832 after having presided over american judiciary for over 30 years besides its inherent legal questions case of marbury v madison also created a difficult political dilemma for marshall and rest of supreme court if court ruled in favor of marbury and issued a writ of mandamus ordering madison to deliver commission jefferson and madison would probably have simply ignored order which would have made court look impotent and emphasized shakiness of judiciary on other hand a plain and simple ruling against marbury would have given jefferson and democratic republicans a clear political victory marshall avoided both problems and solved dilemma first he ruled that madison s withholding of marbury s commission was illegal which pleased federalists but then he said court could not give marbury his requested writ of mandamus which gave jefferson and democratic republicans result they desired at same time he maneuvered marbury s simple petition for a writ of mandamus into a case that presented a question that went to heart of american constitutional law itself in what american constitutional law scholar laurence tribe described as an oft told tale that remains awe inspiring in his well known history of supreme court american political historian robert g mccloskey wrote marshall had been looking for a case that was suitable for introducing judicial review and was eager to use situation in marbury to establish his claim he introduced judicial move jefferson used it to strike down a provision of a law that he read to have expanded supreme court s powers and thereby produced jefferson s hoped for result of marbury losing his case he seized occasion to uphold institution of judicial review but he did so in course of reaching a judgment that his political opponents could neither defy nor protest though jefferson criticized marshall s opinion he accepted it and marshall s decision in marbury articulate d a role for federal courts that survives to this day american legal scholar erwin chemerinsky concluded brilliance of marshall s opinion cannot be overstated criticism given its preeminent position in american constitutional law marshall s opinion in marbury v madison continues to be subject of critical analysis and historical inquiry in a 1955 harvard law review article u s supreme court justice felix frankfurter emphasized that one can criticize marshall s opinion in marbury without demeaning it courage of marbury v madison is not minimized by suggesting that its reasoning is not impeccable and its conclusion however wise not inevitable criticisms of marshall s opinion in marbury usually fall into two general categories first some criticize way marshall strove to reach conclusion that u s supreme court has constitutional authority over other branches of u s government today american courts generally follow principle of constitutional avoidance if a certain interpretation of a law raises constitutional problems they prefer to use alternative interpretations that avoid these problems so long as alternative interpretations are still plausible in marbury marshall could have avoided constitutional questions through different legal rulings for example if he had ruled that marbury did not have a right to his commission until it was delivered or if he had ruled that refusals to honor political appointments could only be remedied through political process and not judicial process it would have ended case immediately and court would not have reached case s constitutional issues marshall did not do so and many legal scholars have criticized him for it however others have noted that constitutional avoidance principle did not exist in 1803 and in any case is only a general guide for court action not an ironclad precept alternatively it has also been argued that claim that marshall strove to create a controversy largely vanishes when case is viewed from legal perspective of late 18th century when american colonies and states supreme courts were largely modeled on british court of king s bench which inherently possessed mandamus powers second marshall s arguments for court s authority are sometimes said to be mere series of assertions rather than substantive reasons logically laid out to support his position it is generally agreed that marshall s series of assertions regarding u s constitution and actions of other branches of government do not inexorably lead to conclusion that marshall draws from them marshall s assertion of american judiciary s authority to review executive branch actions was most controversial issue when marbury was first decided and several subsequent u s presidents have tried to dispute it to varying degrees additionally it is questionable whether marshall should have participated in marbury case because of his participating role in dispute marshall was still acting secretary of state when nominations were made and he himself had signed marbury and other men s commissions and had been responsible for their delivery this potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for marshall to have recused himself from case in hindsight fact that marshall did not recuse himself from marbury is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear case and use it to establish judicial review legacy thumb upright 1 25 subpoena duces tecum order to bring items as evidence issued to president richard nixon that was center of dispute in 1974 judicial review case united states v nixon marbury v madison remains single most important decision in american constitutional law it established american judges authority to review constitutionality of congress s legislative acts and to this day supreme court s power to review constitutionality of american laws at both federal and state level is generally rested upon epic decision of marbury v madison although court s opinion in marbury established judicial review in american federal law it did not create or invent it some 18th century british jurists had argued that british courts had power to circumscribe parliament and principle became generally accepted in colonial in marshall s native to idea that in america only people were sovereign rather than government and therefore that courts should only implement legitimate laws by time of constitutional convention in 1787 american courts independent power and duty to interpret law was well established nevertheless marshall s opinion in marbury was power s first announcement and exercise by supreme court it made practice more routine rather than exceptional and prepared way for court s opinion in 1819 case mcculloch v maryland in which marshall implied that supreme court was supreme interpreter of u s constitution marbury also established that power of judicial review covers actions by executive branch president and his cabinet members however american courts power of judicial review over executive branch actions only extends to matters in which executive has a legal duty to act or refrain from acting and does not extend to matters that are entirely within president s discretion such as whether to veto a bill or whom to appoint to an office this power has been basis of many subsequent important supreme court decisions in american history such as 1974 case united states v nixon in which court held that president richard nixon had to comply with a subpoena to provide tapes of his conversations for use in a criminal trial related to watergate scandal and which ultimately led to nixon s resignation although it is a potent check on other branches of u s government power of judicial review was rarely exercised in early american history after deciding marbury in 1803 supreme court did not strike down another federal law until 1857 when court struck down missouri compromise in its decision in dred scott v sandford a ruling that contributed to
