flight unlimited iii is a 1999 flight simulator video game developed by looking glass studios and published by electronic arts it allows players to pilot simulations of real world commercial and civilian aircraft in and around seattle washington players can fly freely or engage in challenge missions such as thwarting a theft or locating bigfoot development team built on general aviation gameplay of flight unlimited ii with more detailed physics and terrain more planes and a real time weather system roughly half of flight unlimited iis team returned to work on sequel supported by new hires lead designer peter james described flight unlimited iiis development as a struggle thanks to a lack of interest from electronic arts and from looking glass s management placed in direct competition with microsoft flight simulator 2000 and fly game failed to capture sufficient market share it became one of looking glass s biggest commercial flops with roughly 20 000 units sold in united states during 1999 this contributed to company s closure in 2000 game was well received by critics who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers but others felt that physics were imprecise and that game s system requirements were extremely high gameplay thumb left player flies over mount rainier in beechcraft baron 58 using visual navigation flight unlimited iii is a three dimensional 3d flight simulator video game in which player pilots virtual reproductions of real world planes players may control ten aircraft lake turbo renegade s10 mooney bravo fokker dr i and five planes first included in flight unlimited ii plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as and primary flight displays and allow for both visual and instrument navigation main airspace is 10 000 square miles of seattle terrain eight other western american states are modeled as well albeit in less detail california scenery from flight unlimited ii may be imported to expand airspace player shares game s skies with artificially intelligent ai planes real time interactive air traffic control monitors player s actions and tries to prevent mid air collisions before a flight player may select which types of weather to encounter weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real time in addition to default quick flight mode player may play tutorial and challenge missions game s tutorial mode features 26 lessons which demonstrate basic and advanced flying techniques and then allow player to perform them challenge missions test player s flying ability with objectives such as locating bigfoot rescuing a stranded hiker stopping a theft or flying through hoops eleven challenges are available but player may create more or download them from internet flight unlimited iii includes level editor fled used to develop game which allows players to use game s assets to create airports ai flight paths and edited landscapes players may share their creations online development following release of flight unlimited ii in 1997 certain members of that game s team wanted to move on to flight unlimited iii while others wanted to create combat flight simulator game flight combat looking glass studios chose to develop games simultaneously team was split into two both supplemented with new hires company then surveyed customers to determine where flight unlimited iii should take place among other things in may 1998 electronic arts was announced as game s publisher as part of a multi title marketing and distribution deal that also included system shock 2 looking glass s goal was to build on foundation of flight unlimited ii and to provide what project leader tom sperry called true joy and sensation of flight in most realistic environment available company first displayed flight unlimited iii at conference in august 1998 at show game was revealed to take place in and around seattle a choice based on fan requests and on varied landscape and weather of puget sound looking glass also discussed new planes moving objects on ground and a real time physics based weather system former flight instructor peter james who had worked on flight unlimited ii assumed role of lead designer he was largely responsible for flight unlimited iii s lessons planes and simulated flight instruments james believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism and he hoped to create a more accurate experience photographs were captured of each plane s real world counterpart and construction of 3d plane models was led by artist duncan hsu a former car modeler at papyrus design group flight physics were coded by kevin wasserman and involve real time calculations of force vectors such as those acting against a plane s yaw pitch and roll this system was more advanced than that of flight unlimited ii which was also based on force calculations physics code was informed by real aircraft data and personal experience of pilots and each of planes was flown as research for game because plane cockpits of previous flight unlimited games had been criticized by pilots team tried to make flight unlimited iiis cockpits extremely authentic kemal recorded planes sound effects which he said involved risking his life by standing near jet engines and underwings thumb right seattle was selected as main setting of flight unlimited iii partly because of its varied weather and landscape game s terrain texture maps were made with satellite images rendered at four square meters per pixel highest resolution used in a flight simulator at that time artist karen wolff designed terrain by combining large topographic maps into a mosaic which recreated elevations and depressions of seattle area satellite imagery was layered over resultant polygonal mesh real elevation data was also used for eight lower resolution western american states outside of seattle area budget concerns and storage limitations of cd rom format prevented team from rendering entire united states despite fan demand 3d objects that move across terrain were created by cho who used numerous photography books for inspiration flight unlimited iiis object editor let her set these objects to move once along path back and forth or cycle weather system co designed by james generates moves and disperses weather fronts based on real time calculations of atmospheric conditions such as humidity and orographic lift management and final months while visiting looking glass to cover flight unlimited iiis development journalist dan linton was impressed by team management of tom sperry producer sandra smith and vice president of marketing michael he wrote that they employed suggestion and encouragement instead of demands and he believed that their work was in large part responsible for game setting a new standard in industry peter james later accused wider company s management of being lukewarm toward flight unlimited iii during development since their biggest sellers were action oriented games like thief dark project he claimed that their lack of interest turned optimistic team into a grumbling group of depressed and sometimes angry people although he smith and perry petitioned company s managers to plan future add ons and third party development for game james felt that they were ignored james developed concepts for a sequel in his spare time but his ideas were shelved to wait for flight unlimited iiis sales figures which had to surpass those of microsoft flight simulator 2000 for flight unlimited iv to be greenlit james believed that this was foolish particularly because he felt that electronic arts game he wrote that flight unlimited iii s marketing manager had great plans but that his hands seem ed tied flight unlimited iiis official site was opened in march 1999 and game was shown alongside flight combat thunder over europe at electronic entertainment expo in may tal blevins of ign wrote that game had come a long way since he had seen it earlier in year and that it was almost complete with development of real time weather system in its final stages full throttle noted game s impressive clouds and slick looking hud flight unlimited iii was shown again at eaa oshkosh in july at which point beta testing was nearly complete and game was 90 done according to james he stated that public reaction was great which energized team for a short time game went gold that august nine months behind schedule james wrote that team celebrated with a small dinner party and that next few days were spent finding out how many people were quitting he left after game s completion to join com a news and review website dedicated to flight simulators game was released on september 17 1999 unlimited iii was placed in direct competition with flight simulators such as fly and microsoft flight simulator 2000 game failed to capture sufficient market share and became one of looking glass s biggest commercial flops it sold roughly 20 000 copies in united states during 1999 game later earned a silver sales award from entertainment and leisure software publishers association elspa indicating sales of at least 100 000 copies in united kingdom together with costly development of flight combat game s low sales used up looking glass s earnings from thief dark project and system shock 2 which had helped them recover from failures of british open championship golf and terra nova strike force centauri these events contributed to company s bankruptcy and closure in may 2000 game was however positively received by critics with an aggregate review score of 88 on gamerankings josh nolan of computer gaming world wrote fu3 is experience oriented it s user friendly graphically glamorous and lots of fun while he praised its visuals and air traffic control he considered game to be simpler than flight simulator 2000 because of its less detailed lessons interfaces and flight physics magazine later nominated flight unlimited iii as 1999 simulation of year writing for computer games magazine denny atkin stated that use of turbulence really sets fu3 apart from competition and that game s simulation of air traffic is like no other sim he praised its graphics and dynamic weather and he found flight physics solid in general but overly gentle for aerobatic maneuvers he concluded it s not only an excellent of general aviation flying it s even a good game pc gamer uks dean evans wrote that game has a poetic grandeur as well as an astonishing attention to detail greater than that of its predecessors he praised its flight lessons and weather and he considered graphics to be unbelievably delicious evans summarized game as most breathtaking flying experience you can get for a pc simon bradley of pc zone wrote has atmosphere in a way that ms combat flight sim can t even dream of he praised its graphics flight physics and detailed flight environment he also complained of slow frame rates and warned that game could not be played on older computers tony lopez of gamespot called game s environmental modeling simply breathtaking and noted that elevations were rendered more smoothly than in fly or microsoft flight simulator he wrote that game s flight physics and weather simulation were superior to those of any other flight simulator and that powerful easy to use fled editing tool could popularize game ign writer marc saltzman commented that game features absolutely stunning terrain at all altitudes realistic weather and lighting effects and highly detailed planes saltzman praised accuracy of flight unlimited iii s physics but remarked that game s frame rate was noticeably slower than that of its
