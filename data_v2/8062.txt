northern gannet morus bassanus is a seabird largest species of gannet family sulidae it is native to coasts of atlantic ocean breeding in western europe and north america sexes are similar in appearance adult northern gannet has a mainly white streamlined body with a long neck long and slender wings it is long with a wingspan head and nape have a buff tinge that is more prominent in breeding season and wings are edged with dark brown black feathers long pointed bill is blue grey contrasting with black bare skin around mouth and eyes juveniles are mostly grey brown becoming increasingly white in five years it takes them to reach maturity nesting takes place in colonies on both sides of north atlantic largest of which are at bass rock 75 000 pairs as of 2014 st kilda 60 000 pairs as of 2013 and ailsa craig 33 000 pairs as of 2014 in scotland grassholm in wales and bonaventure island 60 000 pairs in 2009 off coast of quebec its breeding range has extended northward and eastward colonies being established on russia s kola peninsula in 1995 and bear island southernmost island of svalbard in 2011 colonies are mostly located on offshore islands with cliffs from which birds can more easily launch into air northern gannet undertakes seasonal migrations and hunts for fish that form bulk of its diet by high speed dives into sea gannet was previously hunted for food in parts of its range and traditional practice still continues in outer hebrides of scotland and faroe islands it faces few natural or man made threats and since its population is growing it is considered to be a least concern species by international union for conservation of nature iucn as a conspicuous and common bird it has been mentioned in several ancient myths and legends taxonomy swiss naturalist conrad gessner named northern gannet as anser bassanus or scoticus in 16th century noting that scots called it former name was also used by english naturalist francis willughby in 17th century species was known to him from a colony in firth of forth and a stray bird that was found near coleshill warwickshire it was one of many species originally described by swedish zoologist carl linnaeus in landmark 1758 10th edition of his systema naturae where it was given binomial name pelecanus bassanus french biologist brisson placed it in genus sula in 1760 and his compatriot louis vieillot moved species to his new genus morus in 1816 morus is derived from ancient greek moros meaning foolish and refers to lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies which enables them to be easily killed specific name bassanus is from bass rock in firth of forth ornithologist bryan nelson in 1978 supported species inclusion in sula as he felt differences in anatomy behaviour ecology and morphology between gannets and boobies were not sufficient to warrant separate genera charles lucian bonaparte described american populations as sula americana in 1838 though basis for distinguishing them from european species was unclear and name is now considered to be a synonym northern gannet has been designated as official common name for species by international ornithologists union ioc it is also known as north atlantic gannet gannet is derived from old english meaning strong or masculine which is ultimately from same old germanic root as gander goose and similar old names for northern gannet such as solan or solan goose derive from a hypothetical scottish gaelic itself borrowed from old norse sula literal meaning is cleft stick referring to appearance of conspicuous crossed black wing tips on a perched northern gannet old regional names such as norfolk s herring gant or yorkshire s mackerel gant refer to typical fish prey lincolnshire s gaunt although derived from same germanic root usually applies to great crested grebe but english writer richard hakluyt used term in 1600 to refer to gannet a great white foule young birds have been called spotted booby or parliament goose former term referring to their plumage feeding habits of gannet have led to its name being used as slang for a gluttonous person a usage first recorded in 1929 sulidae gannets and boobies appeared about 30 million years ago early sulidae fossils resembled boobies although they were more aquatic gannets splitting off later about 16 million years ago gannets evolved in northern hemisphere later colonising southern oceans most ancient extant species may be abbott s booby possibly sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage a 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial dna suggests that ancestor of gannets arose around 2 5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages latter then split into cape and australasian gannets around 0 5 million years ago three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of sula bassanus description an adult northern gannet has a wingspan and is long and weighs making it largest gannet and largest seabird native to western palearctic two sexes are generally of a similar size and appearance plumage is white with dark brown to black wing tips primary flight feathers primary coverts and are dark head and neck are tinged buff yellow becoming much more prominent in breeding season males are more deeply coloured than females eyes have a light blue to light grey iris surrounded by a thin black ring of bare skin beak is long strong and conical with a slight at end and a sharp cutting edge in adults beak is blue grey with dark grey or black edges there is a black groove running length of mandible that merges into skin around eyes a black band of bare skin also separates pale feathers of forehead and throat from bill which gives gannet its distinctive face markings four toed feet are joined by a membrane that can vary in colour from dark grey to dark brown there are coloured lines running along toes that continue along up legs these are typically greenish yellow in males and bluish in females and probably have a role in mating thumb right young bird with front part of its body showing adult plumage right thumb juveniles are dark brown fledglings are dark grey to slate grey with upperparts and wings finely speckled with white there is a prominent v shaped white area under rump wing tips and tail are dark brown black partly tipped with white bill and iris are dark brown they can weigh more than by time they leave nest at about 10 weeks of age in second year bird s appearance changes depending on different phases of moulting they can have adult plumage at front and continue to be brown at rear gannets gradually acquire more white in subsequent seasons until they reach maturity after five years northern gannets are slightly larger and thicker billed than cape or australian gannets northern gannet has more white in wings and an all white tail other species having black tips to their tail feathers individuals on west coast of africa could be confused with vagrant masked boobies though latter is smaller overall lacks buff tinge to head and has a black tail from a distance or in poor visibility albatrosses can be confused with northern gannets particularly those with immature plumage that have more black on wings adaptations for diving northern gannets have streamlined bodies adapted for plunge diving at high speed including powerful neck muscles and a spongy bone plate at base of bill nostrils are inside bill and can be closed to prevent water entry eyes are protected by strong nictitating membranes there are subcutaneous air sacs in lower body and along sides other air sacs are located between sternum and pectoral muscles and between ribs and intercostal muscles these sacs are connected to lungs and are filled with air when bird breathes in air can be returned to lungs by muscle contractions feathers are waterproof which allows birds to spend long periods in water a water impermeable secretion produced by a sebaceous gland covers feathers and birds spread it across their body using their beak or head individuals have a subcutaneous fat layer dense down feathers and tightly overlapping feathers that help them withstand low temperatures a reduced blood flow in webbing on their feet outside of breeding season also helps to maintain body temperature when birds swim call thumb calls from grassholm wales northern gannet is a loud and vocal bird particularly in colony its typical call is a harsh arrah arrah or urrah urrah which is emitted upon arriving or when challenging other gannets at colony call is shortened to a rah rah when fishing or collecting nesting material and lengthened to a ooo ah when taking off calls of sexes are similar according to nelson northern gannets can recognize call of their breeding partner their chicks and birds in neighbouring nests individuals from outside this sphere are treated with more aggression distribution and habitat upright 1 5 thumb right red dots show breeding colonies in north atlantic northern gannet s breeding range is on both sides of north atlantic on coasts influenced by gulf stream there are colonies in gulf of saint lawrence and on islands off east coast of canada they normally nest in large colonies on cliffs overlooking ocean or on small rocky islands water needs to be cool enough for atlantic mackerel and herring which are main food source for northern gannet these areas also overlie continental shelf northern gannet colonies can be found in far north in regions that are very cold and stormy and nelson has suggested that they can survive in these regions for several reasons including combination of body weight and a powerful beak that allows them to capture strong muscular fish and ability to dive to great depths and capture prey far from cliffs their fat reserves act as weight when diving and as reserves during extended periods without food northern limit of their breeding area depends on presence of waters that are free of sea ice during breeding season therefore while greenland and svalbard offer suitable breeding sites arctic regions have summers that are too short to allow northern gannets to lay their eggs and raise a brood which requires between 26 and 30 weeks southern limit of their distribution mainly depends on presence of sufficient prey there is fossil evidence of northern gannets breeding on crete in pleistocene breeding colonies alt bass rock scotland thumb bass rock in firth of forth scotland is world s largest colony some northern gannet breeding colonies have been recorded as being located in same place for hundreds of years cliffs containing colonies appear white when seen from a distance due to number of nesting birds present on them there is a written record of a colony on island of lundy from 1274 there were only 70 nests by 1871 and colony finally disappeared by 1909 at latest more than two thirds of world population breeds around coasts of british isles colonies include united kingdom bass rock off firth of forth in scotland first recorded in 1493 in 2004 it contained more than 48 000 nests by 2014 this had increased to over 75 000 making it largest colony in world northern gannets began a colony at troup head in aberdeenshire in 1988 and by 2014 it held an estimated 6 456 pairs saint kilda and sula sgeir in hebrides scotland former colony was estimated at 60 290 pairs and latter 11 230 pairs in 2013 a colony on flannan isles almost doubled in size to 5 280 pairs in 2013 further south island of ailsa craig in firth of clyde hosted an estimated 33 226 pairs in 2014 ailsa craig has been known as a colony since 1583 on shetland there were an estimated 25 580 breeding pairs at 11 786 at and 3 591 at fair isle in 2013 while orkney had an estimated 4 550 pairs at sule stack sule skerry s breeding population rose from 57 to 1 870 pairs between 2003 and 2013 grassholm off pembrokeshire coast in wales had an estimated 36 011 pairs in 2015 gannets began nesting here between 1820 and 1860 though never in great numbers only exceeding 300 pairs by 1913 cliffs hosted an estimated 12 494 pairs in 2015 more than tripling in size in 12 years ireland little a small island located about off peninsula of county kerry is largest colony in ireland hosting around 30 000 breeding pairs known as a gannetry before 1700 colony was exploited by local people and dwindled to 30 pairs by 1880 before rapidly increasing again there are small colonies on ireland s southern coast on bull rock county cork clare island county mayo and great island county wexford alderney around 7 500 pairs nest on two islets and les off coast of alderney in english channel first birds only nesting there in 1940s these birds migrate further south to mediterranean and west coast of africa than more northerly breeding colonies france french island of in archipelago off coast of brittany hosts southernmost breeding colony of northern gannets established in late 1930s it had grown to over 11 500 breeding pairs by 1995 pairs have nested sporadically with varying success along mediterranean coast germany northern gannets have reappeared on heligoland in 1991 and around 680 breeding pairs have been counted in 2016 italy a pair raised a chick successfully for three successive seasons from 2013 to 2015 on a moored boat at porto venere in northern italy after birds had been seen there since 1993 faroe islands mykines in faroe islands held about 2 000 breeding pairs in 2000 although that had risen to 2 500 pairs by 2014 iceland eldey a small island located about off coast of peninsula iceland hosting around 16 300 breeding pairs in 1962 and a similar number in 2008 iceland has several small colonies along its coast and on around north norway as of 2016 there are an estimated 6 900 breeding pairs in norway northern gannets first bred in south of country in mid 1940s at in more og romsdal in 1967 a colony was established at within arctic circle at 70degn colonies were also established on low islets in lofoten and vesteralen but declined due to increasing numbers of white tailed eagles once rare these were protected in 1968 and their numbers have risen it is unclear why eagles have not impacted on gannet numbers further north in 2011 gannets began breeding on bear island southernmost island of svalbard likely due to warming of barents sea and influx of fish colony numbered 52 pairs in 2016 russia there are around 250 pairs in a colony at on kola peninsula in russia established in 1995 this is also thought to be due to warming of barents sea north america there are six breeding colonies along coast of canada gulf of saint lawrence hosts three colonies bonaventure island bird rocks and anticosti island and there are three off eastern and southeastern coast of newfoundland cape st mary s ecological reserve funk island island ecological reserve bonaventure island off south coast of gaspe peninsula of quebec is largest colony with 60 000 nests as of 2009 migration after breeding season adult northern gannets disperse over a wide area although they travel no more than from breeding colony it is not known if all birds from one colony migrate to same over wintering area many adults migrate to west of mediterranean passing over strait of gibraltar and flying over land as little as possible other birds follow africa s atlantic coastline to arrive in gulf of guinea immature northern gannets from colonies in canada fly to gulf of mexico much further south than adults immature gannets migrate southwards for great distances and have been recorded as far south as ecuador in their second year some birds return to colony they were born in where they arrive later than mature birds they then migrate south again at end of breeding season but travel shorter distances in this second migration gannets from alderney have been tracked since 2015 to gain better knowledge of their movements one individual was found to have travelled from its colony in alderney to scandinavian waters a round trip of around 2 700 km 1 680 mi species has been recorded as a vagrant in many central and eastern european countries as far south and west as black sea and also in bermuda cuba cyprus egypt kazakhstan jan mayen and syria in february 2016 one was recorded from ceara in northeastern brazil first sighting in southern hemisphere behaviour thumb plunge diving with wings retracted wings of northern gannet are long and narrow and are positioned towards front of body allowing efficient use of air currents when flying even in calm weather they can attain velocities of between although their flying muscles are relatively small in other birds flying muscles make up around 20 of total weight while in northern gannets flying muscles are less than 13 despite their speed they cannot manoeuvre in flight as well as other seabirds northern gannets need to warm up before flying they also walk with difficulty and this means that they have problems getting airborne from a flat area they take off from water by facing into wind and strongly beating their wings in light winds and high waves they are sometimes unable to take off and they can become beached gannets alight on land using angled wings fanned tail and raised feet to control their speed not always successfully since damaged or broken wings were recorded as a frequent cause of death in adults at one colony feeding northern gannets forage for food during day generally by diving at high speed into sea they search for food both near to their nesting sites but also further out to sea birds that are feeding young have been recorded searching for food up to from their nest it has been found that 2 of birds nesting in colony on bass rock search for fish at dogger bank between away it is likely that they fly further than this while foraging possibly up to double distance normally they fly less than some studies have found that duration and direction of flights made while foraging for food are similar for both sexes although there are significant differences in search behaviour of males and females female northern gannets are not only more selective than males in choosing a search area they also make longer and deeper dives and spend more time floating on surface than males thumb searching for fish in a zoo gannets will follow fishing boats or cetaceans to find discarded or injured fish they forage from heights of up to with no clear preference and typically dive from between they dive with their bodies straight and rigid wings tucked close to body but angled back extending beyond tail before piercing water like an arrow they control direction of dive using their wings and tail and fold their wings against body just before impact birds can hit water at speeds of up to this allows them to penetrate up to below surface and they will swim down to an average sometimes deeper than bird s subcutaneous air sacs may have a role in controlling their buoyancy gannets usually push their prey deeper into water and capture it as they return to surface when a dive is successful they swallow fish underwater before surfacing and never fly with fish in their bill larger fish are swallowed headfirst smaller fish are swallowed sideways or tail first fish is stored in a branched bag in throat and does not cause drag when in flight their white colour helps other gannets to identify one of their kind and they can deduce presence of a shoal of fish by this diving behaviour this in turn facilitates group foraging which makes capturing their prey easier colour also makes gannet less visible to fish underneath northern gannets also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water they eat mainly fish in length that shoal near surface virtually any small fish roughly 80 90 of their diet or other small pelagic species largely squid will be taken opportunistically sardines anchovies haddock smelt atlantic cod and other shoal forming species are eaten breeding thumb transporting material for nest oldest birds are first to return to northern gannet s breeding colonies birds not of breeding age arrive a few weeks later in general birds first return to a colony not uncommonly one in which they were hatched when they are two or three years old once an individual has successfully bred in a colony it will not normally change to another nesting starts in march or april immature birds stay on edges of colony they may even make a nest but they do not breed until they are four or five years old some birds of this age occupy empty nests that they will aggressively defend if they have sat on them for two or three days if an apparently empty nest has an owner immature bird will leave without a struggle when owner arrives to take possession preferred nesting sites are on coastal hillsides or cliffs if these are not available northern gannets will nest in groups on islands or flat surfaces as they find it more difficult to take off from such locations they will often cross area occupied by an adjacent nest causing an aggressive reaction from sitting pair this means that stress levels are higher in this type of colony than in those on steeper surfaces notwithstanding this nests are always built close together and otherwise ideal nesting sites will not be used if they are some distance from a colony on average there are 2 3 nests per square metre 1 9 per square yard both sexes fiercely defend area around their nest where space allows distance between nests is double reach of an individual thumb egg nests are made from seaweed plants earth and debris from sea males usually collect materials nests are compact cups typically in height area which a nest occupies grows throughout breeding season as breeding pairs throw their excrement outside nest over years nests can reach 2 m 7 ft in height northern gannets lay one egg that on average weighs which is light for such a large seabird egg is around long by wide and shell is pale blue and translucent initially before fading to a chalky white surface that is easily stained where two eggs are found in a nest this is result of two females laying an egg in same nest or one egg being stolen from another nest northern gannets will lay a replacement egg if first is lost incubation takes 42 to 46 days during which time egg is surrounded by brooding bird s warm webbed feet just before hatching begins brooding bird releases egg from its feet to prevent egg from breaking under adult s weight as chick breaks it open this is a frequent cause of death for chicks of birds that are breeding for first time process of breaking eggshell can take up to 36 hours webbed feet are also used to cover chicks which are only rarely left alone by their parents chicks that are left unattended are often attacked and killed by other northern gannets a downy chick thumb newly hatched chicks are featherless and are dark blue or black in colour in second week of life they are covered in white down replaced over next five weeks by dark brown feathers flecked with white young chicks are fed regurgitated semi digested fish by their parents who open their mouths wide for their young to fetch food from back of their throats older chicks receive whole fish unlike chicks of other species northern gannet chicks do not move about nest or flap their wings to ask for food this reduces likelihood that they will fall from nest adults feed their offspring for around 13 weeks right up until time they leave young birds fledge between 84 and 97 days old departing by launching themselves off a cliff and flying a procedure for which it is impossible to practice beforehand if they leave nest in bad weather they can be mortally wounded as they can be blown against rocks young birds are attacked by adults if unattended once they leave nest they stay at sea learning to fish and fly their flight skills being too poor for them to return to breeding ledges northern gannets have only one brood a year survival rate for young birds for their first four years is 30 and annual survival rate for adults is 91 9 typical lifespan after becoming adult is 17 years and maximum known age is 37 years 4 months 16 days gannet pairs are monogamous and may remain together over several seasons if not for all of their lives pairs separate when their chicks leave nest but they bond again following year should one of pair die other bird will find another mate displays thumb fencing or billing a mutual greeting gannets exhibit many types of aggressive behaviour while they are nesting confrontations normally only take place between birds of same sex females will lower their heads before an aggressive male that is defending its nest this will expose back of female s neck and male will take it in its beak and expel female from nest a female will not react if a male approaches a nest but it will react fiercely if another female approaches fights between males occupying nests for first time are particularly intense such fights can last for up to two hours and lead to serious injuries birds lunge at each other and lock bills wrestling for extended periods while neighbours peck at them fights are preceded by threatening gestures which are also seen outside breeding season males demonstrate ownership of a nest by gesturing towards their neighbours in a bowing display their heads and beaks point down and their wings are held up and away from body yet folded backwards male moves his head from side to side before bowing forwards males try to attract an available female after establishing a territory females will fly over colony several times before landing their posture with neck stretched out tells male that they are available for courtship male will then shake their heads in a similar way to when they are guarding their nest but with their wings closed mated pairs engage in a fencing display when male arrives back at nest two birds stand breast to breast with wings spread and bills extended vertically they fence and scissor with their bills rapidly calling loudly at same time fencing is interspersed with bill bowing predators and parasites thumb great skua robbing a gannet northern gannet is not heavily predated only known habitual natural predators of adults are bald eagles and white tailed eagles predators of eggs and nestlings include great black backed gull and american herring gull common ravens ermine and red fox attacks at sea are insignificant though large sharks and seals may rarely snatch a gannet out at sea kleptoparasitism by skuas particularly great skua occurs at breeding sites skua chases its victim until it disgorges its stomach contents providing a meal for attacker skuas may catch tip of gannet s wing causing it to fall into sea or seize tail to tip its victim into water gannet is only released when it has regurgitated its catch external parasites include feather lice although there are relatively few species and none are found on head as with grebes and divers it may be that short head feathers provide insufficient cover for parasite in one species bassani immature lice are found in membranes lining subcutaneous air cells ixodes mites include widespread i spiny headed worm appears to occur only in gannets and closely related seabird families such as cormorants tapeworm bassani adsorbs toxic heavy metals at a higher concentration than gannet s own tissues with an average 12 times as much cadmium as gannet s pectoral muscles and 7 10 times lead level of bird s kidney and liver since levels of these toxic metals are detectable in parasite earlier than in host tapeworm might be used as an early indicator of marine pollution conservation status thumb nests among rocks population of this species appears to be increasing a 2004 survey counted 45 gannet breeding colonies and some 361 000 nests population is apparently growing between 3 and 5 a year although this growth is concentrated in just a few colonies although northern gannet populations are now stable their numbers were once greatly reduced due to loss of habitat removal of eggs and killing of adults for their meat and feathers in 1939 there were 22 colonies and some 83 000 nests which means that populations have increased fourfold since that time in 1992 international union for conservation of nature iucn estimated bird s population to be some 526 000 after taking into account an estimate produced for birdlife international in 2004 of european population iucn revised its global population to between 950 000 and 1 200 000 individuals iucn lists northern gannets as a species of least concern as they are widely distributed and as there is a large population that appears to be growing due to high breeding success with 75 of eggs producing fledged young in culture thumb upright 0 4 px leucothea by jean jules 1862 in homer s odyssey sea goddess leucothea white goddess appears in likeness of a gannet and tells shipwrecked odysseus to discard his cloak and raft instead offering him her veil to wind round himself which will save his life and enable him to reach land another early reference to gannet is in seventh century old english epic poem seafarer there i heard naught but seething sea ice cold wave awhile a song of swan then came to charm me gannets and whimbrels trills for laughter of men kittiwake singing instead of mead an old myth from mykines in faroe islands tells of giant torur seeking mercy following defeat at hands of oli islanders head man and magician in return he gave them whales driftwood logs and a bird unique to archipelago on condition that inhabitants did not laugh at his gifts over time islanders forgot their promise and lost whales and logs but fearful of losing a valuable food source they never mocked gannets that torur had given them thumb heather isle collecting hunters from sula sgeir gannets have long been eaten for food birds mainly young were taken from bass rock for at least 350 years until 1885 when annual cull of about 1 500 individuals finally ceased and shetland gannets were sold as highland goose in london restaurants during world war ii views of palatability of this bird are mixed but as well as being a food for poor it also regularly featured in scottish royal banquets in scotland gannets were traditionally salted to preserve them until they got to market this technique being replaced by partially cooking or smoking in era of modern transport they are normally served roasted although sometimes raw when pickled or dried best known site was remote island of st kilda where adults and eggs were taken in spring fat chicks known locally as were harvested from precipitous cliffs in august just before they could fly and thrown to waiting boats far below much of meat was salted in barrels for storage but rest of bird was also used islanders paid their rent in feathers for stuffing pillows and furniture gannet stomachs were used to hold oil derived from carcasses and served as lamp wicks hunting on st kilda ceased in 1910 but gannetry on sula sgeir is still exploited under a licence that permits 2 200 chicks to be taken each year during hunt ten men live on island and cleaned birds are singed on a fire fuelled by their own oil rich offal birds are then taken to stornoway where each hunter receives 200 skins to give away or sell continuing existence of practice of hunting and eating gannets attracts criticism in some quarters island s name sula sgeir itself derives from sula meaning gannet and old norse a skerry other sites that continued hunting into twentieth century were eldey in iceland where activity ceased in 1939 and mykines where small scale culling still persists about 500 young are culled for consumption each year in mykines using techniques similar to those of sula sgeir hunts although bass rock population fell to fewer than 4 000 pairs in early nineteenth century population soon recovered once hunting ceased and st kilda was harvested sustainably for hundreds of years elsewhere recovery was less complete bird rocks colony in gulf of st lawrence may once have held 250 000 birds but unchecked hunting including for fish bait meant that population was only 1 000 birds by 1932 despite government protection since 1904 notes references bibliography external links northern gannet category birds of
