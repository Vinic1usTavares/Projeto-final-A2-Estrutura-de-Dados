sandown castle was a device fort built at sandown on isle of wight by henry viii in 1545 to protect against threat of french attack constructed from stone with angular bastions its design was a hybrid of italian military architectural thinking with traditional english military design site was raided by a french force that summer while fortification was still being constructed site suffered from coastal erosion and castle was demolished in 1631 history 16th century background sandown castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between england france and holy roman empire in final years of reign of king henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications and while france and empire remained in conflict with one another maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of england seemed unlikely modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but in general fortifications were very limited in scale in 1533 henry then broke with pope paul iii to annul long standing marriage to his wife catherine of aragon and remarry this resulted in france and empire declaring an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraging two countries to attack england henry responded in 1539 by ordering through an instruction called a device construction of fortifications along most vulnerable parts of coast immediate threat passed but resurfaced in 1544 with france threatening an invasion across channel backed by her allies in scotland henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve country s defences particularly along south coast construction built between april and september 1545 to protect south east coast of isle of wight sandown castle overlooked sandown bay it was constructed by italian engineer giovanni portinari surveyor william ridgeway and captain of labourers john at a cost of ps2 400 designed around a central courtyard it had a square tower and two angular bastions on one side and a circular bastion looking out to sea rear of stone defences was protected by a moat and castle had a wooden pier for boats to dock at angular bastions echoed contemporary italian thinking on military architecture and may have been influenced by richard lee king s surveyor of works as well as by portinari s own continental background despite being relatively advanced for an english fortification castle did not feature more fashionable italianate arrow head bastion design used at nearby yarmouth castle and has been critiqued by historians andrew saunders describes it as an imperfect hybrid of english and continental ideas john hale as a timid confused flirtation with modern designs before castle could be completed however french attacked admiral claude d annebault crossed channel and arrived off solent with 200 ships on 19 july where local authorities feared sandown castle might be target of a night attack 2 000 french soldiers men landed on isle of wight and attacked sandown where labourers were still present their advance soon stalled however and french retreated back to their fleet bringing invasion threat to an end castle was finally completed after their departure 17th century by 17th century coastal erosion had undermined castle s walls in 1627 charles i announced that he would repair fortification but instead ruins were dismantled in 1631 by sir john oglander a new fortification sandown fort was built in its place positioned further inland but possible remains of foundations of original castle are still visible along shore at low tide see also castles in great britain and ireland notes references bibliography category forts on isle of wight category device forts category buildings and structures completed in 1545 category buildings and structures demolished in 17th century category sandown
