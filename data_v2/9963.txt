for thee o lord i long is an early church cantata by johann sebastian bach composed for an unknown occasion it is unique among bach s cantatas in its sparse orchestration and in independence and prominence of chorus which is featured in four out of seven movements text alternates verses from psalm 25 and poetry by an unknown librettist bach scored work for four vocal parts and a small baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins bassoon and basso continuo many scholars think that it may be earliest extant cantata by bach possibly composed in arnstadt in 1707 history and text bach s original score is lost music survives in a copy made by c f penzel one of bach s last pupils after composer s death date of composition is not known and sources differ as to when and where bach composed work however balance of opinion has moved towards a date at beginning of bach s career it is not currently in dispute that it is one of bach s earliest surviving cantatas suggestions for place of composition have been weimar where bach worked from 1708 conductor and academic jonathan green dates work c 1708 1710 bach scholar william g whittaker dates it c 1712 muhlhausen where bach worked in 1707 1708 zwang catalogue which attempts to list cantatas chronologically dated it as sixth of surviving cantatas by bach and placed aus der tiefen rufe ich herr zu dir bwv 131 as earliest aus der tiefen rufe ich herr zu dir is known to have been composed in muhlhausen in 1707 1708 arnstadt where bach worked until his move to muhlhausen in summer of 1707 recent scholarship suggests nach dir herr verlanget mich could have been composed at arnstadt thumb wender organ which bach inspected in neue kirche arnstadt for which cantata was probably composed bach scholar andreas glockner argued in 1988 that cantata may have been composed in arnstadt scholar hans joachim schulze identified in 2010 a remarkable acrostic in concluding four movements which he described in 2010 bach jahrbuch journal of neue bachgesellschaft adjusting for transposition errors by copyist initial letters should spell doktor conrad meckbach and plausibly therefore work was composed to mark this muhlhausen councillor s 70th birthday in april 1707 on this basis cantata may date from bach s time in arnstadt possibly cantata was heard a few weeks later after end of lent and thus it may have formed a test piece for muhlhausen appointment composed in arnstadt with bach s supporter meckbach in mind cantata is as john eliot gardiner notes generally accepted to be bach s very first church cantata gardiner conducted in 2000 bach cantata pilgrimage and performed cantata in church for which it was then probably composed at bach s time called neue kirche new church now johann sebastian bach kirche libretto alternates between biblical verses and free contemporary poetry which is common in bach s later cantatas but rare among his early cantatas text of movements 2 4 and 6 are selected psalm verses author of poetry is unknown on basis of text it has been suggested that work was written for a penitential service cantata was first published in 1884 in bach gesellschaft ausgabe first edition of bach s complete works composer johannes brahms who served on editorial board of bach gesellschaft ausgabe took an interest in cantata as it was being published he used an adapted version of bass line of closing chaconne for a work he completed in 1885 his symphony no 4 structure and scoring bach structured cantata in seven movements an opening instrumental sinfonia and four choral movements interspersed by only two arias he scored it for four soloists soprano alto tenor and bass a four part choir and a small baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins vl bassoon obbligato fg and basso continuo duration of cantata is about 17 minutes in following table of movements scoring follows neue bach ausgabe keys and time signatures are taken from alfred durr using symbol for common time 4 4 continuo playing throughout is not shown music work begins with a sinfonia and then alternates choral movements and arias there are no recitatives no da capo repeats and there is no chorale tune unusually for bach s cantatas bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony often shifting tempo and character of music within movements very quickly to accommodate a new musical idea with each successive phrase of text sinfonia and opening choral movement are both based on motive of an octave leap followed by five descending half steps this chromatic figure sometimes dubbed lamento bass or passus duriusculus has been utilized by composers as early as monteverdi as a musical representation of anguish pain and longing sinfonia also introduces thematic material developed later in work uses asymmetric phrasing and a seamless flow of unstoppable melody first chorus on beginning of psalm 25 lord i long for you my god i hope in you is constructed despite its relative brevity it is episodic emphasizing a descending chromatic scale motif musicologist tadashi isoyama notes graphically chromatic phrases of opening sinfonia and following chorus these are evocative of suffering of world following soprano aria yet i am and remain content is also brief but includes significant word painting fourth movement lead me in your truth and teach me is another short and episodic chorus divided into four sections movement five cedars must before winds often feel much hardship is one of only a handful of vocal trios to be found in bach s oeuvre as well as only movement in cantata in all major isoyama writes continuo part drives music forward with its phrase describing trials of penultimate movement features a celestial haze of instruments as part of a complex texture it is in binary form and modulates from d major through b minor to b major final movement is a chaconne a form which is typically constructed over a repeated ground bass bach uses a ground bass which is possibly a borrowing from pachelbel it is inversion of chromatic fourth ostinato from opening movement bach s orchestration includes strumming effects which could be seen as recalling origin of chaconne in spanish guitar music from a theological point of view both inversion of lamento bass and series of modulations in this movement express in baroque musical affect how
