tag team title from arn anderson and tully blanchard on september 10 1988 this feud was cut short when anderson blanchard signed with wwf over money issues midnight express run with title lasted a little over a month and a half before road warriors took gold from them in a brutal match up which saw heel road warriors brutalize now popular midnight express now fan favorites midnight express had to contend with a team thought to be disbanded forever original midnight express which consisted of condrey and randy rose who joined jcp after a brief run in awa duo was led by long time jim cornette nemesis paul e dangerously in a storyline that saw them trying to prove originals were better than new version surprise appearance of original midnight express gave dangerously s team initial momentum in feud but soon after condrey left promotion once more this forced bookers to bring in jack victory as a replacement as condrey s disappearance cut promising feud short midnight express then turned their attention to paul e s new team samoan s w a t team as well as a new version of fabulous freebirds eaton and lane were defeated by freebirds in finals of a tournament for vacated world tag team titles following this loss midnight express teamed with their former enemies road warriors and dr death steve williams to defeat sst and freebirds in a wargames match at great american bash following this feud lane and eaton began having issues with a young new team in nwa known as dynamic dudes shane douglas and johnny ace dudes admitted that midnight express was one of their favorite teams and asked if cornette would be their manager as well cornette agreed to manage young team to displeasure of midnight express after arguing with express jim cornette stopped accompanying eaton and lane to ring choosing to only actively manage dudes at clash of champions ix two teams met with jim cornette appearing in a neutral corner forced to choose between teams express started out very aggressively especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites and when night was over midnight express had once again established themselves as heels with jim cornette in their corner cornette had never stopped siding with express after returning to their cheating ways midnight express started a storyline with up and coming team of flyin brian and z man tom zenk over united states tag team title express won title from young team in early 1990 but lost belts to steiner brothers rick and scott three months later after a loss at wcw pay per view halloween havoc 1990 midnight express split up as jim cornette and stan lane left federation while eaton chose to remain in wcw for first time in almost a decade there was no midnight express world television champion 1991 for first time since 1979 eaton was a singles competitor and he faced an uphill struggle to establish himself he wrestled his former opponents in tag team competition such as brad armstrong whom he defeated at wrestlewar 91 ricky morton and z man tom zenk whom he defeated at starrcade 90 but lost to at clash of champions xiv but it was not until he turned face during early parts of 1991 that he started to move up

being that dangerously had brought rude to wcw in defeating sting for united states championship in joining group eaton became allies with rude larry zbyszko and his two former rivals for world television championship in arn anderson and steve austin shortly after group was formed anderson and eaton became its tag team specialists this seemed to make sense as both men had been successful tag

quickly won wcw world tag team championship by defeating ricky steamboat and dustin rhodes team to whom anderson and zbyszko lost belts for championship and held on to belts for five months before they lost them to steiner brothers dangerous alliance was a dominant force in wcw at one point during 1992 they held every title except wcw world title which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy sting war between dangerous alliance and sting and friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a double ring war games match at wrestlewar 1992 sting s team won when sting forced eaton to give up after larry zbyszko accidentally struck eaton in arm with a metal rod this match would be given a 5 star rating from dave meltzer of wrestling observer newsletter in aftermath of war games match zbyszko was kicked out of alliance for causing alliance loss soon after alliance disintegrated paul e dangerously left wcw eaton and anderson continued to team after alliance fell apart
