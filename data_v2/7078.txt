mediterranean campaign of 1798 was a series of major naval operations surrounding a french expeditionary force sent to egypt under napoleon bonaparte during french revolutionary wars french republic sought to capture egypt as first stage in an effort to threaten british india and support tipu sultan and thus force great britain to make peace departing toulon in may 1798 with over 40 000 troops and hundreds of ships bonaparte s fleet sailed southeastwards across mediterranean sea they were followed by a small british squadron under rear admiral sir horatio nelson later reinforced to 13 ships of line whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting frigates and reliable information bonaparte s first target was island of malta which was under government of knights of st john and theoretically granted its owner control of central mediterranean bonaparte s forces landed on island and rapidly overwhelmed defenders securing port city of valletta before continuing to egypt when nelson learned of french capture of island he guessed french target to be egypt and sailed for alexandria but passed french during night of 22 june without discovering them and arrived off egypt first unable to find bonaparte nelson turned back across mediterranean eventually reaching sicily on 19 july while nelson was returning westwards bonaparte reached alexandria and stormed city capturing coast and marching his army inland his fleet entrusted to vice admiral francois paul brueys d aigalliers was anchored in a line of battle in aboukir bay on 1 august nelson who had returned to egyptian coast after reports gathered at coron revealed french invasion arrived off aboukir bay although it was late afternoon and british fleet had no accurate charts of bay nelson ordered an immediate attack on french van brueys was unprepared and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as british split into two divisions and sailed down either side of french line capturing all five ships of vanguard and engaging his 120 gun flagship orient in centre at 21 00 orient caught fire and exploded killing most of crew and ending main combat sporadic fighting continued for next two days until all of french ships had been captured destroyed or fled at battle of nile eleven french ships of line and two frigates were eliminated trapping bonaparte in egypt and changing balance of power in mediterranean with french navy in mediterranean defeated other nations were encouraged to join second coalition and go to war with france portugal kingdom of naples russian empire and ottoman empire all subsequently deployed forces to mediterranean russians and turks participated in blockade of egypt and operations in adriatic sea while portuguese joined siege of malta which was distantly conducted by nelson from his lodgings in naples nelson who had been wounded at battle of nile became involved in neapolitan politics and encouraged king ferdinand to go to war with france resulting in loss of his mainland kingdom in western mediterranean vice admiral earl st vincent who commanded mediterranean fleet from off cadiz deployed forces against menorca rapidly captured island and turned it into an important naval base background bonaparte s plan at beginning of 1798 war of first coalition had come to an end with french control of northern italy much of low countries and rhineland confirmed by treaty of campo formio chandler p 78 of all major european powers that had at one time allied against french republic only kingdom of great britain remained hostile and french directory determined to end french revolutionary wars by eliminating britain a series of invasions of british isles were planned come p 185 and 28 year old general napoleon bonaparte who had defeated austrians in italy previous year was assigned to lead armee d angleterre army of england that had been assembled at boulogne james p 113 however english channel was firmly controlled by royal navy and french invasion supplies particularly of viable landing craft were totally inadequate for purpose gardiner p 107 in early spring of 1798 bonaparte left his command at boulogne and returned to paris reporting that continued british naval supremacy in northern european waters made an invasion impossible in near future mostert p 248 with operations to north impossible bonaparte directed his attention southwards to toulon principal french seaport on mediterranean there a french army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location speculated by french commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places including among others britain sicily malta and crimea cole p p 230 expedition s intended target was actually egypt which formed an important link in chain of communications between britain and economically vital colony of british india adkins p 7 bonaparte considered capture of egypt as most important step in neutralising massive economic benefits that britain gained from trade with india and bringing britain to terms in august 1797 he wrote time is not far away that we will feel that in order to truly destroy england we must take egypt cole p 13 possession of egypt could grant french control of eastern mediterranean and red sea forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between britain and india and obstructing trade worth ps2 7 million equivalent of ps as of to british economy maffeo p 227 in addition a successful invasion of egypt could be followed by a direct attack on british territory in india possibly in conjunction with anglophobic tippoo sultan of seringapatam warner p 41 french

mediterranean bases of corsica and elba rose p 140 by early 1798 their mediterranean fleet was based at tagus river in portugal their one remaining continental ally maffeo p 224 with no permanent british fleet in mediterranean and an uprising imminent in ireland bonaparte firmly believed that royal navy would be unable to intervene in his plans even if they should discover them rose p 141 with passage to egypt seemingly unopposed bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen ships of line led by 120 gun orient under vice admiral francois paul brueys d aigalliers and numerous smaller warships including entire venetian navy captured previous year to prepare for sea gardiner p 20 fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 transport ships which were to carry 35 000 men detailed for invasion clowes p 353 on 3 may bonaparte departed paris arriving at toulon five days later to oversee final preparations on 9 may he reviewed assembled army and gave a speech announcing that expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land speech was met with an enthusiastic response from his soldiers and a revised version subsequently appeared in le moniteur universel and was widely distributed throughout france as a poster cole p 5 despite bonaparte s pronouncement french departure was delayed a strong headwind prevented fleet from sailing for another nine days conditions

of state for war henry dundas suggested it he was urged by foreign secretary lord grenville to think with a map in your hand and with a calculation of distances rodger p 458 letters reached london and st vincent at tagus describing extensive preparations right along french and italian mediterranean coastlines but distances between base in tagus and toulon prevented any sustained observation of french movements maffeo p 234 urgent orders were sent from lord spencer at admiralty to vice admiral earl st vincent commander of british mediterranean fleet at tagus to despatch a squadron to investigate under command of rear admiral sir horatio nelson nelson had returned to fleet three days earlier at lord spencer s order bradford p 169 following recovery in britain from loss of an arm at battle of santa cruz de tenerife in july 1797 gardiner p 18 st vincent had already been preparing for an expedition to toulon with nelson in mind and rear admiral departed tagus in his flagship hms vanguard on 2 may st vincent was overjoyed to be able to place nelson in command of mission writing that arrival of admiral nelson has given me new life his presence in mediterranean is so very essential bradford p 170 his preference for nelson over more senior admirals sir william parker and sir john orde provoked a storm of protest which eventually culminated in orde challenging st vincent to a duel mostert p 255 and being subsequently ordered to return to britain warner p 45 on 9 may nelson collected ships of line hms alexander and hms orion under captains alexander ball and sir james saumarez frigates hms emerald and hms terpsichore under captains thomas moutray waller and william hall gage and sloop hms bonne citoyenne under captain robert retalick at gibraltar and passed into

inflicting negligible damage keegan p 41 on 17 may terpsichore captured privateer la pierre off cape sicie and from crew nelson learned that bonaparte s departure was imminent although destination was still unknown maffeo p 239 on 21 may as his squadron reached iles d hyeres near toulon they were struck by strong winds that snapped vanguard s topmasts and brought wreckage down onto deck killing two men vanguard was left struggling in heavy seas blown southwards in one night bradford p 173 so severe was damage that vanguard was almost wrecked on corsican coast on following day and nelson even ordered captain ball who had managed to attach a towline to flagship to abandon him padfield p 112 ball refused order and british ships of line rode out storm together mostert p 250 although alexander was able to tow vanguard to san pietro island off sardinia for repairs gale had forced squadron s frigates to separate from larger ships padfield p 113 thomas waller on emerald was divided from other frigates and his lookouts had observed vanguard in its dismasted state at height of storm other two frigates had reefed their sails and ridden out storm together captain gage turning towards spanish coast when storm abated and on 29 may encountered hms alcmene under captain george johnstone hope which had been sent by st vincent to augment nelson s force two days later hope s squadron encountered emerald which had captured two merchant ships and together they sailed for prearranged rendezvous point off cape st sebastian near barcelona keegan p 45 hope ordered terpsichore and bonne citoyenne to cruise off sardinia and on 3 june encountered brig hms mutine under captain thomas hardy scout of a fleet sent by earl st vincent that was approaching rendezvous knowing of damaged suffered by vanguard and aware that french had left toulon hope then took unilateral decision to search for french himself dispersing frigates across western mediterranean keegan p 47 hope s ships failed to find either british or french fleets and none of frigates returned to nelson s command until after battle of nile maffeo p 241 malta thumb napoleon s arrival in malta departing toulon on 19 may bonaparte s fleet passed along coast of provence to genoa where 72 additional transport ships were collected keegan p 40 sailing south fleet reached corsica on 23 may and collected a fleet of 22 transports from ajaccio on 28 may adkins p 11 convoy remained within sight of eastern coastline until 30 may crossing strait of bonifacio and following coastline of sardinia in anticipation of combining with fleets of transports sailing from civitavecchia on 3 june a message reached bonaparte reporting presence of nelson s squadron at san pietro and french general sent a french squadron to investigate although by that time nelson had sailed and harbour was empty abandoning wait for civitavecchia force which had still not arrived bonaparte gave orders for his fleet to turn southeast passing on sicily and island of pantelleria on 7 june there a report from a captured british merchant brig warned bonaparte that nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful royal navy fleet and concerned for his transports bonaparte gave urgent orders for french fleet to steer for malta arriving off valletta at 05 30 on 9 june shortly after uniting with 56 ships of civitavecchia convoy which had missed rendezvous and continued to malta alone maffeo p 259 report on nelson s activity submitted to bonaparte on 7 june was inaccurate repairs to vanguard in san pietro took six days squadron sailing on 27 may for toulon arriving off harbour on 31 may clowes p 354 nelson had already learned of departure of french fleet from a captured marseilles merchant ship but without reinforcements or knowledge of french direction he could not begin a pursuit keegan p 44 on 5 june brig hms mutine arrived off toulon and reported that a british fleet was only a few days away consisting of ten ships of line and a fourth rate sent by earl st vincent from tagus on 24 may under captain thomas troubridge in hms culloden james p 152 st vincent acting under urgent orders from london to send a fleet to mediterranean had opted to split his forces rather than risk taking all of his ships into mediterranean and leaving spanish at cadiz unattended troubridge was considered by st vincent to be best officer in fleet and nelson who also held a high opinion of troubridge immediately sailed his squadron to scheduled rendezvous point bradford p 175 on 6 june his squadron briefly intercepted a spanish merchant convoy and capturing two ships before admiral called off pursuit to ensure he arrived at agreed time on 7 june at 12 00 fleets combined nelson now commanding 13 74 gun ships of line one 50 gun ship and one brig maffeo p 243 noticeable by their absence were frigates vital for scouting operations in a campaign of this nature after his encounter with hope hardy reported to nelson that frigates were cruising independently to which admiral bitterly responded i had thought that hope would have known me better mostert p 251 nelson s search delayed until 10 june by a calm and still unaware of french intentions nelson initially sailed along corsican coast before anchoring at elba on 12 june and sending mutine into civitavecchia for information hardy was unable to discover french destination and after a detour to elba with his whole fleet nelson continued south keegan p 48 two days later admiral spoke with a tunisian ship at which passed on inaccurate information that french had been seen off trapani mostert p 253 and might be anchored at syracuse clowes p 355 on 17 june nelson anchored at pontine islands off naples and sent troubridge ashore to appeal to british ambassador sir william hamilton for information and for assistance of neapolitan navy in scouting for french although neapolitan prime minister sir john acton had already passed on reports that french were sailing for egypt hamilton did not give report to nelson possibly suspicious of disinformation keegan p 50 hamilton did however relay information that bonaparte s fleet had passed sardinia and were probably sailing in direction of malta despite private animosity towards france warner p 55 neapolitan government refused to openly join british in war and denied nelson use of their frigates bradford p 176 although they did quietly agree to resupply nelson s fleet with a rough direction established and believing ultimate french destination to be sicily bradford p 177 nelson sailed in pursuit but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass straits of messina until 20 june there he received a report from ambassador at messina that french were at malta then on 22 june near cape passaro hardy stopped a genoese ship from ragusa that reported seeing french fleet sailing southwards away from malta and that they had left valletta on 16 june gardiner p 29 this information was wrong or mistranslated in one important respect although preparations had begun on 16 june french had actually not departed until 19 june bradford p 181 and nelson s fleet was just away from brueys rodger p 459 nelson decided that french target must be egypt or constantinople and called his senior captains saumarez ball troubridge and henry darby on board vanguard for a conference together these officers determined egypt as most likely option deducing that it was best location in mediterranean from which bonaparte could threaten india padfield p 114 consequently nelson turned southeast towards alexandria exercising his men s gunnery daily to ensure they were ready for battle he planned his plan should his force encounter french was clear dividing into three squadrons his fleet would strike french at three points two squadrons of five ships each would engage french fleet directly while third would separate and attack transports sinking or capturing as many as possible james p 153 nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them he later said of this time that i had happiness to command a band of brothers adkins p 15 bonaparte at malta thumb fort rohan one of few forts whose garrison fought against french invasion of malta while nelson was gathering his fleet and searching for french bonaparte had secured first stage of his plan for invasion of egypt arriving off malta on 9 june he demanded that island s ruler ferdinand von hompesch zu bolheim grand master of knights hospitaller or knights of st john of jerusalem to allow his fleet to enter harbour and purchase provisions cole p 8 hompesch refused insisting that only two ships at a time could enter port bonaparte responded by opening fire on harbour defences and on 11 june landed soldiers at seven sites around malta under general louis baraguey d hilliers coming under fire from 2 000 native maltese soldiers that mustered against invasion skirmishing continued in western part of island for 24 hours until general claude henri belgrand de vaubois entered mdina and defenders withdrew to fortress of valletta cole p 9 maltese troops refused to continue fight without support from their government warner p 29 and negotiations followed in which hompesch and knights agreed to abandon malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million francs in exchange bonaparte gained entire maltese archipelago including fortresses military stores and cannon small maltese navy and army and entire property of roman catholic church in malta gardiner p 21 maltese position had already been severely weakened by large number of frenchmen who were part of order who refused en masse to take up arms against bonaparte french revolution had already significantly reduced knights income and their ability to put up serious resistance to bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources cole p 10 on 12 june bonaparte finally announced to his troops destination of expedition and on 19 june he sailed for alexandria initially steering east towards crete he left behind vaubois and 4 000 men to maintain malta as a base to control central mediterranean adkins p 13 to ensure that news of impending attack on egypt did not spread ahead of fleet brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted convoy during passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached alexandria maffeo p 256 on 26 june british gained first firm intelligence of french intentions when frigate hms seahorse under captain edward foote encountered and captured french frigate sensible which was returning to toulon from malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers including general d hilliers james p 208 from these prisoners destination of french fleet was discovered and seahorse joined shortly afterwards by terpsichore sailed in pursuit hoping to encounter nelson james p 160 arrivals at alexandria nelson s passage from sicily to alexandria was uneventful journey taking six days due to his lack of frigates nelson was unable to scout to flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships none of which had useful information about french fleet james p 154 lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 june when british fleet sighted four sails to southeast mostert p 254 although captain thomas thompson of hms leander requested permission to investigate strangers nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading believing french to be five days ahead and wishing to reach alexandria as rapidly as possible keegan p 56 had british frigates been available to approach and investigate distant squadron they might have discovered that they were scouts for main french fleet which was only a short distance away adkins p 14 french frigate had sighted british fleet and reported its presence to bonaparte who adjusted his convoy s direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory bradford p 182 as a result nelson s fleet passed north of french to east of malta during night in a heavy mist although nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard orient his lookouts did not observe french ships and british fleet continued ahead without deviating maffeo p 258 when dawn broke following day bonaparte s diversion to northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of british fleet which continued to southeast undisturbed bradford p 185 on 28 june mutine arrived at alexandria ahead of nelson s fleet and discovered that french fleet was not in harbour warner p 58 once main fleet had arrived attempts were made to contact british consul george baldwin but these failed as he had been dismissed by british government shortly before and had left city as a result official diplomatic channels were closed to nelson bradford p 188 a message warning of french approach was carried to ottoman governor sayyid muhammad kurayyim by hardy in mutine kurayyim replied that he had not seen french fleet and that he would enforce ottoman empire s neutrality and forbid both british and french from entering harbour or landing on coast he was dismissive of british warnings it is impossible that french should come to our country they have no business here and we are not at war with them maffeo p 257 without baldwin no further entries could be made and when there was still no sign of french on morning of 29 june nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across central mediterranean towards corfu following a more northerly course than his first voyage invasion of egypt thumb 300px alt small figure on a horse looks towards a giant statue in desert with a blue sky bonaparte before sphinx jean leon gerome c 1868 hearst castle california bonaparte s fleet delayed by its many transport ships passed cape durazzo on island of crete during 30 june and reached alexandria following morning driven by fresh winds bradford p 187 bonaparte s first action was to send a small brig into harbour to collect french consul charles who relayed news of nelson s stay off port and of kurayyim s refusal to allow french to land cole p 20 seriously concerned that nelson might return while his men were still in their transports bonaparte gave orders for landing to go ahead immediately soldiers were landed in region of creek although appearance of a sail to east was mistaken for a scout from british fleet and caused momentary panic bonaparte reportedly exclaiming fortune m tu quoi cinq jours fortune wilt thou abandon me what only five days newcomer was eventually revealed to be french frigate justice sent from malta and invasion continued unopposed james p 156 by evening landing had been completed although several boats had been wrecked in surf and bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned adkins p 17 on 2 july bonaparte led his men to victory in brief battle of alexandria and secured city he placed general jean baptiste kleber in command with rear admiral pierre dumanoir le pelley in charge of harbour finding that entrances to anchorage were too shallow to accommodate main body of french fleet bonaparte ordered brueys to sail his squadron to wider aboukir bay northeast of alexandria brueys was instructed that if he considered anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for corfu leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in alexandria mostert p 257 there brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should nelson discover them in bay although rear admiral armand blanquet of franklin argued that fleet was safest sailing out to meet british he was outvoted and overruled brueys ordering that ships remain anchored in line of battle to receive british attack james p 159 on 21 july frigates seahorse and terpsichore arrived at alexandria and observed french dispositions while flying french colours to confuse observers from shore with no sign of nelson foote and hall turned back westwards in search of admiral when brueys learned that british frigates had been seen off egyptian coast he decided that retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a british force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack warner p 65 nelson returns nelson having sailed northeast on same day that first french ships arrived off alexandria had reached anatolia on 4 july and turned westward against wind sailing for sicily again bradford p 192 his ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 july before reconstituting following day and on 18 july british fleet reached cape passaro again and on 19 july nelson s force anchored in syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by emma lady hamilton wife of ambassador to naples frustrated nelson wrote in a letter to his wife fanny every moment i have to regret frigates having left me to which must be attributed my ignorance of movements of enemy mostert p 258 reports subsequently reached british fleet at syracuse that french had not been seen in eastern mediterranean in adriatic or in aegean sea leaving either egypt or syria as only likely destinations bradford p 195 sailing once more on 25 july nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for morea and sending troubridge in culloden into coron on 28 july for news maffeo p 266 ottoman governor reported that french had been seen sailing southwards from crete at start of month and presented troubridge with a french merchant ship that was anchored in harbour warner p 62 with their first definite sighting of french british fleet turned southwards towards alexandria gardiner p 30 battle of

padfield p 118 brueys believed that his line protected by shoals to north and west was impenetrable and that as a result british would be forced to attack rear and centre of his fleet he consequently placed his strongest ships at these points planning to stall british fleet while his van used prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack padfield p 120 brueys was also confident that british fleet strung out and with nightfall approaching would not attack that day he believed that nelson would anchor off bay and attack in morning giving brueys time to prepare and leaving open option of simply sailing away during night following bonaparte s orders to avoid a direct confrontation with british fleet james p 161 nelson s attack thumb 300px battle of nile augt 1st 1798 thomas whitcombe 1816

place his lead ship guerrier close to northern shoal french admiral had left a gap widened by order for french fleet to only anchor by bow which meant that they drifted significantly between guerrier and shoals sailing directly through this gap foley raked guerrier and engaged second ship of french line conquerant mostert p 266 zealous also passed through gap and attacked guerrier and was followed by hms orion hms theseus and hms audacious all of which opened up a fierce fire on first four french ships against their unprepared port sides james p 165 nelson followed in vanguard bringing next two

gunboats were subsequently used to bombard aboukir castle and a french encampment at lake on 25 october although results were negligible after first day turkish crews were replaced with british sailors but except for a complaint from french that unfair incendiary weapons were used in attack nothing was achieved incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from captured spartiate following battle on 1 august and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water after three days bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on egyptian coast

island of corfu held out and there defenders were forced back into main town although town was besieged operations were slow and blockade was only loosely enforced allowing genereux to successfully break out and reach ancona by end of year little had changed french garrison remaining besieged in corfu clowes p 375 malta and naples further westwards newly captured french island of malta was under a much more diligent blockade returning convoy from aboukir bay under saumarez reached malta in september there he encountered a squadron of four portuguese ships of line and british ship lion under

valletta nelson despatched ships alexander culloden and colossus from his squadron at naples to blockade port under command of captain alexander ball although neapolitans refused to deploy forces to malta which was technically their territory squadron was joined within a few days by niza s portuguese ships and then by nelson now lord nelson in vanguard on 24 october four days later nelson authorised ball to negotiate surrender of nearby island of gozo french abandoned island s fortifications and british captured 24 cannon and 3 200 urgently required sacks of grain which were distributed among maltese populace with french garrison trapped in valletta no further actions took place off malta during year both sides settling in for a long siege while his captains enforced

september vanguard was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by royal family and led by a barge carrying sir william and lady emma hamilton gardiner p 47 over next weeks nelson was taken into court as an honoured guest and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities it was at this time that his mutual attraction to lady emma hamilton developed into a romantic affair he also began to dabble in neapolitan politics successfully combining with maria carolina queen to encourage ferdinand to go to war with france ferdinand ordered neapolitan army under general mack to drive french out of rome bradford p 223 resulting campaign was a disaster for neapolitans french counterattacked and forced ferdinand and his court to flee to palermo in sicily french

fleet made no major deployments during year except for a single convoy of ship of line monarca two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in april although privateers and minor warships

british ship of line lion at ensuing action of 15 july 1798 spanish ships formed a line to meet attack of captain dixon s ship but damaged frigate santa dorotea fell behind leading three frigates as leading ships returned to after a desultory long range exchange of gunfire santa dorotea was defeated and captured gardiner p 54 once french mediterranean fleet had been destroyed in aboukir bay st vincent was determined to restore british hegemony in mediterranean to ensure this his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land best island harbour in western mediterranean was at port mahon on menorca where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf extensive storehouses and a purpose built naval hospital these facilities were all british in manufacture constructed during periods of occupation by british forces between 1708 1756 and 1763 1781 gardiner p 45 st vincent therefore detached two ships of line three frigates and
