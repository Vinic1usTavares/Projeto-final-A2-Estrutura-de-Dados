prolific reading habits but claim that it originated in west africa has been disputed no earlier citation for phrase has been found and there is no record of phrase being used in west africa before

stating that he only wanted other republics on this continent to be happy and prosperous for that goal to be met corollary required that they maintain order within their borders and behave with a just

and territorial integrity nicaragua then returned contract draft with a change they wished to receive instead of an annual 100 000 6 million in ratification u s accepted deal but after congress approved contract a problem of court jurisdiction came up u s did not have legal jurisdiction in land of future canal an important note is that this problem was on verge of correction until pro panama representatives posed problems for nicaragua current leader general jose santos zelaya did not cause problems from outlook of u s interests construction of panama canal in 1899 isthmian canal commission was set up to determine which site would be best for canal nicaragua or panama and then to oversee construction of canal after nicaragua was ruled out panama was obvious choice a few

had many expansionists who wanted to annex cuba many people felt that a foreign power outside of u s would control a portion of cuba thus u s could not continue with its interests in cuba although many advocated annexation this was prevented by teller amendment which states hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said island except for pacification thereof and asserts its determination when that is accomplished to leave government and control of island to its people when summarized this could mean that u s would not interfere with cuba and its peoples expansionists argued though that teller amendment was created ignorant of actual conditions and that this released u s from its obligation following debate surrounding teller
