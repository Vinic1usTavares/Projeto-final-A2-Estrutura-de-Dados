nagorno karabakh war referred to as artsakh liberation war by armenians was an ethnic and territorial conflict that took place in late 1980s to may 1994 in enclave of nagorno karabakh in southwestern azerbaijan between majority ethnic armenians of nagorno karabakh backed by armenia and republic of azerbaijan as war progressed armenia and azerbaijan both former soviet republics entangled themselves in protracted undeclared mountain warfare in mountainous heights of karabakh as azerbaijan attempted to curb secessionist movement in nagorno karabakh enclave s parliament had voted in favor of uniting itself with armenia and a referendum boycotted by azerbaijani population of nagorno karabakh was held whereby most of voters voted in favor of independence demand to unify with armenia began in a relatively peaceful manner in 1988 in following months as soviet union disintegrated it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between armenians and azerbaijanis resulting in claims of ethnic cleansing by both sides inter ethnic clashes between two broke out shortly after parliament of nagorno karabakh autonomous oblast nkao in azerbaijan voted to unify region with armenia on 20 february 1988 declaration of secession from azerbaijan was final result of a territorial conflict regarding land as azerbaijan declared its independence from soviet union and removed powers held by

that both sides could work with in early 1993 armenian forces captured regions outside enclave itself threatening involvement of other countries in region four un security council resolutions passed in 1993 called on withdrawal of armenian forces from regions falling outside of borders of former nkao by end of war in 1994 armenians were in full control of enclave with exception of shahumyan

may 1994 but regular peace talks between armenia and azerbaijan mediated by osce minsk group have failed to result in a peace treaty this has left nagorno karabakh area in a state of legal limbo with

troops from nagorno karabakh situation in conflict zone became uncontrollable weapons vacuum as disintegration of soviet union became a reality for soviet citizens in late 1991 both sides sought to acquire weaponry from military caches located throughout karabakh initial advantage tilted in azerbaijan s favor during cold war soviet military doctrine for defending caucasus had outlined a strategy where armenia would be a combat zone in event that nato member turkey were to have invaded from west thus there were only three divisions stationed in armenian ssr and no airfields while azerbaijan had a total of five divisions and five military airfields furthermore armenia had approximately 500 railroad cars of ammunition in comparison to azerbaijan s 10 000 as mvd forces began pulling out they bequeathed armenians and azerbaijanis a vast arsenal of ammunition and stored armored vehicles government forces initially sent by gorbachev three years earlier were from other republics of soviet union and many had no wish to remain any longer most were poor young conscripts and many simply sold their weapons for cash or even vodka to either side some even trying to sell tanks and armored personnel carriers apcs unsecured weapons caches led both sides to blame gorbachev s policies as ultimate cause of conflict azerbaijanis purchased a large quantity of these vehicles as reported by foreign ministry of azerbaijan in november 1993 which reported it had acquired 286 tanks 842 armored vehicles and 386 artillery pieces during power vacuum emergence of black markets helped facilitate import of western weaponry most weaponry was russian made or came from former eastern bloc countries some improvisation was made by both sides azerbaijan received substantial military aid and provisions from turkey israel and numerous arab countries armenian diaspora donated a significant amount of aid to armenia through course of war and even managed to push for legislation in united states congress to pass a bill entitled section 907 of freedom support act in response to azerbaijan s blockade against armenia placing a complete ban on military aid from united states to azerbaijan in 1992 section 907 of freedom support act humanitarian aid was not explicitly banned but such supplies had to be routed through indirectly to aid organizations on 25 january 2002 president george w bush signed a waiver that effectively repealed section 907 thereby removing any restrictions that were barring united states from sending military aid to azerbaijan military parity is maintained

remaining republics including ukraine belarus and russia declared their independence and soviet union ceased to exist on 31 december 1991 this dissolution gave way to any barriers that were keeping armenia and azerbaijan from waging a full scale war one month prior on 21 november azerbaijani parliament had rescinded karabakh s status as an autonomous region and renamed its capital in response on 10 december a referendum was held in karabakh by parliamentary leaders with local azerbaijani community boycotting it whereby armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence on 6 january 1992

thumb azerbaijani soldiers during war 1992 sporadic battles between armenians and azerbaijanis had intensified after operation ring recruited thousands of volunteers into improvised armies from both armenia and azerbaijan in armenia a recurrent and popular theme at time compared and idolized separatist fighters to historical armenian guerrilla groups and revered individuals such as andranik ozanian and garegin nzhdeh who fought against ottoman empire during late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in addition to government s conscription of males aged 18 45 many armenians volunteered to fight and formed or detachments of about forty men which combined with several others came under command of a lieutenant colonel initially many of these men chose when and where to serve and acted on their own behalf rarely with any oversight when attacking or defending areas direct insubordination was common as many of men simply did not show up looted bodies of dead soldiers and commodities such as diesel oil for armored vehicles disappeared only to be sold in black markets many women enlisted in nagorno karabakh military taking part in fighting as well as serving in auxiliary roles such as providing first aid and evacuating wounded men from battlefield azerbaijan s military functioned in much same manner it was better organized during first years of war azerbaijani government also carried out conscription and many azerbaijanis enthusiastically enlisted for combat in first months after soviet union collapsed azerbaijan s national army consisted of roughly 30 000 men as well as nearly 10 000 in its omon paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from popular front suret huseynov a wealthy azerbaijani also improvised by creating his own military brigade 709th of azerbaijani army and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from 23rd motor rifle division s arsenal isgandar hamidov s or grey wolves brigade also mobilized for action government of azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through revenue it was making from its oil field assets on and near caspian sea former troops of soviet union also offered their services to either side for example one of most prominent officers to serve on armenian side was former soviet general anatoly who remained in nagorno karabakh for five years 1992 1997 and was involved in planning and implementation of many operations of armenian forces by end of war he held position of chief of staff of republic of artsakh armed forces estimated

1997 and 2010 and because csto did not exist then armenia had to protect its border with turkey by itself for duration of war most of military personnel and equipment of republic of armenia stayed in armenia proper guarding armenian turkish border against possible aggression in an overall military comparison number of men eligible for military service in armenia in age group of 17 32 totalled 550

to kill civilians by azerbaijanis and also russia s alleged passive and unconcerned attitude toward allowing its army s weapons stockpiles to be sold or transferred to azerbaijan kocharyan s assertion

fields in baku were producing 21 5 million tons of oil annually by 1988 that number had dropped down to almost 3 3 million outdated soviet refinery equipment and a reluctance by western oil companies to invest in a war region where pipelines would routinely be destroyed prevented azerbaijan from fully exploiting its oil wealth mid 1993 conflicts despite grueling winter new year was viewed

ceasefire was signed armenian forces of nagorno karabakh currently control almost 9 of azerbaijan s territory outside former nagorno karabakh autonomous oblast while azerbaijani forces control shahumian and eastern parts of martakert and martuni in october 1993 aliyev was formally elected president and promised to bring social order to country in addition to recapturing lost regions in october azerbaijan joined cis winter season was marked with similar conditions as in previous year both sides scavenging for wood and harvesting foodstuffs months in advance two subsequent unsc resolutions on nagorno karabakh conflict were passed 874 and 884 in october and november same points as previous two they acknowledged nagorno karabakh as a region of azerbaijan in early january 1994 azerbaijani forces and afghan guerrillas recaptured part of fizuli district including railway junction of on iranian border but failed to recapture town of fizuli itself on 10 january an offensive was launched by azerbaijan toward region of martakert in an attempt to recapture northern section of enclave offensive managed to advance and take back several parts of karabakh in north and to south but soon petered out in response republic of armenia began sending conscripts and regular army and interior ministry troops to stop azerbaijani advance in karabakh to bolster ranks of its army armenian government issued a decree that instituted a three month call up for men up to age forty five and resorted to press gang raids to enlist recruits several active duty armenian army soldiers were captured by azerbaijani forces azerbaijan s offensives grew more desperate as boys as young as 16 with little to no training were recruited and sent to take part in ineffective human wave attacks a tactic often compared to one employed by iran during iran iraq war two offensives that took place in winter cost azerbaijan as many as 5 000 lives at loss of several hundred armenians main azerbaijani offensive was aimed at recapturing kelbajar district which would thus threaten lachin corridor attack initially met little resistance and was successful in capturing vital omar pass as armenian forces reacted bloodiest clashes of war ensued and azerbaijani forces were soundly defeated in a single episode of that time s clashes azerbaijan lost about fifteen hundred of its soldiers after failed offensive in kelbajar de waal thomas caucasus an introduction oxford oxford university press 2010 p 123 several azerbaijani brigades were isolated when armenians recaptured omar pass surrounded then destroyed while political leadership changed hands several times in azerbaijan most armenian soldiers in karabakh claimed that azerbaijani youth and azerbaijanis themselves were demoralized and lacked a sense of purpose and commitment to fighting war as one armenian fighter commented difference is in what you do and what you do it for you know a few mi back is your family children women and old people and therefore you re duty bound to fight to death so that those behind you will live russian professor i mirsky lent credence to this view in his 1997 book on ruins of empire stating that karabakh does not matter to azerbaijanis as much as it does to armenians probably this is why young volunteers from armenia proper have been much more eager to fight and die for karabakh than azerbaijanis have this view received further validation in a report filed by a journalist from new york times visiting region who noted that in stepanakert it is impossible to find an able bodied man whether volunteer from armenia or local resident out of uniform whereas in azerbaijan draft age men hang out in cafes andrei sakharov famously remarked on this at outset of conflict for azerbaijan issue of karabakh is a matter of ambition for armenians of karabakh it is a matter of life or death 1994 ceasefire thumb graves of armenian soldiers in stepanakert after six years of intense fighting both sides were ready for a ceasefire azerbaijan with its manpower exhausted and aware that armenian forces had an unimpeded path to march on to baku counted on a new ceasefire proposal from either csce or russia as final battles of conflict took place near shahumyan in a series of brief engagements in armenian and azerbaijani diplomats met in early part of 1994 to hammer out details of ceasefire on 5 may with russia acting as a mediator all parties agreed to cease hostilities and vowed to observe a ceasefire that would go into effect at 12 01 am on 12 may agreement was signed by

appendix documents 38 39 in azerbaijan many welcomed end of hostilities sporadic fighting continued in some parts of region but all sides vowed to abide by terms of ceasefire media coverage valuable footage of conflict was provided by a number of journalists from both sides including vardan hovhannisyan who won 2007 tribeca film festival s prize for best new documentary filmmaker for his a story of people in war and peace and who was posthumously awarded title of national hero of azerbaijan armenian russian journalist dmitri pisarenko who spent a year at front line and filmed many of battles later wrote that both armenian and azerbaijani journalists were preoccupied with echoing official stands of their respective governments and that was being sacrificed for ideology armenian military commanders were eager to give interviews following azerbaijani offensives when they were able to criticise other side for launching heavy artillery attacks that small numbered but proud armenians had to fight off yet they were reluctant to speak out when armenian troops seized a village outside nagorno karabakh in order to avoid justifying such acts therefore armenian journalists felt need to be creative enough to portray event as an armenian counter offensive or as a necessary military operation na v karabakhe pisarenko dmitrii journalists in karabakh war dmitri pisarenko biblioteka centra

entire conflict chorbajian et al caucasian knot p 9 readers already aware of rising military islamism in middle east were considered a perfect audience to be informed of a case of muslim oppressors a christian minority religion was unduly stressed more than political territorial and ethnic factors with very rare references to democratic and self determination movements in both countries it was not until khojaly massacre in late february 1992 when hundreds of civilian azeris were massacred by armenian units that references to religion largely disappeared as being contrary to neat journalistic scheme where christian armenians were shown as victims and muslim azeris as their a study of four largest canadian newspapers covering event showed that journalists tended to present massacre of azeris as a secondary issue as well as to rely on armenian sources to give priority to armenian denials over azerbaijani allegations which were described as grossly exaggerated to downplay scale of death not to publish images of bodies and mourners and not to mention event in editorials and opinion columns post ceasefire violence and mediation nagorno karabakh conflict remains one of several

governments of armenia and azerbaijan to settle for a new solution numerous proposals have been made which have primarily been based on both sides making several concessions one such proposal stipulated that as armenian forces withdrew from seven regions surrounding karabakh azerbaijan would share some of its economic assets including profits from an oil pipeline that would go from baku through armenia to turkey other proposals also included that azerbaijan would provide broadest form of autonomy to karabakh next to granting it full independence armenia has also been pressured by being excluded from major economic projects throughout region including baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline and kars tbilisi baku railway according to armenia s former president levon ter petrosyan by giving certain karabakh territories to azerbaijan karabakh conflict would have been resolved in 1997 a peace agreement could have been concluded and a status for nagorno karabakh would have been determined ter petrosyan noted years later that karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and they thought they could get more most autonomy proposals have been rejected by armenians who consider it as a matter that is not negotiable likewise azerbaijan warns country is ready to free its territories by war but still prefers to solve problem by peaceful means on 30 march 1998 robert kocharyan was elected president and continued to reject calls for making a deal to resolve conflict in 2001 kocharyan and aliyev met in key west florida for peace talks sponsored by organization for security and

favor overall trend is clearly in azerbaijan s favor and it seems that armenia will not be able to sustain an arms race with azerbaijan s oil fueled economy and this could lead to destabilization of

side to abide by virtually sanctioned activity in war to what would be considered war crimes looting and mutilation body parts such as ears brought back from front as treasured war souvenirs of dead soldiers were commonly reported and even boasted about among soldiers another practice that took form not by soldiers but by regular civilians during war was bartering of prisoners between armenians and azerbaijanis often when contact was lost between family members and a soldier or a militiaman serving at front they took it upon themselves to organize an exchange by personally capturing a soldier from battle lines and holding them in confines of their own homes new york times journalist yo av karny noted this practice was as old as people occupying land after war ended both sides
