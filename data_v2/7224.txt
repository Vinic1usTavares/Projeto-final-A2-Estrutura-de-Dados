mangotsfield railway station was a railway station on midland railway route between bristol and birmingham north east of and from serving what is now bristol suburb of mangotsfield station was opened in 1845 by bristol and gloucester railway but had very little in way of passenger amenities station was resited in 1869 to serve new mangotsfield and bath branch line and became an important junction station with extensive facilities and six platforms passenger however failed to match station s size though at its peak eight staff were employed station closed in 1966 when services to bath ended as part of beeching cuts and line through station closed in 1969 railway became a cycle path in 1980s and is a popular resting point on route as several of station s walls and platforms are still in situ history first station thumb original station building now a private house first railway through mangotsfield was bristol and gloucestershire railway which opened in 1828 line which was horse drawn was built to convey stone and coal to bristol harbour line was built as single track standard gauge but with space for double track a connecting branch known as avon and gloucestershire railway was built from mangotsfield south towards river avon in 1830s bristol and gloucestershire railway was purchased by bristol and gloucester railway in early 1840s as part of a plan to connect gloucester with great western railway at line was converted to locomotive operation and broad gauge with services beginning in july 1844 there was initially no station at mangotsfield which was a small village in an area of farmland in march 1845 railways board resolved that a station on cheapest scale be established at mangotsfield less than two months later on 1 may 1845 station was opened it was located east of village just south of what is now main road in hamlet of shortwood at junction with avon and gloucestershire railway sited along line from bristol temple meads and from birmingham new street it was first station north from temple meads with being next station north away railways in united kingdom are for historical reasons measured in miles and chains there are 80 chains to mile it took until 1866 for another station to west to be opened between mangotsfield and bristol facilities at mangotsfield were very limited when station opened there was nothing apart from a platform either side of two running lines western up platform served trains towards gloucester and eastern down platform served trains towards bristol a shelter was added to up platform in 1848 and a brick station building was built separate from platforms however no electrical telegraph system was provided there were extensive sidings north of station by time station at mangotsfield opened bristol and gloucester railway had effectively become part of midland railway however official handover was 7 may six days after station opened station had an initial passenger service of six trains per day each way between bristol and following conversion of line to dual broad and standard gauge in 1854 passenger trains were all standard gauge which allowed direct services to occasional broad gauge goods trains operated until 1882 second station thumb a train at mangotsfield in 1958 working a service to bristol from north photo is taken from western end of station and shows extensive glass canopies which were built in 1883 when midland railway took over bristol and gloucester in 1845 it announced plans to build a branch to bath while several different plans were mooted what eventually came to pass was mangotsfield and bath branch line roughly following route of avon and gloucestershire railway south from mangotsfield to a terminus at a large triangular junction was built at mangotsfield and a new station constructed at western point of junction from centre of mangotsfield branch and with it new station opened on 4 august 1869 original station was closed to passengers but goods facilities were retained new station was west of original from bristol temple meads from birmingham new street and from bath green park next station towards bath was to south with fishponds now away and yate distant in 1888 a station was opened at west of mangotsfield second station was much more extensive than original built on southern face of rodney hill it had three platform islands giving six platform faces with junction apex forming western end of middle island northern island platform had two platforms for trains going towards birmingham northernmost platform was mostly used as a passing loop for goods trains and was known as under rock due to hill southern side was up main line centre island had its western apex at junction and was triangular in shape northern face was down main line for trains from birmingham southern face was up bath line for trains towards bath southern island s north face was down bath line serving trains from bath towards bristol and its southern side was a west facing bay platform south side of bay platform had a timber windbreak due to station s exposed site and thus platform acquired name behind box station as built was sparsely furnished there was a small building on centre platform in a standard midland railway style which housed booking office and two waiting rooms and also a shelter on bristol bound branch platform passengers were required to use a level crossing to change between platforms however through carriages whereby a carriage from one train would be transferred to a train going a different direction without need for passengers to alight were also used initial service along bath branch was 9 trains per day each way increasing to 18 each way by 1910 from 1870 most bristol bound trains were diverted from temple meads to which midland railway had opened after noting that many travellers from mangotsfield and other branches found location of temple meads to be inconvenient and would thus take omnibus instead in 1874 services began on clifton extension railway a joint railway operated by midland and great western railways to connect to bristol port railway and pier midland initially operated 13 trains per day between and mangotsfield terminating in bay platform however by 1887 these services would mostly terminate at fishponds rather than mangotsfield and service was discontinued in 1941 1874 also saw opening of somerset and dorset joint railway which had its northern terminus at bath green park providing more passengers for branch trains from north would frequently use eastern side of mangotsfield triangle and continue on south from bath triangle was also used for turning locomotives when turntable at bath was unavailable main line services also increased by 1882 there were ten trains each way between bristol and gloucester via mangotsfield with trains variously continuing to cheltenham worcester and birmingham significant enhancements were made to station in 1883 designed by midland railway architect john holloway sanders and built by john garlick of birmingham original station buildings were deconstructed and sold to local tradespeople with new stone buildings erected western daily press described new building on centre platform in extensive detail as part of reconstruction a large glass roof was built on each platform using a total of 138 iron posts and of rolled plate glass in an iron frame canopies were ridged along platforms rather than perpendicular as was usual midland design wooden shelters were built on outer island platforms all platforms were lengthened to allow longest midland trains to call and all laid with asphalt a subway with passages and stairs of painswick stone was built to provide access between platforms replacing level crossings station even had its own gas works which also supplied neighbouring station at warmley there were no catering facilities as per stipulation of previous landowner who was also owner of a local hotel there was however a book stall by this point a signal box had been constructed at western end of southern island thumb a northbound train departing mangotsfield in 1958 chocolate factory is visible in background a carson s chocolate factory was opened in middle of mangotsfield railway triangle in early 1910s served by a private siding and with its own cricket pitch tennis courts and bowling green factory became a well known landmark for rail travellers as well as an extra source of passengers for station station also became site of regular releases of racing pigeons in 1923 grouping resulted in midland railway being absorbed into london midland and scottish railway mangotsfield s peak usage came in inter war years when station staff consisted of a station master two booking clerks two foremen and three porters however mangotsfield itself never saw large amounts of traffic it had been built for and was considered a somewhat desolate place actor arnold ridley was once stranded at station and sound of a train passing on eastern side of triangle out of sight of station inspired him to write his play ghost train during second world war glass platform roofs were removed as a precautionary measure in event of air raids making station even more unwelcoming to passengers thumb station closed in 1966 and tracks were lifted in 1972 this photo from that same year shows down main line platform passenger traffic declined following war and when railways were nationalised in 1948 following passage of transport act 1947 mangotsfield came under aegis of london midland region of british railways 1950s saw an increase in road travel and rail passenger numbers declined eastern side of mangotsfield triangle closed on 18 september 1962 and with great western main line providing an alternate route from bristol to bath beeching report of 1963 recommended closure of branch from mangotsfield to bath green park goods facilities at original site of station were withdrawn on 10 june 1963 and local stopping services between bristol and gloucester ended on 4 may 1965 passenger services along bath branch were to be withdrawn from 3 january 1966 but had a temporary reprieve due to difficulties with rail replacement bus service line and station eventually closed two months later on 7 march 1966 trains continued to pass station site non stop for several years however as there were two routes between bristol and yate via and via mangotsfield it was decided to close line through mangotsfield as an economy measure line was slated to be closed on 3 january 1970 but on 26 december 1969 an embankment collapse near blocked line and it was never reopened post closure thumb western end of station in 1973 after tracks had been lifted thumb since closure station has become part of bristol bath railway path following closure of railway route fell into disuse buildings at mangotsfield became derelict with some demolition taking place central and southern island platforms remained in situ as did some of walls of central platform buildings tracks were lifted in 1972 but that same year a group of local residents aided by robert mp set up bristol suburban railway society which would later become avon valley railway society s aim was reinstatement of route from bristol to bath via mangotsfield from a base at however after reaching in 1988 further extension towards mangotsfield became impractical due to housing and transport developments trackbed through mangotsfield was disused until late 1970s when cycling charity sustrans began to convert route from bristol to bath into a cycle path path built between 1979 and 1986 and known as bristol bath railway path was first major project undertaken by sustrans and is oldest part of national cycle network part of national cycle route 4 path now handles over a million travellers per year mangotsfield in its railway path guise is once again a junction as a branch from main path now heads north along old railway alignment towards emersons green platforms provide a resting point for pedestrians and cyclists and replica railway tickets are inlaid in platform surface iron pillars which supported glass platform canopies have been replaced with trees planted by sustrans volunteers station and cycle path are now owned by south gloucestershire council and sustrans path is lit but only during winter months as lights are turned off in summer to allow glow worms to breed rest of mangotsfield railway area has mostly been built over eastern part of mangotsfield triangle is now part of a4174 bristol ring road chocolate factory in centre of triangle was demolished in 1998 and area including land directly south of station outside triangle is now a housing estate with chocolate and railway themed road names original station
