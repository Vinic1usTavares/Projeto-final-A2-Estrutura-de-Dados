is first serialized action manga written and illustrated by tite kubo zombiepowder was published in japan in 1999 by shueisha who printed it in weekly shonen jump magazine for 27 chapters before cancelling it series was collected into four paperback volumes released following year zombiepowder is distributed in north america by viz media who licensed it in 2005 although critical reception in united states was largely mediocre series achieved moderate commercial success in western market due to prominence its author had by that point achieved for his second manga series bleach zombiepowder follows a teenaged boy named elwood shepherd who joins with mysterious criminals gamma akutabi and c t smith in their search for rings of dead these rings are a group of legendary artifacts with power to resurrect dead and grant immortality to anyone who collects 12 of them series has a weird west setting which mixes a background of sparsely populated frontier settlements and gunslinger aesthetics with modern conveniences occult magic supernatural martial arts and mad science trio travel from town to town in this world fighting other criminals for possession of rings of dead protagonists obtain three of rings in course of story but due to series cancellation eventual success or failure of their quest is unknown series was a commercial failure in japan but has been successful in united states critical consensus is that zombiepowder was a technically proficient manga but one which lacked originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers which accounted for its cancellation additionally series was heavily focused on battles even by standards of action manga though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention due to these factors combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending critics hold that zombiepowder is significant primarily as a chapter in career of its author and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action setting and plot zombiepowder is set in a western themed environment with inconsistent levels of technology similar to that found in yasuhiro nightow s manga series trigun most prominent characters in series are powder hunters individuals who seek titular zombie powder zombie powder is a life giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force grant them immortality and even raise people from dead zombie powder can only be obtained from rings of dead these rings are dangerous magical artifacts that individually devour life force of anyone they touch rendering them comatose this stolen life energy is converted into zombie powder which can only be extracted if twelve rings of dead are brought together story begins with young pickpocket john elwood shepherd befriending powder hunter gamma akutabi after a botched attempt to rob him gamma is a highly wanted criminal who possesses one ring of dead another member of local gang for which elwood works sees two together and assumes that elwood is harboring criminal in hopes of turning him in for his substantial bounty gang attacks elwood s home and gamma comes to rescue but not before elwood s sister sheryl is slain by gang s leader following gang attack elwood decides to accompany gamma in his powder hunting in hopes of resurrecting sheryl after leaving elwood s hometown pair meet up with gamma s long time partner c t smith another wanted powder hunter smith has infiltrated ranks of ash daughter a gang which has found a ring of dead three challenge gang s leader calder and gamma slays calder using his mastery of fictional sword art karin a martial art which grants its users pyrokinesis elwood gamma and smith thereby gain a second ring of dead concluding first arc and volume of series remaining three volumes concern themselves with battle for a third ring which has been embedded for years in body of a comatose young man named emilio getto gamma and company learn of emilio s existence from his sister wolfina a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in rings of dead group of hunters offer to restore emilio to consciousness in exchange for ring he contains before they can do so however emilio is kidnapped by balmunk mystic a powder hunting magician who leads a circus themed gang wolfina teams up with elwood gamma and smith to retrieve emilio and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with balmunk s henchmen conflict culminates in a fight between gamma and a giant golem summoned by balmunk which gamma defeats with help of a berserk state balmunk is beaten but not killed and departs swearing revenge upon gamma after rescuing emilio gamma arranges to have ring of dead removed from his body by an old friend mad scientist gemini characters are brought to gemini s lab by cooney a young girl with power of teleportation once there gemini agrees to operate to remove ring from emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on wolfina due to series early cancellation zombiepowder is ended without a solid conclusion final chapter shows gamma and smith leaving elwood and wolfina behind as they depart gemini laboratory whose staff have just begun operation to save emilio it is left ambiguous whether elwood chooses to follow gamma and smith stay with wolfina and emilio or become a powder hunter in his own right characters gamma team leader and main combatant of zombiepowder s cast is a 22 year old powder hunter who desires zombie powder for sake of immortality and has already obtained one ring of dead at his introduction in first chapter due to numerous past violent crimes gamma is one of most wanted criminals in zombiepowder universe with a bounty to match this high bounty was one of first things determined about gamma s character by tite kubo dating back to a pre draft rendition of character who was a sort of samurai gamma s personal history is never expounded upon but it is implied by balmunk that he was once a mercenary but reformed and became a powder hunter following death of a woman throughout series gamma bests his enemies using his superhuman strength and speed a steel plated right arm which allows him to catch bullets and a large sword chainsaw hybrid other abilities gamma possesses are mastery of which is a fictional ancient sword art which grants him a controllable aura called black flame of death and a berserk state balmunk refers to as gamma s black monster neither of these elements is fully explained in course of story theron martin of anime news network considered gamma to be a typical bad ass anti hero good at creating mayhem and not much else ign s review of series treated him similarly saying his role of protagonist who wields a lot of power and hides a dark secret was done effectively but not remarkably and was typical of shonen action manga alexander gorban of russian animemaniacs magazine believed gamma s typical nature as a hero with an inner demon was offset by character s devilish charm and portrayed willingness to fight to last breath to not lose his humanity he noted that aspects of this personality were reused for bleach protagonist ichigo kurosaki who would also bear some similarities in physical appearance to gamma gorban felt however that these same strengths of character made gamma dominate cast and that zombiepowder would have been improved if he had simply been its sole protagonist john elwood shepherd referred to more commonly as elwood is a 13 year old pickpocket who joins up with powder hunters gamma and smith in an effort to resurrect his dead sister sheryl ann shepherd he is introduced in first chapter of series his character is named after records co founder joey elwood a real life music producer whose name kubo thought fit elwood s character design perfectly elwood has great talent with throwing knives and is ingenious in combat but struggles to overcome his sidekick status and measure up to abilities of his superhuman partners smith and gamma both see elwood as a younger version of gamma which fills gamma with hope and pride but also fear that elwood may turn to evil this concern prompts smith and gamma to leave elwood behind at gemini laboratory at end of manga so that he can find his own way without gamma s influence whether elwood decides to follow pair or not is left ambiguous reviewers of zombiepowder found elwood s character mostly unremarkable due to his similarity to numerous other tag along protege characters found in manga ed chavez reviewer for mangacast said he grew fond of his character while he read but that he suffered from sidelining by gamma while den of geek thought his motivation for seeking zombie powder was an effective twist on usual plot device of avenging a dead relative c t smith is introduced in third chapter of zombiepowder as an apparent antagonist a hired assassin working for ash daughters gang this is however a disguise and smith is actually gamma s long standing partner in powder hunting smith is least developed member of main cast with little known backstory or motivation it is implied that he is like gamma a legendarily dangerous criminal smith possesses superhuman speed and dexterity is above average at everything and fights using handguns and an armored briefcase he has no other known abilities but according to duo gamma and smith are each incapable of killing other tite kubo s character commentary for smith in volume one states that smith s appearance was based on a london banker and notes that c t in his name was eventually meant to hold some plot significance compared to his two fellow protagonists c t smith was considered more novel anime news network said he was one of few fresh points of series and had most distinctive design among cast though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else mangacast s reviewer on other hand found his role mostly extraneous due to being overshadowed by gamma animemaniacs magazine online noted that smith s physical appearance was later echoed by bleachs central antagonist getto nicknamed wolfina is an 18 year old paparazzi journalist who specializes in criminal expose stories her brother emilio hosts a ring of dead that he found 8 years before main storyline ring has been consuming his life force ever since forcing him into a coma wolfina is introduced in ninth chapter of series and joins up with main characters soon after in order to protect her brother from balmunk she fights using a modified camera tripod she calls tripod of justice at end of series she agrees to work for zanza gemini for a year as an experimental subject in order to pay for operation of removing ring of dead from emilio she is thus left behind by gamma and smith as they continue their powder hunting critical reaction to wolfina s character was limited with reviewers contrasting her large breasted character design to otherwise lanky shojo manga esque designs used in series and praising her novel weapon choice balmunk referred to by his stage name balmunk mystic is a sorcerer powder hunter and serial killer nearly as wanted as gamma he gathers rings of dead solely for excitement seeking them brings balmunk is introduced in eleventh chapter and takes role of primary antagonist for remainder of series balmunk leads a gang made up of criminals with superpowers and weaponry based on traditional circus acts and freak show performances such as fire swallowing and box impalement trick his magical powers include summoning abilities which allow him to create weapons call upon henchmen and beasts such as tigers and in his most powerful technique create a giant golem named from one of his own limbs balmunk kidnaps emilio in order to obtain ring of dead within him but is defeated by gamma balmunk holds a personal grudge towards gamma and knows about gamma s berserker personality history behind their rivalry is never revealed though he states that gamma nearly killed him once before balmunk and his circus troupe were received positively in reviews which considered group a colorful and creepy opposing threat a scene at end of volume 2 in which balmunk offers to return emilio s body to wolfina unharmed but without his head was cited by mangacast as an eerie and effective character builder anime news network said his character was a unique application of circus villains trope that while not original is a rarity in eastern comics and rarely done so outlandishly even in west alexander gorban considered balmunk best written character in series and his arc a grand circus of memorable scenes and battles thanks to his personal charisma and author s resourcefulness in selecting powers for balmunk and his troupe production and release according to tite kubo zombiepowder originated as an idea for a samurai manga which would have been titled samurai drive this initial conception of story had very little in common with end product as it did not feature western elements or titular zombie powder it did star a version of gamma however who still bore an over sized sword and bounty and featured scifi technologies with respect to premise of zombiepowder author stated that theme was fighting and a world where hope for resurrection lay not in god but obtaining a mysterious substance tite kubo did not comment on his influences for series but critic theron martin believed its tone setting and style drew heavily on cyberpunk manga battle angel alita dark fantasy manga berserk and fellow sci fi western manga trigun and a e sparrow of ign noted obligatory genre influence of martial arts anime dragon ball z series also borrows terminology from music industry referring to each chapter as a track bonus omake content in each volume as b sides and naming primary character elwood after a record label founder zombiepowder began serialization in shueisha s weekly shonen jump on august 2 1999 and ran a brief 27 chapters before being canceled on february 28 2000 according to author s commentary in cover leaf of third volume tite kubo was in a state of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it and only began to be happy with quality of series as it neared its ending speaking retrospectively 12 years later kubo stated that he was not yet used to scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote zombiepowder and that at time he paid too much attention to his editor s comments rather than trusting his own ideas other than tite kubo zombiepowder had five credited staff though their exact roles in its production were never specified series was collected into four volumes published in 2000 in japan zombiepowder was licensed for english distribution by viz media in 2005 following success of tite kubo s second manga series bleach first english volume was released in united states in september 2006 and last was released in june 2007 a french language edition began publication through tonkam in 2013 viz media releases preserve japanese reading order and overlay visual sound effects with equivalent english text english lettering was criticized for being overly large which anime news network thought made characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments there are several additional differences between japanese and english volume releases of zombiepowder cover of second manga volume which featured an illustration of c t smith holding a gun to his own head was replaced in english edition with new art of gamma in sunglasses english editions of volumes 2 4 also each contain a one shot story from early in kubo s career which were not present in japanese collections ultra unholy hearted machine rune master and bad shield united respectively these extra stories were included for two apparent reasons to further appeal to zombiepowder s primary english speaking audience of bleach fans interested in development of tite kubo s style and to expand length of later volumes which would otherwise have been shorter than viz s normal releases to standard chapters reception thumb alt elwood battles a gang leader in first chapter of series zombiepowder s battle scenes are typified by their graphic violence minimal use of backgrounds and quick angle changes between panels all of which can be seen here zombiepowder sold modestly in japan but has been commercially successful in united states second volume placed in top 100 graphic novels for christmas 2006 theron martin of anime news network believed series could have achieved some success in united states without bleach connection due to american market s larger appetite for series which focus on violent action but that series was heavily buoyed by bleachs international popularity and primarily imported for an audience of kubo critical reception of zombiepowder as a whole mostly deemed it mediocre and average two reviews from anime news network ranked it as a c it received a c review from mangacast a den of geek review gave it 3 5 stars and an ign review concluded it was no better or worse many other shonen titles with not much to separate it from massive stock of shonen series that are similar to it jason thompson included it in a list of mediocre shonen action titles whose cliched nature and ripped off character designs left them interesting only to readers unacquainted with tropes of genre universal criticism in these reviews is that series as a whole lacks originality with most mentioning that it reads very much like author s first effort it is and would therefore appeal mostly to fans of author while he echoed most individual criticisms of english language reviewers a divergent conclusion was reached by russian critic alexander gorban of animemaniacs magazine online who believes that zombiepowder s fundamentals were all strong and that failure of series in japan was instead due to tite kubo s overreach in publishing a series in highly competitive weekly shonen jump at such a young age had freshman author been serialized in a less prominent magazine asserts gorban zombiepowder would have been allowed longer to establish itself and could have developed into a series at least as good as bleach reception for individual elements of zombiepowder was more mixed series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ann and ign but deemed sufficient for needs of story by amo and parasitic nature of rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by mangacast and ign for lending suspense to plot setting was criticized by ann and gorban alike for not having much effort put into it being too similar to trigun and seeming to be chosen just for sake of coolness while ign liked mixture of old west arcane and technological quality of individual characters in series was again considered a mixed bag both in artistic design and characterization but with a consensus across reviews that characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes of all elements of series zombiepowder s action sequences received most feedback battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by anime news network with rough drawings and few backgrounds though in its second review ann noted a guiding philosophy to background omission elements of scene which were not props in fight faded out whenever action began ann also said that action was entertainingly violent kinetic well paced easy to follow and interspersed well with comedic moments they ultimately concluded action was handled better than average but with disclaimer that action was entire sum and substance of series ign opened their review with a tite kubo quote from first volume s flap theme is fighting sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine but if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read and said that if this advice was taken zombiepowder could be a great shonen tale but that without it story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series gorban s view was again most positive stating that essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other and that series grasped this notion admirably finally den of geek found zombiepowder s wall to wall action sequences colorful and fun but complained that sheer mass of them overwhelmed rest of story references specific general external links category 1999 manga category
