history finbarr of cork thumb left upright 1 1 modern church at gougane barra church grounds are located south of river lee on holy island on one of many inlets forming great marsh of munster mor na saint fin barre s is on site of at least two previous church buildings each dedicated to fin barre of cork patron saint of cork city and founder of monastic hermitage at gougane barra finbarr was born in about 550 he was by legend given gougane barra as a place of contemplation and visited cork city to lay foundation stones for one true christian faith by legend after finbarr died his remains were brought to cork to be enclosed in a shrine located on site of today s cathedral archaeological evidence suggests first site at fin barre s probably dates from 7th century and consisted of a church and round tower which survived until 12th century after which it fell into neglect or was destroyed during norman invasions medieval and 18th century churches thumb photograph of early stage of construction a 1644 reference to site notes that in one of suburbs of cork there is an old tower ten or twelve feet 3 3 m in circumference and more than one hundred feet 30 m high believ ed to have been built by st baril finbarr building was badly damaged in 1690 during siege of cork after which only steeple remained intact due to an outbreak of fire and impact of a 24 pound 11 kg shot from elizabeth fort in nearby barrack street cannonball was rediscovered during 1865 demolition and is now on display in cathedral church was demolished in 1735 and replaced same year by a smaller building as part of a wider phase of citywide construction and renovation only earlier spire was retained for new building older part of this church was described in 1862 as doric in style attached to a featureless modern tower with an ill formed spire building was widely considered to be poorly designed dublin builder described it as a shabby apology for a cathedral which has long disgraced cork while parliamentary gazetteer of ireland judged it a plain massive dull tasteless oblong pile totally destitute of what is usually regarded as cathedral character and possessing hardly a claim to any sort of architectural consideration it was demolished in 1865 19th century building in april 1862 church of ireland in pursuit of a larger more attractive cathedral and determined to reassert its authority in response to a resurgent catholicism initiated a competition for a replacement building which became commission for first cathedral to be built in british isles since london s st paul s following february designs of architect william burges then 35 were declared winner of competition to build new cathedral burges disregarded ps15 000 budget and produced a design that he estimated would cost twice as much despite protestations of fellow competitors it won his diary records his reaction got cork while cathedral accounts mention a payment of ps100 as prize money foundation stone was laid on 12 january 1865 unfinished cathedral was consecrated in 1870 and spires topped out in 1879 burges used earlier unrealised designs for exterior including those intended for crimea memorial church istanbul st john s cathedral brisbane and elevations for lille cathedral main obstacle was economics despite efforts of fundraisers cork was unable to afford a large cathedral burges partially alleviated this by designing a three spired exterior which enhanced size of building to viewers he realised early on build would vastly exceed money city had raised superiority of his design was recognised by bishop of cork john gregg who supported burges and lobbied for additional funding gregg was instrumental in sourcing additional money including local merchants such as william crawford of crawford brewing family and francis wise a local distiller final total was significantly over ps100 000 burges assured by efforts of gregg was unconcerned gregg died before completion of project in his place his son robert continued his father s support and in 1879 ceremoniously placed final stone on eastern spire by then contractors estimated that build was nearing its completion with only a number of pre designed stained glass fittings left to be installed cathedral holds book of estimates prepared for decoration of west front nicholls was paid ps1 769 for modelling and robert mcleod ps5 153 for carving burges took 10 per cent for design more than his usual 5 per cent apparently due to his high level of personal involvement its construction took seven years before first service was held in 1870 during first building phase three firms of contractors were employed owned by chronologically robert walker gilbert cockburn and john delany who eventually completed construction of spires in 1879 building carving and decoration continued into 20th century long after burges death in 1881 including marble panelling of aisles installation of reredos and side choir walls and 1915 construction of chapter house saint fin barre s is described by architectural historians david lawrence and ann wilson as undoubtedly burges greatest work in ecclesiastical architecture with an interior that is overwhelming and intoxicating through his ability careful leadership of his team artistic control and by vastly exceeding intended budget burges produced a building which though not much larger than a parish church has been described as a cathedral becoming such a city and one which posterity may regard as a monument to almighty s praise 20th and 21st centuries thumb southern side mindful that cathedral was unlikely to be finished in his lifetime burges produced comprehensive plans for its decoration and furnishing recorded in his book of furniture and book of designs at end of 20th century a major restoration of cathedral costing ps5 million was undertaken this included reinstatement and restoration of twin trumpets held by resurrection angel which had been vandalised in 1999 restoration programme also saw cleaning repointing and repair of exterior of building including re carving of some of burges gargoyles where repair proved impracticable cathedral s heating system was also replaced when it was found to be damaging intricate mosaic floor in 2006 lawrence and wilson published first detailed study of cathedral s history and architecture cathedral is one of three cathedrals of anglican diocese of cork cloyne and ross notable interments in graveyard include those of archbishop william lyon died 1617 richard boyle died 1644 ware james antiquities and history of ireland dublin a crook 1705 p 36 and in a family vault first lady freemason elizabeth aldworth died exterior architecture cathedral s style is gothic revival burges preferred period which he used for his own home tower house in london he reused elements of unsuccessful designs he had earlier produced for competitions for cathedrals at lille and brisbane shell of building is mostly limestone sourced from near cork with interior walls formed from stone brought from bath red marble came from little island purple brown stone from fermoy each of three spires supports a celtic cross a reference to saint patrick seen as a foundational ancestor by both irish catholics and protestants this inclusion was an implicit statement of national identity but was against burges wishes his initial design included weather vanes a choice rejected by building committee who according to historian o callaghan wanted church to retain continuity with one true faith of ancient past spires had a troubled construction it was a difficult build from a technical point of view and thus expensive to fund cost reached ps40 000 early in build with a further ps60 000 spent by time spires were in place along way a number of sub contractors were hired and dismissed contract was eventually completed by cork builder john delaney hired in may 1876 by end of following year main and two ancillary spires were complete sculpture thumb upright burges copper gilt resurrection angel placed over sanctuary roof alt robed figure of a standing winged angel with two straight trumpets gazing down an 1881 estimate by local stonemason mcleod suggests that burges provided around 844 sculptures of which around 412 were for interior total of some 1 260 sculptures include 32 gargoyles each with different animal heads burges oversaw nearly all aspects of design headquartered in his office in buckingham street and on numerous site visits most modern scholars agree that his overarching control over design of architecture statuary stained glass and internal decorations led to cathedral s unity of style he considered sculpture as an indispensable attribute of architectural effect and at saint fin barre s believed he was engaged upon a work which has not been attempted since west front of wells cathedral in designs for pieces decorating cathedral burges worked closely with thomas nicholls who constructed each figure in plaster and with mcleod and local stonemasons who carved almost all of sculptures in situ burges designs for western facade were based on medieval french iconography he considered this front to be most important exterior feature as it would be lit by setting sun and thus most dramatic theme is last judgement with representations of twelve apostles bearing instruments of their martyrdom wise and foolish virgins resurrection of dead and beasts of evangelists gilded copper resurrection angel facing eastwards on main spire is locally cathedral s most iconic feature and colloquially known as goldie angel it was designed by burges and erected in 1870 free of charge as his gift to city in recognition of cork s willingness to fund his original design and positioned in place of an intended wrought iron cross thumb left tympanum last judgement imagery of tympanum is taken from book of revelation with divine on upper register and mortals below it shows an angel accompanied by john evangelist measuring temple in jerusalem while beneath them dead rise from their graves of these sculptures victorian critic charles eastlake writing in a history of gothic revival considered that no finer examples of decorative sculpture have been produced during revival burges found it difficult to realise some of his original images for sculptures and stained glass panels a number of them contained frontal nudes including designs for creation of planets figures of adam and eve christ in glory our lord as king crucified dead rising from their graves and welcoming angels in august 1868 some protestant committee members led by chancellor george webster rejected use of images of naked human body in ecclesiastical iconography especially in images of christ and forced burges to provide clothed designs modesty providing loin cloths or strategically placed foliage or books in frustration burges wrote i am sorry to see puritanism so rampant in cork i wish we could transplant building to england his revised designs were reviewed in april and may 1869 but were again rejected both gregg and dean arthur edwards supported burges and moved decision from general committee to a select vestry sub committee although webster continued to object modified designs were finally approved interior plan and elevation thumb upright apse and sanctuary ceiling cathedral s plan is conventional west front is opened by three entrance doors leading to nave with internal vaulting arcade triforium and clerestory rising to a timber roof beyond nave pulpit choir bishop s throne and altar end in an ambulatory small floor plan drew criticism both at time and in later years building is relatively short at 180 feet length but contains all of traditional elements of a cathedral of much greater size a contemporary critic robert rolt brash wrote effect of this is to make building look exceedingly short and disproportionately high although modest in size compact design makes most of small footprint three spires allow illusion of greater interior space main features burges designed majority of interior including mosaic pavement altar pulpit and bishop s throne narrow and unusually high marble nave from red and puce stone is supported by large columns supporting central tower and spire exterior gives impression of a large structure which is at odds with reduced size of interior where choir sanctuary and ambulatory take up almost half of floor space interior is filled with colour most especially from stained glass windows this aspect of interior is in marked contrast to uniform and austere grey of exterior thumb left view from gallery cylindrical pulpit is located near entrance and was completed in 1874 but not painted until 1935 like baptismal font it is placed on four sculpted legs it contains five stone relief figures assumed to be four evangelists and paul apostle sitting on an upturned pagan altar and a winged dragon below reading stand baptismal font is located near entrance its ledge is decorated with a carving of head of john baptist font s bowl is of cork red marble and supported by a stem also red marble a marble shaft of sculpted capitals and an octagonal base brass lettering reads we are buried with him by baptism into death lectern reading desk is made of solid brass from a design burges had originally intended for lille cathedral it is decorated with heads of moses and king david there is a heroes column war memorial by choir at dean s chapel it contains names of 400 men from dioceses killed in battle during first world war a processional cross completed in 1974 by patrick pye is located in front of dean s chapel 46 foot great oak throne of cork dioceses bishop was installed in 1878 alongside a statue of fin barre of cork and a kneeling angel stained glass burges conceived iconographical scheme for stained glass windows designed individual panels for each of 74 windows and oversaw every stage of their production according to maurice carey in consequence windows have a consistent cohesive style and follow a logical sequence in subject matter panels were cartooned by h w lonsdale and manufactured in london between 1868 and 1869 by william saunders who worked in burges office before forming his own firm of stained glass makers doctrinal objections to some of figures particularly of christ lead to a delay of four years with their eventual installation between 1873 and 1881 four windows remain incomplete lonsdale s cartoons are kept at cathedral many of figures relate to christian iconography and echo those in tympanum including in ambulatory a window showing god as king of heaven overlooking evangelists matthew mark luke and john in panel matthew takes human form mark is depicted as a lion luke as an ox while john takes form of an eagle as elsewhere in cathedral illustrations can be divided between divine wise and foolish scheme begins and ends with two rose windows at west front and south transept respectively west rose window shows god as creator resting on a rainbow and in act of blessing he is surrounded by eight compartments each inspired by scenes from book of genesis beginning with creation of light and ending with birth of eve and adam naming animals south transept rose window known as heavenly hierarchies places christ king in centre with compartments containing a series of angels archangels and cherubim separate glass sheets containing building tools are placed between each angelic compartment nave windows contain signs of zodiac each lancet by arcade contains a grisaille panel these scenes are mostly from old testament while those from transepts onward are of prophets who foretold christ s coming or from new testament clerestory panels above high altar depict christ reigning from his cross alongside his mother john three marys and various disciples windows around ambulatory include scenes from life of christ culminating in a representation of heaven at worship from book of revelation pipe organ thumb saint fin barre s organ pipes organ was built in 1870 by william hill sons it consisted of three manuals over 4 500 pipes and 40 stops main organ utilised a tubular pneumatic action with tracker action for other two manuals it was in place for cathedral s grand opening on saint andrew s day 1870 and positioned in west gallery but moved to north transept in 1889 to improve acoustics maximise space and avoid its interference with view of windows that year a 14 foot pit was dug in floor beside nave as new location for organ its maintenance has been one of most expensive part of cathedral s upkeep it was overhauled in 1889 by cork firm t w who added three new stops organ was moved from west gallery balcony down to a pit in north transept where it sits today most of choir organ is housed in an enclosure attached to console lid of which can be raised or lowered electrically by organist next major overhaul was in 1906 by hele company of plymouth who added a fourth manual solo by this stage action of organ was entirely pneumatic in 1965 1966 j w walker sons ltd of london overhauled soundboards installed a new console with action and lowered pitch by 2010 organ s electrics were unreliable trevor crowe was employed to reconstruct and increase number of pipes and make tonal enhancements including a 32 extension to pedal trombone project cost eur1 2m and took three years to complete references notes sources external links cork category 19th century church of ireland church buildings category churches completed
