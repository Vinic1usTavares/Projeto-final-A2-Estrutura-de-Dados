10 78 blue shift received a mixed reaction from critics holding overall scores of 67 40 and 71 100 on review aggregator sites gamerankings and metacritic respectively game has sold around 800 000 copies at retail this figure does not include later sales on steam in a review for ign critic tal blevins noted that blue shifts gameplay is pretty much what we ve come to expect out of half life by blending action and puzzle solving stating that latter were all logical and well done although some of jumping puzzles were frustrating though ign praised game for maintaining epic feel of original blevins was critical of relatively short length of game gamespot reviewer greg kasavin agreed with many of ign s criticisms stating that it s not that game is easy so much that it s extremely short and that blue shift doesn t amount to much on its own terms in addition kasavin described graphical enhancements brought about by high definition pack as helpful but noted that they still don t make half life look like a new game nor are many of changes themselves very noticeable other reviews echoed complaints about similarity of blue shift to previous games gamespy s reviewer jamie madigan stated that what really pulls game down is more of same factor although writing that game feels like just a few more levels for original game he noted that this is what blue shift was designed to be given its origins as an add on for a dreamcast version of half life madigan described single player campaign as decent and commented that high definition pack made game worthy of consideration eurogamer echoed criticism on game s length reviewer tom bradwell commented that although i m hard pressed to criticize what you get complete absence of everything we ve learnt from likes of counter strike and everything since is frankly bizarre bradwell did however criticize game s artificial intelligence and occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall pc zones mark hill was more lenient in his comments praising game s artificial intelligence as intelligent as you could hope an ai enemy to be in addition hill praised game for showing more activity in base noting that a whole world goes on around you with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry complex is more alive than ever before hill also praised focus on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than two or three models that were cloned throughout facility who kept repeating same phrases describing this as blue shifts greatest achievement pc zones review closed by commenting that as a dreamcast extra it works perfectly but as a standalone pc title there s not nearly enough to it references external links gearbox software official website category 2001 video
