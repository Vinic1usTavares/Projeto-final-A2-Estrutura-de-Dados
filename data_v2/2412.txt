to win jackpot have borrowed every available copy of shirley jackson s book lottery at local library one of them is homer who throws book into fireplace after kent reveals that of course book does not contain any hints on how to win lottery it is rather a chilling tale of conformity gone mad in her book shirley jackson essays on literary legacy bernice murphy comments that this scene displays some of most contradictory things about jackson it says a lot about visibility of jackson s most notorious tale that more than 50 years after its initial creation it is still famous enough to warrant a mention in world s most famous sitcom fact that springfield s citizenry also miss point of jackson s story completely can perhaps be seen as an indication of a more general misrepresentation of jackson and her work episode contains several references to previous episodes of simpsons for instance santa s little helper gets picked up by a car on a street called michael jackson expressway a reference to season three premiere episode stark raving dad in which mayor quimby had expressway renamed in honor of an expected visit by michael jackson in another scene ned flanders is seen wearing

equivalent to about 13 1 million viewing households which made simpsons highest rated show on fox week episode aired since airing dog of death has received positive reviews from television critics tom adair of scotsman considers it to be a classic episode of show and mark of ugo s named it one of his personal favorites from season three episode s reference to a clockwork orange was named 10th greatest film reference in history of show by total films nathan ditum nate meyers of digitally obsessed rated dog of death a3 of 5 and commented that people who like dogs will enjoy episode in part because of mr burns attack dog training program which meyers called a brilliant reference to a clockwork orange he added that episode is unlikely to satisfy devoted fans and relationship between family and santa s little helper will not register to casual viewers still there are enough laughs especially in animal hospital to keep audience entertained dvd movie guide s colin jacobson also praised parody of a clockwork orange describing it as possibly funniest clockwork orange parody i ve ever seen jacobson added that episode as a whole offers a terrific program from cracks about lottery and public hysteria that open program to calamities that befall family when santa s little helper gets sick to bizarre escapades that greet pooch when he splits dog of death provides a hilarious piece authors of book i can t believe it s a bigger and better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood praised several scenes from episode including homer s dream of winning lottery mr burns brainwashing of santa s little helper and closing line of episode that no dogs were harmed in filming of this episode a cat got sick and someone shot a duck but that s it bill gibron of dvd verdict commented that santa s little helper s twisted stomach means family must budget themselves to pay for surgery and results are some of best lines in history of show from lousy chub night to snouts hard knock life seems to enliven homer into one sarcastic bastard in 2007 mikey cahill of herald sun named this episode s chalkboard gag i saw nothing unusual in teacher s lounge third best chalkboard gag in show s history while reviewing episode in 2011 nathan rabin of a v club noted perhaps because he s a fucking dog santa s little helper is never developed as fully as other characters so requisite episode ending orgy of sentimentality when santa s little helper is joyously reunited with bart feels a little cheap and unearned references external links dog of death at
