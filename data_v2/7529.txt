anderson were more traditional country in their sound than tracks cook produced highlighting is that a tear and somewhere between moon and you as strongest and most country sounding cuts stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote that album was another crowd pleasing set of contemporary country like his previous albums song selection is a hit or miss affair with about half of songs failing to make much of an impression remainder however proves why lawrence is one of most popular singers in nashville in 1996 billboard ranked lawrence as tenth most played radio artist in any genre that year 1997 1998 coast is clear lawrence s fifth studio album coast is clear was issued in march 1997 and achieved an riaa gold certification two months later like its predecessor it featured some songs

certainly pleasant yet it tends to fade into background jeffrey b remz of country standard time thought that album maintained a constantly country sound and had well witten songs in late 2000 atlantic records closed its nashville division and moved all artists including lawrence to nashville branch of parent company warner bros records his only release for that label tracy lawrence accounted for two low charting singles in life don t have to be so hard and what a memory lawrence and anderson produced album and wrote several songs on it with other contributing writers including michael white casey beathard billy yates and frequent collaborator larry boone both country standard time and allmusic praised album for having a more consistent and traditional sound than its predecessors with former s scott homewood calling it quite possibly his best album and latter s liana jonas complimenting lyrics of both singles along with scaled down production allmusic biographer steve huey wrote of album that despite some good reviews it failed to halt his downward commercial momentum lawrence also said that he felt that label did not invest in promotion of album due to a lack of interest in his musical style and direction as a result he began seeking out new producers in an attempt to reinvent him self he considered buddy cannon byron and billy joe walker jr before choosing to reunite with stroud two began recording for what would have been a second album for warner bros in 2002 but lawrence was dropped from label s roster 2003 2004 strong after being dropped from warner bros lawrence

airplay reaching number four on hot country songs and number 42 on hot 100 in early 2004 corresponding album strong came out in 2004 and it consisted largely of material from unreleased second project for warner bros nashville album s follow up singles it s all how you look at it and sawdust on her halo were less successful at country radio lawrence noted that he had writer s block when attempting to come up with material for album and thus sought outside writers instead of his usual collaborators he described title track about a divorced woman moving on with her life a different than anything i ve done in past while calling stones most traditional song and noting presence of story songs throughout he also noted that album was almost titled stones but was renamed in order to avoid confusion with his debut album sticks and stones erlewine wrote in allmusic that strong ranks among his smoothest albums a record dominated by ballads and where up tempo songs are as polished as slow ones peter cooper of tennesseean thought that album had better written songs than its predecessors highlighting paint me a birmingham and sawdust on her halo in particular but criticizing application of auto tune to lawrence s singing voice robert woolridge of country standard time thought that lawrence s singing was stronger on ballads such as paint me a birmingham as opposed to more upbeat material but criticized mainstream production 2005 2006 then now hits collection following closure of dreamworks nashville in 2005 lawrence transferred to mercury nashville that same year there he released compilation then now hits collection which included fifteen of his previous hits all of which except paint me a birmingham had to be newly recorded as label did not own rights to original recordings made while he was on atlantic two new tracks were included as well both of which were released as singles a cover of mark nesler s 1998 single used to pain and if i don t make it back which was co witten by bobby pinson of this compilation erlewine wrote these new versions are a little more laid back than originals and they re a little slicker too and while that doesn t necessarily suit lawrence s voice which has grown a little thinner over years that doesn t make then and now a bad listen 2006 2008 for love and all wrapped up in christmas in 2006 lawrence started his own record
