sequel to i can only imagine regarding these comparisons millard said i can only imagine took focus off of what you are going through and was comforting because it put focus on where they were going homesick is opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here i don t think as a christian that it s right for me to say i wish you could ve stayed here because truthfully we re getting raw end of deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be whole idea is that we re ones who have to wait millard has also noted difference with homesick as compared to i can only imagine is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away when you lose somebody you learn what being homesick is really about reception critical reception
