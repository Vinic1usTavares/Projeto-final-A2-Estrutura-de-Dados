mersea fort also known as cudmore grove blockhouse was an artillery fort established by henry viii on east mersea coast in 1543 it formed part of king s device programme to protect against invasion from france and holy roman empire and defended river colne that led to town of colchester it was triangular in shape with earthwork walls and three bastions to hold artillery it was demobilised in 1552 but was brought back into use several times over next century and saw service during second english civil war of 1648 fort hosted an admiralty court to oversea local oyster trade until dilapidation of site forced court to move to moot hall in colchester in middle of 18th century a new gun battery was built at fort during napoleonic wars but fortification then fell into decline and was extensively damaged by construction of a sea wall along coast remains of earthworks were excavated by archaeologists between 2002 and 2003 history 16th 17th centuries mersea fort was built as a consequence of international tensions between england france and holy roman empire in final years of reign of king henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications and while france and empire remained in conflict maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of england seemed unlikely modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but in general fortifications were limited in scale thumb left simplified plan of fort in 1533 henry broke with pope paul iii over annulment of his long standing marriage to catherine of aragon catherine was aunt of charles v holy roman emperor who took annulment as a personal insult this resulted in france and empire declaring an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraging two countries to attack england an invasion of england appeared certain in response henry issued an order called a device in 1539 giving instructions for defence of realm in time of invasion and construction of forts along english coastline county of essex was not a priority for new investment but town of harwich was reinforced in 1539 and further new fortifications including mersea fort were built along coast in 1543 under direction of richard lee and richard cawarden at an estimated total cost of ps2 717 fort was positioned on salt marshland on south side of river colne and would have protected entrance to estuary working together with new blockhouses built at st and brightlingsea mersea was triangular with earthwork walls between approximately long further protected by round baskets filled with earth and a defensive ditch with a drawbridge on each of three corners was a circular bastion housing up to four guns buildings in courtyard would have housed garrison which comprised a captain a lieutenant two soldiers a porter and between three and six artillery gunners there was a nearby jetty probably for use by fort in 1552 fort was decommissioned but was subsequently recommissioned by mary i in addition to fort s military role it hosted a court to oversee along east mersea coast which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing in 1566 colchester introduced new rules to govern oyster trade which were enforced by an admiralty court held when necessary in mersea fort location was chosen so as to demonstrate town s authority all way up to top of estuary a survey in 1586 showed fort had been abandoned by military once again defences were in a poor state guns barrels were clogged with dirt and site had been occupied by an elderly woman it was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first spanish armada and then privateers english civil war and interregnum during first english civil war between supporters of king charles i and parliament mersea fort saw no action after victory of parliament in 1646 fort s garrison was demobilised conflict flared again in 1648 with outbreak of second english civil war and colchester was taken by royalists town was immediately besieged by general thomas fairfax who quickly seized mersea fort which controlled supply route by river into colchester before royalists could do so fort had contained five pieces of artillery two culverins two sakers and one drake a royalist raiding party of 300 soldiers was sent to recapture fort but without success mersea fort was placed under command of captain william burrell guns and ammunition were kept there in case of a fresh rebellion with a garrison of 36 men which was temporarily reinforced by an additional squadron of horsemen and 50 foot soldiers in july 1650 repairs were made from 1651 onwards and new accommodation was constructed for fort s gunners after an invasion scare in 1655 mersea was temporarily used to imprison royalists suspected of planning an insurgency against oliver cromwell s commonwealth government fort was then demobilised by cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs burrell was ordered to dismantle fort but order was never carried out partially because of practical difficulties and because of opposition from owner of land admiralty court continued to be held in fort although it proved much harder to enforce fishery rules because of political turmoil 18th 21st centuries thumb marshland around fort overlooking estuary and brightlingsea by 18th century mersea fort was in ruins fishery rules were reinforced by fresh legislation in 1758 which created a court of conservancy to oversea oyster stocks officially this court was supposed to sit at fort but rather than using now dilapidated earthworks it began to meet in colchester s moot hall instead a ceremony began to take place each year at mersea stone near to fort involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking fort was recommissioned during napoleonic wars at start of 19th century and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking sea equipped with six 24 pounder 10 9 kg guns after this fort was abandoned once again a sea wall was built along coast early in century cutting through south east side of fort legislation on oysters was reformed by parliament in 1870 which disbanded previous court structure and severed historic link with mersea fort a defensive pill box was constructed at castle during second world war in 21st century remains of site are protected under uk law as a scheduled monument site was surveyed in 1982 and excavations were carried out
