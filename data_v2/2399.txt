spinophorosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in what is now niger during middle jurassic period first two specimens were excavated in 2000s by german and spanish teams under difficult conditions skeletons were brought to europe and digitally replicated making spinophorosaurus first sauropod to have its skeleton 3d printed and were to be returned to niger in future together two specimens represented most of skeleton of genus and one of most completely known basal sauropods of its time and place first skeleton was made holotype specimen of new genus and species spinophorosaurus nigerensis in 2009 generic name spine bearing lizard refers to its spiked osteoderms and specific name refers to where it was found a juvenile sauropod from same area was later assigned to genus subadult holotype specimen is estimated to have been around in length whereas paratype was about long shoulder height reached by these individuals was estimated at around and weight at about braincase was short deep and broad and neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal sauropodomorphs and more derived neosauropods teeth were spatulate spoon shaped and had large spaced denticles at top of crown an ancestral feature in sauropods neck of spinophorosaurus is one of most completely known among sauropods containing 13 dorsal vertebrae had multiple small air filled internal chambers a feature typical of later more derived sauropods tail was powered by strong musculature and had a rear section that was rather rigid due to long and overlapping chevron bones osteoderms bearing spikes appear to have been placed on tail tip in two pairs a similar feature is seen in related shunosaurus spinophorosaurus has been classified as either a very basal sauropod or inside eusauropoda a more derived group anatomy age and location of specimens indicate that important developments in sauropod evolution may have occurred in north africa possibly controlled by climatic zones and plant biogeography features of vestibular apparatus suggest that vision and coordinated eye head and neck movements were important in spinophorosaurus due to completeness of spinophorosaurus 3d models have been made of skeleton and used to test its range of motion one study suggests it may have been a high browser and another examined possible mating postures spikes on tail may have been used for defence sutures between neural arches with centra of vertebrae were more complex in front part of trunk of spinophorosaurus since stresses were probably greatest in that region spinophorosaurus is known from irhazer shale a geological formation thought to be middle jurassic in age it was formed by deposits from rivers and lakes in a great river valley system discovery thumb left alt drawn map showing dinosaur localities in niger map showing dinosaur localities around agadez niger large star middle indicates irhazer shale where spinophorosaurus was found rich dinosaur fauna of niger was brought to scientific attention through french and italian excavations in 1960s and 1970s this led to description of new genera from lower cretaceous rocks most prominently iguanodontian ouranosaurus an older succession of rocks tiouraren formation was explored by american palaeontologist paul sereno who conducted a large scale excavation campaign in niger between 1999 and 2003 although initially thought to fall within lower cretaceous formation is now thought to be of a much older middle jurassic age sereno named new dinosaurs such as sauropod jobaria and theropod from tiouraren most finds were discovered along a cliff known as falaise de tiguidit in southern agadez region in sereno left partial jobaria skeletons in field as a tourist attraction starting in 2003 paldes project paleontologia y desarrollo palaeontology and development was conducting excavations in southern agadez region a cooperative effort between spanish science and humanitarian institutions paldes aimed to combine palaeontological research with a developmental program for region this included improvement of infrastructure education structures and promotion of tourism including planned construction of a new palaeontological museum in thumb alt group of people by a desert camp paldes team in niger 2007 early in 2005 german explorers ulrich joger and edgar sommer explored semi deserts south of agadez after local tuaregs had informed sommer about occurrence of large bones in region sommer is founder of cargo a relief organisation specialised in improving local education system for tuareg people while joger is a biologist and director of state natural history museum braunschweig germany on their return route they chatted with a group of tuaregs who then directed them to a hilly area nearby that was littered with small bone fragments this locality where dinosaurs had not been excavated before is about north of falaise de tiguidit and near town of aderbissinat in agadez region and part of irhazer shale or de l irhazer a geological formation below and thus slightly older than tiouraren after a one hour search joger discovered a rounded bone tip sticking out of surface which after further excavation turned out to be a complete femur upper thigh bone of what would later become holotype specimen of spinophorosaurus an associated scapula shoulder blade and a were discovered soon after sediment in locality a hard but brittle siltstone could be removed from bones using light hammer blows joger and sommer then hired local tuaregs for support and after two days had uncovered most of specimen which included a virtually complete articulated vertebral column and several limb and pelvic bones vertebral column formed an almost complete circle tip of tail being located where skull would be expected but was not found lacking equipment and an excavation permit they covered specimen with debris for protection and returned to germany now planning a full scale scientific excavation to be carried out by braunschweig museum an official excavation permit was promised to museum in 2006 by republic of niger in return museum was to build and equip a new school for local tuareg children in settlement of in autumn of 2006 sommer and joger together with other associates of braunschweig museum revisited site in preparation for excavation putting one of pelvic bones in plaster to test equipment and methodology team also discovered theropod tracks around from site sponsors for financing both school and excavation were found early in 2007 official campaign dubbed projekt dino started on march 1 2007 when two trucks with equipment left braunschweig for niger taking a route via spain morocco mauritania and mali shorter route through sahara was not possible due to risk of terrorist attacks other part of team which comprised ten permanent members arrived by airplane it was first german dinosaur expedition to africa in almost a

these activities vanguard of german team found an empty dig site showing signs of a professional excavation upon their arrival on march 16 trucks arrived on march 20 although disappointed german team discovered a second spinophorosaurus specimen future paratype apart from first on march 17 an exploratory trench within an area littered with small bone fragments soon revealed jaw and tooth fragments on next day ribs vertebrae a humerus upper arm bone and a scapula could be identified eight local excavation helpers joined group on march 19 on march 20 before arrival of trucks freshwater reserve of

fossils were packed for transport to port of cotonou on april 3 on same day echika revealed to team that first skeleton had been excavated by a spanish group with his permission he promised to lead team to another fossil site located around south of agadez at cliff of tiguidit as compensation there team found rear part of a possible jobaria skeleton but was forced to leave largest block in field until next season to discourage others from collecting block an explosive dummy was fabricated and attached to fossil labeled with a warning in spanish german team retrieved block next season in 2008 paldes team had canceled their excavation plans for that year following outbreak of tuareg rebellion 2007 2009 two spinophorosaurus specimens were provisionally housed in spanish and german museums by contract with republic of niger they were to be returned to country in future managed by musee national d histoire naturelle in niamey as well as by a smaller newly built local museum future paratype specimen arrived in germany on march 18 2007 for its preparation which took two and a half years braunschweig museum rented a separate factory building in parallel a joint paper was prepared by now cooperating german and spanish teams german team digitised prepared bones and fragments of both specimens in 3d using laser scanning as skeleton in braunschweig was only 70 complete specimen in spain was used to fill in missing pieces during this process it was discovered that skeleton in spain was one germans had initially discovered and lost 3d scans were digitally repaired and printed in 3d and assembled into a mounted skeleton for braunschweig museum s exhibition first sauropod skeleton reproduced through 3d printing a life sized model of a living spinophorosaurus nicknamed namu after museum s name was put up in front of main entrance of museum spanish team produced separate 3d models from photographs of holotype using photogrammetry where photos are taken of an object from different angles to map them a caudal vertebra was put on display at elche museum in 2018 in a 2018 conference abstract garcia martinez and colleagues announced that they reconstructed morphology of second back vertebrae which is poorly preserved based on better preserved first and fifth back vertebrae this was done using landmark based geometric morphometrics where corresponding 3d coordinates are collected from each vertebra and analysed statistically thumb alt model of a long necked dinosaur outside a museum spinophorosaurus model nicknamed namu outside braunschweig museum first skeleton

palaeontologist kristian remes and colleagues of german and spanish teams in 2009 generic name is composed of spina latin for spike greek for to bear and sauros which means lizard spine bearing lizard in full name refers to presence of osteoderms bearing spikes specific name refers to niger where taxon was discovered holotype specimen consists of a a postorbital bone a squamosal a a pterygoid a surangular and a nearly complete postcranial skeleton which lacks sternum manus and pes second paratype specimen nmb 1698 r consists of a partial skull and an incomplete postcranial skeleton elements preserved in this specimen but not holotype include a premaxilla maxilla lacrimal dentary angular dorsal ribs of right side humerus and a pedal phalanx two specimens are considered to belong to same taxon since skeletal elements that overlapped between them were identical and because of proximity of skeletons in same stratigraphic layer at time it was described spinophorosaurus was most completely known middle jurassic sauropod from north africa and by 2018 was considered to be one of most complete early non sauropods in 2012 adrian paramo and francisco ortega from paldes team reported a small sauropod skeleton that had been discovered on ground a few metres from two spinophorosaurus specimens all fossils were probably from same beds small skeleton consists of 14 vertebrae some articulated including all neck vertebrae as well as some back vertebrae centra of its vertebrae are 20 smaller than those of spinophorosaurus and neurocentral suture is open indicating it is a juvenile several distinct features of skeleton are shared with spinophorosaurus and though some features of that genus are not present it most likely represents a juvenile spinophorosaurus differences probably explained by ontogeny changes during growth description thumb left alt diagram showing known bones of a long necked dinosaur with a human in front of it skeletal reconstruction size based on

has fully fused neurocentral sutures skull thumb alt photo of fragmentary skull bones skull elements of holotype braincase a c right quadrate and pterygoid bones d e and upper end of right quadrate f g frontal bones of were fused in midline unlike other sutures of skull between frontals was a small about in front of suture between frontal and parietal bones rear margin of skull had an open notch a feature otherwise only known in dicraeosaurids and a notch following midline at front of conjoined frontal bones indicates there might have been a prong extending from each nasal bone to between frontals as may have been case for nigersaurus but is unusual among sauropods in general upper temporal fenestrae a pair of major openings on skull roof were four times broader than long such broadened fenestrae were typical for shunosaurus and more derived or advanced sauropods occipital condyle at back of skull was concave on sides like in shunosaurus a pair of extensions on underside of skull base that served as muscle attachments were enlarged and were directed to sides unique among known sauropods quadrate did not have a concavity on hind side an ancestral condition otherwise only known in tazoudasaurus among sauropods spatulate spoon shaped teeth were unique in possessing enlarged spaced denticles around top of crown with a higher count of denticles on front edge of crown braincase of spinophorosaurus was broad and short from front to back moderately deep and of relatively large size overall it differed significantly from those of other jurassic sauropods possibly except they shared a on their that were similar in being directed strongly backwards a ct endocast of holotype s brain cavity showed it was similar to most sauropods in having pontine and cerebral that were well marked a pituitary fossa that was large and oblong and in that structure of brain was obscured by spaces that housed relatively thick meninges as well as by dural venous sinuses labyrinth of inner ear was characteristic in having long and slender semicircular canals similar to those of massospondylus and giraffatitan its neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal or primitive sauropodomorphs and more derived neosauropods vertebrae and ribs thumb alt photos of vertebrae left vertebrae and clavicle d vertebral column is almost completely known and holotype is one of few sauropod specimens that include a complete neck neck was composed of 13 trunk had 12 and four tail comprised more than 37 complex elements individual vertebrae are composed of a lower part and an upper part important landmarks of neural arch include upwards projecting spinous process and sideward projecting which together give vertebra a t shape in front and rear views pairs of connecting with neighboring vertebrae are protruding from front and rear cervical vertebrae were similar to those of jobaria and cetiosaurus their centra were approximately 3 1 times as long as wide they were therefore moderately elongated compared to sauropods in general but generally longer than in other basal forms cervical centra had large excavations on their sides that deepened towards front such were also developed in jobaria and patagosaurus unlike in jobaria pleurocoels were not subdivided by an oblique bony ridge a midline keel was present on underside of front end of centrum which was absent in cetiosaurus tips of prezygapophyses had a triangular extension which is also seen in jobaria although it is deeper in that genus above postzygapophyses were comparatively large bony projections for muscle attachment cervical vertebrae were different from those of basal sauropods from south america and india sideward facing processes of neural arch were inclined to face slightly downwards and had triangular flanges on their rear margins features unseen in those southern forms furthermore neural spines were rugose wrinkled on their rear and front surfaces and close to base of neck broader in side view and less high in side view a u shaped depression was present between centrum and neural arch which is an autapomorphy unique feature of spinophorosaurus thumb alt 3d model of a long necked dinosaur life restoration dorsal vertebrae were unusual in having a internal structure containing multiple small air filled chambers this feature is otherwise known in much later as well as in mamenchisaurids where it evolved independently from former group although front dorsal vertebrae showed deep pleurocoels in their centra these openings became much shallower towards rear of trunk rearmost dorsal vertebrae were also proportionally short in and patagosaurus in contrast rearwards dorsals were more elongated and had pronounced pleurocoels neural canal of dorsal vertebrae was very narrow but high hyposphene articulations accessory articular processes were present in all dorsals making spine more rigid neural spines had marked rugosities on their front and back sides as in other basal sauropods frontmost caudal vertebrae had same rugosities on neural spines as seen in dorsals a feature otherwise only known in in hind part of tail neural spines were strongly inclined backwards and extended over front part of succeeding vertebra similar to some east asian sauropods barapasaurus and jobaria ribs of second to fifth dorsal vertebrae were flattened and backwards directed while those of sixth to eleventh dorsal were more circular in cross section and more vertically oriented ribcage can therefore be clearly subdivided into a pectoral and a lumbar section such a differentiation has only been described in a single other sauropod dicraeosaurid brachytrachelopan furthermore ends of pectoral ribs had attachment sites for sternal ribs which connected to sternum in front part of tail bones below vertebral centra were blade like which is basal condition in rear part of tail chevrons were rod like and left and right counterparts separated from each other these rod like chevrons would have been closely attached to bottom edges of centra they articulated with preceding and succeeding chevrons at mid length of vertebral centra thus bracing vertebral joint restricting bending of tail girdles and limbs thumb upright alt photo of various bones spike like osteoderms a c girdle and limb elements scapula was unique amongst sauropods being strongly curved with an expanded fan shaped lower end it was d shaped in cross section a feature characteristic for eusauropods its upper end was broadened and featured a bony flange on lower margin in these respects it was similar to mamenchisaurids from asia but different from gondwanan forms vulcanodon barapasaurus and patagosaurus in which upper end was only weakly broadened and rear flange lacking which articulated to lower end of scapula showed a distinct kidney shape considered an autapomorphy it had a large biceps tubercle to which biceps muscle attached clavicle was robust although more slender than in jobaria of forelimb only humerus is preserved its lower end was asymmetrical and had enlarged accessory condyles forward directed projections on lower front margin of bone features otherwise only seen in mamenchisaurids pubis and ischium of pelvis were robust latter being broadened at its end upper femur thigh bone was characterised by presence of a on its upper end a bony projection serving as attachment site for muscles that drew hind leg forwards and inwards fourth trochanter which projected from back surface and anchored muscles that drew hind leg backwards was especially large in spinophorosaurus close to fourth trochanter was a large opening that is absent in other sauropods and thus an autapomorphy tibia shinbone was similar to that of other basal sauropods and fibula calf bone was robust of ankle upper side of had facets for articulation with tibia and fibula that were not separated by a bony wall and as many as eight openings that allow blood vessels to enter bone tail spikes a left and a right osteoderm bone formed in skin were found with holotype skeleton these bones had a roundish base from which a spike like projection protruded inner surfaces were rugose and concave although found within pelvic region they are thought to have been situated on tip of tail in living animal a distinguishing feature of genus evidence for this position can be derived from fact that left and right elements were found closely together suggesting they came from near midline of body furthermore stiffening of hind part of tail by elongated chevrons is also observed in other dinosaurs showing tail clubs or spikes similar spines were part of a tail club in related sauropod shunosaurus such a tail club was likely not present in spinophorosaurus as hindmost caudal vertebrae became too small right osteoderm was somewhat larger than left and slightly different in shape this indicates they did not form a pair in which case they would probably be simply mirror inverted counterpart of one another rather these differences indicate two pairs of spines were present originally preliminary results of an ongoing restudy of spines suggested that they were not tail spikes after all but instead represented clavicles classification thumb alt 3d scans of a braincase and brain cavity upright ct scans of holotype braincase with endocast of brain and inner ear below neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal sauropodomorphs and more derived neosauropods initial phylogenetic analysis presented by remes and colleagues suggested spinophorosaurus fell among most basal sauropods known being only slightly more derived than vulcanodon cetiosaurus and tazoudasaurus in this position it would form sister taxon of eusauropoda a clade comprising all more derived sauropods authors conceded that support for this very basal position was weak and discussed several alternative placements within eusauropods that would explain anatomical similarities with other sauropods from northern africa and laurasia a similarly basal position outside of eusauropoda was suggested by several subsequent studies which placed spinophorosaurus as sister taxon of tazoudasaurus or in a 2013 conference abstract palaeontologist pedro mocho and colleagues re evaluated phylogenetic relationships of genus by incorporating further information from newly prepared bones arguing that spinophorosaurus was nested within eusauropods according to this analysis genus was more derived than shunosaurus and barapasaurus and close to patagosaurus and mamenchisaurids a much more derived systematic position within eusauropoda was also proposed by a 2015 study which found spinophorosaurus to be sister taxon of cladogram based on nair and salisbury 2012 which supports a basal position of spinophorosaurus cladogram based on xing and colleagues 2015 which supports a more derived position within eusauropoda evolution left thumb alt drawn map showing world during middle jurassic congruence between middle jurassic sauropod distribution and palaeoclimatic zones middle is spinophorosaurus type locality as one of most completely known basal sauropods spinophorosaurus has helped to shed light on early evolution and of group this has been unclear due to a sparsity of early and middle jurassic remains particularly outside asia remes and colleagues found that spinophorosaurus shares features with middle jurassic east asian sauropods especially in neck and tail vertebrae scapula and humerus but is very dissimilar from lower and middle jurassic south american and indian taxa differences include shape and development of vertebra features and shape of scapula and humerus they suggested this could be explained by middle jurassic sauropod faunas of laurasia northern supercontinent of time and south gondwana southern supercontinent having been separated by geographic barriers earlier it was believed that sauropods were distributed across supercontinent pangaea which was composed of laurasia and gondwana during early and early middle jurassic it had relatively little diversity until continent broke up and led to sauropod groups evolving in isolation through vicariance during late middle and late jurassic spinophorosaurus shows that features once thought to be derived among east asian sauropods are rather plesiomorphic ancestral traits among eusauropods eusauropods that colonised laurasia retained basal features also seen in spinophorosaurus eusauropods which colonised south gondwana were a specialised line of group which had lost said ancestral features during isolation remes and colleagues noted that more evidence was needed to support these interpretations but were confident that there was a connection between jurassic sauropods of north africa europe and east asia as indicated by anatomy of spinophorosaurus and pattern of middle jurassic sauropod distribution important developments in sauropod evolution may have occurred in north africa it was close to equator and had a summer wet climate in early and middle jurassic with high plant productivity and diversity on other hand sauropods of south gondwana were isolated from equatorial region by central gondwanan desert in early jurassic leading to differences in south and north gondwanan floras when desert shrank in late middle jurassic neosauropods appeared and replaced sauropod fauna that had been typical of middle jurassic since jobaria of north africa is close to base of neosauropoda and because neosauropods such as were widely distributed in upper jurassic neosauropods and some of their subgroups may also have originated in equatorial region of jurassic pangaea which may have acted as a hot spot in sauropod evolution jurassic diversification of sauropods was possibly controlled by climatic zones and plant biogeography rather than just continental differentiation palaeobiology thumb upright alt drawing of an embedded dinosaur tooth dentary tooth of paratype note enlarged spaced denticles near top of crown spinophorosaurus and some other sauropodomorphs did not have reduced vestibular apparatuses a sensory system for balance and orientation in inner ear though this might have been expected in a lineage that led to heavy plant eating quadrupeds it is unknown why spinophorosaurus retained this feature but size and morphology of sauropodomorph labyrinths may be related to neck length and mobility for example it is possible expansion of vestibular apparatus is an indicator of importance of vision and coordinated eye head and neck movements though interpretation of sauropod vestibular features are still uncertain at a 2018 conference benjamin and colleagues reported radial fibrolamellar bone rfb a type of bone tissue characterised by radially oriented channels in outermost part of cortex outermost bone layer of humerus belonging to an adult spinophorosaurus specimen and a young adult isanosaurus normally cortex in long bones of sauropods shows a fibrolamellar complex instead rfb is considered to be fast growing bone tissue and has not been reported in sauropods before its presence in outermost cortex is unusual as it would usually be expected in innermost cortex corresponding to juvenile growth rfb of spinophorosaurus was buried in outer cortex followed by a normal fibrolamellar complex which indicates animal survived for some time after its accelerated growth which probably suggests pathological bone growth due to injury a 3d model of holotype skeleton shows a body plan with inclination towards vertical lengthening which is consistent with high browsing but more testing of animal s range of motion for example has to be done to support this idea motion since spinophorosaurus is one of most completely known basal sauropods it is a good model for biomechanical studies that help to understand sauropod biology and function of anatomical features manipulation of 3d model by vidal and colleagues in 2015 showed that each of frontmost 20 tail vertebrae could deflect up to and 8 in sideways flexion before limited by bone morphology actual range of movement in a live animal would have been smaller as soft tissue as well as large chevron bones would have been a limiting factor first 20 tail vertebrae also became longer towards end of tail as seen in diplodocids and were powered by enlarged musculature as indicated by large chevron bones and upwards angled transverse processes in first tail vertebrae movement in rear part of tail was limited as chevrons were overlapping as is also case in dromaeosaurids and ankylosaurids together these features of tail may have been part of a specialised function which is unknown joger and colleagues have argued spikes that may have formed a at end of tail would have been used for defence against predators in 2017 john and jeffrey wilson used spinophorosaurus as a model to study how complexity of neurocentral sutures rigid joint connecting neural arch of a vertebra to its centrum in sauropods may have contributed to strength of spine sauropods reached their often enormous body sizes by both rapid and extended growth as long as an individual was growing neurocentral sutures were composed of cartilage to permit this growth upon reaching full body size this cartilage would turn into bone closing suture cartilage however is much less resistant to forces that could potentially dislocate neural arch such as bending and torsion these become especially relevant at large body sizes sauropods and other counteract this structural weakness by increasing complexity of suture meaning that surfaces that connect neural arch to its centrum had complex ridges and furrows that interlocked in spinophorosaurus suture complexity was most pronounced in front part of trunk indicating that stresses were highest in this region probably because of weight of long neck and rib cage complexity became weaker towards skull and sacrum orientation of ridges allows for identifying type of stress that affected vertebra in neck vertebrae ridges would mainly have prohibited dislocation of neural arch in a front to back direction while ridges in trunk vertebrae were more effective in impeding rotation in a 2018 conference abstract vidal used virtual spinophorosaurus skeleton to test hypothetical mating postures that have been proposed for sauropods that would involve a cloacal kiss as is performed by most birds rather than a male intromittent organ such hypotheses include leg over back male mounting from behind with female standing or lying down as well as backwards mating postures that resulted in dislocation or osteological stops were not considered feasible leg over back posture was rejected since it would be impossible for a standing male to reach its leg over back and hip of a crouching female even if it was half size of male and it is unknown if sauropods were sexually dimorphic in size posture wherein male mounted female from behind while resting its front legs on back of female was possible tail was flexible enough to get out of way but even if female was lying down cloacae would not approach each other close enough for a cloacal kiss cloacal kiss would only be possible through backwards mating wherein male and female approached each other backwards and joined their cloacae with their tails flexed sideways and movement of legs would allow individuals of different sizes to mate this way backwards mating is only way sauropods could have mated without need of a male intromittent organ such a pose is common in mating arthropods and in tied phase of mating carnivoran mammals such as canis vidal and colleagues presented a study at a 2018 conference wherein they examined effect of intervertebral soft tissue and its thickness on posture and range of motion in sauropod necks using spinophorosaurus as a model studies have shown that there are notable changes in neck posture and proportional shrinking of soft tissue which contributes to neck length from younger to adult giraffes researchers used 3d models of pairs of neck vertebrae of a juvenile and an almost adult spinophorosaurus to test whether this applied to sauropods as well and to see if they could make same predictions by using 3d models of giraffe neck vertebrae by comparing with dead and living giraffes as was true for giraffes it was found that virtual neck of juvenile spinophorosaurus had more intervertebral space a lower neutral posture and a smaller range of motion than adult they therefore concluded that neutral posture of neck would shift and range of motion would increase with ontogeny in sauropod palaeoenvironment thumb alt four sharp weathered fossil teeth upright left four theropod teeth found with holotype spinophorosaurus is known from irhazer shale of niger which has been determined to represent base of irhazer group based on presence of red clay that show interbedded sand beds with traces of subaerial exposure and dinosaur footprints which is stratigraphically below outcrops of group irhazer group was earlier considered jurassic to earliest cretaceous in age as overlying tiouraren formation was once considered to be of lower cretaceous age subsequent studies have found latter formation to be middle jurassic to early late jurassic and phylogenetic position of spinophorosaurus compared with other basal sauropods from around world indicates it could be middle jurassic bajocian bathonian in age since strata of irhazer group cannot yet be directly dated it might be as old as lower jurassic lower limit is defined by underlying agadez group which is upper triassic in age based on presence of chirotherium trace fossils thumb upright alt photos of two toed dinosaur tracks in a desert two toed theropod tracks found near spinophorosaurus specimens spinophorosaurus skeletons were discovered in a massive to finely laminated red siltstone whose matrix contained some carbonate fossils were recovered from upper half of this several metres thick siltstone layer layers there are subhorizontal bearing minor faults and commonly contain and carbonate at top of unity about a metre above level with skeletons sediments of irhazer group were deposited under conditions that were fluvio lacustrine associated with rivers and lakes during a time when basin was part of a great river valley system which was connected with proto atlantic coast of gondwana through adjacent basins four theropod teeth were found closely associated with spinophorosaurus holotype by a vertebra pubis and in acetabulum three had similarities with and while fourth belongs to what may be one of earliest known members of spinosauridae fact that teeth are poorly preserved while spinophorosaurus skeleton is well preserved indicates that teeth were transported before being buried with sauropod dinosaur tracks were found some hundred metres away from spinophorosaurus site including a trackway of six footprints from a mid sized sauropod as well as 120 well preserved didactyl two toed theropod footprints didactyl tracks were originally thought to have been left by paravian theropods such as dromaeosaurs or troodontids which have two weight bearing toes but were subsequently interpreted as having been produced by swimming theropods explaining
