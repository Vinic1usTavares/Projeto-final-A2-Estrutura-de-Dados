they had reached two days earlier farthest south refers most southerly latitude reached by explorers before conquest of south pole in 1911 significant steps on road to pole were discovery of lands south of cape horn in 1619 captain james cook s crossing of antarctic circle in 1773 and earliest confirmed sightings of antarctic mainland in 1820 from late 19th century onward quest for farthest south latitudes became in effect a race to reach pole which culminated in roald amundsen s success in december 1911 in years before reaching pole was a realistic objective other motives drew adventurers southward initially driving force was discovery of new trade routes between europe and far east after such routes had been established and main geographical features of earth had been broadly mapped lure for mercantile adventurers was great fertile continent of terra australis which according to myth lay hidden in south belief in existence of this supposed land of plenty persisted well into 18th century explorers were reluctant to accept truth that slowly emerged of a cold harsh environment in lands of southern ocean james cook s voyages of 1771 74 demonstrated conclusively likely hostile nature of any hidden lands this caused a shift of emphasis in first half of 19th century away from trade and towards sealing and whaling and then exploration and discovery after first overwintering on continental antarctica in 1898 99 adrien de prospect of reaching south pole appeared realistic and race for pole began british were pre eminent in this endeavour which was characterised by rivalry between robert falcon scott and ernest shackleton during heroic age of antarctic exploration shackleton s efforts fell short scott reached pole in january 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by norwegian amundsen early voyagers 350px thumb right antarctica and surrounding islands showing tierra del fuego and auckland islands in 1494 principal maritime powers portugal and spain signed a treaty which drew a line down middle of atlantic ocean and allocated all trade routes to east of line to portugal that gave portugal dominance of only known route to east

inhabited by tribes such as selk nam ona yamana and haush haush in particular made regular trips to isla de los estados which was from main island of tierra del fuego suggesting that some of them may have been capable of reaching islands near cape horn indian artifacts and canoe remnants have also been discovered on falkland islands suggesting capacity for even longer sea journeys while natives of tierra del fuego were not capable of true oceanic travel there is some evidence of polynesian visits to some of sub antarctic islands to south of new zealand although these are further from antarctica

ferdinand magellan transferred his allegiance to king charles i of spain on whose behalf he left seville on 10 august 1519 with a squadron of five ships in search of a western route to spice islands in east indies success depended on finding a strait or passage through south american land masses or finding southern tip of continent and sailing around it south american coast was sighted on 6 december 1519 and magellan moved cautiously southward following coast to reach latitude on 31 march 1520 little if anything was known of coast south of this point so magellan decided to wait out southern winter here and established settlement of puerto san julian in september 1520 voyage continued down uncharted coast and on 21 october reached here magellan found a deep inlet which proved to be strait he was seeking later to be known by his name early in november 1520 as squadron navigated through strait they reached its most southerly point at approximate latitude this was a record farthest south for a european navigator though not farthest southern penetration by man position was north of tierra del fuego archipelago where there is evidence of human settlement dating back thousands of years francisco de hoces first sighting of an ocean passage to pacific south of tierra del fuego is sometimes attributed to francisco de hoces of expedition in january 1526 his ship san was blown south from atlantic entrance of magellan strait to a point where crew thought they saw a headland and water beyond it which indicated southern extremity of continent it is speculation as to which headland they saw conceivably it was cape horn in parts of spanish speaking world it is believed that de hoces may have discovered strait later known as drake passage more than 50 years before

renamed golden hinde his principal objective was plunder not exploration his initial targets were unfortified spanish towns on pacific coasts of chile and peru following magellan s route drake reached puerto san julian on 20 june after nearly two months in harbour drake left port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace his ships entered magellan strait on 23 august and emerged in

towards land on 22 october ship anchored off an island which drake named elizabeth island where wood for galley fires was collected and seals and penguins captured for food according to drake s portuguese pilot nuno da silva their position at anchorage was however there is no island at that latitude as yet undiscovered diego ramirez islands at 56deg30 s are treeless and cannot have been islands where drake s crew collected wood this indicates that navigational calculation was faulty and that drake landed at or near then unnamed cape horn possibly on horn island itself his final southern latitude can only be speculated as that of cape horn at 55deg59 s in his report drake wrote uttermost cape or headland of all these islands stands near 56 degrees without which there is no main island to be seen to southwards but that atlantic ocean and south sea meet this open sea south of cape horn became known as drake passage even though drake himself did not traverse it willem schouten on 14 june 1615 willem schouten with two ships eendracht and hoorn set sail from texel in netherlands in search of a western route to pacific hoorn was lost in a fire but eendracht continued southward on 29 january 1616 schouten reached what he discerned to be southernmost cape of south american continent he named this point kaap hoorn cape horn after his hometown and his lost ship schouten s navigational readings are inaccurate he placed cape horn at south when its actual position is 55deg58 his claim to have reached 58deg south is unverified although he sailed on westward to become first european navigator to reach pacific via drake passage knox johnston pp 57 59 garcia de nodal expedition next recorded navigation of drake passage was achieved in february 1619 by brothers bartolome and gonzalo garcia de nodal garcia de nodal expedition discovered a small group of islands about south west of cape horn at latitude 56deg30 s they named these diego ramirez islands after

ships hms resolution and hms adventure 1771 hms adventure after pausing at cape town on 22 november two ships sailed due south but were driven to east by heavy gales coleman pp 56 57 they managed to edge further south encountering their first pack ice on 10 december this soon became a solid barrier which tested cook s seamanship as he manoeuvered for a passage through eventually he found open water and was able to continue south on 17 january 1773 expedition reached antarctic circle at 66deg20 s coleman p 59 first ships to do so further progress was barred by ice and ships turned north eastwards and headed for new zealand which they reached on 26 march during ensuing months expedition explored southern pacific ocean before cook took resolution south again adventure had retired back to south africa after a fracas with new zealand native population coleman p 61 this time cook was able to penetrate deep beyond antarctic circle and on 30 january 1774 reached 71deg10 s his farthest south preston p 11 but state of ice made further southward travel impossible this southern record would hold for 49 years preston pp 11 12 in course of his voyages in antarctic waters cook had encircled world at latitudes generally above 60degs and saw nothing but bleak inhospitable islands without a hint of fertile continent which some still hoped lay in south cook wrote that if any such continent existed it would be a country doomed by nature and that no man will venture further than i have done and land to south will never be explored he concluded should impossible be achieved and land attained it would be wholly useless and of no benefit to discoverer or his nation coleman pp 62 64 searching for land despite cook s prediction early 19th century saw numerous attempts to penetrate southward and to discover new lands in 1819 william smith in command of brigantine williams discovered south shetland islands knox johnston pp 85 86 and in following year edward bransfield in same ship sighted trinity peninsula at northern extremity of graham land a few days before bransfield s discovery on 27 january 1820 russian captain fabian von bellingshausen in another antarctic sector had come within sight of coast of what is now known as queen maud land he is thus credited as first person to see continent s mainland although he did not make this claim himself bellingshausen made two circumnavigations mainly in latitudes between 60 and and in january 1821 reached his most southerly point at 70degs in a longitude close to that in which cook had made his record 47 years earlier markham pp 396 97 in 1821 american sealing captain john davis led a party which landed on an uncharted stretch of land beyond south shetlands i think this southern land to be a continent he wrote in his ship s log if his landing was not on an island his party were first to set foot on antarctic continent p 19 james weddell james weddell was an anglo scottish seaman who saw service in both royal navy and merchant marine before undertaking his first voyages to antarctic waters in 1819 in command of 160 ton brigantine which had been adapted for whaling he set sail for newly discovered whaling grounds of south sandwich islands his chief interest on this voyage was in finding aurora islands which had been reported at by spanish ship aurora in 1762 he failed to discover this non existent land but his sealing activities showed a handsome profit thumb left alt stylized drawing of two sailing ships caught in rough seas surrounded by towering icebergs weddell s ships jane and beaufort under full sail in 1822 weddell again in command of jane and this time accompanied by a smaller ship cutter set sail for south with instructions from his employers that should sealing prove barren he was to investigate beyond track of former navigators this suited weddell s exploring instincts and he equipped his vessel with chronometers thermometers compasses barometers and charts in january 1823 he probed waters between south sandwich islands and south orkney islands looking for new land finding none he turned southward down 40degw meridian deep into sea that now bears his name season was unusually calm and weddell reported that not a particle of ice of any description was to be seen on 20 february 1823 he reached a new farthest south of 74deg15 s three degrees beyond cook s former record unaware that he was close to land weddell decided to return northward from this point convinced that sea continued as far as south pole another two days sailing would likely have brought him within sight of coats land which was not discovered until 1904 by william speirs bruce during scottish national antarctic expedition 1902 04 speak p 93 on his return to england weddell s claim to have exceeded cook s record by such a margin caused some raised eyebrows but was soon accepted benjamin morrell in november 1823 american sealing captain benjamin morrell reached south sandwich islands in schooner wasp gould p 263 according to his own later account he then sailed south unconsciously following track taken by james weddell a month previously morrell claimed to have reached 70deg14 s at which point he turned north because ship s stoves were running short of fuel otherwise he says he could have reached 85deg without least doubt morrell pp 65 68 after turning he claimed to have encountered land which he described in some detail and which he named new south greenland this land proved not to exist morrell s reputation as a liar and a fraud

break imposed by southern winter they sailed south east on 12 november 1840 and crossed antarctic circle on 1 january 1841 on 11 january a long mountainous coastline that stretched to south was sighted ross named land victoria land and mountains admiralty range he followed coast southwards and passed weddell s farthest south point of 74deg15 s on 23 january a few days later as they moved further eastward to avoid shore ice they were met by sight of twin volcanoes one of them active which were named mount erebus and mount terror in honour of expedition s ships coleman pp 329 32 great ice barrier later to be called ross ice shelf stretched away east of these mountains forming an impassable obstacle to further southward progress in his search for a strait or inlet ross explored along edge of barrier and reached an approximate latitude of on or about 8 february 1841 he failed to find a suitable anchorage that would have allowed ships to over winter so he returned to tasmania arriving there in april 1841 following season ross returned and located an inlet in barrier face that enabled him on 23 january 1842 to extend his farthest south to 78deg09 30 s coleman p 335 a record which would remain unchallenged for 58 years although ross had not been able to land on antarctic continent nor approach location of south magnetic pole on his return to england in 1843 he was knighted for his achievements in geographical and scientific exploration coleman p 340 explorers of heroic age oceanographic research voyage known as challenger expedition 1872 76 explored antarctic waters for several weeks but did not approach land itself its research however proved existence of an antarctic continent beyond reasonable doubt jones pp 56 57 impetus for what would become known as heroic age of antarctic exploration came in 1893 when in a lecture to royal geographical society professor sir john murray called for a resumption of antarctic exploration a steady continuous laborious and systematic exploration of whole southern region crane p 75 he followed this call with an appeal to british patriotism is last great piece of maritime exploration on surface of our earth to be undertaken by britons or is it to be left to those who may be destined to succeed or supplant us on ocean fisher p 18 during following quarter century fifteen expeditions from eight different nations rose to this challenge in patriotic spirit engendered by murray s call and under influence of rgs president sir clements markham british endeavours in following years gave particular weight to

expedition to antarctic led by henryk bull in january 1895 borchgrevink was one of a group from that expedition that claimed first confirmed landing on antarctic continent at cape adare borchgrevink determined to return with his own expedition which would overwinter and explore inland with location of south magnetic pole as an objective borchgrevink went to england where he was able to persuade publishing magnate sir george newnes to finance him to extent of ps40 000 equivalent to ps in with sole stipulation that despite shortage of british participants venture be styled british antarctic

its new southern record historian david crane commented that if borchgrevink had been a british naval officer his contribution to antarctic knowledge might have been better received but a norwegian seaman schoolmaster was never going to be taken seriously crane p 74 robert falcon scott discovery expedition of 1901 04 was robert falcon scott s first antarctic command although according to edward wilson intention was to reach pole if possible or find some new land wilson diary 12 june 1902 p 151 there is nothing in scott s writings nor in official objectives of expedition to indicate that pole

specific strategy for doing so riffenburgh p 108 to assist his endeavour shackleton adopted a mixed transport strategy involving use of manchurian ponies as pack animals as well as more traditional
