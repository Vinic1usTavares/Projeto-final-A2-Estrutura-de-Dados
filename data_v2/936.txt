1866 atlantic hurricane season was originally one of only four atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status along with 1852 1858 and 1884 initially there were three known storms during season but a re analysis confirmed increased activity there were also two other systems that were included as tropical cyclones at one time although both were considered to have been other storms already in database all tropical activity occurred between middle of july and end of october there may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during season meteorologist christopher landsea estimates that up to six storms were missed from official database due to small tropical cyclone size sparse ship reports and relatively unpopulated coastlines every storm but fourth hurricane affected land during season first hurricane hit matagorda texas in july only one of season to hit united states as a hurricane a month later a hurricane made two landfalls in mexico third hurricane of season formed near bermuda and was last observed along southern coast of newfoundland a few weeks later another storm executed a similar track although it struck

terrific hurricanes ever known about 75 of population was left homeless and moneyless after affecting turks and caicos islands hurricane passed through bahamas eye crossed over nassau where a barometric pressure of 938 mbar 27 70 inhg was reported based on this observation hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h hurricane struck without warning in bahamas either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in nassau in addition strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs every building in nassau was damaged or destroyed after moving through islands hurricane curved northeastward affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four on october 4 it passed north of bermuda where it produced force 11 winds on beaufort scale hurricane was last observed

tropical storm seven final storm of season was first observed on october 28 over bahamas and may have been a hybrid or subtropical cyclone it moved north northwestward through island chain followed by a turn to north northeast over western atlantic several ships encountered tropical storm and one lost their supply of molasses on october 30 cyclone at time transitioning to extratropical struck on
