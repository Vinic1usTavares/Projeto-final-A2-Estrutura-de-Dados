robbie shakespeare opened their own record label taxi records and attained a distribution deal with island records during early 1980s after island founder and executive chris blackwell hired them to work with singer grace jones duo developed a more sparse robotic production style with funk and dub influences this deviated from their past reggae work as well as genre s roots sound and light rhythms sly and robbie recorded primarily at blackwell s compass point studios in bahamas with state of art equipment which led to dunbar s experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines after their work with black uhuru and that group s line up change sly and robbie pursued more international music endeavors they branched out into cross genre experiments with a conceptual ensemble oriented approach while developing a mentorship with record producer bill laswell whom they met through blackwell and by working on mick jagger s 1985 album she s boss in 1985 they collaborated with laswell on their album language barrier which had guest contributions from herbie hancock bob dylan afrika bambaataa and manu its recording developed from a track duo had revisited from their work on soundtrack to 1983 film never say never again track had been done with electronic drums at compass point studios but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use a dub album language barrier showcased a musical clash between duo s characteristic rhythms and laswell s own production style with african jazz influences predominant use of fairlight cmi sampling synthesizer and experimentations with tempo and dub techniques dunbar was enthused by newer recording technology and in a 1987 interview for sydney morning herald said that he wanted to be a part of it not be left out although it had a lukewarm reception from music critics language barrier was sly and robbie s first work to receive international exposure for their next album they sought to record a like minded album to expand their audience

gang band sly and robbie enlisted laswell again to work on rhythm killers they recorded album over a period of three months at quad recording in new york city before entering studio sly and robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with but scrapped them after chris blackwell of island discouraged idea blackwell wanted duo to come up with original material at studio as they had been known to do since their early years in jamaica in an effort to crossover with music listeners outside of reggae s market sly and robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds particularly funk and occasional hip hop music despite his eclectic output laswell himself had started out as a bass player in funk groups an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation dunbar explained their approach for album in an interview for musician at time saying that we re trying to get new fans once they come into funk they re going to have to come into reggae because that s where we re going to take them sly and robbie s direction was also influenced by supervision of blackwell who according to dunbar wanted us to make two tracks 17 minutes long so we cut two tracks and extended them each side consisting of three songs non stop dancing that s idea in early stage of recording sly and robbie focused primarily on constructing difficult grooves for songs to record their rhythm tracks dunbar worked in studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind he recounted his approach for album to musician saying that i just played what i felt working from a sense of now i ll do 103 beats per minute and robbie would come in next night and lay a bass part unlike most reggae or funk bassists shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff he said that his inspiration comes from god sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me sometimes i ll change drum pattern to a bass line and sly will play bass line on drums along with live percussion dunbar played simmons drums and duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as fairlight cmi synthesizer in album s recording dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger synthesizer s sampled drum sounds sly and robbie worked with an ensemble of musicians including funk artists bootsy collins bernie worrell and gary mudbone cooper reggae vocalist shinehead avant garde jazz musicians karl berger and henry threadgill hip hop artist rammellzee d s t and guitarist nicky skopelitis rhythm killers was produced by laswell with his band material which included shakespeare vocalist bernard fowler and percussionist aiyb dieng among others sly and robbie recorded songs in single takes and cut approximately 20 tracks a day with laswell and engineer robert musso who used reel to reel tape recording laswell also hired violinist mark feldman who was working at a dinner theater in connecticut at time he had feldman read charts in strings section and play syncopated lines which he found a little more funky than theater album was mixed at power station and mastered by howie weinberg at in new york city music and lyrics rhythm killers is characterized as a work of funk music by musician magazine s alan di perna while stereo review critic garland called it a dance album album s songs feature contrasting musical elements writer and musicologist robert palmer viewed it as an attempt at an ambitious dance music synthesis with funk stylistic common denominator adding that funk ethos less is more groove is tune underlies all of mr laswell s work although it is not a reggae album rhythm killers exhibits sly and robbie s taxi records production aesthetic which drew on their cultural connection to jamaican dance halls and their collective interest in experimental electronic sounds dunbar was particularly fascinated with instrument and rhythm killers is one of last albums to feature live drums by him incorporating mechanized beats rocksteady tempos and sinuous bass aesthetic presaged ragga music and rise of digital instrumentation in reggae during 1980s similar to language barrier rhythm killers has a dense thudding sound and heavy handed humorless tone but features more recognizable hooks songs on rhythm killers are typified by deep bass striking beats low frequency grooves improvisational rhythms electronic percussion disco era string synthesizers aggressive guitar riffs and stylistic influences from reggae early hip hop downtown music hard rock and worldbeat genres they are densely layered in a fashion similar to phil spector s wall of sound production bud kliment of trouser press said they comprise a groove oriented song cycle that is heavy bottomed from start to finish similar to album s funk instrumentation guest rappers have exclamatory confrontational tones and percussive vocals vocals are complemented by improvisatory turntable scratches and both african and latin influenced percussion which resulted in cross rhythms during songs carl matthews of baltimore afro american observed a noticeable looseness in vocals and a sort of p funk quality to rhythm tracks mat smith from melody maker said enthusiastic music was driven by a schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight according to spin alternative record guide 1995 rhythm killers truly broke ground after experimentation on language barrier and served as story of late 20th century black music done as symphony music journalist peter shapiro noticed a striking collision of urban sounds in album s music while robert hilburn called it an unpredictable salute to liveliness and character of urban pop music in its broadest sense mike joyce of washington post found it more punchy and elastic than language barrier and felt accent is still on electronic rhythms but mood is vibrantly expansive robert christgau called album sly and robbie s art funk statement he characterized duo as a world pop rhythm section and said their style is complemented by a chauvinistic variation on bill laswell s usual international brigade john leland argued that album is continuous synthesis that laswell promised on herbie hancock s rockit extended in both length and scope as it features a knack for unexpected juxtapositions and no respect for artificial boundaries according to nation sounds on record ranged from ludwig van beethoven to jimi hendrix album s songs are arranged into a gapless suite on each side both of which begin with covers of early 1970s r b songs garland writes that each side is stylistically derived from its respective opening track and distinguishes two side opening tracks as anchoring songs that serve as starting points for uninterrupted improvisations in rhythm that build to multiple climaxes while drawing from wildly disparate musical styles fire a cover of ohio players 1974 song of same name was reworked as an extended vamp with an uncredited sample of liquid liquid s 1983 song cavern and lyrics proclaiming bass to be final frontier it features vocals by shinehead whose rap begins with a howard cosell impersonation and bootsy collins who advises listeners that you have one desire and that s to dance until you drop boop is a jamaican patois slang term for a man

could perform funk music just as well steve hochman from los angeles times hailed it as one of 1987 s best records from any genre because of how sly and robbie drew on funk s past 20 years from sly family stone through george clinton along way throwing in reggae rap and even a bit of rossini in rolling stone gavin edwards called it a thirty five minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises writing that it sounds like great missing dj set albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy i d magazine s simon witter said it was most entertaining and exceptionally conceived dance album of year while garland from stereo review called it one of best dance records in some time because duo s creative yet accessible urban dance music showed how to combine best parts of older music with contemporary recording techniques in a negative review greg taylor of sydney morning herald criticized music as wallpaper undermined by a gaudy hip hop production john leland of spin wrote that while rhythm killers may be ambitious and successful as a dialogue on elasticity of funk it lacked vigor as actual funk music and never got beyond its concept and into funk in new york times palmer found musical ideas innovative and its concept a worthy one that funk is rosetta stone of contemporary dance music but he observed an excess of disordered effects and funk derived sounds on what were otherwise expressive rhythm tracks at end of 1987 it was named year s eighth best album by face magazine and 25th best album by nme who also named boops here to go year s 18th best single

appearance on album bolstered his mainstream exposure as he was receiving american radio airplay with his debut single and performing on an international tour rhythm killers was reissued by island on 4 june 1990 but eventually went out of print in retrospect culture critic mark anthony neal deemed rhythm killers an essential album of 1980s underground funk while reggae historian steve barrow cited it as one of most engaging projects sly and robbie were involved in during 1980s in a retrospective article state wrote that on albums such as rhythm killers they frequently attempted to broaden role of their instruments and consequently took bass and drums to unexplored rhythmic frontiers music journalist mark coleman writing in rolling stone album guide said that album was so coherent and smooth that you could mistake it for a suite if it wasn t also so thoroughly down and dirty in rough guide to rock 2003 peter shapiro cited album as laswell s best outside production and one that fulfilled his fusion fission concept in which some of finest dance musicians in world jam on two side long grooves that imply new orleans r b 70s funk hip hop and ragga are all part of same continuum in a mixed
