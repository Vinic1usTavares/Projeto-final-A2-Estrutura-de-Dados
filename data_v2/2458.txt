after breaking a string of age group records in 1955 she became youngest swimmer to win an australian title claiming victory in 110 yard freestyle at age of 13 she twice broke australian record in 100 yard freestyle in late 1955 thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for olympic selection in 1956 leech s preparation was hindered by illness which forced her out of 1956 australian championships but she recovered to gain olympic selection in both 100 metre freestyle and corresponding relay leech produced a late surge to take bronze in individual event and seal an australian trifecta before swimming second leg in relay to help secure an australian victory in world record time leech retired after olympics at age of 15 she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of main factors in her decision early years second child of johnstone and jessie francis leech leech was born in bendigo in australia she was given name faith after her elder sister who died from leukaemia at age of two howell p 133 a delicate child leech had an aversion to eating in first two years of her life so her mother fed her in small hourly doses leech was twice rushed from family home to a melbourne hospital conventional medicine failed to rectify leech s dietary issues so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at recommendation of a naturopath leech was later placed on a diet of fruit salad and vegetables with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice leech s health improved but she remained slight and frail with a double curvature of back in an effort to help her gain muscle control and confidence her parents sent her to start ballet dancing before trying swimming a sport her mother had competed in aged six she was taken to swimming classes while family holidayed in mornington peninsula leech was coached by gus froelich a former european swimming champion and coach of australian olympic medallist judy joy davies after a difficult start leech improved in her second year at victorian championships she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17 4 seconds s for 25 yard freestyle in under 8 division following year she covered 25 yards in 15 7 seconds three seconds faster than davies had done at same age she progressed steadily sweeping state age titles from nine to 13 setting records that were often faster than those by boys of same age living in bendigo and studying at camp hill primary school leech could only travel three times a year to train with froelich so she relied heavily on dry land simulations such as a pulley attached to kitchen door when she was 12 she covered 110 yards in 1 minute min 7 1 seconds setting an unofficial world record for her age group howell p 134 this achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in melbourne so she could train with froelich on a regular basis leech moved there with her mother while her father stayed in bendigo to look after family s jewellery business from 1954 leech attended st michael s girls grammar school and trained with froelich on a daily basis at city baths regular sessions paid off at 1955 victorian championships leech won open 110 and 220 yard

7 6 seconds to become youngest ever winner of an open title at age of 13 leech also won national junior 110 and 220 yard events leech s regimen differed from most swimmers because froelich was not an advocate of distance training and designed shorter workouts for his students she trained once a day swimming no more than froelich did not push her to continue swimming laps when she felt tired but emphasised an efficient stroke mechanism which leech implemented with a long and graceful arm action leech stood 180 centimetres 5 11 but weighed only with broad shoulders slim hips and large hands and feet her long streamlined action prompted observers to call her a flying fish spinal problems caused by a back misalignment prevented her from using optimal flip turn preferred by freestyle swimmers instead she was forced to utilise touch turn which was slower national selection in august 1955 leech set an australian record of 1 minute 5 0 seconds for 110 yard freestyle before lowering it to 1 minute 4 8 seconds in october this prompted newspapers to trumpet her as a prospect for melbourne olympics she did not get an opportunity to defend her australian title in 1956 because she was hospitalised with illness leech recovered in time to win national age title in 100 metre freestyle in a time of 1 minute 4 6 seconds just 0 1 of a second outside dawn fraser s world record she then posted a time of 1 minute 4 6 seconds to defeat fraser and lorraine crapp at another meeting in following month leech was named in olympic squad and australian swimming union exempted her from
