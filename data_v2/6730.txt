water pipit anthus spinoletta is a small passerine bird which breeds in mountains of southern europe and southern asia eastwards to china it is a short distance migrant many birds move to lower altitudes or wet open lowlands in winter water pipit in breeding plumage has greyish brown upperparts weakly streaked with darker brown and pale pink buff underparts fading to whitish on lower belly head is grey with a broad white supercilium eyebrow and outer tail feathers are white in winter head is grey brown supercilium is duller upperparts are more streaked and underparts are white streaked lightly with brown on breast and flanks there are only minor differences between three subspecies sexes are almost identical and young birds resemble adults water pipit s song is delivered from a perch or in flight and consists of four or five blocks each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note water pipits construct a cup like nest on ground under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey ish white eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14 15 days to fledging although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off ground or vegetation and also some plant material water pipit may be hunted by birds of prey infested by parasites such as fleas or act as an involuntary host to common cuckoo but overall its population is large and stable and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn taxonomy and systematics family motacillidae consists of wagtails pipits and largest of three groups is pipits in genus anthus which are typically brown plumaged terrestrial insectivores their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems water pipit and buff bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of eurasian rock pipit of these rock pipit is more closely related to water pipit based on external and molecular characteristics other near relatives are meadow red throated and rosy pipits water pipit was first was described by carl linnaeus in 10th edition of his systema naturae in 1758 as alauda spinoletta characterised as a fuscis oblique albis current genus anthus was created for pipits by german naturalist johann matthaus bechstein in 1805 anthus is latin name for a small bird of grasslands and specific spinoletta is a local dialect word for a pipit from florence area of italy thumb wintering anthus spinoletta blakistoni at tal sanctuary there are three recognised subspecies of water pipit anthus spinoletta spinoletta linnaeus 1758 nominate subspecies breeds in mountains of southern europe from pyrenees eastwards to northwestern turkey and on sardinia and corsica anthus spinoletta coutellii audouin 1828 breeds in mountains of turkey other than north west caucasus northern iran and turkmenistan anthus spinoletta blakistoni swinhoe 1863 breeds in mountains across asia from southern russia east to central china a possible fourth race from northwestern caucasus anthus spinoletta caucasicus cannot be reliably separated from a s coutellii latter form is itself a potential new species based on genetic data appearance and a characteristic flight call description water pipit is long and weighs adult of nominate race in spring plumage has greyish brown upperparts weakly streaked with darker brown and pale pink buff underparts fading to whitish on lower belly there may be some faint streaking on breast and flanks head is grey with a broad white supercilium outer tail feathers are white and legs bill and iris are dark brown or blackish in non breeding plumage head is grey brown and supercilium is less distinct upperparts are more streaked and underparts are white marked lightly with brown on breast and flanks sexes are similar although female has on average a greyer head young birds resembles non breeding adult but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on underparts a s coutellii is smaller than nominate subspecies and white of outer tail feathers has a hint of grey it is paler and more heavily streaked above and in summer plumage underparts colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint a s blakistoni is large pale and less strongly streaked thumb left conspicuous head markings water pipit has a complete moult between july and september although there is considerable individual variation in timing there is a partial pre breeding moult mainly between january and march but with much variability in timing this moult typically involves replacing head body and some wing feathers but extent is again variable very occasionally females may moult into what looks like non breeding plumage rather than expected brighter garb chicks start to gain juvenile plumage as soon as a month after hatching and most have completed transition to near adult appearance by september first pre breeding moult is similar to that of adult but may be less complete or even absent water pipit is closely related to eurasian rock pipit and meadow pipit and is rather similar to both in appearance compared to meadow pipit water pipit is longer winged and longer tailed than its relative and has much paler underparts it has dark rather than pinkish red legs water pipit in winter plumage is also with eurasian rock pipit but has a strong supercilium greyer upperparts and white not grey outer tail feathers it is also typically much warier habitats used by eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in breeding season and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting there is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where species coexist eurasian rock pipit s subspecies anthus littoralis in summer plumage is particularly close in outward appearance to water pipit rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to head streaking on breast and flanks and buff outer tail feathers and songs are also different species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in same general area voice water pipit s song is delivered from a perch or in flight and consists of four or five blocks each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note in comparison eurasian rock pipit s song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls and finishing with a short trill call of water pipit is a single or double sharp or similar slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of meadow pipit or shrill of eurasian rock pipit short thin fist flight call is intermediate between sip of meadow pipit and rock pipit s differences between calls of pipit species are very subtle and not diagnostic in absence of other evidence flight call of subspecies a s coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of nominate race distribution and habitat thumb in typical breeding habitat breeding range of water pipit is mountains of southern europe and asia from spain to central china along with mediterranean islands of sardinia and corsica water pipit is predominantly a mountain species in breeding season found in alpine pasture and high meadows with short grass and some bushes or rocks it is typically found close to wetter areas and often on slopes it breeds between altitude mostly it migrates relatively short distances in autumn to lower ground typically wintering on coastal wetlands marshes rice fields and similar habitats although most birds move to lowlands some may remain at up to nominate a s spinoletta winters mainly in western and southern europe and in northwestern africa in western europe some birds show fidelity to same wintering site returning each year birds in spain appear only to move lower down mountains in which they breed a s coutellii winters at lower altitudes near its breeding areas and also in arabian peninsula and northeast africa a s blakistoni winters in pakistan northwest india and southern china water pipits leave their breeding sites from mid september although eastern subspecies may start moving south before then spring migration starts in february and march with arrival on breeding grounds in april and may water pipit has been recorded as a vagrant in belarus gibraltar and latvia and on islands including canaries iceland malta and svalbard behaviour water pipit is a much less approachable bird than eurasian rock pipit it is warier than its relative and if approached it flies some distance before landing again whereas rock pipit typically travels only a short distance close to ground before it alights breeding thumb egg in museum wiesbaden water pipit is mainly monogamous although both sexes may deviate from this occasionally male has a display flight in which he climbs to flies in an arc and glides back down singing throughout female constructs a cup nest from grass and leaves which is lined with finer plant material and animal hairs nest is hidden in vegetation on ground sometimes in a hollow normal clutch is four to six eggs laid from end of april to early july eggs are greyish white with darker grey or brownish speckles mainly at wider end and they measure and weigh of which 5 is shell eggs are incubated by female for 14 15 days to hatching chicks are fed initially by male both parents sharing duty after a few days when female does not need to brood so often and they fledge in a further 14 15 days there may be two broods in a year in a swiss study of nominate subspecies 76 of eggs hatched and 58 of chicks fledged birds of race a s blakistoni in tian shan hatched 90 of their eggs and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47 of nests in latter study early nests were more likely to fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators neither average lifespan nor maximum age of survival are known feeding thumb glacier fleas are a prey item found on snow fields water pipit s feeding habitat is damp grassland rather than rocky coasts favoured by eurasian rock pipit water pipit feeds mainly on a wide range of invertebrates including crickets and grasshoppers beetles snails millipedes and spiders true flies caterpillars and can form a large part of diet of fledglings birds close to snow fields take insects specialised for that habitat such as springtails glacier flea and i nivalis and scorpion fly birds normally forage alone or in pairs in bad weather foraging is more frequent and involves longer flights and may be concentrated around marmot burrow entrances prey items average in length and are mainly hunted on foot although flying insects are occasionally caught in air some plant material is taken and one study on border of czechoslovakia and poland found that 75 of diet by volume consisted of algae specifically despite large numbers of insects being available in areas with acidic soils there is less calcium available potentially leading to thinner egg shells in such locations pipits are more likely to select snails and similar prey with calcium rich shells than is case in limestone terrain predators and parasites water pipit is hunted by birds of prey including eleonora s falcon and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes as with other members of its genus water pipit is a host of common cuckoo a brood parasite eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts a new species of feather mite proctophyllodes was discovered on water pipit which is also a host to fleas ceratophyllus borealis and dasypsyllus gallinulae along with other motacillidae species water pipit is a host of protozoan parasite haemoproteus status estimates of european breeding population of water pipit vary widely but may be as high as two million pairs which would suggest a global population of tens of millions of individuals spread over range is discontinuous due to mountain habitat this species uses but population is considered overall to be large and stable and for this reason water pipit is evaluated as a species of least concern by iucn breeding densities in pairs per 10 ha have been recorded as 2 4 in jura mountains 3 0 3 6 in alps and 4 5 in tatra mountains of poland notes references external links
