godlike power commending cudi s performance and chemistry of artists as well as lyricism brevity is effective as kanye and cudi stack ideas on top of ideas packing 23 minutes with as much creativity as possible chemistry is that of two old friends who no longer have to second guess each other s instincts concluding that album reasserts west as a fun thrilling rap music maker that tests genre s boundaries jayson greene of pitchfork wrote that songs are most intriguing ones to emerge from this wyoming project thus far he compared kids see ghosts positively to west s preceding album ye writing that a lot of energy that ye seemed to be gasping for fills lungs of this project and it s humbling to consider how much this material might have enlivened west s own album praising soul and depth of cudi s contributions to album and psychic bond between two artists which yields a spacious and melancholy album about brokenness he concluded that kids see ghosts was first time in years that kanye sounds at peace in a highly positive review russell stone of highsnobiety praised cudi s performance for fueling album s immaculate feel and sounding most empowered you ve ever heard him while complimenting west s mind bending production and focused subject matter in contrast to his lyricism on ye bassett concluded that kids see ghosts sounds suitably ghostly and supernatural a brief glimpse into another world and is sound of two artists looking back over vast distance they ve travelled so far for a v club marty sartini garner praised cudi s contributions as without qualification spiritual and artistic backbone of kids see ghosts source of its truest artistic risks writing that he lifts kanye up who allows cudi to take him further than he s been willing to go by himself he further stated that album marks cudi s true return only a year and a half after he checked himself into rehab to fight depression and suicidal ideation and taking time out to work on himself seems to have done him wonders chuck arnold of entertainment weekly wrote that album had a lot going against it before it dropped from wyoming wilderness but that album s hope healing and haunting music in face of darkness causes these concerns to go out window and that west and cudi craft a work that easily surpasses ye both musically and emotionally he concluded that album leaves you greedy for more but hopefully kanye and cudi have rid themselves of enough ghosts to bust out more of this kind of artistry writing for rolling stone christopher r weingarten wrote that album is nowhere near as incisive infectious or rewarding as their best work but is still an important step forward into an era of big moods and short attention spans accolades kids see ghosts appeared on year end best album
