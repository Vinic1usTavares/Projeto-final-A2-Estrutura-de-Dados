gallimimus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now mongolia during late cretaceous period about seventy million years ago mya gallimimus is largest known ornithomimid adults were about long tall at hip and weighed about as evidenced by its relative ornithomimus it would have had feathers head was small and light with large eyes that faced to sides snout was long compared to other ornithomimids although it was broader and more rounded at tip than in other species gallimimus was toothless with a keratinous horny beak and had a delicate lower jaw many of vertebrae had openings that indicate they were pneumatic air filled neck was proportionally long in relation to trunk hands were proportionally shortest of any ornithomimosaur and each had three digits with curved claws forelimbs were weak while hindlimbs were proportionally long several fossils in various stages of growth were discovered by polish mongolian expeditions in gobi desert of mongolia during 1960s a large skeleton discovered in this region was made holotype specimen of new genus and species gallimimus bullatus in 1972 generic name means chicken mimic referring to similarities between its neck vertebrae and those of galliformes specific name is derived from bulla a gold capsule worn by roman youth in reference to a bulbous structure at base of skull of gallimimus at time it was named fossils of gallimimus represented most complete and best preserved ornithomimid material yet discovered and genus remains one of best known members of group family ornithomimidae is part of group ornithomimosauria ostrich dinosaurs anserimimus also from mongolia is thought to have been closest relative of gallimimus as an ornithomimid gallimimus would have been a fleet or cursorial animal using its speed to escape predators its speed has been estimated at 42 56 km h 29 34 mph it may have had good vision and intelligence comparable to ratite birds gallimimus may have lived in groups based on discovery of several specimens preserved in a bone bed various theories have been proposed regarding diet of gallimimus and other ornithomimids highly mobile neck may have helped locate small prey on ground but it may also have been an opportunistic omnivore it has also been suggested that it used small columnar structures in its beak for filter feeding in water though these structures may instead have been ridges used for feeding on tough plant material indicative of a herbivorous diet gallimimus is most commonly found ornithomimosaur in nemegt formation where it lived alongside its relatives anserimimus and deinocheirus gallimimus was featured in movie jurassic park in a scene that was important to history of special effects and in shaping common conception of dinosaurs as bird like animals description thumb size compared to a human gallimimus is largest known member of family ornithomimidae adult holotype specimen igm 100 11 was about long and tall at hip its skull was long and femur thigh bone was it would have weighed about in comparison one juvenile specimen zpal mgd i 94 was about long tall at hip and weighed about based on fossils of related ornithomimus it is known that ornithomimosaurs were feathered and that adults bore wing like structures as evidenced by presence of quill knobs on ulna bone of lower arm bumps that indicate where feathers would have attached skull thumb left reconstructed skull and neck nhm head of gallimimus was very small and light compared to vertebral column due to length of its snout skull was long compared to other ornithomimids and snout had a gently convex sloping upper profile side profile of snout differed from other ornithomimids in not narrowing towards its front half and lower front margin of premaxilla at front of upper jaw rose upwards instead of being horizontal seen from above snout was almost spatulate spoon shaped broad and rounded at tip or u shaped whereas it was acute or v shaped in north american ornithomimids orbits eye sockets were large and faced sideways as in other ornithomimids temporal region at side of skull behind eyes was deep and infratemporal fenestra lower opening behind orbit was nearly triangular and smaller than that of related struthiomimus it had deep muscle scars at back part of skull roof along parietal bone parasphenoid a bone of braincase at underside of skull s base was thin walled hollow and formed a pear shaped bulbous structure structure had a shallow furrow which opened towards front internal nares internal openings for nasal passage were large and placed far back on palate due to presence of an extensive secondary palate which was common to ornithomimids delicate lower jaw consisting of thin bones was slender and shallow at front deepening towards rear front of mandible was shovel like resulting in a gap between tips of jaws when shut shovel like shape was similar to that of common seagull and lower beak may have had a shape similar to that of this bird process at back of jaw where jaw muscles attached that opened beak was well developed and consisted mainly of angular bone surangular was largest bone of lower jaw which is usual in theropods mandibular fenestra a sidewards facing opening in lower jaw was elongated and comparatively small lower jaw did not have a coronoid process or a bone lack of which is a common feature of beaked theropods ornithomimosaurs oviraptorosaurs therizinosaurs and birds but unusual among theropods in general jaws of gallimimus were edentulous toothless and front part would have been covered in a keratinous rhamphotheca horny beak in life beak may have covered a smaller area than in north american relatives based on lack of nourishing foramina on maxilla inner side of beak had small tightly packed and evenly spaced columnar structures their exact nature is debated which were longest at front and shortening towards back postcranial skeleton thumb restoration showing an adult with feathers based on those known from related ornithomimus gallimimus had 64 66 vertebrae in its spine fewer than other ornithomimids centra or bodies of vertebrae were with a flat front surface and a concave hind surface except for first six caudal tail vertebra where hind surface was also flat and those at end of tail which were with both surfaces flat many of centra had foramina openings which have also been called pleurocoels and were therefore probably pneumatic with their hollow chambers invaded by air sacs neck consisted of 10 cervical vertebrae which were all long and wide except for atlas bone first vertebra that connects with back of skull atlas differed from that of other ornithomimids in that front surface of its was slanted downwards towards back instead of being concave and facing upwards to support occipital condyle neck appears to have been proportionally longer in relation to trunk than in other ornithomimids neck was divided into two distinct sections cervical vertebrae at front had centra which were nearly triangular in side view and tapered towards back as well as low neural arches and short broad zygapophyses processes that articulated between vertebrae cervical vertebrae at back had spool like centra which became gradually higher and long thin zygapophyses pneumatic foramina here were small and oval and neural spines projecting outwards from centra formed long low and sharp ridges except for in hindmost cervical vertebrae thumb upright left pneumatic structures in caudal vertebrae of a and cervical b c d dorsal e sacral f g and caudal h vertebrae of gallimimus back of gallimimus had 13 dorsal vertebrae with spool like centra that were short but tended to become deeper and longer towards back their transverse processes processes articulating with ribs slightly increased in length towards back two first dorsal centra had deep pneumatic foramina while rest only had shallow fossae depressions and neural spines were prominent being somewhat triangular or rectangular in shape sacrum fused vertebrae between pelvic bones consisted of five sacral vertebrae which were about equal in length centra here were spool like flattened sideways and had fossae which appear to have continued as deep foramina in some specimens neural spines here were rectangular broad and higher than those in dorsal vertebrae they were higher or equal in height to upper margin of iliac blade and were separate whereas in other ornithomimids they were fused together tail had 36 39 caudal vertebrae with centra of those at front being spool shaped while those at back were nearly triangular and elongated across neural spines here were high and flat but diminished backwards where they became ridge like only sign of pneumaticity in tail were deep fossae between neural spines and transverse process of two first caudal vertebrae all vertebrae in front of sacrum bore ribs except for atlas and last dorsal vertebra scapula shoulder blade was short and curved thin at front end and thick at back it was connected relatively weakly with coracoid which was large and deep from top to bottom overall forelimbs did not differ much from those of other ornithomimids all of which were comparatively weak humerus upper arm bone which had a near circular cross section was long and twisted deltopectoral crest on upper front part of humerus was comparatively small and therefore provided little surface for attachment of upper arm muscles ulna was slender long and weakly curved with a nearly triangular shaft olecranon projection from elbow was prominent in adults but not well developed in juveniles radius other bone in lower arm was long and slender with a more expanded upper end compared to lower manus hand was proportionally short compared to those of other ornithomimosaurs having smallest manus to humerus length ratio of any member of group but was otherwise similar in structure it had three fingers which were similarly developed first thumb was strongest third was weakest and second was longest unguals claw bones were strong somewhat curved that of first finger was most curved and compressed sideways with a deep groove on each side unguals were similarly developed though third was slightly smaller pubis pubic bone was long and slender ending in a pubic boot which expanded to front and back a general feature of ornithomimosaurs hind limbs differed little from those of other ornithomimids and were proportionally longer than in other theropods femur was nearly straight long and slender with a sideways flattened shaft tibia was straight long with two well developed condyles rounded end of a bone on upper end and a flattened lower end fibula of lower leg was flat thin and broad at upper end narrowing towards lower end lower half of third metatarsal was broad when viewed end on partly covering adjoining two metatarsals to each side but narrowed abruptly at mid length wedging between those bones and disappearing an arctometatarsalian foot structure third toe was proportionally shorter in relation to limb than in other ornithomimids as in other ornithomimids foot had no hallux or dewclaw first toe of most other theropods unguals of toes were flat on their lower sides outer two declined slightly outwards from their digits history of discovery thumb cretaceous aged dinosaur fossil localities of mongolia gallimimus fossils were collected in area a left between 1963 and 1965 polish academy of sciences and mongolian academy of sciences organised polish mongolian palaeontological expeditions to gobi desert of mongolia among dinosaur remains discovered in sand beds of nemegt basin were numerous ornithomimids at different growth stages from nemegt tsaagan khushuu ula iv and localities three partially complete skeletons two with skulls as well as many fragmentary remains were collected largest skeleton later to become holotype of gallimimus bullatus was discovered by palaeontologist zofia kielan jaworowska in tsaagan khushuu in 1964 it was preserved lying on its back and skull was found under its pelvis one small specimen was also found in tsaagan khushuu same year and another small specimen was found in nemegt locality a small skeleton without forelimbs was discovered in 1967 by mongolian palaeontological expedition in bugeen tsav outside nemegt basin fossils were housed at mongolian polish and ussr academy of sciences polish mongolian expeditions were notable for being led by women some of whom were among first women to name new dinosaurs fossils discovered in these expeditions shed new light on interchange of fauna between asia and north america during cretaceous period some of skeletons were exhibited in warsaw in 1968 mounted in tall semi erect postures which was accepted at time though more horizontal postures are favoured today thumb left upright adult holotype skeleton igm 100 11 during a temporary exhibition in in 1972 palaeontologists halszka osmolska ewa and rinchen barsbold named new genus and species gallimimus bullatus using largest collected skeleton specimen igm 100 11 from tsaagan khushuu formerly referred to as g i no dps 100 11 and mpd 100 11 as holotype generic name is derived from latin gallus chicken and greek mimos mimic in reference to front part of neck vertebrae which resembled those of galliformes specific name is derived from latin bulla a gold capsule worn by roman youth around neck in reference to bulbous capsule on parasphenoid at base of dinosaur s skull such a feature had not been described from other reptiles at time and was considered unusual holotype consists of an almost complete skeleton with a distorted snout incomplete lower jaw vertebral series pelvis as well as some missing hand and foot bones other partially complete skeletons were juveniles zpal mgd i 1 from tsaagan khushuu has a crushed skull with a missing tip damaged vertebrae fragmented ribs pectoral girdle and forelimbs and an incomplete left hind limb zpal mgd i 94 from nemegt locality lacks skull atlas tip of tail pectoral girdle and forelimbs while smallest specimen igm 100 10 from bugeen tsav lacks a pectoral girdle forelimbs and several vertebrae and ribs osmolska and colleagues listed twenty five known specimens in all nine of which were only represented by single bones thumb slab with two specimens which was repatriated to mongolia after having been smuggled to us central museum of mongolian dinosaurs ulaanbaatar at time it was named fossils of gallimimus represented most complete and best preserved ornithomimid material yet discovered and genus remains one of best known members of group ornithomimids were previously known mainly from north america archaeornithomimus being only prior known member from asia though without a skull since first discoveries more specimens have been found by further mongolian led international expeditions three of gallimimus skeletons including holotype later became part of a travelling exhibit of mongolian dinosaur fossils which toured various countries fossil poaching has become a serious problem in mongolia in 21st century and several gallimimus specimens have been looted in 2017 hang jae lee and colleagues reported a fossil trackway discovered in 2009 associated with a clenched gallimimus foot specimen mpc 17 rest of skeleton appeared to have been removed previously by poachers along with several other gallimimus specimens as indicated by empty excavation pits garbage and scattered broken bones in quarry it is unusual to find tracks closely associated with body fossils some of tracks are consistent with feet while others belong to different dinosaurs in 2014 a slab with two gallimimus specimens was repatriated to mongolia along with other dinosaur skeletons after having been smuggled to us in 1988 palaeontologist gregory s paul concluded that skulls of ornithomimids were more similar to each other than previously thought and moved most species into same genus ornithomimus resulting in new combination o bullatus in 2010 he instead listed it as gallimimus or struthiomimus bullatus but returned to using only genus name gallimimus in 2016 species involved have generally been kept in separate genera by other writers an ornithomimid vertebra from japan informally named was reported in a 1988 magazine but was assigned to gallimimus sp of uncertain species by palaeontologist dong zhiming and colleagues in 1990 barsbold informally referred to a nearly complete skeleton igm 100 14 as gallimimus mongoliensis but since it differs from gallimimus in some details yoshitsugu kobayashi and barsbold proposed in 2006 that it probably belongs to a different genus in 2000 palaeontologist philip j currie proposed that anserimimus which is only known from one skeleton from mongolia was a junior synonym of gallimimus but this was dismissed by kobayashi and barsbold who pointed out several differences between two barsbold noted some morphological variation among newer gallimimus specimens though this has never been published classification thumb three skeletons including a juvenile middle and holotype right during a temporary exhibition in cosmocaixa barcelona thumb upright cast of holotype skeleton in a semi erect posture museum of evolution of polish academy of sciences warsaw osmolska and colleagues assigned gallimimus to family ornithomimidae in 1972 with north american struthiomimus as closest relative while lamenting fact that comparison between taxa was difficult because other ornithomimids known at time were either poorly preserved or inadequately described in 1975 kielan jaworowska stated that though many dinosaurs from asia were placed in same families as north american relatives this category of classification tended to be more inclusive than was used for modern birds she highlighted that while gallimimus had a rounded beak similar to a goose or duck north american ornithomimids had pointed beaks a difference that would otherwise lead taxonomists to place modern birds in different families in 1976 barsbold placed ornithomimidae in new group ornithomimosauria ostrich dinosaurs in 2003 kobayashi and jun chang lu found that anserimimus was sister taxon to gallimimus both forming a derived or advanced clade with north american genera which was confirmed by kobayashi and barsbold in 2006 following cladogram shows placement of gallimimus among ornithomimidae according to li xu and colleagues 2011 ornithomimosaurs belonged to clade maniraptoriformes of coelurosaurian theropods which also includes modern birds early ornithomimosaurs had teeth which were lost in more derived members of group in 2004 makovicky kobayashi and currie suggested that most of early evolutionary history of ornithomimosaurs took place in asia where most genera have been discovered including most basal or primitive taxa although they acknowledged that presence of basal in europe presents a complication in classification group must have dispersed once or twice from asia to north america across beringia to account for late cretaceous genera found there as seen in some other dinosaur groups ornithomimosaurs were largely restricted to asia and north america after europe was separated from asia by strait in 1994 palaeontologist thomas r holtz grouped ornithomimosaurs and troodontids in a clade based on shared features such as presence of a bulbous capsule on parasphenoid he named clade bullatosauria based on specific name of gallimimus bullatus which was also in reference to capsule in 1998 holtz instead found that troodontids were basal meaning that all members of that clade would fall within bullatosauria which would therefore become a junior synonym of maniraptoriformes and clade has since fallen out of use palaeobiology thumb left upright reconstructed skull and neck in front view nhm cervical vertebrae of gallimimus indicate that it held its neck obliquely declining upwards at an angle of 35 degrees osmolska and colleagues found that hands of gallimimus were not prehensile or capable of grasping and that thumb was not opposable they also suggested that arms were weak compared to for example those of ornithomimosaur deinocheirus they agreed with interpretations of ornithomimid biology by palaeontologist dale russell from earlier in 1972 including that they would have been very fleet or cursorial animals although less agile than large modern ground birds and would have used their speed to escape predators russell also suggested that they had a good sense of vision and intelligence comparable to that of modern ratite birds since their predators may have had colour vision he suggested it would have influenced their colouration perhaps resulting in camouflage in 1982 palaeontologist richard a thulborn estimated that gallimimus could have run at speeds of 42 56 km h 29 34 mph he found that would not have been as fast as ostriches which can reach 70 80 km h 43 49 mph in part due to their arms and tails increasing their weight in 1988 paul suggested that eyeballs of ornithomimids were flattened and had minimal mobility within sockets necessitating movement of head to view objects since their eyes faced more sideways than in some other bird like theropods their binocular vision would have been more limited which is an adaptation in some animals that improves their ability to see predators behind them paul considered relatively short tails which reduced weight and missing of ornithomimids to be adaptations for speed he suggested that they could have defended themselves by pecking and kicking but would have mainly relied on their speed for escape in 2015 watanabe and colleagues found that together with deinocheirus and archaeornithomimus gallimimus had most pneumatised skeleton among ornithomimosaurs pneumatisation is thought to be advantageous for flight in modern birds but its function in non avian dinosaurs is not known with certainty it has been proposed that pneumatisation was used to reduce mass of large bones that it was related to high metabolism balance during locomotion or used for thermoregulation thumb hindlimb bones of zpal mgd i 8 mepas in 2017 lee and colleagues suggested various possible taphonomic circumstances changes during decay and fossilisation to explain how gallimimus foot discovered in 2009 was associated with a trackway trackway is preserved in sandstone while foot is preserved in mudstone extending below layer with tracks it is possible fossil represents an animal that died in its tracks but depth of foot in mud may be too shallow for it to have become mired it may also have been killed by a flood after which it was buried in a pond however layers of mud and sand do not indicate flooding but probably a dry environment and disrupted sediments around fossil indicate animal was alive when it came to area authors thus suggested that tracks had been made over an extended amount of time and period of drying and that probably none of them were produced by individual that owned foot animal may have walked across floor of a pond breaking through sediment layer with tracks while it was soaked from rain or contained water animal may have died in this position from thirst hunger or another reason and mud then deposited on sand thereby covering and preserving tracks and carcass foot may have become clenched and disarticulated as it decomposed which made tendons flex and was later stepped on by heavy dinosaurs area may have been a single bone bed based on possible number of poached specimens representing a gallimimus mass mortality perhaps due to a drought or famine fact that animals seem to have died at same time empty excavation pits were stratigraphically identical may indicate that gallimimus was gregarious lived in groups which has also been suggested for other ornithomimids feeding and diet thumb left skull cast of juvenile specimen zpal mgd i 1 national museum of natural history paris osmolska and colleagues pointed out that front part of neck of gallimimus would have been very mobile hind part was more rigid neural arches in vertebrae of that region being similar to chicken and other galliformes indicating similar feeding habits they found beak of gallimimus similar to that of a duck or goose and that it would have fed on small living prey which it swallowed whole mobility of neck would have been useful in locating prey on ground since eyes were positioned on sides of skull they assumed that all ornithomimids had similar feeding habits and pointed out that russel had compared beaks of ornithomimids with those of insectivorous birds osmolska and colleagues suggested that gallimimus was capable of cranial kinesis due to seemingly loose connection between some of bones at back of skull a feature which allows individual bones of skull to move in relation to each other they also proposed that it did not use its short handed forelimbs for bringing food to mouth but for raking or digging in ground to access food hands of gallimimus may have been weaker than for example those of struthiomimus which may instead have used its hands for hooking and gripping according to a 1985 article by palaeontologists elizabeth l nicholls and anthony p russell in 1988 paul disagreed that ornithomimids were omnivores that ate small animals and eggs as well as plants as had previously been suggested he pointed out that ostriches and emus are mainly grazers and browsers and that skulls of ornithomimids were most similar to those of extinct which were strong enough to bite off twigs as evidenced by their gut content he further suggested that ornithomimids were well adapted for browsing on tough plants and would have used their hands to bring branches within reach of their jaws palaeontologist jorn suggested in 2001 that due to its similar jaw structure gallimimus may have had an opportunistic omnivorous diet like seagulls he also observed that tight joint would prevent any movement between front and rear portions of lower jaw thumb repatriated adult skull in 2001 palaeontologists mark a norell makovicky and currie reported a gallimimus skull igm 100 1133 and an ornithomimus skull that preserved soft tissue structures on beak inner side of gallimimus beak had columnar structures that authors found similar to lamellae in beaks of anseriform birds which use these for manipulating food straining sediments filter feeding by segregating food items from other material and for cutting plants while grazing they found northern shoveller which feeds on plants molluscs ostracods and foraminiferans to be modern anseriform with structures most similar in anatomy to those of gallimimus authors noted that ornithomimids probably did not use their beaks to prey on large animals and were abundant in mesic environments while rarer in more arid environments suggesting that they may have depended on aquatic food sources if this interpretation is correct gallimimus would have been one of largest known terrestrial filter feeders in 2005 palaeontologist paul barrett pointed out that lamella like structures of gallimimus did not appear to have been flexible bristles like those of filter feeding birds as there is no indication of these structures overlapping or being collapsed but were instead more akin to thin regularly spaced vertical ridges in beaks of turtles and hadrosaurid dinosaurs in these animals such ridges are thought to be associated with herbivorous diets used to crop tough vegetation barrett suggested that ridges in beak of gallimimus represented a natural cast of internal surface of beak indicating that animal was a herbivore that fed on material high in fibre discovery of many gastroliths gizzard stones in some ornithomimids indicate presence of a gastric mill and therefore point towards a herbivorous diet as these are used to grind food of animals that lack necessary chewing apparatus barrett also calculated that a gallimimus would have needed between of food per day depending on whether it had an endothermic or an ectothermic warm or cold blooded metabolism an intake which he found to be unfeasible if it was a filter feeder he also found that ornithomimids were abundant not only in formations that represented mesic environments but also in arid environments where there would be insufficient water to sustain a diet based on filter feeding in 2007 palaeontologist espen m wrote that beak shape of ornithomimids when compared to those of modern birds was consistent with omnivory or high fibre herbivory development thumb smallest known gallimimus juvenile specimen igm 100 10 exhibited in cosmocaixa shape and proportions of skull changed significantly during growth rear of skull and orbits decreased in size whereas snout became relatively longer similar changes occur in modern crocodiles skull was also proportionally larger in younger specimens and sloping of snout s upper profile was less distinct ribs in neck were fused to vertebrae only in adults forelimbs appear to have become proportionally longer during growth whereas proportional length of bones in hind limbs changed very little in 2012 palaeontologist darla k and colleagues concluded that since adult ornithomimosaurs had wing like structures on their arms whereas juveniles did not as evidenced by specimens of ornithomimus these structures were originally secondary sexual characteristics which could have been used for reproductive behaviour such as courtship display and brooding a 1987 study by biologists roman and p showed age related differences in content of calcium and phosphorus important components in formation of bone of gallimimus specimens they found that ratio was highest in young to middle aged animals decreasing with age in 1991 they reported that bones of old individuals contained highest amounts of lead and iron while those in younger animals were lower a study of bone histology of various dinosaurs in 2000 by biologists john m rensberger and mahito revealed that channels which connect bone cells and collagen fibre bundles of gallimimus and other ornithomimids were more akin to those in birds than mammals unlike those of ornithischian dinosaurs which were more similar to mammals these differences may have been related to process and rate at which bone formed palaeoecology thumb left skeleton of g mongoliensis a species which may belong to a new genus mongolian natural history museum ulaanbaatar gallimimus is known from nemegt formation in gobi desert of southern mongolia this geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically but fauna present in fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during early maastrichtian stage at end of late cretaceous about 70 million years ago sediments of gallimimus type locality tsaagan khushuu consist of silts siltstones mudstones sands as well as less frequent thin beds of sandstones rock facies of nemegt formation suggest presence of river channels mudflats shallow lakes and floodplains in an environment similar to okavango delta of present day botswana large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of a significantly more humid climate than those found in older barun goyot and formations although caliche deposits indicate that periodic droughts occurred fossil bones from nemegt basin including of gallimimus are more radioactive than fossils from surrounding areas possibly because uranium accumulated in bones transported there by percolating ground water nemegt rivers where gallimimus lived were home to a wide array of organisms occasional mollusc fossils as well as a variety of other aquatic animals like fish turtles and crocodylomorphs including shamosuchus have been discovered in this region mammal fossils are rare in nemegt formation but many birds including enantiornithine gurilynia judinornis as well as teviornis a possible anseriform have been found herbivorous dinosaurs discovered in nemegt formation include ankylosaurids such as tarchia pachycephalosaurian prenocephale large hadrosaurids such as saurolophus and barsboldia and sauropods such as nemegtosaurus and opisthocoelicaudia predatory theropods that lived alongside gallimimus include tyrannosauroids such as tarbosaurus alioramus and bagaraatan and troodontids such as borogovia tochisaurus and herbivorous or omnivorous theropods include therizinosaurs such as therizinosaurus as well as oviraptorosaurians such as elmisaurus nemegtomaia and rinchenia other ornithomimosaurs including anserimimus and deinocheirus are also found but gallimimus is most common member of group in nemegt cultural significance thumb upright gallimimus was formerly depicted without feathers like this model in mepas gallimimus was featured in 1993 movie jurassic park by director steven spielberg a similar scene in original 1990 novel instead featured hadrosaurs spielberg had wanted a stampede sequence with animal herds in movie but did not know how to achieve it and it was initially going to be visualised through stop motion animation at time there was little faith in creating animals through computer animation but visual effects company industrial light and magic was given a go ahead by movie s producers to explore possibilities ilm created a gallimimus skeleton in computer and animated a test showing a herd of running skeletons and later a tyrannosaurus chasing a fully rendered gallimimus herd production team became very enthusiastic as nothing similar had previously been achieved and spielberg was convinced to write scene into script and to also use computer graphics for other dinosaur shots in movie instead of stop motion gallimimus were animated by tracing frames from footage of ostriches and footage of herding gazelles was also referenced kielan jaworowska who discovered holotype specimen called it a beautiful scene movie s dinosaurs were one of most widely publicised applications of computer generated imagery in film and were considered more lifelike than what had been previously accomplished with special effects emphasising bird like flocking behaviour of gallimimus herd was a point in jurassic park s story as they were supposed to represent precursors to birds herd was shown moving as a whole rather than individual animals running around and smaller gallimimus were shown in middle of group as though they were protected during scene protagonist palaeontologist alan grant says that herd moves with uniform direction changes just like a flock of birds evading a predator and bet you ll never look at birds same way again as he watches movements of fast graceful gallimimus this contrasted with how dinosaurs were traditionally depicted in mass media as lumbering tail dragging animals and movie helped change common perception of dinosaurs this and other scenes reflected then recent theories of bird evolution encouraged by movie s scientific advisor palaeontologist john r horner ideas which were still contentious at time despite such theories gallimimus and other dinosaurs of movie were depicted without feathers in part because it was unknown at time how widespread these were among group it has been claimed that lark quarry tracks one of world s largest concentrations of dinosaur tracks in queensland australia served as inspiration and scientific underpinning for gallimimus stampede scene in jurassic park these tracks were initially interpreted as representing a dinosaur stampede caused by arrival of a theropod predator idea that tracks represent a stampede has since been contested theropod may instead have been a herbivore similar to muttaburrasaurus and a consultant to jurassic park has denied tracks served as inspiration for movie see also timeline of ornithomimosaur research references external links
