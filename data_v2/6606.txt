otto julius zobel october 20 1887 january 1970 was an electrical engineer who worked for american telephone telegraph company at t in early part of 20th century zobel s work on filter design was revolutionary and led in conjunction with work of john r carson to significant commercial advances for at t in field of frequency division multiplex telephone transmissions bray p 62 although much of zobel s work has been superseded by more modern filter designs it remains basis of filter theory and his papers are still referenced today zobel invented m derived g past bt technology journal vol 18

noise in electric circuits concluding that contrary to mainstream p 9 it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise will always be a limiting factor in what is possible to transmit thus they anticipated later work of claude shannon who showed how theoretical information rate of a channel is related to noise of channel life otto julius zobel was born on october 20 1887 in ripon wisconsin j c biographisch fur mathematik astronomie physik mit chemie und verwandte p verlag chemie g m b h 1940 he first studied at ripon college where he received his ba in 1909 with a thesis student theses ripon college on theoretical and experimental treatment of electrical condensers he later received a distinguished alumnus award from ripon distinguished alumni award recipients ripon college he then went to university of wisconsin and graduated with an ma in physics in 1910 zobel stayed at university of wisconsin as a physics instructor from 1910 to 1915 and graduated with his phd in 1914 his dissertation concerned thermal conduction and radiation this followed his 1913 co authoring of a book on subject of geophysical thermodynamics leonard et al passim from 1915 to 1916 he taught physics at university of minnesota american telephone and telegraph company bell system technical journal p 686 1922 having moved to maplewood new jersey he joined at t in 1916 where he worked on transmission techniques in 1926 still with company he moved to new york and in 1934 he transferred to bell telephone laboratories bell labs research organisation created jointly by at t and western electric a few years earlier r of systems 2007 springer berlin heidelberg he retired from bell telephone in 1952 last of his prolific list of o j impedance transformer

interconnected pulley wheels a large dial with indicating needle and a recording drum and pen a harmonic analyser due to lord kelvin intended to be used for prediction of tides ingersoll and zobel found this design of limited use for fourier analysis because of very small number of frequencies measured zobel s early work on heat conduction was not pursued in his later career there are however

electric line by analogy with heat conduction hunt b j maxwellians p 63 cornell university press 2005 this is based on fourier s law and fourier conduction equation ingersoll and zobel describe work of kelvin and fourier in their et al pp 9 14 and kelvin s approach to representation of transmission functions would consequently have been very familiar to zobel it is therefore no surprise that in zobel s paper on electric wave pp 3 4 a very similar representation is found for transmission function of filters solutions to fourier equation can be provided by fourier series leonard et al pp 25 26 ingersoll and zobel state that in many cases calculation involved makes solution well nigh impossible by analytical means with modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy but ingersoll and zobel recommend use of harmonic analysers which are mechanical counterpart of today s spectrum analysers these machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs one for each oscillator reverse process is also possible driving machine with function and measuring fourier components as output ingersoll and zobel pp 62 64 background to at t research after work of john r carson in j r electric circuit theory and operational calculus 1926 mcgraw hill new york it became clear that multiplexed telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by use of single sideband suppressed carrier ssb transmission compared to basic amplitude modulation am ssb has advantage of half bandwidth and a fraction of power one sideband can have no more than 1 6 of total power and would typically be a lot less am analysed in frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands carrier wave in am represents majority of transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required at least from an information transmission point of view up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits however ssb required a flat response over sideband of interest and maximum rejection of other sideband with a very sharp transition between two as idea was to put another completely different signal in slot vacated by unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk at same time minimum distortion i e flat response is obviously desirable for sideband being retained this requirement led to a big research effort in design of electric wave filters bray pp 61 63 electric wave filters term electric wave filter was much used around zobel s time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across band it appears in numerous papers published in early 20th century sometimes used to distinguish these more advanced designs from simple tuned circuits which preceded them in modern usage simpler term filter would be used and is unambiguous within field of electronics george a campbell and zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude modulated composite wave for use in multiplexing telephone channels and related problem of extracting de multiplexing signal at far end of transmission initially pass range used was 200 hz to 2500 hz but later international telecommunication union set a standard of 300 hz to 3 4 khz with 4 khz spacing thus filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in space of 900 hz this standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from 1980s onwards bray pp 62 64 campbell had previously utilised condition discovered in work of oliver heaviside for lossless transmission to improve frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors loading coils when campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910 this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors low pass high pass and band pass filters were designed sharper cut offs and higher stop band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing length of ladder filter designs used by g a physical theory of electric wave filter bell system tech j november 1922 vol 1 no 2 pp 1 32 were described by zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by campbell himself bray p 53 innovations after zobel arrived at engineering department of at t he used his mathematical skills to further improve design of electric wave filters carson and zobel developed mathematical method of analyzing behavior of filters now known as image method whereby impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections chu w chung chang transients of resistance terminated low pass and high pass electric wave filters

resistor component values are marked as multiples of components of a prototype filter not shown zobel invented m derived or m type filter section in 1920 distinguishing feature of this design being a pole of attenuation close to filter cut off frequency result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past cut off frequency a fast transition between pass band and stop band was one of primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable matthaei et al p 65 one disadvantage of m type section was that at frequencies past pole of attenuation response of filter started to increase again reaching a peak somewhere in stop band and then falling again ghosh network theory analysis and synthesis prentice hall of india pp 564 569 zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m type sections this gave zobel advantages of both fast transition of m type and good stop band rejection of constant k zobel pp 26 28 by 1921 zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs he was now using in addition m type half sections at ends of his composite filters to improve impedance matching of filter to source and load a technique in which he held a patent zobel o j terminating network for filters filed 30 april 1920 issued 13 oct 1925 difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances technically this was easy to do within filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances one of characteristics of m type sections is that one side or other of m type section will have an image impedance identical to equivalent constant k section however terminating impedances are a different story these are normally required to be resistive but image impedance will be complex even worse it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance zobel found that a value of m 0 et al pp 72 74 radio diary 1970 p 47 william collins sons co 1969 for end half sections while not mathematically exact gave a good match to resistive terminations in pass band shea t e transmission networks and wave filters 1929 bell telephone laboratories around 1923 zobel s filter designs were reaching peak of their complexity he now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied m derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called mm type this had all advantages of previous m type but more so an even faster transition into stop band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in pass band at same time one side would match into old m type just as m type could match into k type because there were now two arbitrary parameters m and m that filter designer could adjust much better end matching half sections could be designed a composite filter using these sections would have been very best that could have been achieved at that time however mm type sections never became as widespread and well known as m type sections possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers they would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and increased count of components especially wound components made them more expensive to implement with conventional lc technology certainly it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design zobel o j electrical wave filter filed 25 nov 1930 issued 22 march 1932 transmission line simulation zobel directed much of his effort in 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines these networks were derived from filter sections which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and filters were used on transmission line signals in turn these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections zobel o j electrical network filed 27 march 1928 issued 3 june 1930 zobel o j electrical network filed 9 sept 1926 issued 16 july 1929 zobel o j electrical network filed 15 dec 1922 issued 6 july 1926 zobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that impedance looking into end of a filter chain was practically same within limits of component tolerances as theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to chain these image impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components and can only ever be approximated zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators these were not in any sense intended as practical filters in field but rather intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with zobel o j selective constant resistance network filed 13 april 1928 issued 20 aug 1929 equalisers zobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a constant resistance as input impedance resistance remained constant through pass band and stop band with these designs zobel had completely solved impedance matching problem main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies k type and m type filters remained best for this but rather to equalize response in pass band to a flat response zobel o j electrical network and method of transmitting electric currents filed 9 aug 1922 issued 19 oct 1926 perhaps one of zobel s most fascinating inventions is lattice filter section this section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across band yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors only signal parameter it modifies is phase of signal at different frequencies zobel o j phase shifting network filed 12 march 1927 issued 17 feb 1931 impedance matching a common theme throughout zobel s work is issue of impedance matching obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for attenuation characteristics desired with modern computing power a brute force approach is possible and easy simply incrementally adjusting each component while in an iterative process until desired response is achieved however zobel developed a more indirect line of attack he realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections and reflections meant a loss of signal improving impedance match conversely would automatically improve a filter s pass band response this impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances zobel o j electrical wave filter filed 9 june 1923 issued 25 jan 1927 zobel o j complementary filter filed 30 april 1920 issued 13 oct 1925 zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career during world war ii he moved on to waveguide filters for use in newly developed radar technology schwartz pp 7 8 little was published during war for obvious reasons but towards end with bell labs in 1950s zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear however circuit noted above which still bears zobel s name today constant resistance network can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains zobel s finest achievement in this regard loudspeaker equalisation name of zobel is perhaps most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field however none of zobel s patents or articles appear to discuss this topic it is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable or in another instance where clearly he has in mind hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit noise while carson led way theoretically zobel was involved in design of filters for purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems schwartz pp 5 7 background at beginning of 1920s and through to 1930s thinking on noise was dominated by radio engineers concern with external static in modern terminology this would include random thermal and shot noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at time despite an early paper by schottky in 1918 on shot noise schottky w uber in verschiedenen annalen der physik verte folge band 57 1918 pp 541 567 to radio engineers of time static meant externally generated interference line of attack against noise from radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where problem was known not to be so severe schwartz pp 3 5 for telephone engineers what was then called fluctuating noise and would now be described as random noise i e shot and thermal noise was much more noticeable than with early radio systems carson broadened radio engineers concept of signal to static ratio to a more general signal to noise ratio and introduced a figure of merit for noise carson j r signal to static interference ratio in radio telephony proceedings of ire vol 11 june 1923 pp 271 274 schwartz pp 1 5 impossibility of noise cancellation radio engineers preoccupation with static and techniques being used to reduce it led to idea that noise could be totally eliminated by in some way compensating for it or canceling it out culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by edwin armstrong armstrong e h methods of reducing effect of atmospheric disturbances proceedings of ire vol 16 no 1 january 1928 pp 15 26 this led to a famous retort by carson in a subsequent paper noise like poor will always be with us carson j r reduction of atmospheric disturbances proceedings of ire vol 16 no 7 july 1928 pp 966 975 armstrong was technically in wrong in this exchange but in 1933 ironically and paradoxically went on to invent wide band fm which enormously improved noise performance of radio by increasing bandwidth armstrong a h filed 24 january 1933 issued 26 december 1933 carson and zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to same degree as say interference from another station could be removed to do this they had analyzed random noise in frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum this was first use of fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies also first published in this paper was concept of what we would now call band limited white noise for zobel this meant that characteristics of receiving filter completely determine figure of merit in presence of white noise and that filter design was key to achieving optimum noise performance carson j r and zobel o j transient oscillation in electric wave filters bell system technical journal vol 2 july 1923 pp 1 29 although this work by carson and zobel was very early it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in frequency domain in this way for this reason aforementioned exchange between carson and armstrong was still possible years later precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by harry nyquist in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering nyquist h thermal agitation of electric charges in conductors physical review vol 32 july 1928 pp 110 113 this work on noise produced concept and led zobel to pursue design of matched filters in this context matched means that filter is chosen to match signal s characteristics in order to admit all of available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize signal to noise ratio when signal to noise ratio is maximized noise performance of equipment is optimal this conclusion was culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by application of linear filters this became important in development of radar during second world war in which zobel played a part schwartz p 7 use of work in genetic programming research zobel s work has recently found an application in research into genetic programming purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements two of measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human competitive are result is a patented invention result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at time of discovery one such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a crossover filter for woofer and tweeter loudspeakers output design was identical in topology to a design found in a patent of zobel o j wave filter filed 15 jan 1921 issued 26 may 1925 for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line this was judged to be human comparable not only because of patent but also because high pass and low pass sections were decomposed as in zobel s design but not specifically required to be so in programs parameters whether or not zobel s filter design would be good for a hi fi system is another question design does not actually cross over but rather there is a gap between two pass bands where signal is not transmitted to either output essential for multiplexing but not so desirable for sound reproduction zobel s p 4 l 23 enumerates gap as 400 hz a later genetic a engineering design synthesis understanding approaches and tools p 328 springer 2002 experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m type half section this was also determined to have been a design patented by zobel notes references bray j
