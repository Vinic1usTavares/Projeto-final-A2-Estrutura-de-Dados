through wilderness is a tribute album with contributions from a variety of artists dedicated to american singer madonna it was released on november 27 2007 by los angeles based manimal vinyl records according to label head paul beahan idea for album was conceived by him in a dream he enlisted multiple artists to work on project including giant drag lavender diamond winter flowers and chapin sisters although he s not a fan of madonna beahan wanted to see how her songs would sound when covered by different musicians through wilderness is a psychedelic folk tribute to madonna without adhering to any particular coherent sound cover songs were composed differently from original versions by performers they changed melody of madonna tracks by tweaking lyrics and re interpreting actual meaning music critics both complimented and criticized songs noting strength of madonna s discography in album s track list background and release in february 2007 los angeles based manimal vinyl record company announced its plan of releasing a compilation album containing cover versions of songs by american singer madonna initial artists listed in roster included devendra banhart giant drag

wilderness record was third project to be released by company it was originally reported to be released on september 4 2007 but was delayed until november 27 2007 special release parties were organized in los angeles and new york featuring artists who recorded songs for project beahan had been thinking of releasing a tribute record through his company for a long time following death of musicians arthur lee and syd barrett in 2006 however he changed his mind and instead chose madonna believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release idea for through wilderness originated from an epiphany beahan had about madonna although not a fan of singer he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians madonna tribute came to me in a dream last fall and i immediately started making calls and emails to winter flowers chapin sisters and banhart asking them to record a song for it beahan clarified to spin magazine banhart and vietnam were not included in final track list of album other artists mentioned by beahan for record but not included were cat power and thurston moore through wilderness is a psychedelic folk tribute to madonna with songs spanning her entire career until that point from lucky star 1984 to hung up 2005 title is a reference to opening line of madonna s like a virgin where she sings i made it through wilderness beahan had asked all bands to pick their own songs he suggested chapin sisters to record borderline instead of like a virgin becky stark of lavender diamond wanted to sing like a prayer for album similarly lion of panjshir sent a demo of crazy for you which label head accepted indie rock band giant drag confirmed on their official website that they were recording madonna s oh father for release rock musician prayers covered cherish for project composition groups covering songs changed melody of original madonna tracks by tweaking lyrics and re interpreting actual meaning according to stephen m deusner from pitchfork media album did not have a particular or coherent sound and it doesn t get bogged down in musical proselytizing or cultural weight shifting synthpop influenced covers of into groove and everybody by jeremy jay and ariel pink respectively were given as examples by deusner emphasizing post punk era of songs but still being different enough from madonna s versions former added layers of synths and spoken echoing verses while latter featured vocals from julia holter backed by keyboards and drums through wilderness opens with jonathan wilson s piano version of la isla bonita whose chorus consists of a 1970s electric guitar against a reverb borderline featured vocal harmonies by chapin sisters with percussion and banjos as instrumentation lavender diamond s cover of like a prayer is a low key version but vocals and instrumentation are given equal importance giant drag s oh father sticks to original madonna composition but adds piano bass and chimes guitar influenced version was created by golden animals who turned beautiful stranger into a swamp blues track by removing chorus and made it reminiscent of songs by creedence clearwater revival a freak folk recording of lucky star was composed by alexandra hope while lion of panjshir included a multi array of instruments in crazy for you like sitar tabla and acoustic guitar with lead singer ariana delawari belting in breathy vocals crosby stills nash young influenced version of live to tell was created by winter flowers with desert sunset atmosphere noodly guitar fills epic solos and gorgeous harmonies sung by lead singers astrid quay and gavin toler critical reception deusner gave album a rating of 7 out of 10 complimenting release by adding that madonna is an ideal candidate for tribute album treatment having already inspired several in past but none are quite as sturdy or as much fun as through wilderness however he felt that few of songs were uninspired like drag s version of oh father and bubonic plague s rendition of who s that girl jon caramanica from spin also gave a positive review saying that album captures madonna s vivacious side but reminds that she was desperate too he particularly commended crazy for you saying that last 30 seconds of track is chilling frontwoman ariana delawari and her traditional afghan backing accelerate feverishly breaking sweat madonna never quite did or could bruce scott from prefix rated album 6 on 10 and opined that in patches record holds up good as a tribute release he listed tracks into groove everybody and la isla bonita as highlights but criticized cover of ballads which he felt diminished quality through wilderness reminds that these tracks can withstand some reinventing no matter how minimal or lo fi arrangement because songs themselves are strong scott concluded chris morgan from treble noticed lack of coherence in album but complimented that attention bestowed on giving prominence to hook and peppiness of songs however he still found that be it because their sound is not right for covering such an act or because they let their imagination run a little too wild for sake of art of reinterpretation creativity is vulnerable to quickly becoming a gimmick he listed oh father and like a prayer as two highlights describing them as most resonant track listing personnel credits and personnel adapted from allmusic apollo heights producer performer linda beecroft drums vocals p brown composer bubonic plague producer
