produced by coldplay and producer danton supple it is noted for its troubled and urgent development with producer ken nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of album however many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to band s dissatisfaction with them album s cover art is a combination of colours and blocks which is a representation of baudot code album contains twelve tracks and an additional hidden track til kingdom come it is omitted from track listing on album sleeve but listed as on disc label and inside album booklet it was originally planned for american country star johnny cash to record it with lead singer chris martin but cash died before he was able to do so song talk appeared in track listing although after it leaked online in early 2005 it was thought to have been downgraded to a b side for album s subsequent single releases album s title is reflected in 6th track also titled x y x y was released after a considerable amount of global anticipation overall reaction to album was generally positive though some critics cited it as being inferior to its predecessors it was a significant commercial success reaching top spot of many charts worldwide including united kingdom and united states being first time coldplay topped us chart with accumulated sales of 8 3 million units in 2005 alone x y was best selling music album released in 2005 album has sold over 13 million copies worldwide it spawned singles speed of sound fix you talk hardest part what if and white shadows background coldplay announced details about x y in march 2004 while album was being recorded their initial plans were to stay out of public eye throughout year lead singer chris martin stated we really feel that we have to be away for a while and we certainly won t release anything this year because i think people are a bit sick of us this plan was not carried out because of pressure their second album a rush of blood to head had induced but they were trying to make best thing that anyone has ever heard prior to announcement martin lead guitarist jonny buckland and british record producer ken nelson had started recording demos while in chicago illinois band then entered a london studio in january 2004 recording band spent all of 2004 producing x y released album is third version of which band had produced during their late sessions and some have even considered it as their fifth album due to constant changes in track lists and re recordings band members were not satisfied with output of their initial sessions with nelson who had produced band s previous two albums parachutes and a rush of blood to head initial set release date was late 2004 but was later pushed back to january 2005 as new target date was approaching band again discarded songs which they deemed flat and passionless sixty songs were written during these sessions fifty two of which were ditched band started rehearsing songs for a planned tour but felt songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions we realized that we didn t really have right songs and some of them were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record so we thought we better go back and record them again guitarist jonny buckland has said that band had pushed themselves forward in every direction in making album but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works attempting to perfect their work coldplay had to step it up a few notches and work hard at it to get it right band chose danton supple who mixed bulk of a rush of blood to head to oversee production of x y when january went band had to finish album they were conscious of pressure as expectations for record grew larger and completing it became tougher and tougher finally band was settled with song square one which martin has described as a call to arms and a plea to each of them not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else once finished band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else s demands during this month band was into final weeks of production and had put finishing touches on tracks drummer will champion later admitted that coldplay did not rush to complete album because prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time and also we wanted to make sure that it was best it could possibly be according to him band had no deadline which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something once a proper deadline was imposed onto band they became more productive than in previous sessions at this juncture band had written about 14 or 15 songs martin added that reason why they ended up late was that they kept adding finishing touches to record until it was way too late they don t listen to it at moment because they would just find something to go back and change composition music left thumb coldplay received permission from kraftwerk to use main riff from computer love for track talk music of x y consists of multi layered production with heavy electronic influences featuring extensive use of synthesizers musical characteristics that contribute to album s multi layering and grandiosity include fast tempos dynamic drum patterns distorted guitar riffs and driving bass lines coldplay has also cited various other influences in album german electronic music pioneer kraftwerk is evident on song talk which borrows its synthesizer hook from 1981 s computer love with riff instead being created by electric guitar as mentioned before also present is large electronic musical influences from some of likes of english musicians david bowie and brian eno eno who would later produce viva la vida or death and all his friends also played backing synthesizer on tracks low and white shadows first single speed of sound also takes inspiration from drumbeat of english singer songwriter kate bush s song running up that hill according to jon pareles of new york times who wrote a controversial article extensively criticizing album band attempts to carry beauty of clocks across album borrowing some of its features to songs like speed of sound opening track square one also features famous motif from also sprach zarathustra known better as title theme of stanley kubrick s 1968 science fiction film 2001 a space odyssey three note sequence is replicated in song by distorted guitar riffs with a backing synthesizer added for musical texture sequence also transitions as a part of song s chorus showcasing chris martin s trademark falsetto voice fix you features an organ and piano sound song starts with a hushed electric organ ballad including martin s falsetto song then builds with both an acoustic guitar and piano sound sound then shifts with a plaintive three note guitar line ringing through a bringing rhythm upbeat tempo its instrumentation is varied with sound of church style organs hovering throughout background piano notes acoustic and electric guitar riffs drums bass guitar and a singalong chorus hardest part features a faster piano ballad sound and starts with a repeating two note piano riff and features an instrumentation of a guitar it also includes a slow tempo with a drumming rhythm track ends with band playing repeated instrument riffs speed of sound is a track musically based on piano song benefits from an insistently ornate keyboard riff and a busy but less hummable chorus in which song builds into a huge drum beat and a synthesizer heavy chorus song also includes an upbeat tempo with a driving bass line and distorted guitar riffs being heard throughout song lyrics lyrically x y made an apparent shift from its predecessors with many lyrics focused on a questioning and philosophical view of world on their previous works martin sang mostly in first person i but here moves to second person you accordingly songs on album are a reflection of martin s doubts fears hopes and loves with lyrics that are earnest and vague another recurrent theme in album is that everything is broken out of place or missing this is apparent in nearly all songs in album examples include fix you when you lose something you can t replace and also in x y when something is broken and you try to fix it trying to repair it any way you can and talk are you lost or incomplete do you feel like a puzzle you can t find your missing piece this theme is also reflective of random incomprehensible pattern on album s cover until you fix it using baudot code artwork and

wrote that album feels a little forced describing overall sounds as overtly weak alexis petridis writing in guardian said that some of songs are mostly beautifully turned but marred by lyrics that are so devoid of personality that they sound less like song lyrics pitchforks joe tangari called it bland but never offensive listenable but not memorable mojo wrote that album is awash with cliches non sequiturs and cheap existentialism at times it all becomes nigh on unbearable in a negative review for village voice robert christgau named x y dud of month and called coldplay a precise bland and
