paraceratherium is an extinct genus of hornless rhinoceros it is one of largest terrestrial mammals that has existed and lived from early to late oligocene epoch 34 23 million years ago its remains have been found across eurasia between china and balkans it is classified as a member of hyracodont subfamily indricotheriinae paraceratherium means near hornless beast in reference to aceratherium genus in which type species a bugtiense was originally placed exact size of paraceratherium is unknown because of incompleteness of fossils shoulder height was about and length about its weight is estimated to have been about long neck supported a skull that was about long it had large tusk like incisors and a nasal incision that suggests it had a prehensile upper lip or proboscis trunk legs were long and pillar like lifestyle of paraceratherium may have been similar to that of modern large mammals such as elephants and extant rhinoceroses because of its size it would have had few predators and a slow rate of reproduction it was a browser eating mainly leaves soft plants and shrubs it lived in habitats ranging from arid deserts with a few scattered trees to subtropical forests reasons for animal s extinction are unknown but various factors have been proposed taxonomy of genus and species within has a long and complicated history other genera of oligocene indricotheres such as baluchitherium indricotherium and have been named but no complete specimens exist making comparison and classification difficult most modern scientists consider these genera to be junior synonyms of paraceratherium and it is thought to contain at least three discernible species p bugtiense p transouralicum and p huangheense most completely known species is p transouralicum so most reconstructions of genus are based on it differences between p bugtiense and p transouralicum may be due to sexual dimorphism which would make them same species taxonomy thumb left 1911 illustration of down turned lower jaw of p bugtiense which was basis for its separation from genus aceratherium taxonomic history of paraceratherium is complex due to fragmentary nature of known fossils and because western soviet and chinese scientists worked in isolation from each other for much of 20th century and published research mainly in their respective languages scientists from different parts of world tried to compare their finds to get a more complete picture of these animals but were hindered by politics and wars opposing taxonomic tendencies of lumping and splitting have also contributed to problem inaccurate geological dating previously led scientists to believe various geological formations that are now known to be contemporaneous were of different ages many genera were named on basis of subtle differences in molar tooth that vary within populations of other rhinoceros are therefore not accepted by most scientists for distinguishing species early discoveries of indricotheres were made through various colonial links to asia first known indricothere fossils were collected from balochistan in modern day pakistan in 1846 by a soldier named but these fragments were unidentifiable at time prothero 2013 pp 35 52 first fossils now recognised as paraceratherium were discovered by british geologist guy pilgrim in balochistan in 1907 1908 his material consisted of an upper jaw lower teeth and back of a jaw fossils were collected in formation of dera bugti where pilgrim had previously been exploring in 1908 he used fossils as basis for a new species of extinct rhinoceros genus aceratherium a bugtiense aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros many of which have since been moved to other genera prothero 2013 pp 17 34 fossil incisors that pilgrim had previously assigned to unrelated genus were later shown to belong to new species thumb 1913 illustration of an astragalus bone foot bone atlas bone and various vertebrae which were part of basis for baluchitherium osborni now a synonym of p bugtiense in 1910 more partial fossils were discovered in dera bugti during an expedition by british palaeontologist clive forster cooper based on these remains foster cooper moved a bugtiense to new genus paraceratherium meaning near hornless beast in reference to aceratherium his rationale for this reclassification was species distinctly down turned lower tusks in 1913 forster cooper named a new genus and species wonderful beast osborni based on larger fossils from same excavations some of which he had earlier suggested to belong to male p bugtiense but he renamed genus baluchitherium later that year because former name was preoccupied as it had already been used for a hemipteran insect fossils of baluchitherium were so fragmentary that foster cooper was only able to identify it as a kind of odd toed ungulate but he mentioned possibility of confusion with paraceratherium american palaeontologist henry fairfield osborn after which b osborni was named suggested it may have been a titanothere a russian academy of sciences expedition later found fossils in aral formation near aral sea in kazakhstan it was most complete indricothere skeleton known but it lacked skull in 1916 based on these remains aleksei borissiak erected genus indricotherium named for a mythological monster beast he did not assign a species name i until 1923 but russian palaeontologist maria pavlova had already named it i transouralicum in 1922 also in 1923 borissiak created subfamily indricotheriinae to include various related forms known by then in 1922 american explorer roy chapman andrews led a well documented expedition to china and mongolia sponsored by american museum of natural history various indricothere remains were found in formations of mongolian gobi desert including legs of a specimen standing in an upright position indicating that it had died while trapped in quicksand as well as a very complete skull these remains became basis of baluchitherium grangeri named by osborn in 1923 prothero 2013 pp 1 16 in 2017 a new species p huangheense was named by chinese palaeontologist yong xiang li and colleagues based on jaw elements from formation in gansu province of china name refers to nearby river a multitude of other species and genus based on differences in size snout shape and front tooth been coined for various indricothere remains fossils attributable to paraceratherium continue to be discovered across eurasia but political situation in pakistan has become too unstable for further excavations to occur there species and synonyms thumb left preparator with p transouralicum skull amnh formerly assigned to b grangeri american museum of natural history in 1922 forster cooper named new species metamynodon bugtiensis based on a palate and other fragments from dera bugti thought to belong to a giant member of that genus these fossils are now thought to have belonged to an aberrant paraceratherium bugtiense specimen that lacked m3 molar in 1936 american palaeontologists walter granger and william k gregory proposed that forster cooper s baluchitherium osborni was likely a junior synonym an invalid name for same taxon of paraceratherium bugtiense because these specimens were collected at same locality and were possibly part of same morphologically variable species american palaeontologist william diller matthew and forster cooper himself had expressed similar doubts few years earlier although it had already been declared a junior synonym genus name baluchitherium remained popular in various media because of publicity surrounding osborn s b grangeri prothero 2013 pp 67 86 thumb 1911 illustration of a p bugtiense incisor and part of a mandible in 1989 american palaeontologists spencer g lucas and jay c sobus published a revision of indricothere taxa which is followed by most western scientists today they concluded that paraceratherium as oldest name was only valid indricothere genus from oligocene and contained four valid species p bugtiense p transouralicum originally in indricotherium p prohorovi originally in and p orgosensis originally in dzungariotherium they considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa or as dubious names based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly by analysing alleged differences between named genera and species lucas and sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens as had been pointed out in 1930s fact that single skull assigned to p transouralicum or indricotherium was domed while others were flat at top was attributed to sexual dimorphism it is possible that p bugtiense fossils represent female while p transouralicum represents male of same species according to lucas and sobus type species p bugtiense from late oligocene of pakistan includes junior synonyms such as b osborni and p p transouralicum from late oligocene of kazakhstan mongolia and northern china includes b grangeri and i minus in 2013 american palaeontologist donald prothero suggested that p orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name dzungariotherium though its exact position requires evaluation p prohorovi from late oligocene of kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to be resolved in relation to other species same applies to proposed species such as i and p tienshanensis as well as genus though genus name indricotherium is now a junior synonym of paraceratherium subfamily name indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect names of higher level taxa that are derived from these members of subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres in contrast to revision by lucas and sobus a 2003 paper by chinese palaeontologist jie ye and colleagues suggested that indricotherium and dzungariotherium were valid genera and that p prohorovi did not belong in paraceratherium they also recognised validity of species such as p p tienshanensis and p sui a 2004 paper by chinese palaeontologist tao deng and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since 1989 revision but without providing detailed analysis and justification evolution thumb comparison of front teeth of metamynodon amynodontidae hyracodon hyracodontidae paraceratherium indricotheriinae and rhinocerotidae superfamily rhinocerotoidea which includes modern rhinoceroses can be traced back to early 50 million years early precursors such as rhinocerotoidea contains three families amynodontidae rhinocerotidae true rhinoceroses and hyracodontidae diversity within rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times they ranged from dog sized to size of paraceratherium there were long legged cursorial forms adapted for running and squat semi aquatic forms most species did not have horns rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth which is part of animals most likely to be preserved upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi shaped p pattern on crown and each lower molar has paired l shapes various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses subfamily indricotheriinae to which paraceratherium belongs was first classified as part of family hyracodontidae by american palaeontologist leonard b radinsky in 1966 previously they had been regarded as a subfamily within or even a full family in a 1999 cladistic study of american palaeontologist luke holbrook found indricotheres to be outside clade and wrote that they may not be a monophyletic natural grouping radinsky s scheme is prevalent hypothesis today hyracodont family contains long legged members adapted to running such as hyracodon and were distinguished by incisor characteristics indricotheres are distinguished from other hyracodonts by their larger size and derived structure of their snouts incisors and canines earliest known indricothere is dog sized forstercooperia from middle and late eocene of western north america and asia cow sized juxia is known from middle eocene by late eocene genus urtinotherium of asia had almost reached size of paraceratherium prothero 2013 pp 53 66 paraceratherium itself lived in eurasia during oligocene period 23 to 34 million years ago genus is distinguished from other indricotheres by its large size nasal incision that would have supported a muscular snout and its down turned premaxillae it had also lost second and third lower incisors lower canines and lower first premolars thumb skull and neck of juxia a cow sized relative from middle eocene museum of china cladogram below follows 1989 analysis of indricotheriinae by lucas and sobus and shows closest relatives of paraceratherium lucas and colleagues had reached similar conclusions in a previous 1981 analysis of forstercooperia wherein they still retained paraceratherium and indricotherium as separate genera in 2016 chinese researchers wang and colleagues used name for family and for subfamily and placed them outside of hyracodontidae description thumb estimated size of p transouralicum olive green compared with that of humans other large mammals and dinosaur patagotitan paraceratherium is one of largest known land mammals that have ever existed but its precise size is unclear because of lack of complete specimens its total body length was estimated as from front to back by granger and gregory in 1936 and by soviet palaeontologist vera gromova in 1959 but former estimate is now considered exaggerated weight of paraceratherium was similar to that of some extinct proboscideans with largest complete skeleton known belonging to steppe mammoth mammuthus trogontherii despite its roughly equivalent mass paraceratherium might have been taller than any its shoulder height was estimated as at shoulders by granger and gregory but by american palaeontologist gregory s paul in 1997 neck was estimated at long by palaeontologists michael p taylor and mathew j wedel in 2013 thumb left life restoration of p transouralicum early estimates of are now considered exaggerated it may have been in range of at maximum and as low as on average calculations have mainly been based on fossils of p transouralicum because this species is known from most complete remains estimates have been based on skull teeth and limb bone measurements but known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations resulting in several weight ranges there are no indications of colour and skin texture of animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known most life restorations show creature s skin as thick folded grey and hairless based on modern rhinoceroses because hair retains body heat modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless prothero has proposed that contrary to most depictions paraceratherium had large elephant like ears that it used for thermoregulation ears of elephants enlarge body s surface area and are filled with blood vessels making dissipation of excess heat easier according to prothero this would have been true for paraceratherium as indicated by robust bones around ear openings prothero 2013 pp 87 106 palaeontologists pierre olivier antoine and darren naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea skull thumb p transouralicum skull amnh largest skulls of paraceratherium are around long at back of skull and wide across by zygomatic arches paraceratherium had a long forehead which was smooth and lacked roughened area that serves as attachment point for horns of other rhinoceroses bones above nasal region are long and nasal incision goes far into skull this indicates that paraceratherium had a prehensile upper lip similar to that of black rhinoceros and indian rhinoceros or a short proboscis trunk as in tapirs back of skull was low and narrow without large lambdoid crests at top and along sagittal crest which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight it also had a deep pit for attachment of nuchal ligaments which hold up skull automatically occipital condyle was very wide and paraceratherium appears to have had large strong neck muscles which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches one skull of p transouralicum has a domed forehead whereas others have flat foreheads possibly because of sexual dimorphism a brain endocast of p transouralicum shows it was only 8 percent of skull length while brain of indian rhinoceros is 17 7 percent of its skull length left thumb upper molars of p transouralicum musee d histoire naturelle paris species of paraceratherium are mainly discernible through skull characteristics p bugtiense had features such as relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae shallow skull roofs mastoid paroccipital processes that were relatively thin and placed back on skull a lambdoid crest which extended less back and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation which it shared with dzungariotherium p transouralicum had robust maxillae and premaxillae upturned domed frontal bones thick mastoid paroccipital processes a lambdoid crest that extended back and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation p huangheense differed from p bugtiense only in anatomy of rear portion of jaw as well as its larger size unlike those of most primitive rhinoceroses front teeth of paraceratherium were reduced to a single pair of incisors in either jaw which were large and conical and have been described as tusks upper incisors pointed downwards lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards among known rhinoceroses this arrangement is unique to paraceratherium and related urtinotherium incisors may have been larger in males canine teeth otherwise found behind incisors were lost incisors were separated from row of cheek teeth by a large diastema gap this feature is found in mammals where incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations upper molars except for third upper molar that was v shaped had a pi shaped p pattern and a reduced premolars only partially formed pi pattern each molar was size of a human fist among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans though they were small relative to size of skull lower cheek teeth were l shaped which is typical of rhinoceroses postcranial skeleton thumb upright hind foot of p transouralicum amnh no complete set of vertebrae and ribs of paraceratherium has yet been found and tail is completely unknown atlas and axis vertebrae of neck were wider than in most modern rhinoceroses with space for strong ligaments and muscles that would be needed to hold up large head rest of vertebrae were also very wide and had large zygapophyses with much room for muscles tendons ligaments and nerves to support head neck and spine neural spines were long and formed a long hump along back where neck muscles and nuchal ligaments for holding up skull were attached ribs were similar to those of modern rhinoceroses but ribcage would have looked smaller in proportion to long legs and large bodies because modern rhinoceroses are comparatively short limbed last vertebra of lower back was fused to sacrum a feature found in advanced rhinoceroses like sauropod dinosaurs paraceratherium had pleurocoel like openings hollow parts of bone in their pre sacral vertebrae which probably helped to lighten skeleton thumb left 1923 skeletal reconstructions of b grangeri now p transouralicum in rhinoceros like and slender versions limbs were large and robust to support animal s large weight and were in some ways similar to and convergent with those of elephants and sauropod dinosaurs with their likewise graviportal heavy and slow moving builds unlike such animals which tend to lengthen upper limb bones while shortening fusing and compressing lower limb hand and foot bones paraceratherium had short upper limb bones and long hand and foot for disc shaped to running rhinoceroses from which they descended some foot bones were almost long thigh bones typically measured a size only exceeded by those of some elephants and dinosaurs thigh bones were pillar like and much thicker and more robust than those of other rhinoceroses and three on sides were much reduced as this robustness diminished their importance limbs were held in a column like posture instead of bent as in smaller animals which reduced need for large limb muscles front limbs had three toes due to fragmentary nature of known paraceratherium fossils skeleton of animal has been reconstructed in several different ways since its discovery in 1923 matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of skeleton based on even less complete p transouralicum specimens known by then using proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide result was too squat and compact and osborn had a more slender version drawn later same year some later life restorations have made animal too slender with little regard to underlying skeleton gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959 based on p transouralicum skeleton from aral formation but this also lacked several neck vertebrae palaeobiology thumb left foraging herd of p transouralicum by elizabeth fulda 1923 british zoologist robert m alexander suggested in 1988 that overheating may have been a serious problem in paraceratherium due to its size according to prothero best living analogues for paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses to aid in thermoregulation these animals cool down during day by resting in shade or by wallowing in water and mud they also forage and move mainly at night because of its large size paraceratherium would not have been able to run and move quickly but they would have been able to cross large distances which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food they may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least and that because of a scarcity of resources there would have been little room in asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera this principle is called competitive exclusion it is used to explain how black rhinoceros a browser and white rhinoceros a grazer exploit different niches in same areas of africa most terrestrial predators in their habitat were no bigger than a modern wolf and were not a threat to paraceratherium adult individuals would be too large for any land predators to attack but young would have been vulnerable bite marks on bones from bugti beds indicate that even adults may have been preyed on by long crocodiles crocodylus bugtiensis as in elephants gestation period of paraceratherium may have been lengthy and individuals may have had long lifespans paraceratherium may have lived in small herds perhaps consisting of females and their calves which they protected from predators it has been proposed that may be maximum weight possible for land mammals and paraceratherium was close to this limit reasons mammals cannot reach much larger size of sauropod dinosaurs are unknown reason may be ecological instead of biomechanical and perhaps related to reproduction strategies movement sound and other behaviours seen in cgi documentaries such as walking with beasts are entirely conjectural diet and feeding thumb p transouralicum skull illustration simple low crowned teeth indicate that paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs later rhinoceroses were grazers with high crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth studies of on paraceratherium teeth confirm creatures had a diet of soft leaves studies have yet to be conducted isotope analysis shows that paraceratherium fed chiefly on c3 plants which are mainly leaves like its relatives horses tapirs and other rhinoceroses paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive like other large herbivores paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract granger and gregory argued that large incisors were used for defence or for loosening shrubs by moving neck downwards thereby acting as picks and levers tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with front teeth this ability would have been helpful to paraceratherium some russian authors suggested that tusks were probably used for breaking twigs stripping bark and bending high branches and that because species from early oligocene had larger tusks than later ones they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet since species involved are now known to have been contemporaneous and differences in tusks are now thought to be sexually dimorphic latter idea is not accepted today herds of paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees which smaller mammals could not reach osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been similar to that of high browsing giraffe and okapi rather than to modern rhinoceroses whose heads are carried close to ground distribution and habitat thumb left locations of fossil finds remains assignable to paraceratherium have been found in early to late oligocene 34 23 million years ago formations across eurasia in modern day china mongolia india pakistan kazakhstan georgia turkey romania bulgaria and balkans their distribution may be correlated with palaeogeographic development of alpine himalayan mountain belt range of paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers so genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this fauna which coexisted with paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses artiodactyls rodents weasels and cats thumb restoration of a p transouralicum pair with two below habitat of paraceratherium appears to have varied across its range based on types of geological formations it has been found in gol formation of mongolia represents an arid desert basin and environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover as fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to ground a study of fossil pollen showed that much of china was woody shrubland with plants such as saltbush mormon tea and bush all adapted to arid environments trees were rare and concentrated near groundwater parts of china where paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes and most common plant fossils are leaves of desert adapted trees in mongolia and china included birch elm oaks and other deciduous trees while siberia and kazakhstan also had walnut trees dera bugti in pakistan had dry temperate to subtropical forest extinction reasons paraceratherium became extinct after surviving for about 11 million years are unknown but it is unlikely that there was a single cause theories include climate change low reproduction rate and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans from africa in late oligocene between 28 and 23 million years ago may have been able to considerably change habitats they entered in same way that african elephants do today by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats large predators like and also entered asia from africa during early miocene between 23 and 16 million years ago these may have preyed on paraceratherium calves other herbivores also invaded asia during this time prothero 2013 pp 107 121 references bibliography category oligocene rhinoceroses category genus
