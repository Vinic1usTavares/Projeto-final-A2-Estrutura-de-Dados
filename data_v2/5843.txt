gaylussacia brachycera commonly known as box huckleberry or box leaved is a low north american shrub related to blueberry and other huckleberries it is native to east central united states pennsylvania delaware maryland virginia west virginia north carolina kentucky and tennessee biota of north america program 2014 county distribution map gaylussacia brachycera is easily distinguished from other members of its genus by its leaves they resemble those of boxwood hence its name and lack resin glands typical of huckleberries like its relatives it bears white urn shaped flowers in early summer which develop to blue edible berries in late summer it is mostly found in appalachia many of its stations there were known to natives who picked and ate berries before botanists became aware of them in 1920s a relict species nearly exterminated by last ice age box huckleberry is self sterile and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots one colony in pennsylvania was once estimated to be as many as 13 000 years old more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8 000 years which would make it oldest woody plant east of rocky mountains another colony in pennsylvania about 1 300 years old has been protected by hoverter and sholl box huckleberry natural area description box huckleberry is a low shrub tall its leaves resemble those of boxwood hence its name about long and oval shaped they are glossy and minutely toothed turning red in winter evergreen leaves lacking resin glands are in sharp contrast to other species of gaylussacia box huckleberry flowers in may and june flowers are urn shaped and white sometimes tinged with pink like other huckleberries flowers appear on a raceme springing from leaf axils its fruits which appear in july and august are blue berries borne on short pedicels flora of north america gaylussacia brachycera michaux a gray 1846 box huckleberry taxonomy box huckleberry was first collected and described in 1796 near winchester virginia probably in what is now west virginia by botanist andre michaux michaux named it vaccinium in his flora americana published in 1803 matthias kinn in about 1800 and frederick in 1805 also obtained specimens in west virginia r a salisbury referred to it as v in 1805 and this remained prevailing name for next forty years common name box leaved berry was used for species at time no further specimens were collected until 1845 when spencer baird a professor at dickinson college discovered a colony near new bloomfield pennsylvania it was redesignated g brachycera in 1846 by asa gray on basis of baird s specimens gaylussacia was not recognized as a genus separate from vaccinium until 1819 discovery brought about a friendship between gray and baird that ultimately resulted in latter s appointment as secretary of smithsonian institution john kunkel small assigned species as brachycera to a monospecific genus in 1933 however this was not widely accepted and was rejected by other authors on grounds of both nomenclatural and phyletic more recently phylogenetic studies in 2002 suggested that monophyly of g brachycera with remainder of gaylussacia is equivocal and further analysis of vaccinium might result in g brachycera being returned to that genus distribution and habitat about 100 separate stations for box huckleberry have been documented in scientific literature by time of baird s collection in 1845 west virginia stations of plant had been lost to science and his pennsylvania colony was only one known for some time specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in delaware in 1870 by william m canby in 1919 frederick v coville called attention to threatened state of plant in an article in science while investigating species for horticultural purposes he only found two herbarium specimens those of baird and canby coville apparently did not locate kinn s west virginia specimen preserved at muhlenberg herbarium upon examination of new bloomfield site in 1918 he discovered entire colony except for one patch cut off by cultivation was connected by roots and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around margins of colony coville concluded that plant was self sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks after commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from new bloomfield site in 1918 coville was particularly anxious to preserve species as new bloomfield site was only one then thought extant it was protected by state from 1929 becoming hoverter and sholl box huckleberry natural area however edgar t wherry was able to locate delaware colony thought lost in 1919 and send specimens for cross pollination with specimens from pennsylvania colony this report stimulated considerable interest in species additional colonies were located in pennsylvania and delaware one in maryland several in virginia three in tennessee 1920 1930 two in kentucky 1927 1932 and many in west virginia 1921 in summarizing these discoveries in 1932 wherry noted that many of colonies were already known to local residents who picked berries for food under names such as juniper berry ground huckleberry and bear huckleberry he called for more intensive effort on part of scientific community to make use of such local knowledge in determining plant geography more recently a colony of box huckleberry was discovered in durham county north carolina first report from that state in 2003 most of reported stations for box huckleberry fall within appalachian mountains ranging from central pennsylvania in north to eastern tennessee in south however specimens located in maryland and delaware were found on atlantic coastal plain and single north carolina station is in piedmont its scattered distribution suggests that species once spread more broadly across north america but was almost eradicated by glacial advances surviving only where it escaped ice in protected refugia box huckleberry prefers dry acidic soils including duff and partial shade locations on wooded slopes tend to face north however new bloomfield site faces west at one of delaware sites a small portion of colony extended to wet margin of a marsh but most was located on dry sandy soil upslope ecology and human use box huckleberry is self sterile so single plants cannot reproduce sexually instead they form colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks a colony of g brachycera at losh run pennsylvania was found to be long when surveyed if this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along juniata river at rate of per year it would be about 13 000 years old oldest living organism in united states and second oldest in world eclipsed only by lomatia tasmanica however this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds at that time site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for box huckleberry to survive current forest did not begin to appear at site until about 8 000 years ago this age would still make it oldest woody plant in north america east of rocky mountains recent studies have attempted to determine whether in fact reproduction of colony since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in 1970s has been entirely clonal two genotypes were found in samples taken from colony but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction unfortunately destruction of about 80 of colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle question caterpillar of moth has been reported to feed on leaves berries are eaten by wild turkeys and ruffed grouse they have been harvested for food by humans in west virginia kentucky and tennessee rev frederick w gray who documented many of box huckleberry colonies in west virginia in 1920s first took an interest in plant when served a juniper pie juniper being local name for box huckleberry however they are reportedly tasteless with cooperation of united states department of agriculture efforts are under way to promote g brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source but it is difficult to propagate making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry it is commonly marketed as berried treasure tm trademark symbol is not always present and while name gives impression of being a cultivar it is simply a propagate of wild colony briggs nursery has developed a treasure chest logo and stylized title to accompany its
