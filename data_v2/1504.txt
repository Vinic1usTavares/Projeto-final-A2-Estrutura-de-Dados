thumb term paratheria was proposed as a result of hypothesis that edentates such as this brown throated sloth bradypus variegatus are distinct from other placental mammals paratheria is an obsolete term for a taxonomic group including xenarthran mammals sloths anteaters and armadillos and various groups thought to be related to them it was proposed by oldfield thomas in 1887 to set apart sloths anteaters armadillos and pangolins usually classified as placentals from both marsupial and placental mammals an arrangement that received little support from other workers when teeth of extinct mammals were first discovered in argentina in 1980s they were thought to be related to xenarthrans leading to renewed attention for hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals however by early 1990s gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals history term paratheria was coined by british mammalogist oldfield thomas in 1887 in a review of tooth development in mammals he found that edentata were especially distinctive in this group he included sloths anteaters and armadillos which are still placed together as xenarthra as well as pangolins and aardvark according to thomas edentate teeth would be derived from very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution consequently he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from other major groupings of mammals for which terms had been introduced by thomas huxley eutheria placentals and marsupials for this new grouping he suggested name paratheria to indicate their position by side of but separate from other mammals greek para para means beside thomas had included one other mammal among edentates aardvark however he was unable to provide a satisfactory scenario for origin of its wholly unique dentition which he could only compare with that of some fish thomas s arrangement was foreshadowed by henri marie ducrotay de blainville s 1839 classification he placed edentates except sloth bradypus which he considered to be a primate as a major division poorly toothed this group was considered to be distinct from other placentals bien well toothed similarly paul gervais proposed in 1855 that edentates should be placed in a separate subclass of mammals thomas s hypothesis received little support or even attention in subsequent years in 1893 henry fairfield osborn remarked that new studies of edentate teeth indicated that they were not as distinct as thomas thought william berryman scott did however place paratheria as a separate subclass in 1904 although he apparently did not follow thomas s theories about origins of edentate teeth in 1910 william king gregory reviewed interrelationships of mammals and placed edentates among other placentals though he gave paratheria as an alternative name for his superorder edentata which included xenarthra and tentatively pholidota pangolins tubulidentata aardvarks and fossil in 1976 eli minkoff also used paratheria for a placental superorder that included edentata for sloths armadillos and anteaters and pholidota paratheria hypothesis enjoyed a brief renaissance when unusual high crowned teeth began turning up in cretaceous and paleocene fossil record of argentina in 1984 sudamerica from paleocene of argentina was assigned to xenarthra within paratheria ranked as a cohort a taxonomic rank between infraclass and superorder two years later jose bonaparte named from late cretaceous of argentina which he thought to be related to sudamerica and tentatively assigned it to paratheria now ranked as an infraclass bonaparte described an additional related animal vucetichia gracilis from argentinean late cretaceous in 1990 by then he classified it in order which was tentatively assigned to infraclass paratheria bonaparte argued against george gaylord simpson s 1931 view that xenarthrans derive from tertiary of north america and instead suggested that xenarthrans and perhaps pangolins split from eutherians placentals and their extinct relatives as early as early cretaceous and derived from some early a now abandoned grouping of early mammals including among others however bonaparte himself had abandoned proposed relationship between xenarthrans and gondwanatherians by 1993 instead gondwanatherians were shown to be related to another late cretaceous argentinean animal which turned out to be from vucetichia and through it to multituberculates relation between multituberculates and gondwanatheres later became controversial but they are no longer thought to be related to xenarthrans by 1996 few if any systematists would doubt eutherian affinities of xenarthrans and molecular data have also supported placement of xenarthra within placentals as one of four major clades name paratheria is no longer in use references literature cited category gondwanatheres category obsolete mammal taxa category xenarthrans
