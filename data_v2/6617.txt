hurricane alex was a rare june atlantic hurricane and first tropical cyclone to develop in 2010 atlantic hurricane season originating from an area of disturbed weather on june 25 2010 it slowly developed in western caribbean sea and struck belize as a strong tropical storm after entering gulf of mexico alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development early on june 30 cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern mexico first june hurricane in atlantic basin since hurricane allison in 1995 and storm rapidly intensified just off coast of tamaulipas alex came ashore near soto la marina as a category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale alex caused deaths of at least 51 people along its path and produced over 1 5 billion 2010 usd in damage precursor of hurricane produced substantial rainfall across greater antilles causing one death in dominican republic fourteen people were killed in central america as a result of flooding during first landfall of alex in mexico storm s outer rainbands killed three people in acapulco one person in oaxaca and another in chiapas at its final landfall alex caused at least fifteen deaths in nuevo leon eight in coahuila six in guanajuato and one in both tamaulipas and san luis potosi an additional twenty persons were reported missing alex triggered widespread power outages throughout northeastern mexico and southern texas damage was most evident in monterrey metropolitan area which faced what nuevo leon governor rodrigo medina de la cruz described as worst weather phenomenon in its history following alex s final landfall a state of emergency was declared for most of nuevo leon portions of tamaulipas and texas widespread flooding from storm affected 500 000 people throughout northeast mexico and ruined over of crops in region equivalent to 11 of region s total farmland meteorological history weather system from which hurricane alex developed was first discernible as a disturbance in intertropical convergence zone itcz on june 17 2010 over next few days most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within itcz national hurricane center nhc first mentioned it as a candidate for tropical cyclone formation on june 20 while it was crossing windward islands into southeastern caribbean sea at time some upper level wind shear was present leading to conditions only marginally favorable for development system moved through caribbean and on june 21 it developed to extent that nhc assessed a 50 chance of development into a tropical depression within 48 hours next day however feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across greater antilles although upper level regime remained favorable for eventual redevelopment on june 24 a low level circulation had gradually become better established to south of jamaica although it was displaced from its poorly organized convection by 1800 utc a surface low pressure area had formed about 105 miles 165 km to northeast of cabo gracias a dios nicaragua but due to a lack of persistent thunderstorm activity it was not yet considered a tropical cyclone later that day convection increased over center of circulation and atmospheric pressures dropped across region late on june 25 hurricane hunters verified development of a surface low pressure area which combined with increase of thunderstorm activity indicated system was a tropical depression accordingly cyclone was classified as tropical depression one at 2200 utc while located about 345 miles 555 km to east southeast of chetumal quintana roo after end of hurricane season national hurricane center revised their analysis and estimated that system had actually become a tropical depression at around 1800 utc at time of its formation depression was moving to west northwest steered by a high pressure system over northern gulf of mexico an anticyclone positioned over storm created an environment of minimal wind shear and depression quickly intensified at 0900 utc on june 26 it obtained tropical storm status and was given name alex as tropical storm alex progressed through western caribbean sea towards yucatan peninsula it developed a large field of clouds accompanied by well established outflow throughout its circulation its inner structure was initially disorganized although by late on june 26 it became better defined at about 2100 utc as tropical storm approached belize coast a hurricane hunters flight reported winds of 65 mph 100 km h early on june 27 alex made landfall just north of belize city at this intensity upon moving ashore an area of convection increased over center and convection initially became better defined as it crossed yucatan peninsula while most tropical cyclones weaken and become disorganized after landfall alex seemed to become stronger when viewed on radar and satellite imagery national hurricane center noted in one of its forecast discussions that cyclone s structure more closely resembled a hurricane than a deteriorating storm still after enough time over land convective activity markedly decreased and alex weakened to tropical depression status as it approached peninsula s western coastline although post analysis determined that alex remained a minimal tropical storm late on june 27 storm emerged into gulf of mexico with a large overall convective structure but little thunderstorm activity near center due to interaction with land right thumb visible satellite image of tropical storm alex near yucatan peninsula when alex was still located over yucatan peninsula nhc remarked upon potential for significant strengthening because of low wind shear and very warm water temperatures in gulf of mexico possibility existed that alex could intensify into a major hurricane a category 3 storm on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale before its next landfall early on june 28 thunderstorm activity had reformed over center and depression re intensified into a tropical storm for next day combination of dry air increasing wind shear and slightly cooler water temperatures prevented significant convection from developing over center at same time alex was moving slowly off northwest coast of yucatan peninsula and environment s conditions became more favorable for intensification as tropical storm tracked away from coast circulation envelope of alex remained very large and by june 29 storm s rainbands covered entire western half of gulf of mexico rainfall was reported along texas and louisiana coasts even while center was still several hundred miles offshore tropical storm continued to strengthen and based on reports from hurricane hunters it is estimated that alex attained hurricane status at 0300 utc on june 30 about 255 miles 415 km southeast of brownsville texas upon becoming a hurricane alex was located in a moist low shear environment which led to steady intensification on june 30 pressure continued to fall a sign of an intensifying cyclone with a more rapid drop occurring that afternoon and evening hurricane strengthened into a category 2 storm late on june 30 as it approached northeastern mexican coast at 0200 utc on july 1 alex made landfall at peak strength with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph 165 km h gusts of 125 mph 205 km h and an unusually low central pressure of in municipality of soto la marina in mexican state of tamaulipas after storm national hurricane center revised landfall intensity estimate showing alex was even stronger when it struck mexican coast with sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a central pressure of several hours after moving ashore storm weakened to category 1 status and its structure began to deteriorate however deep convection persisted around center by 1200 utc alex had weakened into a tropical storm by 0000 utc july 2 sierra madre oriental disrupted alex s core causing storm to weaken into a tropical depression and dissipate over san luis potosi however interaction with mountain range caused orographic lift on eastern side of storm after center of circulation had ceased to exist producing torrential rainfall throughout northern and central mexico following dissipation of alex divergence at 200 mb atmospheric pressure level approximately at of altitude a ridge of high pressure located over southern texas and alex s residual moisture interacted to produce intense convection over nuevo leon tamaulipas and coahuila for next 72 hours preparations caribbean immediately after storm formed on june 25 a tropical storm warning was issued for entire east coast of quintana roo on mexico s yucatan peninsula shortly thereafter tropical storm warning was extended to include east coast of belize late on june 25 government of honduras issued a tropical
