which can vary widely depending on committee s jurisdiction size and political importance a small percentage of each committee s budget and staff are devoted to institutional needs of committee staff employed in this capacity are known as committee staff and are nonpartisan career employees under rules established by majority party in each chamber remaining budget and staff are allocated to majority and largest minority party respectively these staff are known as majority staff and minority staff although many commentators refer to all committee staff as committee staff leading to some confusion tradition of firm party control in house of representatives usually means that majority party will control as much as 80 percent of a committee s staff and budget while minority party and nonpartisan committee staff control 10 percent each in senate tradition of comity and unanimous consent has led to distribution of staff and budgetary resources on a basis closer to each party s representation in that chamber there is wide variety in titles and functions of committee majority and minority staff as chief minority counsel kennedy led a small legal staff employed to provide
