palmyra palmyrene tadmor tadmur is an ancient semitic city in present day homs governorate syria archaeological finds date back to neolithic period and documents first mention city in early second millennium bc palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of roman empire in first century ad city grew wealthy from trade caravans palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along silk road and operated throughout roman empire palmyra s wealth enabled construction of monumental projects such as great colonnade temple of bel and distinctive tower tombs ethnically palmyrenes combined elements of amorites arameans and arabs city s social structure was tribal and its inhabitants spoke palmyrene a dialect of aramaic while using greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes greco roman culture influenced culture of palmyra which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions city s inhabitants worshiped local semitic deities mesopotamian and arab gods by third century ad palmyra had become a prosperous regional center it reached apex of its power in when palmyrene king odaenathus defeated persian emperor shapur i king was succeeded by regent queen zenobia who rebelled against rome and established palmyrene empire in 273 roman emperor aurelian destroyed city which was later restored by diocletian at a reduced size palmyrenes converted to christianity during fourth century and to islam in centuries following conquest by 7th century rashidun caliphate after which palmyrene and greek languages were replaced by arabic before ad 273 palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to roman province of syria having its political organization influenced by greek city state model during first two centuries ad city became a roman colonia during third century leading to incorporation of roman governing institutions before becoming a monarchy in 260 following its destruction in 273 palmyra became a minor center under byzantines and later empires its destruction by in 1400 reduced it to a small village under french mandatory rule in 1932 inhabitants were moved into new village of tadmur and ancient site became available for excavations during syrian civil war in 2015 islamic state of iraq and levant isil destroyed large parts of ancient city which was recaptured by syrian army on 2 march 2017 etymology records of name tadmor date from early second millennium bc eighteenth century bc tablets from mari written in cuneiform record name as ta ad mi ir while assyrian inscriptions of eleventh century bc record it as ta ad mar aramaic palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of name tdmr i e tadmar and i e tadmor etymology of name is unclear standard interpretation supported by albert schultens connects it to semitic word for date palm tamar thus referring to palm trees that surrounded city greek name latinized palmyra was first recorded by pliny elder in 1st century ad it was used throughout greco roman world it is generally believed that palmyra derives from tadmor and linguists have presented two possibilities one view holds that palmyra was an alteration of tadmor according to suggestion by schultens palmyra could have arisen as a corruption of tadmor via an unattested form changed to by influence of latin word palma date palm in reference to city s palm trees then name reached its final form palmyra second view supported by some philologists such as jean starcky holds that palmyra is a translation of tadmor assuming that it meant palm which had derived from greek word for palm palame an alternative suggestion connects name to syriac tedmurta miracle hence tedmurta object of wonder from root dmr to wonder this possibility was mentioned favourably by franz altheim and ruth altheim 1973 but rejected by jean starcky 1960 and michael gawlikowski 1974 michael patrick o connor 1988 suggested that names palmyra and tadmor originated in hurrian language as evidence he cited of alterations to theorized roots of both names represented in addition of d to tamar and ra to palame according to this theory tadmor derives from hurrian word tad to love with addition of typical hurrian mid vowel rising mvr formant mar similarly according to this theory palmyra derives from hurrian word pal to know using same mvr formant mar location and city layout palmyra lies northeast of syrian capital damascus in an oasis surrounded by palms of which twenty varieties have been reported two mountain ranges overlook city northern palmyrene mountain belt from north and southern palmyrene mountains from southwest in south and east palmyra is exposed to syrian desert a small wadi al qubur crosses area flowing from western hills past city before disappearing in eastern gardens of oasis south of wadi is a spring efqa pliny elder described town in 70s ad as famous for its desert location richness of its soil and springs surrounding it which made agriculture and herding possible layout palmyra began as a small settlement near efqa spring on southern bank of wadi al qubur settlement known as hellenistic settlement had residences expanding to wadi s northern bank during first century although city s walls originally enclosed an extensive area on both banks of wadi walls rebuilt during aurelian s reign surrounded only northern bank section most of city s monumental projects were built on wadi s northern bank among them is temple of bel on a tell which was site of an earlier temple known as hellenistic temple however excavation supports theory that tell was originally located on southern bank and wadi was diverted south of tell to incorporate temple into palmyra s late first and early second century urban organization on north bank also north of wadi was great colonnade palmyra s main street which extended from temple of bel in east to funerary temple no 86 in city s western part it had a monumental arch in its eastern section and a tetrapylon stands in center baths of diocletian were on left side of colonnade nearby were residences temple of baalshamin and byzantine churches which include basilica iv palmyra s largest church church is dated to justinian age its columns are estimated to be high and its base measured temple of nabu and roman theater were built on colonnade s southern side behind theater were a small senate building and large agora with remains of a triclinium banquet room and tariff court a cross street at western end of colonnade leads to camp of diocletian built by hierocles roman governor of syria nearby are temple of al lat and damascus gate people language and society thumb left alt bust of a deceased woman palmyrene funerary portrait at its height during reign of zenobia palmyra had more than 200 000 residents its earliest known inhabitants were amorites in early second millennium bc and by end of millennium arameans were mentioned as inhabiting area arabs arrived in city in late first millennium bc sheikh zabdibel who aided seleucids in battle of raphia 217 bc was mentioned as commander of arabs and neighbouring tribes to number of ten thousands zabdibel and his men were not actually identified as palmyrenes in texts but name zabdibel is a palmyrene name leading to conclusion that sheikh hailed from palmyra arab newcomers were assimilated by earlier inhabitants used palmyrene as a mother tongue and formed a significant segment of aristocracy city also had a jewish community inscriptions in palmyrene from necropolis of beit she in lower galilee confirm burial of palmyrene jews occasionally and rarely members of palmyrene families took greek names while ethnic greeks were few majority of people with greek names who did not belong to one of city s families were freed slaves palmyrenes seem to have disliked greeks considered them foreigners and restricted their settlement in city thumb alt alphabetic inscription on stone alphabetic inscription in palmyrene alphabet until late third century ad palmyrenes spoke a dialect of aramaic and used palmyrene alphabet use of latin was minimal but greek was used by wealthier members of society for commercial and diplomatic purposes and it became dominant language during byzantine era after arab conquest greek was replaced by arabic from which a palmyrene dialect evolved palmyra s society was a mixture of different peoples inhabiting city which is seen in aramaic arabic and amorite clan names palmyra was a tribal community but due to lack of sources an understanding of nature of palmyrene tribal structure is not possible thirty clans have been documented five of which were identified as tribes phyle phule comprising several sub clans by time of nero palmyra had four tribes each residing in an area of city bearing its name three of tribes were komare mattabol and ma zin fourth tribe is uncertain but was probably mita in time four tribes became highly civic and tribal lines blurred by second century clan identity lost its importance and it disappeared during third century even four tribes ceased to be important by third century as only one inscription mentions a tribe after year 212 instead aristocrats played decisive role in city s social organization during umayyad period palmyra was mainly inhabited by kalb tribe benjamin of tudela recorded existence of 2 000 jews in city during twelfth century palmyra declined after its destruction by timur in 1400 and was a village of 6 000 inhabitants at beginning of 20th century although surrounded by bedouin villagers preserved their dialect palmyra maintained life of a small settlement until its relocation in 1932 culture scarce artifacts found in city dating to bronze age reveal that culturally palmyra was most affiliated with western syria classical palmyra had a distinctive culture based on a local semitic tradition and influenced by greece and rome to appear better integrated into roman empire some palmyrenes adopted greco roman names either alone or in addition to a second native name extent of greek influence on palmyra s culture is debated scholars interpreted palmyrenes greek practices differently many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence palmyra s senate was an example although palmyrene texts written in greek described it as a boule a greek institution senate was a gathering of non elected tribal elders a near eastern assembly tradition others view palmyra s culture as a fusion of local and greco roman traditions culture of persia influenced palmyrene military tactics dress and court ceremonies palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other eastern cities such as edessa or antioch although zenobia opened her court to academics only notable scholar documented was cassius longinus palmyra had a large agora however unlike greek public gathering places shared with public buildings palmyra s agora resembled an eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers in which dead laying at full length were placed a relief of person interred formed part of wall s decoration acting as a headstone sarcophagi appeared in late second century and were used in some of tombs many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in ancient egypt art and architecture although palmyrene art was related to that of greece it had a distinctive style unique to middle euphrates region palmyrene art is well represented by bust reliefs which seal openings of its burial chambers reliefs emphasized clothing jewelry and a frontal representation of person depicted characteristics which can be seen as a forerunner of byzantine art according to michael rostovtzeff palmyra s art was influenced by parthian art however origin of that characterized palmyrene and parthian arts is a controversial issue while parthian origin has been suggested by daniel schlumberger michael avi yonah contends that it was a local syrian tradition that influenced parthian art little painting and none of bronze statues of prominent citizens which stood on brackets on main columns of great colonnade have survived a damaged frieze and other sculptures from temple of bel many removed to museums in syria and abroad suggest city s public monumental sculpture many surviving funerary busts reached western museums during 19th century palmyra provided most convenient eastern examples bolstering an art history controversy at turn of 20th century to what extent eastern influence on roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal hieratic and simplified figures as believed by josef and others this transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in western roman empire rather than artistic influence from east palmyrene bust reliefs unlike roman sculptures are rudimentary portraits although many reflect high quality individuality majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender like its art palmyra s architecture was influenced by greco roman style while preserving local elements best seen in temple of bel enclosed by a massive wall flanked with traditional roman columns bel s sanctuary plan was primarily semitic similar to second temple sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with deity s main shrine off center against its entrance a plan preserving elements of temples of ebla and ugarit site cemeteries west of ancient walls palmyrenes built a number of large scale funerary monuments which now form valley of tombs a necropolis more than 50 monuments were primarily tower shaped and up to four stories high towers were replaced by funerary temples in first half of second century ad as most recent tower is dated to ad 128 city had other cemeteries in north southwest and southeast where tombs are primarily hypogea underground notable structures public buildings senate building is largely ruined it is a small building that consists of a peristyle courtyard and a chamber that has an apse at one end and rows of seats around it much of baths of diocletian are ruined and do not survive above level of foundations complex s entrance is marked by four massive egyptian granite columns each in diameter high and weigh 20 tonnes inside outline of a bathing pool surrounded by a colonnade of corinthian columns is still visible in addition to an octagonal room that served as a dressing room containing a drain in its center sossianus hierocles a governor under emperor diocletian claimed to have built baths but building was probably erected in late second century and sossianus hierocles renovated it agora of palmyra is part of a complex that also includes tariff court and triclinium built in second half of first century ad agora is a massive structure with 11 entrances inside agora 200 columnar bases that used to hold statues of prominent citizens were found inscriptions on bases allowed an understanding of order by which statues were grouped eastern side was reserved for senators northern side for palmyrene officials western side for soldiers and southern side for caravan chiefs tariff court is a large rectangular enclosure south of agora and sharing its northern wall with it originally entrance of court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall however entrance was blocked by construction of a defensive wall and court was entered through three doors from agora court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had palmyrene tax law inscribed on it triclinium of agora is located to northwestern corner of agora and can host up to 40 person it is a small hall decorated with greek key motifs that run in a continuous line halfway up wall building was probably used by rulers of city french general director of antiquities in syria henri seyrig proposed that it was a small temple before being turned into a triclinium or banqueting hall temples temple of bel was

presence in city dates to 18 ad when roman general germanicus tried to develop a friendly relationship with parthia he sent palmyrene alexandros to mesene a parthian vassal kingdom this was followed by arrival of roman legion legio x fretensis following year roman authority was minimal during first century ad although tax collectors were resident and a road connecting palmyra and sura was built in ad 75 romans used palmyrene soldiers but unlike typical roman cities no local magistrates or prefects are recorded in city palmyra saw intensive construction during first century including city s first walled fortifications and temple of bel completed and dedicated in 32 ad during first century palmyra developed from a minor desert caravan station into a leading trading center with palmyrene merchants establishing colonies in surrounding trade centers palmyrene trade reached its acme during second century aided by two factors first was a trade route built by palmyrenes and protected by garrisons at major locations including a garrison in dura europos manned in 117 ad second was roman conquest of nabataean capital petra in 106 shifting control over southern trade routes of arabian peninsula from nabataeans to palmyra in 129 palmyra was visited by hadrian who named it palmyra and made it a free city hadrian promoted hellenism throughout empire and palmyra s urban expansion was modeled on that of greece this led to new projects including theatre colonnade and temple of nabu roman garrisons are first attested in palmyra in 167 when cavalry ala i was moved to city by end of second century urban development diminished after city s building projects peaked in 190s palmyra was assigned to province of phoenice newly created by severan dynasty toward end of second century

and began a war against roman empire in an inscription dated to 252 odaenathus appears bearing title of exarchos lord of palmyra weakness of roman empire and constant persian danger were probably reasons behind palmyrene council s decision to elect a lord for city in order for him to lead a strengthened army odaenathus approached shapur i of persia to request him to guarantee palmyrene interests in persia but was rebuffed in 260 emperor valerian fought shapur at battle of edessa but was defeated and captured one of valerian s officers macrianus major his sons quietus and macrianus and prefect balista rebelled against valerian s son gallienus usurping imperial power in syria persian wars odaenathus formed an army of palmyrenes and syrian peasants against shapur according to augustan history odaenathus declared himself king prior to battle palmyrene leader won a decisive victory near banks of euphrates later in 260 forcing persians to retreat in 261 odaenathus marched against remaining usurpers in syria defeating and killing quietus and balista as a reward he received title imperator totius orientis governor of east from gallienus and ruled syria mesopotamia arabia and anatolia s eastern regions as imperial representative palmyra itself remained officially part of empire but palmyrene inscriptions started to describe it as a indicating that city s status was

provoke rome claiming for herself and her son titles held by her husband while guaranteeing safety of borders with persia and pacifying tanukhids in hauran to protect borders with persia zenobia fortified different settlements on euphrates including citadels of and circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with sasanians probably in 269 vaballathus took title persicus maximus great

semitic honorific babylonian cult of bel marduk influenced palmyrene religion and by 217 bc chief deity s name was changed to bel this did not indicate replacing of northwestern semitic bol with a mesopotamian deity but was a mere change in name second in importance after supreme deity were over sixty ancestral gods of palmyrene clans palmyra had unique deities such as god of justice and efqa s guardian yarhibol sun god malakbel and moon god aglibol palmyrenes worshiped regional deities including greater levantine gods astarte baal hamon baalshamin and atargatis babylonian gods nabu and nergal and arab arsu sams and al lat deities worshiped in countryside were depicted as camel or horse riders and bore arab names nature of those deities is uncertain as only names are known most importantly palmyrene pantheon included ginnaye some were given designation gad a group of lesser deities popular in countryside who were similar to arab jinn and roman genius ginnaye were believed to have appearance and behavior of humans similar to arab jinn unlike jinn however ginnaye could not possess or injure humans their role was similar to roman genius tutelary deities who guarded individuals and their caravans cattle and villages although palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals some were associated with other gods bel had astarte as his consort and formed a triple

consecrated in 818 malakbel and roman sol invictus in 274 following his victory over palmyra aurelian dedicated a large temple of sol invictus in rome most scholars consider aurelian s sol invictus to be of syrian origin either a continuation of emperor elagabalus cult of sol invictus elagabalus or malakbel of palmyra palmyrene deity was commonly identified with roman god sol and he had a temple dedicated for him on right bank of tiber since second century also he bore epithet invictus and was known with name sol sanctissimus latter was an epithet aurelian bore on an inscription from position of palmyrene deity as aurelian s sol invictus is inferred from a passage by zosimus reading and magnificent temple of sun he i e aurelian embellished with votive gifts from palmyra setting up statues of helios and bel three deities from palmyra exemplified solar features malakbel yarhibol and sams hence identification of palmyrene helios appearing in zosimus work with malakbel some scholars criticize notion of malakbel s identification with sol invictus according to gaston cult of malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial roman god and aurelian s restoration of bel s temple and sacrifices dedicated to malakbel were a sign of his attachment to sun god in general and his respect to many ways in which deity was worshiped richard stoneman suggested another approach in which aurelian simply borrowed imagery of malakbel to enhance his own solar deity relation between malakbel and sol invictus can not be confirmed and will probably remain unresolved economy thumb alt ruins
