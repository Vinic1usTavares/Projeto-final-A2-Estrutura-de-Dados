that also explores genre s jazzier and elements their sound has been compared to pop singers aiko and yui and ryo has stated himself that he likes expressing human emotions in his music when creating a song ryo has often hummed a tune into a digital recorder or starts by playing piano while it depends on song ryo has stated he generally play s piano and take s notes of chord progression and then writes lyrics ryo has cited artists that blend rock and hip hop styles with today s latest technology as influencing his music including massive attack boom boom satellites portishead tricky and ryo found it difficult at first to write tenderhearted lyrics for songs meant to be sung by young women when describing lyrics for his songs using hatsune miku as vocalist ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best because singer as a computer program would not feel embarrassed about singing lyrics he admitted that his friends would laugh when he played songs but he thought that if a 16 year old girl is supposed to be singing it is best if she sings about romance when writing lyrics for human singers ryo takes more care in writing lyrics that singers would not be embarrassed to sing when ryo receives an offer to compose theme music he writes lyrics that tie in with theme and mood of given work such as ending themes kimi no shiranai
