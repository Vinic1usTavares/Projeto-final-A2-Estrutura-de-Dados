during her time with group a busy schedule and constant media criticism found her describing time as a blur her exhaustion and troubles with negative media comments led to a state in which she had to harden herself claiming that inside she was dying these events inspired her debut album cinderella s eyes yo yo was first song she had written with maya von doll and dimitri tikovoi for album recording was also one of first songs roberts wrote and it helped define her musical style roberts blogged about production of track writing that production s incredible beat is just so constant and powerful that was first song that i wrote with dimitri and maya i felt like i d found my sound and i was kind of looking at it like an outfit so it was if this was an outfit what would this song need now so we had pretty dress which was chorus we had lovely shoes which was verse but what do we need to really set this song off a big fancy bow in hair would really set this song off so when i got to middle eight i wanted to go really erratic almost like tatu on all things she said i wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy hands in air release roberts debut single beat of my drum garnered acclaim from critics but failed to impact commercially charting at 27 in united kingdom she released a follow up single lucky day which likewise garnered positive responses but was even less successful commercially charting at number 40 on both scottish and uk singles charts writing as a guest blogger on website holy in september 2011 roberts announced that yo yo would be released as third single from cinderella s eyes initially citing a november release date release was later delayed until january 2012 roberts had originally intended for yo yo to be first single from album but beat of my drum was instead chosen at last minute roberts stated that it felt right to go with latter song yo yo was released digitally on 2 january 2012 with roberts announcing on her official website that single would be released in cd format featuring a live performance of song in addition to demo version of her song sticks stones seven days later additionally two eps were released on 6 january 2012 composition and critical reception yo yo features 808 drums with a dramatic 1950s inspired pop pastiche however 1950s concept goes completely out of window for an unhinged bridge which features a club mix which speeds up drums featured in song lyrics of track discuss an uncertain relationship leading to vulnerability with roberts describing it as a dark song song references a yo yo this is a metaphor for roberts herself a spinning yo yo on finger of a hot n cold lover described as confessional by robert copsey of digital spy song has a conversational performance and roberts vocals were compared to that of singer kate bush song received positive reviews from music critics emily mackay writing for nme described chorus as a winning one and noted that impulse speed space synths are broken heartedly beguiling in a separate review lisa wright from nme found that while song didn t match success of beat of my drum wright said that song is not a cuss ridden introduction to nicola s re emergence as an english syd tha kyd but a questionable metaphor about being like a crap 90s toy robert copsey of digital spy found cinderella s eyes to be frustratingly under appreciated with yo yo being a shining example of roberts pop sensibilities calling it unashamedly radio friendly music video synopsis video begins with a man performing tricks with a yo yo in a white room

saying that it looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in shower mendoza found that roberts was becoming quite chameleon and had trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren referencing her transformation throughout her videos katherine st asaph of pop dust found that video s low budget had had a negative effect she
