batsch and requested a new court martial for officers involved in incident simultaneously stosch began a campaign to force werner out of navy this was in part to ensure that batsch his protege would

martial for monts who was found not guilty kaiser officially approved verdict which put an end to series of trials over sinking of grosser kurfurst situation became complicated for stosch when batsch
