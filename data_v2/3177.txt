production thumb left yokai based designs of cthulhu mythos inspired elder bairns were decided upon after creation of first episodes elder bairn modeled after a jizo statue blood c was a collaborative production between production i g and clamp production i g is an animation studio which had created blood franchise with 2000 film blood last vampire which was studio s first attempt at an original in house project clamp is an all female manga artist group made up of writer nanase ohkawa and artists mokona tsubaki nekoi and satsuki igarashi main staff included both newcomers and people who had worked on previous entries in blood franchise these included concept creator and co writer junichi fujisaku one of original creators of blood franchise and director tsutomu mizushima whose most notable recent work was anime adaptation of clamp s manga xxxholic background artwork was created by hiromasa ogura and setting artwork was created by kazuo of kusanagi 3d cgi was handled by tsukamoto mori music was composed by naoki sato whose previous work included sword of stranger opening theme spiral was performed by who worked hard to make song a suitable addition to blood canon and incorporated both japanese and french lyrics ending theme paradox was sung by nana mizuki voice actress for saya who used anime s story as inspiration and incorporated archaic phrases for lyrics production team was dubbed project blood c tv when developing plans for blood c it was decided to shift its setting based on positive feedback from change of setting between blood last vampire and franchise s first anime series blood only elements to be retained were first name of main character having a katana as her weapon and basic premise of her defeating monsters with that sword wish for project to be distinct from earlier entries was what spurred collaboration with clamp which became a large part of anime s marketing campaign fujisaku when asked in an interview to describe his one creative ambition for series said that it was to fully expand and build upon basic concept established in blood last vampire choice of a school setting first of its kind to be featured in blood franchise was chosen because mizushima wanted to portray a school life for saya when asked mizushima did not find change from his previous comedy anime based turnout a barrier to his work but did feel pressure when handling a project within blood franchise scripts were written by ohkawa and fujisaku while ohkawa took charge of each episode s dialogue fujisaku handled fight sequences fujisaku pointedly avoided contributing too much to dialogue as ohkawa s writing had a very distinctive style his alterations made only due to story inconsistencies series was composed in a way that gradually revealed central mystery while pitting saya against progressively stronger foes setting s intensely normal appearance was designed to make viewers feel uneasy as faults begin appearing in saya s everyday life according to ohkawa main theme of series was examination of hero s role as a lonely protector of innocent alongside this was portrayal of saya s seemingly normal life and now her role as town s protector began intruding upon this everyday life final episodes were intended to evoke viewer sympathy for saya due to terrible ordeal she had been subjected to series broke from conventions of a hero focused anime by portraying relationships between saya and those close to her in a very shallow way during opening episodes for final few episodes when truth is revealed about saya and her school life supporting cast were generally portrayed as hateful people that viewers would wish to see die so as to keep series twist ending a secret entire voice cast including mizuki and nojima respective voice actors of saya and fumito were told nothing about final episode s events a different interview revealed that each cast member were only given scripts for three episodes at any one time to preserve secrecy subtitle of each episode was drawn from japanese poetry anthology ogura hyakunin isshu series made regular use of bloody violence which was exaggerated to distance viewers from show s horrific elements despite this director said show was not deliberately focused on bloody violence design of main cast was handled by clamp according to mizushima team wanted to portray saya in a far more human way than her previous incarnations ending up creating a character more human then even true human characters saya s character as a long haired song singing girl in glasses almost entirely created by clamp due to stark differences between this version of saya and previous versions fujisaku did not used her original surname so viewers could clearly distinguish saya s portrayal from previous entries when deciding upon her strength mizushima decided to use hit girl from movie kick ass as a role model making saya stronger than hit girl while also putting her into a high school environment animation character designer was kazuchika kise who worked on blood last vampire yasuomi umetsu directed and worked on storyboard for game s opening along with kise a key part of opening was a layer of blood peeling away from saya s naked form while compared by many to opening of ghost in shell umetsu said that it represented saya s personal evolution during course of show elder bairns were designed by tomohiro shinoda they were initially conceived by ohkawa as japanese versions of great old ones figures from cthulhu mythos created by h p lovecraft but this was changed while some elements remained from initial concept final elder bairns physical forms as faced by saya were inspired by yokai from japanese folklore at mizushima s insistence this design choice was decided upon after storyboarding finished for fight against first episode s elder bairn which was modeled after a jizo statue this initial concept was expanded upon by mizushima ohkawa and fujisaku disguised form of elder bairn from fifth episode was based on train carriages from line in nagano prefecture that mizushima had enjoyed traveling on as a boy elder bairn from ninth episode was intended for second episode but staff felt it was too strong to appear so early so it was shifted to a later episode all elder bairns were designed to give impression of a vivid flesh and blood

4 in anime charts at reaper award awards show blood c was awarded 2013 for best animation richard eisenbeis of kotaku praised character and elder bairn designs and also enjoyed questions anime posed about where blood c fit in both overall blood franchise and works of clamp he was more mixed about odd juxtaposition of innocent school life with high violence of elder bairn encounters he was also unsure about ending saying it tidied up series mysteries but required watching movie to understand story he ended his review by calling blood c a beautifully drawn show with excellent action and a legitimately compelling mystery bradley meek writing for them anime gave series 3 5 stars he praised way series maintained its horror based atmosphere in between action sequences he greatly enjoyed horror and action aspects but felt that character driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters talking about anime s second half he said that it drastically altered pace and content to point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of rules of handling characters and viewers alike meek was ultimately angry at series brutal ending but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion anime news network s carlo santos gave subtitled version a score of b and dubbed version as score of c he found darker elements hidden so well in early episodes that it made series boring to watch and that ending would divide opinion due to its drastic alteration of how events in series played out and its discussion of both horror tropes and standard elements of blood franchise action scenes came in for regular praise for their choreography and many monster designs but school life segments were seen as boring and overly slender character designs santos unreservedly praised music s quality and recurring melodies despite calling opening and ending themes typical angst ridden rock numbers he called english dub understated but not emotionless finding that it reinforced overall atmosphere and only suffered due to original writing on june 12 2015 chinese ministry of culture listed blood c among 38 anime and
