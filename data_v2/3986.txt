interested in art he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at ucl s art school slade school of fine art he returned to his previous subject after coming to opinion that in his words he never became more than a conventionally accomplished picture maker this interlude had adversely affected his classical studies and he received a second class ba on graduating wheeler began studying for a master of arts degree in classical studies which he attained in 1912 during this period he also gained employment as personal secretary of ucl provost gregory foster although he later criticised foster for transforming university from a college in truly academic sense into a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man it was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with tessa verney a student then studying history at ucl when they were both serving on committee of university college literary society during his studies wheeler had developed his love of archaeology having joined an excavation of viroconium cornoviorum a romano british settlement in wroxeter in 1913 considering a profession in discipline he won a studentship that had been established jointly by university of london and society of antiquaries in memory of augustus wollaston franks prominent archaeologist sir arthur evans doubled amount of money that went with studentship wheeler s proposed project had been to analyse romano rhenish pottery and with grant he funded a trip to rhineland in germany there studying roman pottery housed in local museums his research into this subject was never published at this period there were very few jobs available within british archaeology as later archaeologist stuart piggott related young wheeler was looking for a professional job where profession had yet to be created in 1913 wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for english royal commission on historical monuments who were embarking on a project to assess state of all structures in nation that pre dated 1714 as part of this he was first sent to stebbing in essex to assess late medieval buildings although once that was accomplished he focused

wheeler transferred to 1st lowland brigade of royal field artillery territorial force and was confirmed in his rank on 1 july with a promotion to temporary lieutenant from same date shortly thereafter on 16 july wheeler was promoted to temporary captain in this position he was stationed at various bases across britain often bringing his wife and child with him his responsibility was as a battery

near gordon square with his wife and child he returned to working for royal commission examining and cataloguing historic structures of essex in doing so he produced his first publication an academic paper on colchester s roman gate which was published in transactions of essex archaeological society in 1920 he soon followed this with two papers in journal of roman studies first offered a wider analysis of roman colchester while latter outlined his discovery of vaulting for city s temple of claudius which was destroyed by boudica s revolt in doing so he developed a reputation as a roman archaeologist in britain he then submitted his research on romano rhenish pots to university of london on basis of which he was awarded his doctorate of letters thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as dr wheeler he was unsatisfied with his job in commission unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in army and so began to seek out alternative employment he obtained a post as keeper of archaeology at national museum of wales a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at university college of south wales and monmouthshire taking up this position he moved to cardiff with his family in august 1920 although he initially disliked city museum was in disarray prior to war construction had begun on a new purpose built building to house collections this had ceased during conflict and edifice was left abandoned during cardiff s post war economic slump wheeler recognised that wales was very divided regionally with many welsh people having little loyalty to cardiff thus he made a point of touring country lecturing to local societies about archaeology according to later archaeologist lydia c carr wheelers work for cause of museum was part of a wider cultural nationalist movement linked to growing welsh nationalism during this period for instance welsh nationalist party plaid cymru was founded in 1925 wheeler was impatient to start excavations and in july 1921 started a six week project to excavate at roman fort of segontium accompanied by his wife he used up his holiday to oversee project a second season of excavation at site followed in 1922 greatly influenced by writings of archaeologist augustus pitt rivers wheeler emphasised need for a strong developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation believing in need for strategic planning or what he termed controlled discovery with clear objectives in mind for a project further emphasising importance of prompt publication of research results he wrote full seasonal reports for archaeologia cambrensis before publishing a full report segontium and roman occupation of wales wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists and two of most prominent students to excavate with him at segontium were victor nash williams and ian richmond over field seasons of 1924 and 1925 wheeler ran excavations of roman fort of y gaer near brecon a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students nowell myres and christopher hawkes during this project he was visited by prominent egyptologist sir flinders petrie and his wife hilda petrie wheeler greatly admired petrie s emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies wheeler published results of his excavation in roman fort near brecon he then began excavations at isca augusta a roman site in caerleon where he focused on revealing roman amphitheatre intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding he contacted press and organised a sponsorship of excavation by middle market newspaper daily mail in doing so he emphasised folkloric and legendary associations that site had with king arthur in 1925 oxford university press published wheeler s first book for a general audience prehistoric and roman wales he later expressed opinion that it was not a good book in 1924 director of national museum of wales william evans hoyle resigned amid ill health wheeler applied to take on role of his replacement providing supportive testimonials from charles reed peers robert bosanquet and h j although he had no prior museum experience he was successful in his application and was appointed director he then employed a close friend cyril fox to take on vacated position of keeper of archaeology wheeler s proposed reforms included extending institution s reach and influence throughout wales by building affiliations with regional museums and focusing on fundraising to finance completion of new museum premises he obtained a ps21 367 donation from wealthy shipowner william reardon smith and appointed smith to be museum s treasurer and also travelled to whitehall london where he successfully urged british treasury to provide further funding for museum as a result construction on museum s new building was able to continue and it was officially opened by king george v in 1927 london museum 1926 33 thumb right lancaster house where london museum was based upon retirement of keeper of london museum harmon oates wheeler was invited to fill vacancy he had been considering a return to london for some time and eagerly agreed taking on post which was based at lancaster house in st james s area in july 1926 in wales many felt that wheeler had simply taken directorship of national museum to advance his own career prospects and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along wheeler himself disagreed believing that he had left fox at museum as his obvious successor and that reforms he had implemented would therefore continue position initially provided wheeler with an annual salary of ps600 which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family who moved into a flat near to victoria station tessa s biographer l c carr later commented that together wheelers professionalized london museum wheeler expressed his opinion that museum had to be cleaned expurgated and catalogued in general turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution focusing on reorganising exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing artefacts he also authored a short guide to collections before using items in museum to write three books london and vikings london and saxons and london and romans upon his arrival treasury allocated museum an annual budget of ps5 000 which wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs in 1930 wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers publications and acquisitions as well as a rise in number of educational projects with this additional funding he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to ps900 soon after joining museum wheeler was elected to council of society of antiquaries through society he became involved in debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in greater london his argument was that city of london corporation should provide funding although in 1926 it was agreed that society itself would employ a director of excavation based in lancaster house to take on position also involved in largely moribund royal archaeological institute wheeler organised its relocation to lancaster house in 1927 wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at university college london where he established a graduate diploma course on archaeology one of first to enroll was stuart piggott in 1928 wheeler curated an exhibit at ucl on recent work in british archaeology for which he attracted much press attention thumb left wheeler excavated at verulamium city s roman theatre is depicted wheeler was keen to continue archaeological fieldwork outside london undertaking excavations every year from 1926 to 1939 after completing his excavation of amphitheatre in 1928 he began fieldwork at roman settlement and temple in lydney park gloucestershire having been invited to do so by aristocratic landowner charles bathurst it was during these investigations that wheeler personally discovered lydney hoard of coinage wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as report on excavation of prehistoric roman and post roman site in lydney park gloucestershire which piggott noted had set pattern for all wheeler s future excavation reports from there wheeler was invited to direct a society of antiquaries excavation at roman settlement of verulamium which existed on land recently acquired by corporation of st albans he took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933 before leaving a fifth season of excavation under control of archaeologist kathleen kenyon and architect a w g lowther wheeler enjoyed opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site and also liked its proximity to his home in london he was particularly interested in searching for a pre roman iron age oppidum at site noting that existence of a nearby catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence with wheeler focusing his attention on potential iron age evidence tessa concentrated on excavating inside of city walls wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during project after tessa wrote two interim reports final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as verulamium a belgic and two roman cities jointly written by wheeler and his wife report resulted in first major published criticism of wheeler produced by young archaeologist nowell myres in a review for antiquity although stating that there was much to praise about work he critiqued wheeler s selective excavation dubious dating and guesswork wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both myres and myres s employer christ church oxford institute of archaeology 1934 39 thumb right wheeler led excavations at iron age hill fort of maiden castle photograph by major george allen october 1937 wheeler had long desired to establish an academic institution devoted to archaeology that could be based in london he hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish professionalisation of archaeology as a discipline with systematic training of students in methodological techniques of excavation and conservation and recognised professional standards in his words he hoped to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses he further described his intention that institute should become a laboratory a laboratory of archaeological science many archaeologists shared his hopes and to this end petrie had donated much of his collection of near eastern artefacts to wheeler in hope that it would be included in such an institution wheeler was later able to persuade university of london a federation of institutions across capital to support venture and both he and tessa began raising funds from wealthy backers in 1934 institute of archaeology was officially opened albeit at this point without premises or academic staff first students to enroll were rachel clay and barbara parker who went on to have careers in discipline while wheeler who was still keeper of london museum took on role of honorary director of institute he installed archaeologist kathleen kenyon as secretary of management committee describing her as a level headed person with useful experience after ending his work at verulamium wheeler turned his attention to late iron age hill fort of maiden castle near to dorchester dorset where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937 co directed by wheeler tessa and curator of dorset county museum charles drew project was carried out under joint auspices of society of antiquaries and dorset field club with around 100 assistants each season dig constituted largest excavation that had been conducted in britain up to that point with wheeler organising weekly meetings with press to inform them about any discoveries he was keen to emphasise that his workforce consisted of many young people as well as both men and women thus presenting image of archaeology as a modern and advanced discipline according to later historian adam stout maiden castle excavation was one of most famous british archaeological investigations of twentieth century it was classic wheeler dig both in terms of scale of operations and publicity which it generated wheeler s excavation report was published in 1943 as maiden castle dorset report s publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of wheeler s approach and interpretations in his review of book archaeologist w f grimes criticised highly selective nature of excavation noting that wheeler had not asked questions regarding socio economic issues of community at maiden castle aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to british archaeology over coming decades as further excavations were carried out at site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of iron age britain much of wheeler s interpretation of site and its development was shown to be wrong in particular by work of archaeologist niall sharples in 1936 wheeler embarked on a visit to near east sailing from marseilles to port said where he visited old kingdom tombs of from there he went via sinai to palestine lebanon and syria during this trip he visited various archaeological projects but was dismayed by quality of their excavations in particular he noted that american run excavation at tel megiddo was adopting standards that had been rejected in britain twenty five years previously he was away for six weeks and upon his return to europe discovered that his wife tessa had died of a pulmonary embolism after a minor operation on her toe according to tessa s biographer for wheeler this discovery was peak of mental misery and marked end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love that winter his father also died by summer of 1937 he had embarked on a new romance with a young woman named mavis de vere cole widow of horace de vere cole who had first met wheeler when visiting maiden castle excavations with her then lover painter augustus john after she eventually agreed to his repeated requests for marriage two were wedded early in 1939 in a ceremony held at caxton hall with a reception at shelley house they proceeded on a honeymoon to middle east left thumb 250px st john s lodge in regent s park first building to house institute of archaeology after a search that had taken several years wheeler was able to secure a premises for institute of archaeology st john s lodge in regent s park central london left empty since its use as a hospital during first world war building was owned by crown and was controlled by first commissioner of works william ormsby gore he was very sympathetic to archaeology and leased building to institute at a low rent st john s lodge premises were officially opened on 29 april 1937 during his speech at ceremony university of london s vice chancellor charles reed peers made it clear that building was only intended as a temporary home for institute which it was hoped would be able to move to bloomsbury city s academic hub in his speech university s chancellor alexander cambridge 1st earl of athlone compared new institution to both institute of historical research and courtauld institute of art wheeler had also become president of museums association and in a presidential address given in belfast talked on topic of preserving museum collections in war time believing that britain s involvement in a second european conflict was imminent in anticipation of this event in august 1939 he arranged for london museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping he was also awarded an honorary doctorate from bristol university and at award ceremony met conservative party politician winston churchill who was then engaged in writing his multi volume a history of english speaking peoples churchill asked wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval britain to which latter agreed after maiden castle wheeler turned his attention to france where archaeological investigation of iron age sites had lagged behind developments in britain there he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with aid of leslie scott beginning with a survey tour of brittany in winter of 1936 37 after this wheeler decided to excavate oppidum at camp d artus near finistere in addition to bringing many british archaeologists to work on site he hired six local breton workmen to assist project coming to belief that oppidum had been erected by local iron age tribes to defend themselves from roman invasion led by julius caesar meanwhile scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at smaller nearby hill fort of near quimper in july 1939 project focused its attention on normandy with excavations beginning at iron age hill forts of camp de canada and they were brought to an abrupt halt in september 1939 as second world war broke out in europe and team evacuated back to britain wheeler s excavation report co written with katherine richardson was eventually published as hill forts of northern france in 1957 second world war 1939 45 wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with nazi germany for a year prior to outbreak of hostilities he believed that united kingdom s involvement in conflict would remedy shame that he thought had been brought upon country by its signing of munich agreement in september 1938 volunteering for armed services he was assigned to assemble 48th light anti aircraft battery at enfield where he set about recruiting volunteers including his son michael as 48th swelled in size it was converted into 42nd mobile light anti aircraft regiment in royal artillery which consisted of four batteries and was led

brief leave of absence to travel to jerusalem where he visited petrie on his hospital deathbed back in egypt he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a wellington bomber on a bombing raid against axis forces to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti aircraft battery thumb left in north africa wheeler sought to preserve archaeological remains such as those of leptis magna pictured from being damaged by occupying troops serving with eighth army wheeler was present in north africa when axis armies pushed allies back to el alamein he was also part of allied counter push taking part in second battle of el alamein and advance on axis held tripoli on way he became concerned that archaeological sites of north africa were being threatened both by fighting and occupying forces after british secured control of libya wheeler visited tripoli and leptis magna where he found that roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by british troops he brought about reforms to prevent this lecturing to troops on importance of preserving archaeology making many monuments out of bounds and ensuring that royal air force changed its plans to construct a radar station in midst of a roman settlement aware that british were planning to invade and occupy italian island of sicily he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve historic and archaeological monuments on island promoted to rank of brigadier after german surrender in north africa wheeler was sent to algiers where he was part of staff committee planning invasion of italy

agreed that he would take job on condition that he be permitted to take part in invasion of italy first as intended wheeler and his 12th anti aircraft brigade then took part in invasion of sicily and

located wheeler had been suggested for job by archibald wavell viceroy of india who had been acting on recommendations of archaeologist leonard woolley who had authored a report lamenting state of archaeological establishment in british controlled subcontinent wheeler recognised this state of affairs in a letter to a friend complaining about lack of finances and equipment commenting that we re back in 1850 he initially found much to dislike in india and in his letters to friends in britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward indians he stated that they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly i already find myself regarding them as ill made clockwork toys rather than as human beings and i find myself bullying them most brutally he expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them from beginning of his tenure he sought to distance himself from previous directors general and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors assigned with a four year contract wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from britain glyn daniel and stuart piggott to aid him in reforming archaeological survey although they declined offer he then toured subcontinent seeking to meet all of survey s staff members he had drawn up a

what he saw as idleness incompetence and corruption of indian society initially focusing on northwest of subcontinent wheeler was particularly fascinated by bronze age indus valley civilization on his initial inspection of indus valley sites of mohenjo daro and harappa he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements he later led a more detailed excavation at harappa where he exposed further fortifications and established a stratigraphy for settlement turning his attention to southern india wheeler discovered remnants of a roman amphora in a museum and began excavations at arikamedu revealing a port from first century ce which had traded in goods from roman empire excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat although it was during excavation that world war ii ended in celebration wheeler gave all his workers an extra rupee for day it has since been alleged that while wheeler took credit for discovering significance of this site it had previously been established by a superintendent of government museum in madras and french archaeologist dubreuil with wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution he later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in brahmagiri mysore which enabled him to gain a chronology for archaeology of much of southern india thumb left wheeler was fascinated by indus valley civilisation

wheeler was known as rik among friends he divided opinion among those who knew him with some loving and others despising him and during his lifetime he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds archaeologist max mallowan asserted that he was a delightful light hearted and amusing companion but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration his charm offensives were often condemned as being insincere during excavations he was known as an authoritarian leader but favoured those who he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority hence he has been termed a benevolent dictator he was meticulous in his writings and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters throughout his life he was a heavy smoker wheeler expressed view that he was least political of mortals despite not taking a strong interest in politics wheeler was described by his biographer as a natural conservative for instance during his youth he was strongly critical of suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women nevertheless he was usually happy to advance young women professionally something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them he expressed little interest in his relatives in later life he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on basis of family ties wheeler was married three times in may 1914 wheeler married tessa verney tessa became an accomplished archaeologist and they collaborated until she died in 1936 their only child michael mortimer wheeler was born in january 1915 he became a barrister following tessa s death in 1939 wheeler married mavis de vere cole widow of prankster horace de vere cole their relationship was strained cole s diaries revealed that wheeler physically hit her when she annoyed him in 1945 mortimer wheeler married his third wife margaret kim collingridge although they became estranged in 1956 collingridge s catholicism prevented divorce meanwhile wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity favouring young women for one night stands many of whom were his students he was further known for having casual sex in public places that behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and mistresses of which he was aware as a result of his behaviour later archaeologist gabriel moshenska informed a reporter from daily mail that wheeler had developed a reputation as a bit of a and a sex pest and an incredible bully as well reception and legacy wheeler has been termed most famous british archaeologist of twentieth century by archaeologists gabriel moshenska and tim schadla hall highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout british society they stated that his mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a showman s willingness to package and sell past this was an issue about which wheeler felt very strongly writing his obituary for biographical memoirs of fellows of royal society english archaeologist stuart piggott noted that wheeler placed great importance to archaeologist s obligation to public on whose support prosecution of his subject ultimately depended piggott believed that wheeler s greatest impact was as great innovator in field techniques comparing him in this respect to pitt rivers piggott stated that importance of wheeler s contribution to archaeological technique enormous and far reaching lies in fact that in early 1920s he not only appreciated and understood what pitt rivers had done but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation development and improvement l c carr stated that it was for his methodological developments oft termed wheeler method that wheeler was best known in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site such as arthur evans and knossos or leonard woolley and ur wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters carr stated that both wheeler and his first wife emphasised technical rigour and a full presentation of materials unearthed as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience focusing on wheeler s publications regarding south asian archaeology sudeshna guha noted that he produced an assemblage of image objects that embodied precision he demanded from excavation photography mallowan noted that immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod jacquetta hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of archaeological evidence because he was sometimes too sure of being right too ready to accept his own authority she asserted that while wheeler was not an original thinker he had a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces however small in its widest significance piggott claimed that wheeler s appointment as director general of archaeological survey of india represented most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in autocratic and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and excavator no other archaeologist of time it seems fair to remark could have come near to attaining his command of incisive strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him bewildered admiration and touching devotion of his indian staff indian archaeologist dilip k chakrabarti later stated that wheeler s accomplishments while in india were considerable particularly given socio political turmoil of independence and partition chakrabarti stated that wheeler had contributed to south asian archaeology in various ways by establishing a total view of region s development from palaeolithic onward by introducing new archaeological techniques and methodologies to subcontinent and by encouraging indian universities to begin archaeological research ultimately chakrabarti was of opinion that wheeler had prepared archaeology of subcontinent for its transition to modernity in post partition period similarly peter johansen praised wheeler for systematising and professionalising indian archaeology and for instituting a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training on wheeler s death h d of deccan college pune described him as well known among old world archaeologists in united states particularly for his book archaeology from earth and his studies of indus valley civilisation in its 2013 obituary of english archaeologist mick aston british archaeology magazine publication of council for british archaeology described aston as mortimer wheeler of our times because despite strong differences between their personalities both had done much to bring archaeology to british public however writing in 2011 moshenska and schadla hall asserted that wheeler s reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists but that instead he had come to be remembered as a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure whom they termed naughty morty carr described institute of archaeology as one of wheeler couple s most permanent memorials biographies and studies in 1960 ronald william clark published a biography titled sir mortimer wheeler fitzroy somerset 4th baron raglan reviewed volume for journal man describing this very readable little book as being adulatory in tone but hardly more so than its subject deserves in 1982 archaeologist jacquetta hawkes published a second biography mortimer wheeler adventurer in archaeology hawkes admitted she had developed a very great liking for wheeler having first met him when she was an archaeology student at university of cambridge she believed that he had a energy with his accomplishments in india being almost superhuman ultimately she thought of him as being an epic hero in an anti heroic age in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness in 2000 film hey ram lead character saket ram played by kamal haasan and his friend amjad khan played by shah rukh khan are shown as employees of wheeler who was portrayed by lewis k before 1947 hindu muslim riots in a 2003 volume of south asian studies journal sudeshna published a research article examining wheeler s use of photography in his excavations and publications in indian subcontinent in 2011 academic journal public archaeology published a research paper by moshenska and schadla hall that analysed wheeler s role in presenting archaeology to british public two years later papers from institute of archaeology issued a short comic strip by moshenska and alex depicting wheeler s activities in studying archaeology of libya during world war ii bibliography a bibliography of wheeler s published books was included by piggott
