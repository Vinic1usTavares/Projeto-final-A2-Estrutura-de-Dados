thumb glenwood generating station in 2011 viewed from bar beach across hempstead harbor brick building at left is station 2 while two yellow smokestacks at right are part of station 3 both buildings were demolished by 2015 glenwood generating station is a power station in glenwood landing new york owned by national grid plc it is mainly known for being former site of an architecturally significant 1920s brick power station that building and an adjacent 1950s station were demolished over course of 2013 to 2015 due to their obsolescence as well as excessive cost of safely retaining building given its poor condition two smaller generators constructed in 2002 remain in operation architecture station 2 was constructed in 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th century industrial architecture it was designed in an industrial beaux arts style with large arched windows and intended to prevent it from becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities it was constructed with flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements document starts on page 27 of file it was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas making glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas at time of its construction document starts on page 153 of file building was divided into three sections a narrow four story administration section to north containing offices a five story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls and a six story boiler house mainly filled with equipment topped by six 140 foot smoke stacks ultimately reaching 265 feet above floor slab at time of its demolition new york state office of parks recreation and historic preservation determined that it appeared to meet criteria for listing on national register of historic places triggering an alternative use analysis given building s poor condition after three decades of disuse excessive cost of making building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it history thumb glenwood generating station in 1936 construction and early history first facility on site was station 1 constructed in 1906 and expanded during world war i which existed until at least 1939 station 2 building was constructed from 1928 to 1931 by nassau power and light company a predecessor of long island lighting company lilco extra generating capacity was needed due to a sixfold increase in long island s electricity demand from 1910 to 1925 expansion also reflected lilco s then novel philosophy of using few centralized power plants interconnected by transmission lines rather than many small plants distributed through region in 1936 it was described as key electric generating plant of long island system and its control room managed lilco s entire system in 1939 it was upgraded to burn both coal and oil and in 1946 natural gas capability was added in 1942 a 3 hour power outage caused by testing of new distribution circuits affected seven major factories producing material for world war ii these included grumman plant in bethpage and republic aviation plant in where workers staged an impromptu baseball game while they waited for power to return local hospitals and mitchel field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power although sabotage was not suspected it caused colonel in charge of civilian protection for nassau county to request that army guard power station two units of station 3 became operational in 1952 and 1954 at time new york times called it one of most modern power plants in country with both mechanical and electrostatic precipitators for dust and ash collection as well as valve and noise barriers it was first turbine generator mounted on an open deck in northeastern united states an identical unit was constructed in far rockaway queens in 1953 later history in 1972 town of oyster bay board unanimously denied lilco a permit to further expand plant with five 50 mw gas turbines citing air quality concerns and effects of 1970s energy crisis town supervisor john w burke at time noted board s recognition that in view of fuel shortage construction of gas turbines just seems out of step with direction being taken by average consumer who lowers his thermostat and wears a sweater in his home to reduce amount of fuel burning station 2 generating units were taken out of operation in 1978 but as late as 2009 building was used for such purposes as a waste water treatment facility for adjacent operational units office and warehouse space and transmission and fiber optic lines in 1998 as part of a state brokered deal lilco s power generation facilities including glenwood plant were absorbed into keyspan energy with public long island power authority lipa taking over transmission and delivery functions in 2001 lipa proposed building two mini turbines at glenwood landing as part of a plan to build ten such plants across long island to avoid risk of rolling blackouts in face of increased demand like those experienced in california previous year pair of turbines produced 79 mw just under an 80 mw threshold that would have triggered a full regulatory and environmental review new turbines were completed by may 2002 and were first of ten to enter operation as a result of 1998 deal lipa had an option to purchase keyspan s power plants outright before december 2005 just before option expired lipa decided to purchase two plants in far rockaway and oceanside with intention of modernizing them while there was no provision for immediate modernization of remaining major plants in glenwood landing port jefferson and northport power station keyspan was acquired by national grid in 2007 station 3 s utilization decreased from 43 percent in 2001 to 11 2 percent in 2005 as of 2009 power station was used as a peaking power plant operating in summer with two operational natural gas steam electric generating units with a combined 210 mw capacity it had a once through water cooling system using water from adjacent hempstead harbor by 2014 station 2 building had deteriorated to point where it was nearing condemnation demolition thumb station 2 being demolished in november 2014 in 2011 it was announced that glenwood landing station would be shut down and demolished along with its sister plant in far rockaway two stations were described as oldest and least efficient of power plants on long island with closures saving 76 million through 2015 local resident karin barnaby campaigned to renovate station 2 for commercial and cultural uses rather than demolish it pointing to other redeveloped historic power plants in united states such as pratt street power plant in baltimore and homan square power house in chicago despite collecting 780 signatures for a petition this was rejected due to excessive cost of renovating building given its poor condition demolition was estimated to cost 8 million as opposed to 31 million to make building structurally sound without improving it and 100 million to renovate it into a mixed use development including an exhibition hall in old turbine room using building for new power generation capacity was deemed unfeasible because modern generation equipment was incompatible with building design demolition of plant raised concern about financial effects on local north shore school district as over 20 million annual tax payments from plant provided 20 percent of district s budget this led to fears of a 15 19 increase in residential taxes in late 2014 however it was determined that according to state law there could be no more than a 1 increase in property taxes for a given tax class as a result of a decreased tax assessment in another class four tax classes being residential cooperatives condominiums commercial and utilities financial effects on district would thus have to be mitigated by increased taxes on remaining utilities in district as well as a 2 5 million one time grant from state arranged by local state legislators site s municipal and school payments in lieu of taxes fell from 23 2 million in 2012 to 16 6 million in 2015 station 3 was demolished in november 2013 and demolition of station 2 was completed in 2015 national grid opted for a controlled deconstruction rather than an implosion or using a wrecking ball demolition of station 2 required relocation of a peregrine falcon nest from top of one of smoke stacks after demolition and land remediation had been completed area was planned to be paved over with asphalt and offered to developers two gas turbine peaking generators three electrical substations three fuel tanks and a water tower elsewhere on site remain in operation see also new york energy law northport power station list of power stations in new york references external links supplemental environmental impact
