while i didn t exactly love it i m happy it exists he thought that scenes with d sora and data were very very odd and that ending didn t reveal anything new about data at all subplot involving nebula was described as an interesting hook but it doesn t go anywhere he gave episode a b grade jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer s reviews described main plot as pleasant enough but couldn t understand d sora s motivations in pursuing relationship with data he described subplot as pure perfunctory filler barely worthy of mention and didn t know why picard piloted shuttle instead of a more experienced shuttle pilot he gave episode a score of 2 5 4 michelle erica green watched episode for treknation in may 2009 she also thought that it was a pleasant episode but that it never approaches greatness she felt that d sora never achieved intimacy that yar did with data and that subplot was simply something created so that picard had something to do she summed up ending of episode by saying that i don t believe that data can t be hurt emotionally but he s more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in jenna d sora keith decandido reviewed episode for tor com in may 2012 describing it as a clunker and a re hash of earlier episode dauphin but without gravitas he thought that having picard pilot shuttle was ridiculous especially as character admitted in episode 11001001 that it had been years since he had worked helm of a ship he summed it up saying that ultimately it s a rehash of a wesley crusher episode a really really bad wesley crusher episode and gave it a score of two
