biography of his portrayer kevin clash and wedding of maria and luis davis calls show s depiction of mr hooper s death and wedding poles that held up canvas tent that was sesame street in 1980s a

international influence critical reception judith fitzgerald of philadelphia inquirer who predicts that street gang will become definitive source of show calls a compulsively readable compendium of all things sesame street as well as informative heartbreaking hilarious and eye opening she credits its complicated and often funny story with cooperation davis received from cooney when writing his book fitzgerald also praises davis calling him a sensitive and subtly brilliant writer who conveys soul of program reviewer drew toal calls street gang a swift narrative and a sensitive honest account and credits large number of cast stories and amount of controversy recounted in book with hundreds of interviews davis conducted frazier moore of associated press states that book is a fascinating account of creation of sesame street and that davis writes thoroughly and with affection james panero reviewer for new york times called street gang a behind lens story and first comprehensive account of sesame street panero found davis history tireless but objected to davis emphasis on unimportant details as a result and due to davis inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history panero considers book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative other reviewers note that street gang is too much like its subject episodic and unfocused diana wagman of l a times states that davis choice of what to focus on is odd for example there is a great deal of focus in book on things like licensing and merchandising agreement of muppets but very little attention on mississippi s 1970 ban of show wagman states yes we get a little past tense womanizing a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in book but it all seems sad not salacious and not germane to basic story nick gillespie of washington post agrees he calls jim henson who is mentioned often in book an almost completely enigmatic character wagman takes issue with way davis moves from topic to topic and time period to time period davis gives long personal histories of principal players in his history but fails to explain reason they are important and is compelled to repeat every positive claim made about sesame street in spite of this wagman states davis demonstrates love and respect cooney and show s cast and crew had for each another for example when calloway was diagnosed with a mental illness show never fired him and wagman calls henson s funeral heartbreaking gillespie finds nasty backstage wrangling and behind scenes stories compelling alex altman of time magazine agrees and calls davis an unabashed fan of show s charms rather than a dispassionate historian he also considers davis use of language breathless and his portrayals of show s creators overly flattering reviewer molly o donnell states that book is broad in scope yet exercises a meticulous attention to detail o donnell views davis as balanced in his account because although davis praises sesame street he describes public criticism show has received and relates personality flaws of people who helped create it even with book s lulls which o donnell attributes to large number of personal histories davis has to tell to give a complete picture of show s creation she says that book is interesting reviewer from publishers weekly agrees praising street gang as continuously interesting honest and well researched reviewer goes on to state any grown up fan will relish this account gaining an even greater appreciation for cultural contributions of kermit big bird oscar grouch and all their neighbors publication history publication of book was announced in 2006 by television industry trade magazine broadcasting and cable which anticipated a buzz about
