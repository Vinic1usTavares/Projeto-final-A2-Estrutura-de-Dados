had been in development since 1997 producer tommy reid heard that rick porrello an ohio policeman was about to publish a book about greene called to kill irishman reid flew to ohio and met with porrello who told reid his grandfather was a high ranking mafia figure in cleveland during prohibition era meeting went well and on march 17 1998 they signed a deal for film rights to book getting kill irishman produced was difficult reid frequently left deals and discovered that script he d commissioned was attached to a cover with another screenwriter and producer s name listed according to reid this was a common occurrence in hollywood and he claims to have spent over 1 million to ensure film was made pre production inspiration reid was a fan of mafia movies including godfather and goodfellas and aspired to become a filmmaker being of irish and italian ancestry he wanted to make a film that would relate to both nationalities reid first heard about mobster danny greene from his roommates in ohio and believed that new york city chicago and boston were three meccas of mafia crime according to reid there wasn t much documentation on greene s life but after hearing that porrello was about to publish a book on greene and mafia in cleveland he was determined to make a movie about him background research prior to making kill irishman reid and screenwriter jeremy walters conducted research on greene s life and organized crime in cleveland reid spoke with sister barbara eppich a nun who helped raise greene during his childhood sister eppich told reid of how greene was abandoned during childhood and was raised by his grandfather because his grandfather worked nights greene was left to walk streets he would go to school dirty on a regular basis and sister eppich would have to wash him she also stated that greene would sleep all time but was a phenomenal athlete reid spoke to number of law enforcement agencies including fbi fbi wanted to make sure that reid wasn t glorifying mafia reid stated he had no intentions of glorifying crime and that whole message at end of movie is that crime doesn t pay on a similar subject hensleigh also said film doesn t suggest greene was a hero however he did note film provides a balanced perspective while researching his role stevenson looked at tv footage of greene and read porrello s book to kill irishman according to stevenson there was quite a bit of research material available d onofrio on other hand had opposite experience information on nardi was scarce so hensleigh allowed him to improvise on his character screenplay although screenplay was adapted from his book porrello had minimum involvement in its writing hensleigh regularly contacted porrello and they agreed not to use real names of anyone who was still alive out of respect and sensitivity towards them casting due to troubled development of kill irishman reid decided to make a documentary about greene s life known as danny greene rise and fall of irishman from his research for movie reid became specialized in northern ohio crime scene and greene s life and felt that by making documentary at least he could go to his grave saying i tried in 2009 with 17 hours of documentary shot reid was told his film had been green lit he joined forces with production company code entertainment and engaged with a reliable director jonathan hensleigh they then signed actors val kilmer and christopher walken and later vincent d onofrio full metal jacket paul sorvino goodfellas and irish actor ray stevenson respectively stevenson was filming book of eli when he got a telephone call from hensleigh so they arranged to meet in los angeles according to stevenson he was drawn to script and immediately made a deal production filming

hollywood reporter retrieved march 7 2015 it was shot within seven weeks mostly in and around detroit this was partly because city gave tax credits which cleveland would not match according to 2009 report by michigan film office kill irishman received roughly 3 million in subsidies tom aug 14 2011 box office bombs made in michigan www com retrieved may 7 2015 michigan s film rebate pays up to 42 percent of filmmakers expenses for costs incurred while filming in state ohio offers only 25 to 35 percent in subsidies meaning that if producers spent same amount filming in cleveland they would have received 500 000 to 1 25 million less in subsidies on other hand stevenson said that they wanted to film in cleveland but city had itself up and changed whereas detroit was in his opinion still on its knees two incidents occurred during filming on first seven bullet holes were shot into one of trucks used during production on second cast and crew were driving from set and a pedestrian was shot in neck outside a supermarket ambulance took 35 45 minutes to arrive and waited a further 35 45 minutes for police to arrive paramedics refused to take victim to hospital without a police escort according to stevenson there was a possibility that rival would shoot at paramedics for trying to resuscitate victim post production effects thumb right upright 0 97 alt destruction of greene s car as with many scenes explosion couldn t be re shot due to limited budget some of effects seen in film couldn t be replicated stevenson said everyone had to be on point and that any mistakes couldn t be rectified by re filming for example producers couldn t afford to shoot film s final scene in which greene is killed via a car explosion twice before filming production crew and actors had to check everything on set time was also lacking with stevenson saying everyone had to be extremely focused editing porrello had second thoughts about one scene being included in film this particular scene included murder of two police officers porrello felt uncomfortable approaching hensleigh but did so anyway porrello said to him if you are going to kill a cop it is going to change tone of story scene was nevertheless included in final cut reception critical response on rotten tomatoes film holds an approval rating of 61 based on 49 reviews with an average rating of 5 6 10 website s critical

film a ripoff of goodfellas 1990 giving film a positive review mike lasalle of san francisco chronicle said what makes this film special and memorable is character of danny greene who is not usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul marshall fine of huffington post gave film a mixed review he criticized it for jumping through different events in a jerky fashion but summed up review by calling it a movie with a lot of meat on bone even if some of it is tough or stringy it s not fancy but it s always tasty robert abele of la times said film plays like an explosion s aftermath shards of mob movies that add up to usual goodfellas knockoff scott tobias of a v club had similar views saying biggest problem with film isn t that it rips off goodfellas but that plenty of good films have ripped it off well in regards to controversy surrounding kill irishman and its purported similarities to goodfellas critic dave van houwelingen said blockquote there are certain movies that serve as a standard bearer for a genre a high water mark that filmmakers always try to hit but seem to always come up short to me i think martin scorsese s goodfellas is that type of film for gangster genre in 21 years since film was released so many filmmakers have tried so hard to copy goodfellas success and so few have gotten even close to capturing magic that scorsese did in one of his very best films 21 years have been littered with a bunch of pale imitations to that list you can add jonathan hensleigh s kill irishman which wants so desperately to be goodfellas and comes up so very very short van houwelingen dave 29 march 2011 movie review kill irishman www blogspot co uk retrieved 7 february 2015 blockquote hensleigh s directing was criticized scott tobias said directing doesn t do much beyond filling in template he noted that hensleigh was telling true life tale of mob s decline in cleveland but also said that every character
