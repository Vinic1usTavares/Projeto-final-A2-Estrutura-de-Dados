1995 gulf of aqaba earthquake also known as nuweiba earthquake occurred on november 22 at 06 15 local time 04 15 utc and registered 7 3 on scale epicenter was located in central segment of gulf of aqaba narrow body of water that separates egypt s sinai peninsula from western border of saudi arabia at least 8 people were killed and 30 were injured in area earthquake occurred along dead sea transform dst fault system an active tectonic plate boundary with seismicity that is characterized by long running quiescent periods with occasional large and damaging earthquakes along with intermittent earthquake swarms it was strongest tectonic event in area for many decades and caused injuries damage and deaths throughout levant and is also thought to have remotely triggered a series of small to moderate earthquakes to north of epicenter in aftermath of quake several field investigations set out to determine extent of any surface faulting and distribution of aftershocks was analyzed tectonic setting gulf of aqaba is situated along southern portion of dead sea transform dst fault zone a transform fault that forms barrier between african plate and arabian plate arabian nubian shield left lateral strike slip fault connects spreading center that forms red sea in south with east anatolian fault in turkey in north although there is much that is not known about dst it is accepted that its transform motion began around 12 18 million years ago geologist a m quennell who is credited with first recognizing movement along fault in 1958 estimated total displacement to be while a similar study that included more regional influences resulted in an estimated slip of that broader kinematic model translates into a slip rate of 8 10 mm year for portion of fault south of dead sea along length of dead sea transform also known as levantine fault there are several pull apart basins that have resulted in formation of dead sea as well as gulf of aqaba gulf comprises three distinct pull apart basins that were formed by individual segments of fault and are known as from north to south elat deep aragonese deep and dakar deep at wide gulf is relatively narrow but is up to deep with nearby mountains near in height this difference in elevation suggests that tectonic activity outpaces erosive processes in area but background seismicity is infrequent and is marked by earthquake swarms stress triggering thumb usgs shakemap showing intensity of 1995 gulf of aqaba earthquake earthquake was largest event to occur on along dst during 20th century and was felt up to away period of aftershocks carried on for over a year with many exceeding magnitude 5 within several hours of mainshock a number of small earthquakes occurred along dst north of epicenter analysis of these earthquakes suggest that they may have been remotely triggered by gulf of aqaba mainshock much attention has been given to remotely triggered earthquakes since 1992 landers earthquake in southern california dead sea fault system runs from red sea north to a triple junction in south central turkey and consists of a main fault and several secondary faults fault system is at its widest and deepest in gulf where a transition from proto oceanic rifting to transform faulting occurs moving northward through lebanon and syria where dst is known as fault trace follows a restraining bend and splits into several strands that include serghaya and rachaya faults these strands are believed to be source of near east earthquakes of 1759 increased seismic activity following aqaba earthquake was detected by syrian national seismic network snsn and occurred in area of serghaya and rachaya faults within a area near restraining bend in southwest syria snsn consists of twenty vertical component seismometers but only nine instruments recorded swarm this small area in southwest syria situated 500 km north of gulf of aqaba mainshock had almost no activity during two previous months then beginning two hours and 47 minutes after event a swarm of 21 small earthquakes occurred average background seismicity was 5 to 1 events per day preceding november 22 and during swarm 21 small earthquakes with a peak magnitude of md 3 7 were recorded in three and a half hours randa mohamad from syrian national seismological center and other seismologists determined that abrupt increase of activity was due to remote earthquake triggering from gulf of aqaba mainshock and reported results of their investigation in a journal published by seismological society of america damage epicenter was located south of head of gulf of aqaba where countries of egypt israel jordan and saudi arabia converge damage to buildings occurred in coastal cities of eilat israel and aqaba jordan and a small tsunami was observed by witnesses there farther down coast and closer to epicenter in egyptian city of nuweiba several well built modern concrete reinforced homes were completely destroyed earthquake s effects were felt as far north as lebanon and syria and it was strongest event in jordan rift valley since 1927 jericho earthquake which was centered near dead sea heaviest damage occurred in resort town of eilat where seven hotels and 50 other buildings were damaged and cracks formed in sidewalks fifteen people were treated there for injuries or shock and one man died of a heart attack in aqaba in saudi arabia two women were reported dead and five deaths were reported in egypt with three of them occurring in gulf resort town of nuweiba eight buildings collapsed in cairo where just several years before much smaller 1992 cairo earthquake had a much more destructive impact one person was killed and two were injured slightly at al bad saudi arabia and damage was reported there as well as towns of al ula and past events gulf of aqaba lies between sinai peninsula and arabian peninsula both mostly desert regions with very few permanent settlements seismologists who work with historical events gather macroseismic data from written records from cities that may not have been anywhere near epicentral area this can result in mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where earthquake occurred records of these events have been influenced by distribution of population where people were and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events several studies in 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in region in last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6 5 7 0 based on macroseismic data countries surrounding gulf have been actively monitoring seismicity there since 1980s and have found a consistent low level of activity but a primary characteristic of activity is that there are multiple sequences of earthquake swarms three swarm events beginning in north and ending in south gulf have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1 000 events occurred over a three month period near northeastern boundary of elat deep in northern gulf with largest three events approaching 5 on richter magnitude scale a less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with largest event reaching 4 3 in central gulf near elat deep and arogonese deep last significant swarm happened in 1993 in southwestern arogonese deep in southern gulf with highest magnitude of 6 1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in following weeks aftermath during several independent field studies cracks and other ground deformations were observed on both egyptian and saudi arabian sides of gulf during a field survey that was done there in 1996 a series of cracks were discovered between n and n on saudi arabian coast a field investigation was also done in egypt in 1996 by seismologist yann klinger and others along with egyptian geological survey and mining authority most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of nuweiba along a coastal road countries surrounding gulf egypt israel jordan and saudi arabia operate their own seismic networks and during months that followed main event fourteen temporary and permanent stations recorded thousands of aftershocks klinger acquired data on approximately 1 000 aftershocks via european mediterranean seismological center and agencies of each country data was filtered to include only those aftershocks within of epicenter data from four stations from institute for petroleum research and geophysics of israel plus seven stations from jordan s natural resource authority recorded aftershocks in epicentral area that met restriction it was found that aftershocks were arranged with a north south alignment over a length of and that was expected from an earthquake of such magnitude group of aftershocks were bunched in two distinct clusters with one in north and one further south see also list of earthquakes in 1995 list of earthquakes in egypt list of earthquakes in saudi arabia
