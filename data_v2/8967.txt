typhoon rammasun known in philippines as typhoon florita was first of four typhoons to contribute to heavy rainfall and deadly flooding in philippines in july 2002 fifth tropical cyclone of 2002 pacific typhoon season rammasun developed around same time as typhoon chataan only further to west storm tracked northwestward toward taiwan and on july 2 it attained its peak intensity with winds of 160 km h 100 mph rammasun turned northward passing east of taiwan and china in taiwan outer rainbands dropped rainfall that alleviated drought conditions in china rainfall occurred after previously wet conditions resulting in additional flooding although damage was less than expected there was about 85 million in crop and fishery damage in one province after affecting taiwan and china rammasun began weakening due to an approaching trough which turned typhoon northeastward it passed over japanese island of miyako jima and also produced strong winds in okinawa about 10 000 houses lost power on island and high surf killed two sailors on japanese mainland there was light crop damage and one serious injury after weakening to a tropical storm rammasun passed just west of south korean island of cheju do killing one person from high waves storm crossed country killing three others and leaving 9 5 million in damage high rains also affected north korea and primorsky krai in russian far east meteorological history toward end of june monsoon trough extended across western north pacific ocean just north of equator spawning two tropical disturbances easternmost one eventually developed into typhoon chataan and western disturbance persisted to east of palau with an associated area of convection system gradually organized developing a weak circulation after wind shear steadily decreased early on june 28 japan meteorological agency jma classified system as a tropical depression near yap in federated states of micronesia fsm at same time philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa declared system as tropical depression florita and a few hours later joint typhoon warning center jtwc initiated advisories on tropical depression 09w after forming depression tracked northwestward influenced by a ridge to northeast although it briefly turned to northeast due to an increase in westerly winds however its northwest motion quickly resumed a trough over philippine sea increased outflow over depression and convection became better organized early on june 29 jma upgraded depression to tropical storm rammasun while moving northwestward circulation initially remained broad and disorganized located east of cycling convection however rammasun steadily intensified and an eye developed on july 1 that day jma and jtwc upgraded storm to a typhoon about 930 km 575 mi east of luzon in philippines typhoon continued strengthening developing concentric eyewalls with well defined rainbands at 1500 utc on july 2 jma estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 160 km h 100 mph early on july 3 jtwc estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 205 km h 125 mph about 350 km 220 mi south southeast of okinawa or 510 km 315 mi southeast of taiwan while at peak intensity rammasun turned northward steered around subtropical ridge to its east and early on july 3 it struck japanese island of miyako jima a stationary trough over china weakened convection on western periphery of typhoon and eye gradually became less organized on july 4 rammasun began weakening and by 0000 utc on july 5 it was located about 280 km 175 mi east northeast of shanghai as a minimal typhoon shortly thereafter rammasun weakened to tropical status an approaching trough caused storm to accelerate to northeast which weakened convection and left circulation exposed around 2200 utc on july 5 rammasun made landfall in south korea near or about 70 km 45 mi northwest of country s capital of seoul jtwc estimated that landfall intensity was around 65 km h 40 mph storm quickly crossed country and although jtwc considered rammasun dissipated early on july 6 over country jma continued tracking storm toward northeast declaring storm extratropical at 1200 utc that day early on july 8 jma reported that remnants of rammasun dissipated to south of vladivostok preparations and impact right thumb typhoon rammasun in east china sea on july 4 as rammasun moved away from philippines it enhanced monsoon and produced rainfall and flooding several landslides were reported and more than 3 000 people had to evacuate subsequent storms also enhanced monsoon and combined with effects from typhoon chataan severe tropical storm and typhoon halong there were 85 deaths with 45 people injured in philippines combined damage in country totaled 10 3 million million 2002 php before typhoon affected taiwan residents in taipei prepared sand bags and president chen shui bian ordered military to be on standby to assist in storm s aftermath taiwan s central weather bureau issued an offshore typhoon warning on july 2 prompting officials to cancel ferry service and restrict water activities in national park after an extended drought that resulted in water restrictions for two months typhoon dropped rainfall across country in county rammasun dropped of rainfall highest total on island rains caused landslides in two villages although damage was minor on july 4 water restrictions were removed island wide with exception of taipei city s restriction was removed a day later after determining that feitsui dam and dam reached levels approaching their full capacity in contrast to previously dry conditions on taiwan eastern china was experiencing above normal rainfall and many reservoirs were near capacity when rammasun was approaching region while paralleling eastern coast of china rammasun dropped heavy rainfall that reached in ningbo and wind gusts peaked at 165 km h 102 mph in eastern zhejiang officials canceled 200 flights either departing or arriving from shanghai pudong international airport high winds destroyed a migrant worker village in shanghai killing five people winds damaged a building that was under construction injuring 44 people a woman was killed in chongming when winds knocked a wall onto her rammasun downed trees and caused power outages in region and storm flooding forced over 2 700 people to evacuate high winds left about 85 million in agriculture and aquaculture damage in zhejiang however damage was less than expected due to storm remaining offshore striking japanese island of miyako jima typhoon produced peak wind gusts of 169 km h 105 mph while in eyewall with sustained winds of 93 km h 58 mph similarly strong winds were reported near okinawa reaching 90 km h 56 mph high seas from typhoon killed two united states navy sailors in okinawa rammasun left about 10 000 houses without power two people were injured in country one of them severely a station in miyazaki prefecture on japanese island of kyushu reported highest rainfall associated with rammasun with a total of one house in country was damaged due to typhoon and there was at least one report of a landslide crop damage in country totaled 4 4 million y 896 million 2002 jpy threat of storm prompted officials to cancel 61 airplane flights typhoon rammasun passed a short distance west of cheju do an island offshore south korea dropping more than 300 mm 12 in of rainfall high surf killed one person on island and officials restricted access to hallasan mountain and all parks seven boats were damaged and many roads on island were flooded before rammasun struck south korean mainland airline officials canceled 167 flights there were three deaths on mainland including one boy who drowned in floodwaters damage in country totaled 9 5 million much of it property damage there was also damage to rice crop rainfall extended into neighboring north korea damaging rice and maize later rammasun brought average monthly rainfall
