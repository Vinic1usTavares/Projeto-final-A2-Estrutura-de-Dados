program supporting united states government s war on poverty was due to expire in an attempt to generate national interest in renewing funding for effort united states senate committee on labor s subcommittee on poverty held a series of hearings related to hunger starting march 15 one of first testifying witnesses was marian wright a 27 year old yale law school graduate working with naacp s legal defense fund in mississippi she told subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in mississippi delta in addition to this two parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits and most counties in mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps with little to no income most households could not produce necessary funds as a result wright argued mississippians were starving they re starving and those who can get bus fare to go north are trying to go north i wish that senators would have a chance to go and just look at empty cupboards in delta and number of people who are going around and begging just to feed their children chairman joseph s clark suggested that subcommittee travel to mississippi to verify wright s testimony of subcommittee s nine members senators robert f kennedy jacob javits george murphy agreed to idea and accompanied him kennedy dispatched his aide peter edelman to get an advanced view on situation edelman spoke extensively with wright whom he would marry 15 months later trip to delta subcommittee members flew into jackson on april 9 that evening senators dined with prominent mississippians including oscar carr and charles evers carr later described kennedy as a very shy man who continuously asked questions evers said we talked and talked and he listened local civil rights activist moore acted as kennedy s host hearing in jackson a field hearing was scheduled for april 10 mississippi senator john stennis a staunch segregationist was scheduled to be interviewed he disapproved of federal efforts to improve economic situation of black people and sought to discredit them by attacking head start program s parent agency child development group of mississippi cdgm head start project provided services to impoverished children and was funded with grants from federal government thereby preventing state authorities from interfering with its activities by potentially improving socioeconomic status of black mississippians head start threatened white political power base that dominated state just days after money for program had been appropriated stennis and state officials began scrutinizing it and requesting financial records in days before stennis scheduled testimony jackson s two newspapers both supportive of segregation ran several stories about senator s planned critique upon poverty subcommittee s arrival in city clark announced that he considered questions concerning head start and funding irregularities to already be answered and that hearing would not spend significant time discussing issue stennis responded by leaking his draft testimony to press subcommittee hearing took place in olympic ballroom of hotel heidelberg in jackson it was originally supposed to take place in a room meant to accommodate 300 persons but subcommittee relocated after local media attention stirred enough interest to bring crowd to about 1 000 people in his opening remarks clark stated that hearing intended to be neither a witch hunt or a whitewash we are here to find out basic facts stennis was called as first witness he admitted that there was poverty in his state but posited that federal anti poverty programs were overrunning expected costs and that he wished to support taxpayers he then declared that federal government had bypassed responsible honest capable local leadership and in favor of northerners and as a result its offices had become a stake hold of beatniks and immorality he requested that governor be empowered to suspend any project he determines not in public interest and finished by highlighting fact that 500 000 650 000 dollars worth of cdgm s funds were proclaimed by a government audit to be unaccounted for clark then allowed members of subcommittee to question stennis kennedy presented a private report conducted by a new york based firm at behest of college that hosted cdgm according to new audit amount of wasted funds was deemed to be relatively minor and no evidence was found to substantiate government s allegation stennis was flustered and declared that senate committee on appropriations of which he was a member should have been informed of conflicting calculations he concluded it s another illustration of mysterious way in which this independent agency operates thanked committee for their time and left hotel testimony was then given about conditions in delta from both public officials and local impoverished inhabitants a black doctor stated that state suffered from a high infant mortality rate and that rate was twice as high for black babies he added that mortality rate of black babies from early childhood illnesses was five times greater than that for white infants head start workers testified that older children they had examined displayed symptoms of anemia and other nutritional deficiencies it was also stated that decline in demand for agriculture labor increased unemployment and that many of adults were unskilled did not have access to adequate transportation or training programs or faced racial discrimination in their work robert former chairman of jackson chamber of commerce asserted that greatest problem afflicting mississippi was its dysfunctional education system he stated that 200 000 adults out of total 2 million had not received schooling beyond fourth grade and that a further 40 000 had never had any education civil rights activist unita blackwell defended head start program saying it was only anti poverty initiative that addressed locals problems when questioned by kennedy about hunger she stated that there was a problem with hunger in her county and that shift from surplus food aid to stamp program had worsened situation wright spoke once more asserting after two civil rights bills and third year of poverty bill negro in mississippi is poorer than he was he has less housing he is badly educated he is almost in despair kennedy took his greatest interest in locals statements afterwards he told evers i want to see it kennedy s and clark s tour thumb a run down house in mississippi delta c 1966 275px left following day kennedy and clark drove into delta area while other senators flew back to washington d c they were accompanied by evers wright moore edelman carr a dozen or so reporters from state and national newspapers and big three television networks and an assortment of u s marshals state highway patrolmen and local police that morning senators reviewed anti poverty programs underway in greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers after lunch kennedy s and clark s motorcade traveled at speeds over 80 mph down u s route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by wright and moore their first stop was a dilapidated shotgun house in cleveland in which 15 people resided holes were present in flooring and roofing and only food in refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter one boy told kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses and that he didn t eat any lunch walking to next house kennedy whispered to edelman i ve been to third world countries and i ve never seen anything like this following home belonged to a mother of seven there were no tables or cutlery in house and toilet operated without plumbing roaches and rats ran across floor kennedy s attention was drawn to a 20 month old boy who was playing with rice grains on floor child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek he said my god i didn t know this kind of thing existed how can a country like this allow it maybe they just don t know clark labeled what lay before them a national disgrace kennedy caressed child and talked to him but elicited no response senator began to cry kennedy stepped outside and quietly remarked we spend 75 billion a year on armaments and 3 billion a year on dogs we have to do more for these children that didn t ask to be born into this local newspaper editor cliff langford who strongly disliked kennedy shouted back that two senators were being brainwashed clark retorted don t worry we ve been brainwashed from other side langford added i don t know of anybody starving down here kennedy responded step over here and i ll introduce you to some clark reassured reporters that he and kennedy were not observing conditions in delta to find fault but rather just to see if we can do anything about it senators motorcade continued on towards clarksdale but kennedy asked that they stop in small town of mound bayou with no advanced notice kennedy his aides and half a dozen reporters walked into home of a 39 year old man named andrew jackson his wife and their six kids there was no electricity running water or toilet there were two pictures in house one of singers a clarksdale based gospel group and another of john f kennedy jackson was incredulous that he was meeting brother of late president and asked is you really mr bobby kennedy kennedy smiled and shook his hand replying yes and are you really mr andrew jackson a thousand people mostly black school children awaited senators outside clarksdale neighborhood center two stayed in city for only 20 minutes clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled as their flight in memphis was due to take off in two hours for capital and he was going to catch that plane meanwhile kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to crowd he said he was glad to have made trip and told them problems of poverty are problems of all united states citizens he was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs though police soon cleared way and motorcade continued onto highway aftermath government response kennedy returned to washington d c on evening of april 10 he walked in on his family having dinner at hickory hill highly agitated and in words of his daughter kathleen ashen faced he announced to his children in mississippi a whole family lives in a shack size of this room children are covered with sores and their stick out because they have no food do you know how lucky you are do you know how lucky you are do something for your country following morning kennedy and edelman met with secretary of agriculture orville freeman and angrily criticized food stamp program for charging families that had no income though freeman was keen on avoiding a political dispute with kennedy he feared that by concurring with senator he would anger southern bloc in congress that held great influence over his department s budget he deflected bob there isn t anyone in america who has no income kennedy replied i ll tell you what i ll send peter edelman here back down there with some of your people will you agree that you ll change regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in mississippi who have no income freeman agreed and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps returning to new york on april 12 kennedy exclaimed to wife of one of his aides you don t know what i saw i have done nothing in my life everything i have done was a waste everything i have done was worthless when asked about poverty subcommittee s findings clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to war on poverty he also said that united states needed a reawakening of a conscience entire subcommittee sent a letter to president lyndon b johnson about their discoveries and findings of department of agriculture officials who had been dispatched to delta writing about conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger that can only be described as shocking and imploring federal government to declare an emergency johnson never responded several johnson administration officials in addition to freeman were skeptical of reports of starvation in delta johnson had seen news coverage of event and on april 17 he ordered that his top domestic aide joseph califano give him a quick report califano replied 20 minutes later writing that freeman was hesitant to make major changes to administration s food stamp program until original system was sanctioned by congress when his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan johnson already uneasy about food stamp program rejected proposal kennedy made a direct appeal to johnson involving increased of food stamps and supplement of emergency food rations for 40 000 60 000 of most impoverished mississippians johnson ignored it a decision an editorial in nation claimed was due to fact that he was incapable of rising above personal politics once news of situation in delta went public mississippi governor paul b johnson jr dismissed report as product of socialist minded senators he also told journalist bill minor all negroes i ve seen around here are so fat they shine following publication in june of a particularly severe report compiled by field foundation of new york governor johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about children s nutrition its findings concurred with those of field foundation on july 11 and july 12 clark held another set of congressional hearings on hunger in delta to pressure freeman attracting widespread media coverage hearings were tense with clark kennedy javits and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with mississippi senators stennis and james eastland also a staunch segregationist and mississippi board of health officer a l gray kennedy called child psychologist robert coles to testify on poverty s effect on children in mississippi delta one north carolina doctor described an unwritten policy on part of those who control state to eliminate negro mississippian either by driving him out of state or starving him to death when stennis and eastland accused doctor of committing libel against welfare workers of their state he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves to which none accepted on second day of proceedings secretary freeman and senator javits got into a shouting match with senator arguing that secretary should disregard local authorities opinions declare an emergency and immediately supply food to region he remarked we seem to be able to send airplanes to congo in a terrible hurry we first heard of desperation point of poor mississippi negroes 18 months ago and we are still hearing that there is starvation in mississippi kennedy openly expressed his frustration with johnson administration officials perceived inability to understand extent of delta s problems and other bureaucratic complications saying it seems to me we are floundering around a great deal in end kennedy managed to amend renewal of economic opportunity act of 1964 to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition stennis was so embarrassed by hearings that he proposed a 10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services despite resistance from other southern legislators and a lack of support from president johnson stennis bill passed senate also voted unanimously to create a select committee on nutrition and human needs kennedy subsequently embarked on more poverty tours to investigate and publicize impoverished conditions across united states he frequently invoked delta tour in legislative discussions and during his 1968 presidential campaign public reaction thumb demonstrators of poor people s march on washington 300px media coverage from event brought national attention to food insecurity issues in delta most americans were shocked by conditions described in area almost immediately field foundation of new york dispatched a team of doctors to mississippi to examine children and verify senators findings they labeled conditions they observed a national disaster documenting cases of rickets and other signs of malnutrition and starvation one doctor likened state of affairs to worst he had seen in eastern kenya this countered initial public reactions of disbelief at severity of situation citizens crusade against poverty an advocacy group already studying problems in delta quickly created a citizens board of inquiry into hunger and malnutrition in united states in april 1968 board published a report of its findings entitled hunger u s a this was shortly followed by a critique of national school lunch program by a coalition of women s organizations in conversation with wright and kennedy remarked only way there s going to be change is if it s more uncomfortable for congress not to act than it is for them to act you ve got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to washington and stay here until congress gets really embarrassed and they have to act following week wright proposed idea to martin luther king jr who subsequently organized poor people s march on washington around same time cbs broadcast a major documentary hunger in america which had been made on suggestion of kennedy to television executive don hewitt legacy trip to mississippi delta made hunger a public issue of interest in united states following revelations of food insecurity a powerful anti hunger movement emerged in country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones federal expenditures on food assistance grew by 500 percent over next decade marian wright would later say that episode set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in virtual elimination of hunger in america during nixon years mississippi delta tour was featured in
