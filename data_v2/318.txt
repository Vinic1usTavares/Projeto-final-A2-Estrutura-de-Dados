hurricane carrie was strongest tropical cyclone of 1957 atlantic hurricane season third named storm and second hurricane of year carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off western coast of africa on september 2 a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of cape verde type hurricanes moving to west storm gradually intensified reaching hurricane strength on september 5 carrie intensified further before reaching peak intensity on september 8 as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h in open atlantic ocean hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared bermuda on september 14 however carrie passed well north of island and turned to northeast towards europe weakening as it reached higher latitudes storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 23 prior to affecting areas of british isles and subsequently dissipated on september 28 due to its distance away from any major land masses carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path on september 16 hurricane passed well north of bermuda causing minimal damage despite its intensity at time though hurricane reconnaissance flights in area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of aircraft as it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of azores german ship pamir encountered storm and capsized on september 21 resulting in deaths of 80 crew members on board as an extratropical storm carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to british isles which claimed three lives hurricane s long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of atlantic hurricane records meteorological history in early september a trough was identified along western coast of africa moving towards west as a result of a strong azores high disturbance passed over cape verde on september 2 observations from weather stations evidenced cyclonic rotation in region an airplane belonging to panair do brasil passed within vicinity of vorticity and as a result reported formation of a tropical storm in hurdat official database listing all known atlantic tropical cyclones since 1851 system was listed to have reached tropical depression intensity at 0600 utc that day depression continued to steadily intensify as it moved westwards later reaching equivalent of a modern day category 1 hurricane by 0600 utc on september 5 on september 6 ship african star encountered hurricane west of cape verde reported winds of and a minimum pressure of 1001 mbar hpa 29 56 inhg confirmed existence of tropical cyclone a weather bureau forecaster remarked that hurricane was in a blind spot at time due to its location outside of shipping lanes and hurricane hunter reconnaissance missions throughout day hurricane intensified reaching major hurricane intensity by 0000 utc on september 7 shortly after a united states air force reconnaissance flight headed for bermuda was diverted to observe hurricane flight reported a well defined eye measuring across and a minimum pressure of 945 mbar hpa 27 91 inhg lowest measured in relation to hurricane at time carrie had maximum sustained winds of equivalent to a modern day category 4 hurricane further strengthening ensued and hurricane peaked in intensity on september 8 with winds of after reaching peak intensity on september 8 carrie began to gradually weaken due to a decreasing pressure gradient caused by a trough that had cut through azores high by september 11 hurricane had degenerated into a category 1 hurricane a reconnaissance flight reported a minimum pressure of 984 mbar hpa 29 06 inhg at same time carrie began to slowly curve towards north in response to trough storm later began to slowly reintensify major hurricane strength by 1200 utc on september 13 restrengthening of subtropical ridge on september 14 caused hurricane to quickly curve towards northwest national hurricane research project observers described hurricane as one of most perfectly formed hurricanes they had seen carrie began to steadily weaken again beginning on september 15 as it passed north of bermuda following day weather radar imagery from island indicated that hurricane had an ill defined structure with its eye having expanded to in diameter however as it curved and accelerated eastward in response to a second trough of low pressure carrie maintained hurricane intensity up until september 23 when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone remnant system continued eastwards until it dissipated over ireland by 1800 utc on september 28 preparations impact and records thumb painting of pamir by yasmina 2008 alt painting of a ship with triple sails traversing through somewhat rough seas on a fair day this ship sunk as a result of hurricane preparations and impact after reports confirmed existence of a hurricane in eastern atlantic weather bureau warned shipping lanes in storm s path small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from block island rhode island south to savannah georgia on september 7 due to threat of rough seas after carrie stalled on september 11 weather bureau gave florida a slight chance of being affected by storm but possibilities of storm affecting peninsula decreased after hurricane curved northwards after storm was forecast to potentially impact bermuda schools were closed in preparation for carrie while vessels were warned of oncoming hurricane most planes in kindley air force base on island were evacuated with remaining planes weighted down by sandbags after passing bermuda storm was forecast to strike nova scotia but instead carrie curved towards northeast as u s air force was maintaining continuous reconnaissance of hurricane using converted boeing b 50 superfortresses one of planes lost an engine and was forced to fly back to west palm beach florida for repairs four other undamaged aircraft were called back to west palm beach including a crippled ship while two other b 50s were held at bermuda passing well north of island on september 16 effects of carrie on bermuda were minimal with peak gusts reaching only german barque pamir en route from buenos aires to hamburg germany encountered hurricane southwest of azores on september 21 while carrying barley cargo ship sank due to effects of carrie and 80 people out of 86 crew members on board ship perished final message received from pamir was a distress call and indicated that ship had lost all of its sails and had been listing at a 45deg angle a search and rescue operation ensued after loss of ship was reported involving u s air force and navy as well as british air force and navy other ships from canada and portugal were also involved in search all associated groups were inconclusive in their findings with no sign of debris left from ship however two lifeboats and a raft were found but they were empty as an extratropical storm carrie impacted azores though damages if any remain unknown extratropical remnants of carrie later struck british isles on september 24 and 25 causing strong winds waves and severe flooding winds from system were estimated at strong waves caused extensive property damage and killed three records lasting as a hurricane for 20 75 days carrie was at time tied for second in terms of longest existing atlantic tropical cyclones alongside ninth hurricane of 1893 atlantic hurricane season and behind 1899 san ciriaco hurricane due to hurricane s long duration weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico issued 62 advisories on storm which was at time most ever issued in association with an atlantic hurricane carrie s long duration and distance from any land masses also contributed to its record travel distance of hurricane faith of 1966 surpassed this record after it traveled hurricane reconnaissance flights throughout carrie s existence traveled further east than any previous flight due to storm s location far from any land masses initial flight on september 7
