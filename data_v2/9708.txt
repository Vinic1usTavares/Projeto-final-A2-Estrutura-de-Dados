tropical cyclone bingiza was only named storm to make landfall in inactive 2010 11 south west indian ocean cyclone season second of three storms bingiza developed on february 9 to northeast of madagascar for a few days it meandered generally southwestward failing to intensify significantly on february 12 storm began a steady westward track as environmental conditions became more favorable in a 24 hour period bingiza developed from a moderate tropical storm into an intense tropical cyclone with a well defined eye after attaining peak 10 minute sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph cyclone moved ashore in northeastern madagascar on february 14 and quickly weakened as it crossed country bingiza emerged into mozambique channel as a weak tropical disturbance and it turned southward to move across western madagascar bingiza attained tropical storm status before making its final landfall near morondava degenerating into a remnant low on february 17 and dissipating two days later across madagascar cyclone killed 34 people and injured 13 others high winds destroyed 25 464 houses which left 25 845 people homeless bingiza first affected masoala national park destroying half of a village and leaving it isolated high winds and heavy rainfall left over 500 195 mi2 of damaged crops which increased food prices and threatened economic livelihoods of affected people meteorological history origins of cyclone bingiza were from a persistent area of disorganized convection on february 8 about 880 km 545 mi north northeast of reunion at time system consisted of a poorly defined circulation located in an area of low wind shear it moved west southwestward along northern periphery of a ridge and its convection gradually became more organized over center on february 9 meteo france mf classified system as tropical disturbance 5 and six hours later upgraded it to a tropical depression shortly thereafter joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert after convective banding and outflow increased following intensification of depression into a moderate tropical storm mf advised madagascan weather service to name storm as bingiza which they did late on february 9 upon becoming a tropical storm bingiza was located in an area of weak steering currents which resulted in a slow meandering motion toward southwest its motion turned to south on february 10 with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification after two days of meandering without strengthening bingiza turned to southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward madagascar around same time upper level conditions began improving which allowed convection to increase in coverage based on improved appearance mf upgraded bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600 utc on february 12 about 335 km 210 mi east of coast of madagascar later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery signaling beginning of a rapid deepening trend late on february 12 mf upgraded bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity which is equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon with minimal wind shear and warm waters agency forecast cyclone to intensify further to peak 10 sustained winds of 195 km h 120 mph continuing to strengthen bingiza attained 10 minute sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph early on february 13 similarly jtwc estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 mph noting a contracting eye 37 km 23 mi in diameter in process of an eyewall replacement cycle despite initial forecasts cyclone failed to strengthen further due to interaction with madagascar early on february 14 bingiza made landfall along masoala peninsula with winds of at least 150 km h 90 mph it emerged into bay before moving ashore north of manambolosy it quickly weakened over land although it produced heavy rainfall along its northern periphery early on february 15 bingiza weakened to a tropical depression center became difficult to locate over land although it emerged into mozambique channel north of as a tropical disturbance after moving over waters system was able to re intensify due to favorable water temperatures and inflow it quickly organized into a tropical depression again although strengthening was halted after it turned southward over western madagascar due to a ridge to its north it again moved into mozambique channel and bingiza re intensified into a tropical storm on february 17 storm developed a concentrated area of convection near center as well as a poorly defined eye re intensification was short lived after bingiza made its final landfall just south of morondava around 1330 utc on february 17 around that time storm s circulation was dissipating over land and its remnants left island on february 19 dissipating soon afterward impact thumb cyclone bingiza over madagascar on february 14 when bingiza made its first madagascar landfall it became first cyclone to strike country in cyclone season it first moved through masoala national park a sparsely populated protected region with significant numbers of trees in located along masoala peninsula cyclone destroyed half of buildings as well as roads and bridges leaving it only accessible by boat cyclone affected five districts primarily mananara nord there an early report indicated that 80 of houses were destroyed along with one hospital and four other health facilities high winds caused heavy crop damage including to rice and banana which left minimal food supplies in some areas vanilla crop was also severely affected and mayor of mananara was uncertain whether any of crop could be harvested bingiza struck at what one relief worker described as worst time of year for a cyclone because many farmers were unable to replant their damaged crops cyclone damaged 40 of food crops and 10 of cash crops in manambolosy as well as 70 of food crops in overall cyclone destroyed 405 23 km2 156 46 mi2 of rice fields as well as 101 67 km2 39 26 mi2 of other crops cyclone also damaged road infrastructure in mananara which made it difficult to transport fish in region to other areas of country resulting crop and road damage resulted in increased food prices across its path bingiza destroyed 25 464 houses and damaged 36 schools overall damage was less than expected given strength of cyclone most of damage occurred due to poor infrastructure and drainage systems of madagascar along with high levels of poverty a total of 34 deaths were reported along with 13 injuries when bingiza made its final landfall it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding in district in southeastern madagascar cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages as well as covering fields of rice and other crops a total of 310 people in southern portion of country were left homeless immediately after storm moved ashore high winds prevented disaster teams from assessing damage in affected areas by february 18 care international had dispatched relief teams to most affected regions teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10 000 people high winds halted locust control operations while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions in area of cyclone s first landfall most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from surrounding countryside overall about 25 845 people became homeless due to cyclone although most were able to return to their homes after a few days after they were repaired in months after storm s passage european commission allocated eur200
