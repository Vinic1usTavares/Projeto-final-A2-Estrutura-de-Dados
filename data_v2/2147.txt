be his final acting project he described his character william bell as somewhat of a blank slate and therefore attractive because there is an opportunity to build an interesting and unpredictable character character of massive dynamic founder william bell was originally meant to be revealed earlier in first season but writers changed their minds as show progressed in early april 2009 entertainment weekly announced that star trek actor leonard nimoy had been cast as bell he and fringe co creator j j abrams already had a relationship after working together on 2009 film star trek abrams stated in an interview that he called nimoy and begged him to join fringe explaining show and character nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with show so abrams and other producers sent him as much information as they could about fringe until nimoy agreed this exchange of phone calls in which nimoy responded with interest when pitched idea was also how abrams was able to cast him in his star trek reboot nimoy later explained when they contacted me about working on fringe same people same attitude same creativity same creative team it was very enticing according to abrams idea that he will play mysterious much referenced william bell is a thrill i know i sound like a goofy fan boy but i can t help it leonard is an icon of genre and such a wonderful actor to have him come on board fringe is a mind blowing honor nimoy was hired for three episodes beginning with season finale fringe co creator roberto orci described nimoy s character as a mix of howard hughes and bill gates while nimoy referred to bell as a master of universe who is brilliant wealthy and very powerful nimoy s part of final scene of episode with olivia was very brief nimoy described scene as interesting entertaining and that you ll want to see more of this relationship and what it s all about actress anna torv described final scene as calm yet threatening that s what s kind of cool about working on fringe is everything seems kind of calm and lovely but there s always something going on underneath while shooting nimoy commented that character was a unique experience as he had not acted outside of spock character for a number of years nimoy has stated in multiple interviews that his fringe role will be last project in his acting career writing and filming thumb upright co creator j j abrams called finale a huge turning point for all three main characters episode s teleplay was co written by executive producers jeff pinkner and j h wyman while consulting producer akiva goldsman and executive producer bryan burk co wrote story producer brad anderson served as episode director his fourth credit of season j j abrams called finale end of one chapter and start of another and believed it was a huge turning point for all three main characters co creator and executive producer roberto orci explained in an interview that big reveal at end of episode in which olivia meets bell in parallel universe was actually planned for a fourth season but writers decided let s actually answer something instead and not get not just rely on that mystery forever and so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended writers wanted to use an iconic image for scene leading to staff writer andrew kreisberg s suggestion of twin towers wyman first thought it was greatest idea in world before having doubts that its use would sensationalize it he explained but then when we started thinking about it we thought collectively america really understood 9 11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn t exploited but indicative of times we re living in right now we used it and that was end of first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going cast would later recollect on series and for jackson considered that show has never had a better visual or a better cliff hanger as this finale to create scene where jones brings a semi truck from parallel universe special effects crew took a smaller truck and dressed it enough so that it seemed like longer semi with help of cgi result was that in episode viewer is led to believe that truck had been cut in half after unsuccessfully entering prime universe doorway it was rigged so that it appeared to be on a tilt and cables linked it to smash into a passing car as production crew considered william bell to be a renaissance man they filled bell s office with things that inspire him such as a prototype of nina s mechanical arm and other items that evoke images and stimulate thought cultural references in final scene set in parallel universe a newspaper states presumably recently inaugurated obamas are moving into new white house indicating that traditional presidential residence had been recently rebuilt another headline has former president john f kennedy addressing united nations another part of newspaper depicts boston celtics player len bias winning mvp award when bias in fact died in 1986 in prime universe reception ratings there s more than one of everything was season one s finale episode was watched by an

go back and rewatch season one because finale had so many references and back story nods that i wanted to have everything in my head together andrew hanson from los angeles times thought finale leads to a wealth of possibilities deja universe was a bold move i can t wait to see what our friends at fringe do with it writing for chicago tribune critic maureen ryan heaped praise on excellent episode and complimented quietly creepy atmosphere slowly building tension in dual walter olivia stories way those stories were skillfully woven together suitably tense lakeside encounter between olivia peter and mr jones though some critics appreciated how fringe chose to end finale with a shot of world trade center others disliked it jeff pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because building is obviously very iconic and it best displayed that in parallel universe things are both better and in some ways worse it s just different choices road not taken leonard nimoy also defended writers commenting that when he received script he thought it was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story you know it s not easy to use that kind of stuff without seeming somehow exploitive but i thought they did it very very well many critics expressed that because of episode they couldn t wait for following season to begin ign s ramsey
