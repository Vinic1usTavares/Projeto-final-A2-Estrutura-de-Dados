tropical storm vamei also known as typhoon vamei was a pacific tropical cyclone that formed closer to equator than any other tropical cyclone on record last storm of 2001 pacific typhoon season vamei developed on december 26 at 1 4deg n in south china sea it strengthened quickly and made landfall along extreme southeastern peninsular malaysia vamei rapidly weakened into a remnant low over sumatra on december 28 and remnants eventually re organized in north indian ocean afterward storm encountered strong wind shear once again and dissipated on january 1 2002 though vamei was officially designated as a tropical storm its intensity is disputed some agencies classify it as a typhoon based on sustained winds of 120 km h 75 mph and appearance of an eye storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern peninsular malaysia causing 3 6 million in damage 2001 usd usd and five deaths meteorological history on december 19 a small low level circulation was located along northwest coastline of borneo at same time a plume of cold air progressed southward through south china sea on southeastern periphery of a ridge over far east vortex drifted southwestward reaching open water by december 21 northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with circulation and at same time a portion of air surge crossed equator southerly flow turned eastward then northward and in combination with northerly flow it wrapped into vortex resulting in rapid development of low level circulation just a short distance north of equator by december 25 an area of scattered convection persisted about 370 km 230 mi east of singapore within an area of low wind shear in association with low level circulation continuing slowly westward convection deepened and organized further and at 1200 utc on december 26 disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230 km 145 mi east of singapore or 156 km 97 mi north of equator this was first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near equator depression strengthened further and officially attained tropical storm status at 0000 utc on december 27 based on analysis by japan meteorological agency jma though joint typhoon warning center jtwc unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior shortly thereafter an eye with a 39 km 24 mi diameter became apparent on satellite imagery along with rainbands extending southward to opposite side of equator at 0600 utc jma first classified system as tropical storm vamei about 65 km 40 mi northeast of singapore and agency estimated storm attained peak winds of 85 km h 50 mph at same time however jtwc upgraded vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 120 km h 75 mph though jtwc operationally assessed storm s peak winds to have been 140 km h 85 mph based on a united states navy ship report from within eye a second ship reported wind gusts of 195 km h 120 mph in southern portion of eyewall storm was small and compact with gales extending about 45 km 30 mi from its center at about 0830 utc on december 27 vamei made landfall approximately 60 km 35 mi northeast of singapore in southeastern portion of malaysian state of johor initially malaysian meteorological department metmalaysia classified cyclone as a tropical storm though it was later re assessed as a typhoon at landfall tropical storm vamei weakened quickly as it crossed extreme southern portion of malay peninsula and late on december 27 jma downgraded it to tropical depression status before cyclone emerged into straits of malacca jtwc initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm though agency downgraded storm to depression status as storm s center again approached land early on december 28 vamei moved ashore on northeastern sumatra and at 0600 utc jma classified storm as dissipated however convection persisted near circulation over land believed to have been caused by process known as upper level diffluence on december 29 what was originally believed to be a separate system reached southeastern bay of bengal in a post season re evaluation jtwc classified system as a continuation of vamei based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated circulation of vamei crossed sumatra without dissipating convection re developed and late on december 30 jtwc classified cyclone as a tropical storm about 390 km 245 mi west southwest of northwestern tip of sumatra initially due to being treated as a separate system it was classified as tropical cyclone 05b vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization though increased wind shear on december 31 rapidly weakened storm by late that day center was exposed and vamei quickly dissipated on january 1 2002 unusual formation right thumb trmm image of vamei near landfall vamei formed and reached tropical storm strength at 1 n only 156 km 97 mi from equator this broke previous record of typhoon sarah in 1956 pacific typhoon season which reached tropical storm strength at 2 2o n due to a lack of coriolis effect near equator formation of vamei was previously considered impossible however a study by naval postgraduate school indicated that probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four centuries vamei developed in a vortex that appears every winter along northwest coast of borneo and is maintained by interaction between monsoonal winds and local topography often vortex remains near coastline and in an analysis of 51 winters only six reported vortex as being over equatorial waters for four days or more as area in south china sea between borneo and singapore is only 665 km 415 mi wide a vortex needs to move slowly to develop a persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days which is needed to enhance vortex is present on average nine days each winter probability for a pre existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10 30 percent thus conditions which resulted in formation of vamei are believed to occur once every 100 400 years preparations and impact left thumb radar image of vamei from four days prior to vamei moving ashore malaysian meteorological department metmalaysia issued storm advisories for potentially affected areas subsequently agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall high winds and rough seas however few citizens knew of passage of rare storm offshore of malaysia two u s navy ships in vamei s eyewall were damaged by strong winds upon moving ashore storm brought storm surge damage to portions of southeastern peninsular malaysia vamei brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to portions of melaka negeri sembilan and selangor as well as to johor where rainfall reached over 200 mm 8 in in senai additionally monsoonal moisture influenced by storm produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular malaysia passage of cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides which forced evacuation of more than 13 195 people in johor and pahang states into 69 shelters along gunung pulai rainfall caused a landslide which destroyed four houses and killed five people river flooding was also reported as a result of precipitation from vamei as well as previous rainfall damage from flooding was estimated at rm13 7 million 2001 myr 3 6 million 2001 usd about 40 percent of damage occurred to crops at a farm in kota tinggi moderate damage to transportation education and health care facilities was also reported malaysian government provided affected families up to rm5 000 2001 myr 1 300 2001 usd in assistance for food clothing and repairs vamei also brought heavy rainfall to singapore which caused air traffic disruptions at singapore changi airport passage of cyclone resulted in many downed trees in 2004 name vamei was retired and replaced with becoming first retired name since japan meteorological agency began naming pacific typhoons in 2000 vamei was one of seven tropical cyclones in current naming list that was retired without attaining typhoon status others were tropical storm in 2003 tropical storm bilis in 2006 tropical storm in 2011 tropical storm in 2013 tropical storm kai tak in 2017 and tropical storm
