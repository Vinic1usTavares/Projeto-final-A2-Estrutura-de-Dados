task early in episode and specifically denied knowledge of any sort of conspiracy against washington in february 1778 billias pp 76 77 gerry s political philosophy was one of limited central government and he regularly advocated for maintenance of civilian control of military he held these positions fairly consistently throughout his political career wavering principally on need for stronger central government in wake of 1786 87 shays s rebellion and was well known for his personal integrity billias pp 140 152 192 in later years he opposed idea of political parties remaining somewhat distant from both developing federalist and democratic republican parties until later in his career it was not until 1800 that he would formally associate with democratic republicans in opposition to what he saw as attempts by federalists to centralize too much power in national government billias p 105 in 1780 he resigned from continental congress over issue and refused offers from

during summer of 1787 billias p 158 in its deliberations he consistently advocated for a strong delineation between state and federal government powers with state legislatures shaping membership of federal government positions gerry s opposition to popular election of representatives was rooted in part by events of shays rebellion a populist uprising in western massachusetts in year preceding convention despite that position he also sought to maintain individual liberties by providing checks on government power that might abuse or limit those freedoms billias pp 153 54 he supported idea that senate composition should not be determined by population view that it should instead be composed of equal numbers of members for each state prevailed in connecticut compromise compromise was

during ratification debates that took place in states following convention gerry continued his opposition publishing a widely circulated letter documenting his objections to proposed constitution

billias pp 207 08 strong pro constitution forces attacked him in press comparing him unfavorably to henry jackson was particularly vicious gerry has done more injury to this country by that infamous letter than he will be able to make atonement in his whole life and oliver ellsworth a convention delegate from connecticut charged him with deliberately courting shays faction billias p 212 one consequence of furor over his letter was that he was not selected as a delegate to massachusetts ratifying p 211 although he was later invited to attend by convention s leadership convention leadership was dominated by federalists and gerry was not given any formal opportunity to speak he left convention after a shouting match with convention chair francis dana billias p 213 massachusetts

notably those of rhode island and north carolina which had at time still not ratified constitution billias p 229 in debate that followed he led opposition to some of proposals arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties he successfully lobbied for inclusion of freedom of assembly in first amendment and was a leading architect of fourth amendment protections against search and seizure billias p 231 he sought unsuccessfully to insert word expressly into tenth amendment which might have more significantly limited federal government s power billias pp 233 34 he was successful in efforts to severely limit federal government s ability to control state militias billias p 232 in tandem with this protection he had once argued against idea of federal government controlling a large standing army comparing it most memorably and mischievously to a standing penis an excellent assurance of domestic tranquility but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure gerry vigorously supported alexander hamilton s reports on public credit including assumption at full value of state debts and supported hamilton s new bank of united states positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization billias pp 223 237 although he had speculated in depreciated continental bills of credit at issue there is no evidence he participated in large scale speculation that attended debate when it took place in 1790 and he became a major investor in new bank billias pp 240 242 he used floor of house to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to republican ideals and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties he opposed any attempt to give officers of executive significant powers specifically opposing establishment of treasury department because its head might gain more power than president billias p 225 he opposed measures that strengthened presidency such as ability to fire cabinet officers seeking instead to give legislature more power over appointments billias p 226 gerry did not stand for re election in 1792 returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife billias p 243 he agreed to serve as a presidential elector for john adams in 1796 election billias p 245 during adams term in office gerry maintained good

president adams appointed gerry to be a member of a special diplomatic commission sent to republican france in 1797 tensions had risen between two nations after 1796 ratification of jay treaty made between united states and great britain it was seen by french leaders as signs of an anglo american alliance and france had consequently stepped up seizures of american ships elkins and mckitrick pp 537 38 adams chose gerry over his cabinet s opposition on political grounds that gerry was insufficiently federalist because of their long standing relationship adams described gerry as one of two most impartial men in america adams himself being other ferling p 345 gerry joined co commissioners charles cotesworth pinckney and john marshall in france in october 1797 and met briefly with foreign minister talleyrand stinchcombe pp 596 97 some days after that meeting delegation was approached by three french agents at first identified as x y and z in published papers leading controversy to be called xyz affair who demanded substantial bribes from commissioners before negotiations could continue billias pp 268 69 commissioners refused and sought unsuccessfully to engage talleyrand in formal negotiations billias pp 272 75 believing gerry to be most approachable of commissioners talleyrand successively froze first pinckney and then marshall out of informal negotiations and they left france

thomas jefferson supported him billias pp 289 93 negative press damaged gerry s reputation and he was burned in effigy by protestors in front of his home he was only later vindicated when his correspondence with talleyrand was published in response to federalist attacks on him and because of his perception that federalist led military buildup threatened republican values gerry formally joined democratic republican party in early 1800 standing for election as governor of massachusetts billias pp 289 301 governor of massachusetts for years gerry unsuccessfully sought governorship of massachusetts his opponent in these races caleb strong was a popular moderate federalist whose party dominated state s politics despite a national shift toward republicans buel pp 39 44 in 1803 republicans in state were divided and gerry only had regional support of party he decided not to run in 1804 returning to semi pp 304 305 and to deal with a personal financial crisis his brother samuel russell had mismanaged his own business affairs and gerry had propped him up by guaranteeing a loan that was due matter ultimately ruined gerry s finances for his remaining years billias pp 305

stood for election again in 1810 against gore and won a narrow victory republicans cast gore as an ostentatious british loving tory who wanted to restore monarchy his parents had remained loyal during revolution and gerry as a patriotic american while federalists described gerry as a french partizan and gore as an honest man devoted to ridding government of foreign influence billias p 313 a

this political cartoon which depicts a state senate district in essex county as a strange animal with claws wings and a dragon type head satirizing district s odd shape gerry s first year as governor was less controversial than his second because federalists controlled state senate he preached moderation in political discourse noting that it was important that nation present a unified front in its dealings with foreign powers buel pp 107 08 in his second term with full republican control of legislature he became notably more partisan purging much of state government of federalist appointees legislature also enacted reforms of court system that resulted in an increase in number of judicial appointments which gerry filled with republican partisans however infighting within party and a shortage of qualified candidates played against gerry and federalists scored points by complaining vocally about partisan nature of reforms buel pp 144 47 other legislation passed during gerry s second year included a bill broadening membership of harvard s board of overseers to diversify its religious membership and another that liberalized religious taxes harvard bill had significant political slant because recent split between orthodox congregationalists and unitarians also divided state to some extent along party lines and federalist unitarians had recently gained control over harvard board formisano p 76 in 1812 state adopted new constitutionally mandated electoral district boundaries republican controlled legislature had created district boundaries designed to enhance their party s control over state and national offices leading to some oddly shaped legislative districts hart p 3 458 although gerry was unhappy about highly partisan districting according to his son

cartoon calling it a gerry mander billias p 317 ever since creation of such districts has been called gerrymandering gerry also engaged in partisan investigations of potential libel against him by elements of federalist press further damaging his popularity with moderates redistricting controversy along with libel investigation and impending war of 1812 contributed to gerry s defeat in 1812 once again at hands of caleb strong whom federalists had brought out of retirement buel pp 148 p 323 gerrymandering of state senate was a notable success in 1812 election body was thoroughly dominated by republicans even though house and governor s seat went to federalists by substantial margins vice presidency and death gerry s financial difficulties prompted him to ask president james madison for a federal position after his loss in 1812 election which was held early in year he was chosen by democratic republican party congress to be madison s vice presidential running mate in 1812 presidential election although nomination was first offered to john langdon he was viewed as a relatively safe choice who would attract northern votes but not pose a threat to james monroe who was thought likely to succeed madison madison easily won reelection and gerry took oath of office at elmwood in march 1813 billias p 324 at that time office of vice president was largely a sinecure gerry s duties included advancing administration s agenda in congress and dispensing patronage positions in new england billias p 327 gerry s actions in support of war of 1812 had a partisan edge he expressed concerns over a possible federalist seizure of fort adams as boston s fort independence was then known as a prelude to anglo federalist cooperation and sought arrest of printers of
