critical reception spanish teacher was given mixed to positive reviews emily vanderwerff of a v club wrote that much of this episode felt like a very deliberate throwback to season one in some very good ways and ign s robert canning said that overarching storylines on glee have become far more engaging than what we saw in first half of season john kubicek of buddytv stated that episode does a lot of things right when it comes to plot and billboard rae votta described plot as consistent and well managed with believable motivation response and action all around however jen chaney of washington post wrote that episode brought more narrative developments that didn t make sense and rolling stone erica futterman stated that aside from martin s scenes rest of episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory amy reiter of los angeles times liked episode and described it as kind that makes you belly laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment introduction of ricky martin as david martinez was welcomed by most reviewers futterman wrote that ricky martin carried on gwyneth paltrow tradition of pretty great guest teacher cameos and tvline michael slezak said that episode was good at least whenever ricky martin appeared on screen vanderwerff called him fun and infectious and kate stanhope of tv guide said he showed himself to be a guest star with mucho potential kubicek though he said martin was great at singing found him kind of dull as an actor and canning said martin felt out of place in episode thumb left upright reviewers were surprised that will morrison pictured a spanish teacher hadn t even mastered basics of language although canning wrote that writers did a fine job of incorporating tenure will s terrible spanish and songs into storylines will s lack of spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers entertainment weekly joseph brannigan lynch said this did not seem to gel with passionate will schuester i remember from season 1 and slezak expressed surprise that he hadn t even mastered basics of language as did chaney slezak also said will as evidenced by his la cucaracha rendition for his class was suddenly dumb as cardboard box that finn winningly turned into a robot head and chaney commented mr schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this vanderwerff wrote of weird dark despair at heart of will s plight he s a high school spanish teacher and he mostly is that because he doesn t know what else to do he added i think this was probably best episode for character since early season one canning stated that tension between will and emma was a welcome change and votta commented on episode s less dramatic ending with will s apology and celebrating emma s new found tenure with a dinner with conclusion sometimes you don t need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode chaney however was puzzled as to why emma was given teaching tenure when she s been working at mckinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self made pamphlets scene between sue and roz was singled out by many reviewers bell wrote that she was really loving feisty dynamic between them and that it was about time that sue had a proper sparring partner flandez called roz delightfully colorful synchronized swimming teacher and said her scathing remarks were expertly delivered and that there were too many good lines to savor futterman said roz reminded her of what an entertaining spitfire sue was during season one and that sue is a shadow of her former self as evidenced by fact that roz has not been a victim of sue s evil planning lynch described encounter as one of episode highlights though he felt that writers overdid it a touch when sue barely got in any retorts against roz reiter called roz a great addition to cast of characters and leakes spot on in role also hearkening back to early sue kubicek said he might like this subplot if leakes did not mistake shouting for acting and slezak commented on roz s particularly abhorrent assessment of sue s reproductive abilities votta however declared that show should never let nene go and said she delivers some of best lines ever chaney and slezak thought that sue should have been fired immediately for requesting sperm donations from new directions males while lynch merely deemed it a possible detriment to her tenure bid kubicek thought pregnancy storyline should move forward because sue becoming a mommy has comedic potential written all over it a highlight for lynch was scene where kurt mercedes and rachel were watching twilight together not only because friendship between kurt and mercedes has been sadly downplayed but because it was nice to see glee kids just being kids sometimes subsequent conversation between kurt and finn in locker room was described by canning as one of truest moments of season so far votta wrote chris colfer and cory monteith often shine together in scenes especially one on one and this is no exception another duo that reviewers complimented was mercedes and sam futterman while she criticized episode for setting its scope too wide credited their storyline as only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song votta stated that glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can shake a stick at and it s delicious especially with valentine s around corner and canning noted that their week long verbal silence helped build their relationship into something we care more about chaney however could not see sense in mercedes bringing sam with her to see miss pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for sam and shane music and performances musical performances received a mixed response from reviewers votta said that songs were mostly forgettable and generally useless to advancing plot and canning maintained that music this week was just okay although vanderwerff called musical numbers mostly superfluous he described many of them as pretty fun while bobby hankinson of houston chronicle said he wasn t incredibly moved by this week s spanish flavored selections sexy and i know it was reviewed positively by huffpost tv crystal bell who cited martin s incredibly sexy performance slezak gave number an enthusiastic oh dear god please yes bonus points and an a grade chaney declared that martin did what he does very well dance and sing with high intensity though she wished they had chosen a better song and gave it a latter sentiment was echoed by lynch who called song idiotic and gave it a slightly lower c futterman characterized it as a rousing number that toes line of being too risque for a high school classroom though kubicek thought that having a teacher grinding with students was wildly inappropriate if hot and pretty entertaining mtv s kevin p sullivan however called it one of most eye brow raising musical numbers in show s history bizarre and a rory dancing finn flailing fail vanderwerff was also critical and described it as dumb and stupid and wrong thumb right upright don t wanna lose you was latest really strong number sung by mercedes riley pictured in third season slezak stated that mercedes musical moments in season 3 have been really strong and that don t wanna lose you was no exception he gave it a b grade lynch gave an and wrote it s been a treat to hear her develop softer side of her voice chaney said that number was fine just not particularly interesting and gave it a c but futterman declared that mercedes brings a richness and power and commendable spanish pronunciation to gloria estefan s song lynch called bamboleo hero mash up another winner and gave it a b and chaney said it was a fun choice that would have been a fun number without constant focus on hipster boots and graded it c sullivan agreed that boots were better not seen but that song actually worked he also noted that sam can sound a hell of a lot like iglesias futterman also heard resemblance between sam and iglesias though she said performance lacks fire and sex appeal of originals raymund flandez of wall street journal described it as number in several seasons futterman called la isla bonita best number of night she added that it mixes slick dance moves and spot on singing with perhaps a touch too much sexual tension for a student teacher pairing slezak said that harmonies were sweet and dancing was sexy without crossing line into disturbing april october territory and gave it an votta wrote that pair don t have any chemistry but that they re both very pretty to look at and listen to and their interpretation of latin culture is modern and sexy both chaney and lynch noted what she called inexplicably high production values fact that these two looked great together danced merengue beautifully and sounded smooth drew a b grade from her while his b was given because dancing wowed but their voices just didn t connect for me on this empty club version two songs performed by will schuester received most negative reviews chaney described la cucaracha as mercifully brief and slezak gave it an f for being not only intentionally awful but awful awful chaney was more generously inclined toward a little less conversation she wrote matthew morrison managed to give his all to this spanish infused elvis presley cover even though he looked pretty ridiculous in that matador outfit and gave it a b futterman stated that performance reached a new low with appearance of mike and brittany as his bulls and lynch said that number was supposed to suck and did its job well even so he gave it a slezak gave a one word summation to accompany his d grade no chart history two of episode s five released singles debuted on billboard hot 100 sexy and i know it debuted at number eighty three and la isla bonita at number ninety nine peak chart positions for season 3 singles in united states sexy and i know it and la isla bonita second of those
