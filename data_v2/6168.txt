thumb 600px food waste in united kingdom is a subject of environmental and socioeconomic concern that has received widespread media coverage and been met with varying responses from government since 1915 food waste has been identified as a considerable problem and has been subject of ongoing media attention intensifying with launch of love food hate waste campaign in 2007 food waste has been discussed in newspaper articles news reports and television programmes which have increased awareness of it as a public issue to tackle waste issues encompassing food waste government funded waste resources action programme wrap was created in 2000 a significant proportion of food waste is produced by domestic household which in 2007 created 6 700 000 tonnes of food waste potatoes bread slices and apples are respectively most wasted foods by quantity while salads are thrown away in greatest proportion a majority of wasted food is avoidable with rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable e g tea bags and unavoidable due to preference e g bread crusts or cooking type e g potato skins reducing amount of food waste has been deemed critical if uk is to meet international targets on climate change limiting greenhouse gas emissions and meet obligations under european landfill directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill equally great emphasis has been placed on reduction of food waste across all developed countries as a means of ending global food crisis that leaves millions worldwide starving and impoverished in context of 2007 2008 world food price crisis food waste was discussed at 34th g8 summit in hokkaido japan then uk prime minister gordon brown said of issue we must do more to deal with unnecessary demand such as by all of us doing more to cut our food waste in june 2009 then environment secretary hilary benn announced government s war on waste a programme aimed at reducing britain s food waste proposed plans under scheme included scrapping best before and limiting sell by labels on food creating new food packaging sizes constructing more on go recycling points and unveiling five flagship anaerobic digestion plants two

ii posters advised on a number of issues including that of food waste food waste was identified as a problem in uk as early as world war i combating food waste was one of initial goals of women s institutes wi set up in 1915 and remains a subject of their campaigns rationing was adopted during world war i although it was voluntary from february 1917 it was only between december 1917 and february 1918 that rationing began in stages to be made compulsory available on google books as well there is no evidence to suggest that by 1918 fines were imposed on either individuals or businesses for wasting food meanwhile in united states where shortages were hardly comparable legislators considered laws restricting distribution of food in order to cut waste breaches of which might be punishable by fines or imprisonment during world war ii rationing was imposed almost immediately restrictions were immediately more stringent than in great war as with effect from 8 january 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration by august 1940 legislation was passed that made wasting of food a offence posters encouraged kitchen waste to be used for feeding animals primarily swine but also poultry many of methods suggested by current campaigns to prevent food waste have taken inspiration from those of world war ii despite this it remains debatable whether waste campaigns and rationing during and post wwii achieved any long term change in people s attitudes towards waste wrap s report on domestic household waste found older people to waste as much avoidable waste as younger people ventour pp 181 3 further as early as 1980 only twenty five years after rationing was fully abolished a journal article published that year found significant levels of waste at home in restaurants and in sectors of food industry however rising amount of food waste could also be attributed to a change of lifestyle for instance buying of produce which has a shorter shelf life which would involuntarily lead to more food being thrown away by late 1990s things had worsened and food manufacturing sector was estimated to be generating over 8 000 000 tonnes of food waste

on intervening fortnightly weeks to those of municipal waste and share infrastructure and transport it has been suggested that given its proportion of waste stream and lack of distinct collections food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately hogg pp 18 19 however proposals by european union which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste have been met with opposition critics of proposals argue that local authorities understand specific needs of areas they serve and that they should decide waste policy advocates of proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials figures from wrap revealed most efficient method of collecting food waste to be separate collections followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis a mixed fortnightly collection was shown to be worst performing this was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that if carried out correctly separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste a widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection involving nineteen english local authorities achieved success and

year on year amount being sent to landfill is decreasing composting purposeful biodegradation of organic matter by microorganisms is among most simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost process can be undertaken at home with no running costs although equipment can accelerate process most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost however some exceptions will not e g cooked foods and feces and can attract vermin effectiveness of composting food waste depends on available space or storage capacity in case of a compost bin and method of composting unlike in landfill where it is mixed with other non biodegradable materials food waste decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases similarly to compost created from other waste sources composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to soil if spread on

to address food waste problem nationally ad technology has a small environmental impact producing less greenhouse gas emissions than composting hogg p 8 however although process is well established in

incinerating food waste is one of several alternatives to disposing to landfill incinerating waste has traditionally been viewed as a method with main purpose being destruction of waste involved recovering energy generated from this process has become of greater importance and all incineration facilities in england now operate as energy from waste plants with many operating as combined heat and power facilities critics question safety of pollutants emitted during process and argue that as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate it encourages more waste however levels of emissions from incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation see also fareshare real junk food project food waste in new zealand waste treatment notes a
