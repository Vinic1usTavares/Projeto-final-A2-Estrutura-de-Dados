attacked although of historical interest it is generally considered to be of poor artistic quality portrait is in room 3 of national portrait gallery in london work is thought to have been completed as part of a set of paintings of protestant martyrs it was in possession of a collector in streatham london by early 20th century in december 2005 portrait was examined by art dealer christopher foley he saw it as an accurate though poorly executed reproduction of a contemporary painting of jane had it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale work was acquired by national portrait gallery in london for a rumoured ps100 000 historian david starkey was highly critical of sale and challenged foley s identifications background lady jane grey was great granddaughter of king henry vii through his youngest daughter mary and first cousin once removed of king edward vi after edward s death a protestant faction proclaimed her queen over his catholic half sister mary two weeks later mary with support of english people claimed throne which jane relinquished only nine days after being installed jane and her husband lord guildford dudley were imprisoned in tower of london on charges of high treason jane s trial was conducted in november but her sentence of death was suspended in february 1554 jane s father duke of suffolk who had been pardoned participated in wyatt s rebellion on 12 february mary had jane then aged 16 and her husband beheaded jane s father suffered same fate two days later jane was a devout protestant during english reformation when church of england violently rejected authority of pope and roman catholic church known for her piety and education she corresponded with protestant leaders in continental europe such as heinrich bullinger a modest person who dressed plainly her last words before her execution are reported as lord into thy hands i commend my spirit jane s execution by a catholic queen made her into what oxford dictionary of national biography terms a protestant martyr and by end of century jane had become in words of historian eric ives a protestant icon depictions of jane in 16th and 17th centuries such as in john foxe s actes and monuments 1563 published after protestant elizabeth i took throne presented jane as primarily a figure in a national narrative about an elect nation possessed of a pure protestant faith which had risen supreme over catholic europe jane was long thought to be only 16th century english monarch without a surviving contemporary portrait one was documented in a 1590 inventory but is now considered lost some identified as her were later deemed to be of other sitters such as one of catherine parr last of six wives of henry viii which was identified as lady jane grey until 1996 other works such as execution of lady jane grey 1833 by paul delaroche were painted years or centuries after her death as a result cynthia zarin of new yorker writes blank where jane s face should be has made it that much easier for succeeding generations to imprint their political and personal fantasies on her description thumb 300px detail showing inscription three quarter length portrait measures 85 6 cm x 60 3 cm 33 7 in x 23 7 in and is painted with oil on baltic oak a faded inscription reading lady jayne or lady iayne is in upper left corner above woman s shoulders sitter is described by art critic charlotte higgins as a slender and demure pious young woman and has been tentatively identified as lady jane grey ives notes a familial resemblance between sitter and grey s sisters catherine and mary which may give conjectural support to identification of grey subject wears an opulent red gown with turned back trumpet sleeves and a with standing collar latter is embroidered with a fleur de lis pattern heraldic emblem of french royalty design on her underskirt shows a pattern variously identified as strawberries scots thistles or pinks last of these was an emblem of grey family a french hood on her head covers most of her red hair she wears numerous pieces of jewellery including a necklace finished with medallions and pearls these indicate a person of high social and economic status which is reinforced by silk and velvet of her gown sitter is not however wearing a wedding ring suggesting she was not yet married instead she is holding a prayer book this type of costume was popular during tudor period particularly in 1550s and accuracy of its depiction has been used to advance portrait s authenticity as a depiction of jane grey independent historian j stephan edwards writes however that fleur de lis give him pause as before june 1553 jane would have had no right to french heraldic emblems as she was not yet an heir to throne after discovery of an inscribed portrait of catherine parr in 2014 edwards published a tentative identification of said painting as original on which streatham portrait was based he wrote that parr painting had been adapted to become jane grey in absence of an accessible authentic portrait in streatham portrait and similar supporting this with an analysis of similar styles of dress and jewellery including a necklace of festooned pearls reception of painting as a work of art has been predominantly negative historian david starkey described it as an appallingly bad picture and there s absolutely no reason to suppose it s got anything to do with lady jane grey a sentiment which art dealer christopher foley rejected cooper of national portrait gallery gave less sharp criticism stating it s a paint by number labored copy and its value is as a historical document rather than a work of art zarin describes painting as looking bleached in comparison with other portraits of monarchs with flat face of a paper doll edwards writes quality might be described as naive primitive or even folk art history production and early history thumb alt houghton portrait in black and white a black and white photograph of houghton portrait now in a private collection it may be a copy of same original as streatham portrait portrait is undated and unattributed it is thought to have been completed in 1590s some forty years after jane s death probably as a copy of a lost portrait contemporaneous with jane dendrochronology dates wood panel to 1593 another strikingly similar portrait depicting a woman also credited as jane although costume differs slightly was once owned by richard monckton milnes 1st baron houghton but is now in an undisclosed private collection owing to similarities between two works edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original perhaps completed by same studio a third copy once owned by english costume designer herbert norris is known through records although its whereabouts are unknown streatham portrait may have been part of a collection of protestant martyr paintings damage to painting s mouth and eyes suggests that it was vandalised possibly by a catholic partisan as seventeen scratches did not splinter paint this attack was probably not long after portrait s completion owing to painting s crudeness foley suggests that it was hurriedly completed for jane s family from an original that had to be destroyed because it would have been too dangerous to own once mary became queen discovery portrait was in possession of a family in streatham london by 20th century they had long believed portrait was of jane and since 1923 had tried to convince others of its authenticity without success it was passed from generation to generation in december 2005 sir john guinness informed foley of family and their portrait foley visited owner hoping to go shut fellow up but upon seeing work on an easel in their attic knew it was right for period identity of sitter has been debated since panel s discovery foley has identified at least four jane greys among english nobility at time of portrait however owing to ages and marital status of other candidates lady jane grey was only viable choice others were too young already married and using a different surname or had lost their title starkey was more reserved arguing there isn t that over top quality you get with royal portraits of period where sitters look as though they ve just come back from asprey and that there was no documentation of jane owning jewellery seen in portrait after discovery libby sheldon of university college london conducted several tests to verify painting s age including spectroscopy and laser microscopy age of inscription was taken into consideration and found to be contemporaneous with rest of painting pigments including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600 were appropriate for 16th century dendrochronological analysis later showed that work was too late to be a life portrait of jane but did not rule out possibility of reproduction national portrait gallery thumb alt yale miniature miniature credited by starkey as a portrait of grey painting was purchased in 2006 by national portrait gallery london with funds raised through their 150th anniversary gala after more than nine months consideration cost was rumoured to be more than ps100 000 though zarin gives a price of ps95 000 acquisition was criticised by starkey who said if national portrait gallery has public money to burn then so be it decision depends on mere hearsay and tradition and it is not good enough foley countered evidence has been supported by people who know far more about science of painting than david starkey i don t know what his problem is is it because he didn t find it privately starkey acted on behalf of philip mould gallery and examined another portrait thought to be jane held by yale center for british art this miniature had been identified as elizabeth i during a 1983 exhibition at victoria and albert museum starkey however was 90 per cent certain it depicted jane after march 2007 exhibition lost faces when miniature was displayed after a recent resurgence of interest in jane foley published a lengthy letter challenging starkey s judgement he cited sitter s brooch and emblem as indicative that she was not jane grey streatham portrait bears accession number
