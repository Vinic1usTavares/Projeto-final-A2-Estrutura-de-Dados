in past which she postulates could be used to heal walter s brain now however piece is still in storage in old massive dynamic facility on main island of new york city tightly controlled by observers who can read their thoughts making its recovery difficult they are able to make it to vault in massive dynamic in part due to inability of observers to read etta s mind and successfully restore walter s memories they are however unaware that they have alerted fringe division still led by agent broyles lance reddick and observers to their presence a coordinated team instructed to shoot on sight is dispatched a more coherent walter explains that according to observer september observers made earth uninhabitable by 2609 and so traveled back in time to take over planet themselves as forces corner

bullet as a necklace production letters of transit was co written by consulting producer akiva goldsman and executive producers co showrunners jeff pinkner and j h wyman although it was previously reported goldsman would be directing executive producer joe chappelle ultimately directed installment observers are prominently featured in episode a mythos that has been visible since pilot previously a mysterious background presence according to noble they have now become incredibly centrally important to series storyline letters of transit was written and shot before series renewal for a fifth season but it was always envisioned as a genesis of season during this time wyman confirmed that a majority of fifth season would be set in 2036 following events of this episode a time period depicting observers as oppressors rather than as passive witnesses leading up to its broadcast journalists noted that nineteenth episode of each season of fringe has generally been its craziest hour and anticipated that letters of transit would be similarly strange fox network promoted episode with a series of four teaser videos each containing a clue to a fifth video revealing special opening credits for this episode episode contained a new opening credit sequence that helped set tone with fringe terms including community joy imagination and free will actor henry ian cusick and actress georgina haig guest starred in episode as a pair of federal agents cusick had worked with co creator j j abrams and executive producer pinkner on abc series lost cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with haig and john noble walter bishop and that story leaves a possibility for return of their characters in future noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve lead actors he explained that was walter with two really big important guest stars henry ian cusick and georgina haig it felt to me like it was a really strong episode two guest actors did a fantastic job which is not easy to do to step into an established company it is out of box and is somewhere else completely i think that fans will love it some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because henry ian cusick was such a big star in lost but also this new girl is just full of wonderful energy too according to noble letters of transit features his ninth version of walter bishop at that point in series he remarked it s a lot of fun as an actor because it keeps me trying to refine and to finish small parts of walter in a june 2012 interview with entertainment weekly noble called letters of transit one of his favorites of series explaining that he thought that was really a beautiful looking episode beautifully told cultural references given guest star henry ian cusick s prominence in lost letters of transit refers to both purge and natives two key elements of that show episode also contains references to prisoner where walter exclaims i am not a number i am a free man episode also references star wars when walter states these are not droids you re looking for and move along jeff jensen of entertainment weekly believed these helped set tone of episode fringe in 2036 was village writ global and under imperial rule matt roush of tv guide noted that episode title letters of transit alludes to a key element of film casablanca episode opens with scrolling text that has been compared to start of film blade runner reception ratings letters of transit first aired in united states on april 20 2012 an estimated 3 03 million viewers watched episode it earned a 1 0 ratings share among adults 18 49 a 10 percent increase from series low of previous week fringe finished third in its timeslot behind nbc s grimm and abc s primetime what would you do reviews ign s ramsey isler gave episode a mixed review noting that its concept is intriguing bold and extremely risky i m just not sure if it works it s such a drastic change of scenery and tone it s hard to say whether this is genius or madness isler observed that he would have absolutely loved episode if he had been given appropriate context through a suitable setup but approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point isler did find positive elements of episode however and rated it 8 out of 10 an indication of a great episode he praised walter s return to a much more confident focused man who s a bit scary in his determination and resolve as well as events that followed isler concluded that core ideas are really good but way new concepts were introduced seems haphazard and a huge gamble that could turn off all but most hardcore viewers like isler entertainment weekly columnist ken tucker enjoyed walter s transition from happy babbling i love lsd licorice licking walter to a walter who yelled at others when escaping calling it one of night s great pleasures tucker s entertainment weekly colleague jeff jensen commented that he was able to roll with some of less plausible plot details such as a still existing massive dynamic out of praise for guest stars cusick and haig believing they worked well in this world jensen also reserved attention for noble s scenes calling them variously frisky and poignant hilarious and touching lastly jensen was happy to find more details about observers but wondered at lack of parallel universe s mention mtv s alex zalben was more critical he wondered how episode fit into rest of season and wrote it s a curious step and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can t afford to lose them while disliking clunky dialogue zalben still commented that for a die hard fringe fan like myself this episode was crack huge emotion crazy science and epic set pieces end of episode had me dying to watch next one even if it isn t a direct continuation that s good television right there jeff jensen of entertainment weekly named letters of transit seventeenth best episode of series stating what at first seemed to be one of fringes nutty number 19s turned out to be episode that helped earn series a fifth and final year of course some may now question merits of ringing out series with a season long story set entirely in this future dystopia ruled by oppressive observers but single episode that introduced this premise was a cool jolt that opened a new front of fringe mythology and gave us a character that would have a lasting impact etta episode has been nominated for 2013 hugo award for best dramatic presentation short form olivia dunham of 100 episodes
