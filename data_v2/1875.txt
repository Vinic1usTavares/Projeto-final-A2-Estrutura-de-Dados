donatiello i also known as mirach s goblin is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in constellation andromeda located between 8 1 and 11 4 million light years from earth it is a possible satellite galaxy of dwarf lenticular galaxy ngc 404 mirach s ghost which is situated 60 arcminutes away it is otherwise one of most isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies known being separated from ngc 404 by around 211 000 light years galaxy is named after its discoverer amateur astrophotographer giuseppe donatiello who sighted galaxy in a 2016 review of his archival long exposures from 2010 and 2013 follow up observations with roque de los muchachos observatory led to a scientific paper on its discovery being published in december 2018 nomenclature donatiello i is named after its discoverer italian amateur astrophotographer giuseppe donatiello and is abbreviated to do i galaxy s nickname mirach s goblin is a reference to nearby dwarf lenticular galaxy ngc 404 with which it may be physically associated ngc 404 is nicknamed mirach s ghost due to its proximity to second magnitude star mirach characteristics donatiello i is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy at an estimated distance from earth between 2 5 and 3 5 megaparsecs or 8 1 and 11 4 million light years outside local group its luminosity is around 200 000 times greater than that of sun with an absolute magnitude of around 8 3 and a surface brightness of 26 magnitudes per negative square arcsecond its effective radius is roughly estimated to be 400 parsecs while its ellipticity is around 0 7 donatiello i is one of most isolated dwarf known and is a possible satellite galaxy of its nearest neighbor ngc 404 which is located around 65 kiloparsecs away from it or 211 000 light years donatiello i could have either been involved in or affected by a possible merger between ngc 404 and an irregular dwarf galaxy around 900 million years ago like similar dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting milky way galaxy and andromeda galaxy donatiello i is populated with metal poor red dwarfs with no active star formation occurring observation donatiello i lies in constellation andromeda at a right ascension of and declination of in j2000 epoch in galactic coordinate system it is located at a longitude of 127 65deg and a latitude of 28 it is situated 60 arcminutes away from mirach and 72 4 arcminutes away from ngc 404 its apparent diameter is roughly 60 arcseconds while its surface brightness is around 27 magnitudes per square arcsecond amateur astrophotographer giuseppe donatiello first sighted galaxy in 2016 while surveying an archived 6000 second exposure of an area around andromeda galaxy taken on 5 7 november 2010 and 5 october 2013 in national park with a custom built 12 7 centimeter telescope donatiello intended to capture stellar streams and dwarf galaxies around andromeda that had been reported at time discovery was corroborated using images from sloan digital sky survey s ninth data release which showed a faint object in same area and was announced by donatiello on 23 september 2016 via a post on facebook donatiello collaborated with a team led by david martinez delgado of heidelberg university after delgado had come across donatiello s post to make further observations of galaxy with roque de los muchachos observatory s galileo national telescope and gran telescopio canarias in la palma spain on 27 november 2016 team s scientific paper on discovery and their follow up observations was submitted to journal astronomy astrophysics in april 2018 and was accepted and published in december 2018 with a preprint released on arxiv in october further detailed observations with hubble space telescope have been suggested by paper s authors as a way to better determine galaxy s distance from earth and its relationship with ngc 404 along with donatiello i s size and mass see also list of galaxies named after people list of nearest galaxies references notes sources citations external links at simbad mirach s goblin discovery of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy behind andromeda galaxy 9px link alt freely accessible freely accessible at arxiv archived 21 february 2019 category andromeda constellation category astronomical objects discovered in 2016 category discoveries by amateur astronomers category dwarf spheroidal galaxies
