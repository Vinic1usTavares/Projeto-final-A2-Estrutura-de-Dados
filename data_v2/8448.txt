operation slapstick was code name for a british landing from sea at italian port of taranto during second world war operation one of three landings during allied invasion of italy in september 1943 was undertaken by airborne troops of british 1st airborne division commanded by major general george hopkinson planned at short notice mission followed an offer by italian government to open ports of taranto and brindisi on heel of italy to allies airborne division was selected to undertake mission but at time they were located in north africa a shortage of transport aircraft meant division could not land in their traditional way by parachute and glider and all landing craft in area were already allocated to other landings operation avalanche at salerno on western coast and operation baytown at calabria instead division had to be transported across mediterranean by ships of royal navy landing was unopposed and airborne division successfully captured ports of taranto and later brindisi on adriatic coast in working order only german forces in area were elements of 1st parachute division 1 fallschirmjager division which engaged advancing british in ambushes and at roadblocks during a fighting withdrawal north eventually by end of september british 1st airborne division advanced to foggia reinforcements from two infantry divisions had by then been landed behind them which allowed

western coast in operation avalanche with naples as their immediate objective allies hoped that invasion would persuade italian forces to surrender if they did five italian divisions in france and twenty nine in balkans would have to be replaced by german formations also if germans then decided to continue fight in italy they would have to redeploy some of their troops engaged on eastern front or on occupation duties in france blumenson p 26 during secret surrender negotiations with allies in early september italian government offered to open ports of taranto and brindisi on eastern coast german forces in that area were very weak and would be expected to withdraw rather than fight if allies landed there blumenson p 60 general dwight d eisenhower supreme allied commander in mediterranean quickly planned a third landing codenamed slapstick to take advantage of offer slapstick was in part an operation of deception to divert german forces away from main allied landings at salerno on same day while also attempting to capture taranto and brindisi intact blumenson p 94 main value of taranto was its large port its seizure would with expected capture of naples in west by americans give allies supply points on both italian coasts blumenson p 113 this military operation had a major political role since leaders of government including king vittorio emanuele iii and his
