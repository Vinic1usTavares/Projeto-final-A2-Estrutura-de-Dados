meteorological history of hurricane gustav spanned eleven days from august 25 to september 4 2008 tropical disturbance which eventually spawned hurricane gustav gathered on august 16 southwest of cape verde islands but was slow to develop as it trekked west across atlantic upon reaching warm waters of caribbean sea it began to organize and became a tropical depression on august 25 it quickly strengthened to a tropical storm and then a hurricane before making landfall on haiti s southwest peninsula gustav was severely disrupted by hispaniola s mountains and stalled disorganized in gulf of gonave between august 26 and 27 deep convection reformed storm s center southwest of haiti near jamaica s east coast under influence of a mid level ridge that extended from gulf of mexico to western atlantic ocean gustav picked up a westward motion it was briefly disrupted by jamaica as it passed over mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again reaching category 4 strength about 24 hours after having been upgraded to a hurricane gustav brushed isle of youth and made landfall on cuba s western s peninsula disrupted by mountains once again gustav never regained its former strength briefly traveling over a warm eddy of gulf stream s loop current it encountered moderate wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures fluctuations in its internal structure and visible appearance did not counter storm s general weakening trend and hurricane gustav made its final landfall as a category 2 hurricane near cocodrie louisiana on september 1 moving inland storm quickly weakened but persisted as a significant tropical depression until it was adsorbed by a frontal boundary on september 5 formation thumb gustav shortly after being named on august 25 on august 18 2008 a tropical wave which had left coast of africa five days previously developed into a significant low pressure area about west southwest of cape verde islands this wave moved westward across atlantic in conditions that were not favorable for development as it began to approach windward islands conditions improved and it showed some signs of organization but no circulation upon reaching windward islands on august 23 bringing showers thunderstorms and generally squally weather wind shear over system decreased and atmospheric conditions improved over eastern caribbean sea about south of santo domingo a low level circulation began to form hours later well defined curved bands and an improving circulation at surface warranted that system be designated a tropical depression depression formed a small inner wind core in diameter which allowed it to rapidly organize and on afternoon of august 25 it was upgraded to a tropical storm and first given name gustav a renewed period of disorganization proved to be very short lived and that night a well defined eye formed this eye was accompanied by strengthening as storm continued to move northwest towards haiti before reaching island gustav s strengthening pattern raised it to hurricane strength its prominent and organizing central dense overcast belied persistent strengthening which continued until hurricane gustav made landfall on haiti s southwest peninsula about west of jacmel at around 1800 utc on august 26 with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 992 mbar 29 29 inhg interaction with haiti and jamaica thumb left hurricane gustav making landfall in haiti on august 26 after making landfall near jacmel hurricane gustav began traversing northwestward across mountainous terrain of southwestern haiti dumping heavy rains as it passed with favorable atmospheric conditions storm maintained its hurricane intensity for several hours after landfall but high mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation eye because ragged and clouded over as gustav weakened to a tropical storm a large mid to upper level anticyclone over florida straight slowed gustav s movement holding it over northern coast of haiti s southern peninsula rainfall from storm which had been heavy since its landfall began to accumulate as storm s movement stalled although storm s upper levels began experiencing moderate shear and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with mountains of southwestern haiti enough of gustav s convection was over gulf of gonave that on morning of august 27 its organization started to improve that afternoon as a broad ridge extended from gulf of mexico into western atlantic ocean gustav began to slowly pull to west away from island of hispaniola increased shear weakened storm as building ridge to north of gustav imparted a southerly component to storm s motion northeasterly shear inhibited convection in northeast quadrant breaking up storm s existing center storm s center reformed to south east of jamaica around a flare of deep convection this new center was a little stronger than its previous one and gustav began moving southwest toward jamaica with its southerly reformation gustav had moved itself away from mountains of haiti and over warm waters of caribbean sea finding itself in a much more advantageous environment gustav restrengthened to continuing west under influence of same mid level ridge that had dominated its steering thus far gustav approached jamaica and its outer bands delivered heavy rains unwavering in its westward motion gustav made landfall on jamaica s eastern tip on august 28 at 1800 utc at just below hurricane strength it then moved across jamaica with its center on southern coast and its convection dragging across island s mountainous center fifteen hours after making landfall gustav s center moved off island s west coast and back over caribbean sea unlike its haitian landfall gustav s interaction with jamaica did not disturb its structure as it left island on morning of august 29 storm s diameter increased substantially and prominent banding features developed its low level center reorganized over open water and with little wind shear a strengthening pattern emerged which quickly returned gustav to hurricane status that afternoon western caribbean sea thumb gustav regain hurricane strength on august 29 after crossing island of jamaica having cleared disruptive landmass of jamaica hurricane gustav entered a period of sustained intensification within hours of leaving island storm regained hurricane status and first signs of an eye appeared convective bands and upper level outflow became well defined in all quadrants wind shear decreased and deep warm waters of caribbean sean provided perfect conditions for strengthening subtropical ridge over eastern gulf of mexico developed a weakness and as gustav approached cayman islands it was into this weakness that gustav was drawn as hurricane gustav tore through low lying cayman islands its wide eye became very well pronounced in early morning hours of august 30 and gustav continued to pass through cayman islands storm s winds increased to raising hurricane gustav to category 2 strength thumb left hurricane gustav near peak intensity on august 30 shortly before landfall on western cuba through morning hurricane gustav continued to rapidly strengthen deep convection around eye flared intensely and hurricane s minimum central pressure dropped precipitously 24 mbar 0 71 inhg in 24 hours by 1000 utc it had reached category 3 strength and continued to strengthen another drop in pressure down 11 mbar 0 32 inhg in 6 hours to 954 mbar 28 17 inhg was quickly followed by an increase in wind speed to making hurricane gustav a category 4 hurricane when it had been a mere tropical storm only 24 hours earlier that afternoon as hurricane gustav continued moving northwest towards cuba its western eyewall passed directly over isle of youth passing along eastern coast of isle of youth gustav wobbled slightly possibly result of an eyewall replacement cycle and strengthened even further here even as it brushed island hurricane gustav continued to strengthen making a brief landfall with a central pressure of 943 mbar 27 85 inhg and winds of its long term motion continued to be dominated by a mid level ridge over western atlantic and that evening with a central pressure of 941 mbar 27 79 inhg hurricane made landfall in western mainland cuba near los palacios at just under category 5 intensity bringing its winds onshore at a height of a gust was recorded which world meteorological organization confirmed to be strongest ever measured during a hurricane gulf of mexico thumb hurricane gustav approaching louisiana on august 31 displaying a partial eye and generally ragged structure after crossing cuba low mountains of western cuba disrupted hurricane gustav s low level circulation although it crosses island in only a few hours brief interaction caused storm s eye to partially cloud over and its wind speeds fell to as it entered that southeastern gulf of mexico that night through that night and into morning of august 31 it continued moving northwestward across gulf its winds weakening to as damage from its interaction with cuba continued to take its toll that morning eye which was expanding as storm weakened completely clouded over some mid to upper level dry air was drawn into cyclone and a trough to south added a slight vertical shear but these interferences were short lived under continued influence of ridge over western atlantic and southeastern united states hurricane gustav accelerated into central gulf here storm tracked over a warm eddy in loop current but high oceanic heat content failed to induce strengthening deep convection continued to be asymmetric and eyewall opened to southeast as wind speed continued to fall into category 2 status however by afternoon of august 31 hurricane s ragged appearance began to improve eye returned properly and its minimum central pressure fell even as its outer bands came ashore on northern gulf coast its asymmetric appearance improved and its wind radius expanded but by that night gustav had moved off eddy of loop current and over slightly cooler water it could not restrengthen here despite its more impressive presentation in pre dawn hours of september 1 while from gulf coast hurricane s wind field expanded and tropical storm force winds extended from its center dry air intrusion from south broke up hurricane s eye completely dissolving eyewall as heavy rain bands came ashore in state of louisiana as eye approached louisiana coast storm weakened to 105 mph making landfall near cocodrie louisiana at 1430 utc eye briefly reformed but was not associated with any strengthening dissipation thumb left hurricane gustav on september 1 about 4 hours after landfall eye has already been cloud filled after landfall hurricane continued moving northwestward at mid level ridge over southeastern united states which had dominated gustav s steering for last few days drifted northward pulling hurricane with it moving further inland hurricane gustav continued to weaken while delivering torrential rains to central gulf coast of united states eye that had cleared during landfall filled in that afternoon and was replaced by a central dense overcast that night 12 hours after landfall gustav weakened to a tropical storm with winds of thumb radar image of remnants of gustav reaching southern wisconsin on september 5 slipping below tropical storm strength following morning gustav s previously firm steering currents began to erode and its forward motion slowed as storm crept through northwest louisiana on september 2 its heavy rainfall began to accumulate in region as storm continued northwestward though intersection of arkansas louisiana texas and oklahoma and into arkansas proper its forward motion slowed considerably and it dumped isolated rainfall accumulations in excess of through morning of september 3 tropical depression gustav briefly drifted north northeastward under very weak steering currents but stalled completely over southwestern arkansas that afternoon and spread heavy rain into mid mississippi valley by evening steering currents returned and gustav picked up speed to northeast at moving even more rapidly gustav left mississippi valley and headed towards ohio valley next morning as it passed through missouri gustav began to gain extratropical characteristics as it merged with a frontal boundary extratropical transition was completed on afternoon of september 4 as gustav s remnant low was moving over st louis missouri although no longer a tropical system remnants of gustav continued to bring wind and rain to northern united states that evening still traveling northeastward remnants dropped of rain on illinois and its widespread remnant low produced trace rainfall stretching from iowa to indiana by nightfall on september 4 remnants had reached southwest michigan where they dumped rain until next morning with accumulations as high as storm s circulation remained intact through wisconsin where it dropped almost of rainfall some of gustav s more northerly remnants even drifted into minnesota where they dropped small amounts of rain on september 5 storm s extratropical remnants were absorbed by a larger extratropical low moving through great lakes see also hurricane gustav tropical cyclone list of
