national flag of bhutan is one of national symbols of bhutan flag is based upon tradition of drukpa lineage of tibetan buddhism and features druk thunder dragon of bhutanese mythology basic design of flag by choying dorji dates to 1947 a version was displayed in 1949 at signing of indo bhutan treaty a second version was introduced in 1956 for visit of druk gyalpo jigme dorji wangchuk to eastern bhutan it was based upon photos of its 1949 predecessor and featured a white druk in place of green original bhutanese subsequently redesigned their flag to match measurements of flag of india which they believed fluttered better than their own other modifications such as changing red background color to orange led to current design in use since 1969 national assembly of bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize flag s design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying flag origins historically bhutan is known by numerous names but bhutanese call country druk after name of bhutanese thunder dragon this tradition dates to 1189 when tsangpa gyare yeshe dorje founder of drukpa lineage of tibetan buddhism was in tibet where he reportedly witnessed valley glowing with rainbow and light considering this an auspicious sign he entered valley to choose a site for construction of a monastery whereupon he heard three peals of thunder a sound produced by druk dragon according to popular bhutanese belief monastery that tsangpa gyare built that year was named druk sewa and his school of teaching became known as druk druk school later split into three lineages one of these three drukpa was founded by tsangpa gyare s nephew and spiritual heir dharma and afterward spread throughout bhutan nation itself would also later become known as druk this legend offers one explanation for how symbolism of dragon came to form basis of national flag of bhutan an alternative hypothesis maintains that notion of symbolizing sovereign and state in form of a dragon emerged in neighboring china and was adopted by rulers of bhutan as a symbol of royalty in early 20th century current national flag design current flag is divided diagonally from lower hoist side corner with upper triangle yellow and lower triangle orange centred along dividing line is a large black and white dragon facing away from hoist side dragon is holding a or jewel in each of its claws background colours of flag yellow and orange are identified as pantone 116 and 165 respectively equivalents of these shades and white of druk are specified by various other codes according

hand accounts obtained through interviews with individuals personally involved in creation and modification of flag in bhutan from late 1940s until adoption of current flag around 1970 this report is therefore a significant primary source for information about history of bhutanese flag but in description of flag from 1949 document is not in complete accord with photos of flag as discussed below

surviving from 1949 it describes flag as square while proportions of flag in photographs appear closer to 4 5 document describes dragon as facing fly end while dragon visible in photos faces hoist dragon is described as parallel to fly meaning according to a diagram in document parallel to length along bottom edge of flag while dragon in photos appears to have a slightly rising vertical slant
