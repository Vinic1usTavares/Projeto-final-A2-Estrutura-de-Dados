petropavlovsk class sometimes referred to as poltava class was a group of three pre dreadnought battleships built for imperial russian navy during 1890s they were transferred to pacific squadron shortly after their completion in 1899 1900 and were based at port arthur before start of russo japanese war of 1904 1905 all three ships participated in battle of port arthur on second day of war sank two months after war began after striking one or more mines laid by japanese her two sister ships and took part in battle of yellow sea in august 1904 and were sunk or scuttled during final stages of siege of port arthur in early 1905 poltava was salvaged after japanese captured port arthur and incorporated into imperial japanese navy ship renamed tango in japanese service participated in battle of tsingtao in late 1914 during world war i she was sold back to russians in 1916 and renamed chesma as her original name was in use by another battleship ship became flagship of russian arctic flotilla in 1917 and her crew supported bolsheviks later that year chesma was seized by british in early 1918 when they intervened in russian civil war abandoned by them when they withdrew and scrapped by soviets in 1924 background and description thumb left 250px corrected right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1902 tsar alexander iii s ambitious building programme of 1882 called for construction of 16 battleships in 20 years for baltic fleet by 1890 program was behind schedule and director of naval ministry vice admiral proposed that six first class and four second class battleships be built together with some armored coast defense ships to make up numbers required petropavlovsk class ships were designed as first class battleships to meet his requirement for a heavily armored ship that displaced and had a speed of a maximum draught of and a range of with good seakeeping qualities design began as an enlarged and improved version of battleship but with her main armament of four guns mounted in lighter barbettes rather than heavy gun turrets of older ship based on experience with in which casemate mounted secondary armament could often not be worked in rough weather naval technical committee ntc adopted layout of american s with secondary armament mounted in turrets on upper deck use of lighter barbette mounting allowed for a flush deck hull which gave design high freeboard it was approved in january 1891 by ntc with a displacement of and a full length waterline armor belt design was intended to have a maximum speed of 17 knots using forced draft but model testing of hull showed that it could only reach rather than delay construction by redesigning hull navy accepted slower speed development of quick firing qf gun meant that an upper belt of armor was necessary and weight required was gained by shortening waterline armor belt which left ships ends protected only by sloping armor deck other changes included replacement of barbettes with turrets of same type as used in battleship and substitution of qf guns for original guns this last change saved enough weight to permit four more six inch guns to be added petropavlovsk class ships were long overall had a beam of and a draught of designed to displace they were overweight and actually displaced ships were first flush decked battleships built for navy they had a partial double bottom and hull was divided by 10 watertight transverse bulkheads a centerline bulkhead divided machinery spaces upper part of hull between main and upper decks curved inwards tumblehome petropavlovsks had a designed metacentric height of and were good seagoing ships their crew consisted of 26 27 officers and 605 25 enlisted men petropavlovsk had a crew of 750 when serving as a flagship ships were powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines each driving one propeller using steam generated by 14 cylindrical boilers at a working pressure of unlike her sisters sevastopol had 16 boilers engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of 16 knots poltava and petropavlovsk used turbines and boilers imported from britain and slightly exceeded their specifications during their sea trials ships reached maximum speeds of from respectively sevastopol using domestically built machinery only reached a speed of from despite extra boilers naval ministry chose not to exercise penalty provisions of contract for failing to attain design speed because it had specified machinery to be used petropavlovsks carried a maximum of of coal which allowed them to steam for at a speed of armament main armament of petropavlovsk class consisted of four 40 caliber 12 inch guns mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft of superstructure they used hydraulic power for loading and traversing but ammunition hoists were electrically powered designed to fire one shell every 90 seconds rate of fire of guns in service proved to be one round every three minutes structure of turrets proved to be too weak to withstand extra strength charges and had to be reinforced guns could elevate to a maximum of 15deg and traverse 270deg each was provided with 58 rounds they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of this gave them a range of at an elevation of 10deg secondary armament of ships consisted of a dozen 45 caliber qf canet model 1892 six inch guns eight of these were mounted in four twin gun turrets on upper deck and remaining four guns were on pedestal mounts in unarmored embrasures in sides of hull one deck below and between turrets electric motors traversed turrets and worked ammunition hoists but guns were elevated manually they had a 135deg arc of fire and guns could elevate to a maximum of 15deg and depress to 5deg rate of fire of turret mounted guns was generally only about half that two to three rounds per minute of pedestal mounted guns motors and mechanism of ammunition hoists were troublesome and sometimes reduced rate of fire down to one round per minute guns in hull could traverse 100deg and each six inch gun was provided with 200 rounds their muzzle velocity of gave their shells a maximum range of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats these included a dozen quick firing qf hotchkiss guns in hull embrasures and on superstructure they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of twenty eight smaller maxim qf guns were positioned in hull embrasures on superstructure and in fighting tops they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of petropavlovsk class ships carried four torpedo tubes all above water mounted on broadside and two broadside underwater tubes forward 15 inch tubes were near forward main gun turret and were unprotected by any armor aft 15 inch tubes were protected by upper armor belt underwater tubes were protected underneath armor deck forward of forward 12 inch magazine each ship also carried 50 mines to be laid to protect its anchorage in remote areas ships were fitted with liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship usually waterline and crow s nest to estimate range gunnery officer consulted his references to get range and calculated proper elevation and deflection required to hit target he transmitted his commands via a geisler electro mechanical fire control transmission system to each gun or turret protection russian armor plate industry had not yet mastered process for forming thick steel plates so armor for these ships was ordered from companies in germany and united states even they could not produce enough of latest types of armor plate in quantities required for all three ships petropavlovsk had ordinary nickel steel while sevastopol used harvey armor and poltava was fitted with latest krupp armor thicknesses of armor plates varied in an attempt to equalize their effectiveness in petropavlovsk maximum thickness of waterline armor belt over machinery spaces was which reduced to 12 inches abreast magazines and tapered to a thickness of 8 inches at its bottom edge in other two ships it was thick over machinery spaces over magazines and at its lower edge belt covered of ships length and was high of which upper was intended to be above waterline it terminated in transverse bulkheads thick fore and aft leaving ends of ships unprotected above waterline belt was an upper strake of armor that ran between turret bases seven and a half feet high ends of upper belt were closed off by five inch angled transverse bulkheads that connected ends of upper belt to turret support tubes armor of main gun turrets and their supporting tubes was 10 inches thick krupp armor in poltava nickel steel in other two with roofs thick turrets of secondary armament had 5 inch sides with roofs six inch guns in hull embrasures were unprotected sides of conning tower were 9 inches thick while armor deck in central citadel was 2 inches thick outside area covered by belt armor flat portion of deck was thick while sloped portion was thick ships ship namesake builder laid down launched entered service fate petropavlovsk battle of petropavlovsk galernyi island shipyard saint petersburg 19 may 1892 9

flagship of russia was destroyed by torpedo of our navy and admiral makaroff drowned petropavlovsk was first of sisters to enter service she departed kronstadt on 17 october 1899 and reached port arthur on 10 may 1900 upon her arrival she became flagship of pacific squadron commander vice admiral nikolai skrydlov ship supported international efforts to suppress boxer rebellion in mid 1900 poltava and sevastopol departed for port arthur on 15 october 1900 and arrived on 12 and 13 april 1901 respectively petropavlovsk was flagship of vice admiral oskar stark at beginning of russo japanese war in february 1904 during battle of port arthur on second day of war poltava was hit twice in aft hull petropavlovsk was hit three times in bow and sevastopol was hit once between them sisters had two men killed and seven wounded and were not significantly damaged none of them made any hits on japanese ships naval ministry relieved stark and he was replaced by vice admiral stepan makarov who assumed command on 7 march on 31 march petropavlovsk and poltava sortied to support russian cruisers and destroyers engaging their japanese counterparts but they headed back to port arthur to join rest of pacific squadron when main japanese battlefleet appeared they ran into a newly laid minefield en route and petropavlovsk struck at least one of mines sinking in less than two minutes casualties included admiral makarov and his guest war artist vasily vereshchagin 26 other officers and 652 enlisted men only 7 officers and 73 crewmen were rescued new commander vice admiral wilgelm vitgeft made an attempt to lead pacific squadron to vladivostok on 23 june but abandoned sortie when squadron was discovered and pursued by japanese while returning to port arthur sevastopol struck a mine and ship took on an estimated of water despite flooding she was able to keep up with fleet and reached port successfully while under repair which lasted until 9 july a fire broke out aboard ship killing 2 crewmen and injuring another 28 all of 47 and 37 millimeter guns in lower hull embrasures were removed from poltava and sevastopol during this time some were remounted on superstructure but others were used to reinforce land defenses of port arthur vitgeft made another attempt to break through japanese blockade on 10 august in obedience to a direct order from tsar nicholas ii squadron was spotted relatively quickly and japanese main fleet intercepted russians in early afternoon in resulting battle of yellow sea poltava and sevastopol were last battleships in russian column and former slowed by engine problems became primary target of japanese battleships and armored cruisers when vitgeft maneuvered squadron past japanese and forced them into a stern chase shortly before sunset a lucky hit killed vitgeft and threw squadron into confusion russian second in command rear admiral prince pavel ukhtomsky eventually gained control of squadron and led most of ships back to port arthur poltava was hit by 12 14 large caliber shells and lost 12 crewmen killed and 43 wounded sevastopol was hit by several shells that killed 1 and wounded 62 crewmen thumb a japanese postcard showing wreck of poltava at port arthur on 23 august sevastopol sortied to bombard japanese troops and struck a mine near her forward magazines while returning to port she was badly damaged and three of her magazines were flooded ship was towed back into port arthur and her repairs lasted until 6 november in meantime new squadron commander rear admiral robert viren decided to use men and guns of pacific squadron to reinforce defenses of port arthur and even more guns were stripped from squadron s ships by september poltava had dismounted three 6 inch four 47 and twenty six 37 millimeter guns and sevastopol lost one 47 and twenty six 37 millimeter guns both ships were lightly damaged by shells in october when imperial japanese army s siege guns began firing blindly into harbor capture of hill 203 which overlooked harbor on 5 december allowed them to fire directly at russian ships and poltava was sunk in shallow water that same day by a shell that started a fire in a magazine that eventually exploded by 7 december all of russian battleships except sevastopol had been sunk and ship s captain nikolai essen anchored her under guns of remaining coast defense guns outside harbor he rigged torpedo nets and laid a minefield around his ship that thwarted repeated attacks until 16 december when one torpedo struck ship in stern during a blinding snowstorm badly damaged sevastopol was towed to deep water about two weeks later when port arthur surrendered on 2 january 1905 and scuttled thumb tango at anchor about 1908 1909 poltava was subsequently raised repaired and reclassified as a first class coastal defense ship in imperial japanese navy renamed tango dan hou she served as a gunnery training ship and participated in siege of tsingtao at beginning of world war i she was sold back to russia in march 1916 as countries were now allies against central powers and arrived in vladivostok on 2 april 1916 renamed chesma chesma because her original name was being used by a ship arrived in port said egypt on 19 september and later supported efforts to intimidate greek government into supporting allied operations in macedonia she arrived at on 16 january 1917 after a brief refit in birkenhead and became flagship of arctic flotilla her crew joined bolsheviks in october 1917 and chesma was captured by british in murmansk in march 1918 during allied intervention in russian civil war ship was already in poor condition and british immobilized her when they departed russia in october 1919 she was stricken from navy list on 3 july 1924 and subsequently scrapped notes
