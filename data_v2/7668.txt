off pitch after a moment s pause in 2009 it was described as an astonishing moment drawing criticism from england s angus fraser who objected to him being canonised simply for not cheating and from others who thought that he walked almost by accident that having played his shot he overbalanced in direction of pavilion his actions nevertheless drew praise from majority in final india elected to field first and gilchrist hammered 57 from 48 balls featuring in a century opening stand with hayden to seize initiative this laid foundation for australia s 2 359 and a crushing 125 run win ending an

ended his final series with 322 runs at 32 20 playing style thumb gilchrist standing up to shane warne in 2005 andrew strauss is batsman gilchrist s attacking batting has been a key part of australia s one day success as he usually opened batting he was a part of successful 1999 2003 and 2007 cricket world cup campaigns gilchrist s test batting average in upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket keeper he is currently 45th on all time list of highest batting averages he maintains a test strike rate of 82 runs per hundred balls highest since balls were recorded in full his combination of

keeper darren berry is best australian wicket keeper of 1990s and early 2000s gilchrist attributed his batting techniques from early trainings with his father where he would train to defend shots sometimes only gripping bat with his top right hand and would end a session to simply play attacking shots with tennis balls to end on a positive and fun note he also has naturally adopted a high grip where both hands are closer to end of handle for more top hand control gilchrist successfully kept wicket for fast bowlers glenn mcgrath and brett lee for most of his international career his partnerships with mcgrath and lee are second and fourth respectively in both test and odi history for number of wickets taken with alec stewart and mark boucher he shares record for most catches 6 by

most successful odi wicket keeper with 472 dismissals 417 catches and 55 stumpings more than 80 dismissals ahead of his closest rival mark boucher this record was surpassed seven years later by kumar sangakkara walking and discipline it is unusual for professional batsmen to walk that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave field of play without waiting for or contrary to an umpire s decision gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high profile match 2003 world cup semi final against sri lanka after umpire ruled him to be not out he has since proclaimed himself to be a walker or a batsman who will consistently walk and has done so on numerous occasions on one occasion against bangladesh gilchrist walked but tv replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and ball without such contact he could not have been caught out gilchrist s actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires ricky ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not while no other australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers lower order batsmen jason gillespie and michael both walked during test matches in india in 2004 in 2004 new zealand captain stephen fleming accused gilchrist of conducting a walking crusade when craig mcmillan refused to walk after gilchrist had caught him off an edge from bowling of jason gillespie in first test in brisbane after appeal was turned down by umpire who did not hear edge gilchrist goaded mcmillan about edge and mcmillan s angry response was picked up by stump microphone not everyone is walking gilly not everyone has to walk mate taunt was effective however as mcmillan perhaps distracted missed next ball and was given out leg before wicket gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had zero support in team for his stance and that he felt that topic made dressing room uncomfortable gilchrist pp 578 579 he added that he felt isolated and silently accused of betraying team implicitly i was made to feel selfish as if i was walking for sake of my own clean image
