ficus macrophylla commonly known as moreton bay fig or australian banyan is a large evergreen banyan tree of family moraceae native to eastern australia from wide bay burnett region in north to illawarra in new south wales as well as lord howe island its common name is derived from moreton bay in queensland australia it is best known for its imposing buttress roots as ficus macrophylla is a strangler fig seed germination usually takes place in canopy of a host tree and seedling lives as an epiphyte until its roots establish contact with ground it then enlarges and strangles its host eventually becoming a freestanding tree by itself individuals may reach in height large leathery dark green leaves are long fruit is small round and greenish ripening and turning purple at any time of year it is known as a syconium an inverted inflorescence with flowers lining an internal cavity like all figs it has an obligate mutualism with fig wasps figs are pollinated only by fig wasps and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers many species of bird including pigeons parrots and various passerines eat fruit ficus macrophylla is widely used as a feature tree in public parks and gardens in warmer climates such as california portugal italy spain northern new zealand auckland and australia old specimens can reach tremendous size its aggressive root system renders it unsuitable for all but largest private gardens taxonomy south african botanist christiaan hendrik persoon published a formal description of moreton bay fig in his 1807 work synopsis plantarum material having been reported by french botanist rene louiche desfontaines in 1804 type specimen has been lost but was possibly located in florence specific epithet macrophylla is derived from ancient greek makros large and leaf and refers to size of leaves in early 19th century italian botanist vincenzo tineo of orto botanico di palermo in sicily obtained a plant from a french nursery that grew to a prodigious size with a banyan habit this form was propagated and grown in gardens around sicily a later director of gardens antonino described it as ficus magnolioides in 1897 distinguishing it from f macrophylla on account of its larger leaves with greener undersides this name was widely used in europe australian botanist charles moore described ficus columnaris in 1870 from material collected from lord howe island choosing species name from latin columnaris for column like roots english botanist e j h corner reduced this to synonymy with f macrophylla in 1965 before p s green noted it was distinct enough for subspecies status in 1986 australian botanist dale j dixon reviewed material and felt differences too minor to warrant subspecific status and recognised two forms ficus macrophylla f macrophylla a free standing tree endemic to mainland australia and ficus macrophylla f columnaris a hemiepiphyte lacking a distinct main trunk and endemic to lord howe island review of f magnolioides by silvio and francesco maria raimondo found that it was f macrophylla f columnaris species is generally commonly known as moreton bay fig after moreton bay in southern queensland although it is found elsewhere an alternate name black fig is derived from dark colour of ageing bark with over 750 species ficus is one of largest angiosperm genera based on morphology corner divided genus into four subgenera later expanded to six in this classification moreton bay fig was placed in subseries malvanthereae series malvanthereae section malvanthera of subgenus urostigma in his reclassification of australian malvanthera dixon altered delimitations of series within section but left this species in series malvanthereae in 2005 dutch botanist cornelis berg completed corner s treatment of moraceae for flora malesiana completion of that work had been delayed since 1972 as a result of disagreements between corner and c j j g van editor of flora malesiana berg combined sections stilpnophyllum and malvanthera into an expanded section stilpnophyllum this left moreton bay fig in subsection malvanthera section stilpnophyllum in a 2008 study on dna sequences from nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers danish botanist nina ronsted and colleagues rejected previous subdivisions of malvanthera instead they divided section malvanthera into three subsections malvantherae platypodeae and in this system moreton bay fig is in subsection malvantherae along with f malvantherae appear to be basal an early offshoot to group f macrophylla form macrophylla is native to mainland australia while form columnaris of macrophylla colonised lord howe island section malvanthera itself is thought to have evolved 41 million years ago and radiated around 35 million years ago description thumb left a moreton bay fig in piazza marina palermo biggest of europe aerial roots thicken into columns after reaching ground moreton bay fig is an evergreen tree that can reach heights of trunk can be massive with thick prominent buttressing and reach a diameter of rough bark is grey brown and marked with various blemishes lord howe form of moreton bay fig has a habit of dropping aerial roots from its branches which upon reaching ground thicken into supplementary trunks which help to support weight of its crown it is a rainforest plant and in this environment more often grows in form of an epiphytic strangler vine than that of a tree when its seeds land in branch of a host tree it sends aerial strangler roots down host trunk eventually killing host and standing alone it is monoecious each tree bears functional male and female flowers as indicated by its specific epithet it has large elliptic leathery dark green leaves long and they are arranged alternately on stems leaves and branches bleed a milky sap if cut or broken figs are in diameter turning from green to purple with lighter spots as they ripen ripe fruit may be found year round although they are more abundant from february to may distribution and habitat thumb emergent moreton bay fig in situ estimated 50 metres tall davis scrub nature reserve australia moreton bay fig is a native of eastern coastal australia from wide bay burnett region in central queensland to shoalhaven river on new south wales south coast it is found in subtropical warm temperate and dry rainforest where as an emergent tree its crown may tower above canopy particularly along watercourses on alluvial soils in sydney region f macrophylla grows from sea level to 300 m 1000 ft altitude in areas with an average yearly rainfall of it often grows with trees such as white argyrodendron flindersia species giant stinging tree dendrocnide excelsa discolor red cedar toona ciliata hoop pine araucaria cunninghamii green leaved fig ficus watkinsiana and cryptocarya obovata soils it grows on are high in nutrients and include bumbo and sandstone as rainforests were cleared isolated specimens were left standing in fields as remnant trees valued for their shade and shelter for livestock one such tree was a landmark for and gave its name to wollongong suburb of in new south wales ecology thumb large moreton bay fig tree in balboa park san diego huge numbers of fruit produced by moreton bay fig make it a key source of food in rainforest it is an important food to green catbird ailuroedus crassirostris as well as fruit eating pigeons such as wompoo fruit dove ptilinopus magnificus and topknot pigeon lopholaimus antarcticus and a sometime food of rose crowned fruit dove ptilinopus regina other bird species that eat fruit include yellow eyed cuckoo shrike pied currawong strepera graculina australasian figbird sphecotheres vieilloti regent bowerbird sericulus chrysocephalus satin bowerbird ptilonorhynchus violaceus and lewin s honeyeater meliphaga lewinii fruit bats such as grey headed flying fox pteropus poliocephalus also feed on fruit as well as pollinating fig wasp pleistodontes froggatti syconia of moreton bay fig are host to several species of non pollinating wasps including sycoscapter australis and sp nematode species schistonchus macrophylla and schistonchus altermacrophylla are found in syconia where they parasitise p thrips species gynaikothrips australis feeds on underside of new leaves of f macrophylla as well as those of f rubiginosa and f obliqua as plant cells die nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue and a gall results and leaves become distorted and curl over thrips begin feeding when tree has flushes of new growth and life cycle is around six weeks at other times thrips reside on old leaves without feeding species pupates sheltered in bark thrips remain in galls at night and wander about in daytime and return in evening possibly to different galls about tree stressed trees can also be attacked by psyllids to point of defoliation grubs hatch from eggs laid on edges of leaves and burrow into leaf to suck nutrients tree s own latex shielding insect caterpillars of moth species can strip trees of their leaves tree is also a host for longhorn beetle species fungal pathogen brown root rot phellinus has infected and killed this species reproduction and life span thumb right pleistodontes froggatti fig wasp that pollinates moreton bay fig figs have an obligate mutualism with fig wasps figs are pollinated only by fig wasps and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers generally each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species to reproduce mainland and lord howe populations of moreton bay fig are both pollinated by pleistodontes froggatti as is case with all figs fruit is actually an inverted inflorescence known as a syconium with tiny flowers arising from inner surface ficus macrophylla is monoecious both male and female flowers are found on same plant and in fact in same fruit although they mature at different times female wasps enter syconium and lay eggs in female flowers as they mature these eggs later hatch and progeny mate females of new generation collect pollen from male flowers which have matured by this point and leave to visit other syconia and repeat process a field study in brisbane found that f macrophylla trees often bore both male and female syconia at same time which could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations such as those on islands same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through winter showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species f macrophylla itself can endure cooler climates than other fig species moreton bay fig trees live for over 100 years in wild potentially invasive species thumb right a young moreton bay fig starts life as an epiphyte in an auckland new zealand park ficus macrophylla is commonly cultivated in hawaii and in northern new zealand in both places it has now naturalised having acquired its pollinating wasp pleistodontes froggatti in hawaii wasp was deliberately introduced in 1921 and in new zealand it was first recorded in 1993 having apparently arrived by long distance dispersal from australia arrival of wasp led to prolific production of fruits containing many small seeds adapted for dispersal by birds moreton bay fig has been found growing on both native and introduced trees in new zealand and in hawaii size and vigour of this fig in new zealand and its lack of natural enemies as well as its immunity to possum browsing indicate that it may be able to invade forest and other native plant communities occasional garden escapees have been recorded in turkey uses moreton bay fig has been widely used in public parks in frost free areas and was popular with early settlers of australia around beginning of 20th century director of royal botanic gardens in sydney joseph maiden advocated planting of street trees generally uniform rows of one species he recommended moreton bay figs be spaced at intervals far enough to avoid crowding as trees matured but close enough so that their branches would eventually interlock specimens can reach massive proportions and have thrived in drier climates impressive specimen trees have been grown in waring gardens in deniliquin and in hay they can withstand light frosts and can cope with salt laden spray in coastal situations and their fruit is beneficial for urban wildlife however their huge size precludes use in all but largest gardens and their roots are highly invasive and can damage piping and disrupt footpaths and roadways vast quantities of crushed fruit can be messy on ground figs are edible but unpalatable and dry especially due to their tendency for root buttressing they are frequently seen as bonsai although they are much more suited to larger styles as their large leaves do not reduce much in size and their stems have long intervals spaces between successive leaves it can be used as an indoor plant in medium to brightly lit indoor spaces soft light timber has a wavy texture and is used for cases aboriginal people traditionally used fibres for fishing nets notable specimens thumb left trunk of f macrophylla at orto botanico di palermo showing buttressed roots large specimens of moreton bay fig trees are found in many parks and properties throughout eastern and northeastern australia brisbane melbourne and sydney botanical gardens contain numerous specimens planted in middle of 19th century these trees are up to 35 metres 115 ft tall at mount keira near wollongong there is a moreton bay fig measured at tall a notable tree in sydney suburb of randwick 150 year old tree of knowledge was controversially cut down in 2016 to make way for cbd and south east light rail there are many large specimens in new zealand a moreton bay fig at pahi on kaipara harbour northland was measured in 1984 as high and wide and in 2011 had a girth of moreton bay fig was introduced into cultivation into california in united states in 1870s 13 specimens being classified as exceptional trees of los angeles in 1980 tallest ficus macrophylla in north america is adjacent to san diego s natural history museum and was planted in 1914 by 1996 it stood high and across widest moreton bay fig in north america is santa barbara s moreton bay fig tree it was planted in 1876 reportedly by a young girl who was given a seedling by an australian sailor it measures across aoyama tree stands between japanese american national museum and temporary contemporary downtown in los angeles it was planted by buddhist japanese americans in early 20th century two south african specimens in gardens in claremont and pretoria zoo respectively have widest and second widest canopies of any single stemmed trees in country pretoria specimen was planted before 1899 and was tall with a canopy width of by 2012 there is a notable specimen sprawling on steps at botanical garden of university of coimbra portugal
