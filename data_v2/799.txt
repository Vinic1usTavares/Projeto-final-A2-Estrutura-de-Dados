columbian mammoth mammuthus columbi is an extinct species of mammoth that inhabited north america as far north as northern united states and as far south as costa rica during pleistocene epoch it was one of last in a line of mammoth species beginning with mammuthus subplanifrons in early pliocene columbian mammoth evolved from steppe mammoth which entered north america from asia about 1 5 million years ago pygmy mammoths of channel islands of california evolved from columbian mammoths closest extant relative of columbian and other mammoths is asian elephant reaching at shoulders and in weight columbian mammoth was one of largest species of mammoth it had long curved tusks and four molars which were replaced six times during lifetime of an individual it most likely used its tusks and trunk like modern elephants for manipulating objects fighting and foraging bones hair dung and stomach contents have been discovered but no preserved carcasses are known columbian mammoth preferred open areas such as parkland landscapes and fed on sedges grasses and other plants it did not live in arctic regions of canada which were instead inhabited by woolly mammoths ranges of two species may have overlapped and genetic evidence suggests that they interbred several sites contain skeletons of multiple columbian mammoths either because they died in incidents such as a drought or because these locations were natural traps in which individuals accumulated over time for a few thousand years prior to their extinction columbian mammoths coexisted in north america with paleoamericans first humans to inhabit americas who hunted them for food used their bones for making tools and depicted them in ancient art columbian mammoth remains have been found in association with clovis culture artifacts these remains may have stemmed either from hunting or scavenging columbian mammoth disappeared at end of pleistocene around 11 500 years ago most likely as a result of habitat loss caused by climate change hunting by humans or a combination of both taxonomy thumb left alt large mammoth tooth 1863 lithograph of partial holotype molar from georgia columbian mammoth was first scientifically described in 1857 by naturalist hugh falconer who named species elephas columbi after explorer christopher columbus animal was brought to falconer s attention in 1846 by charles lyell who sent him molar fragments found during 1838 excavation of brunswick altamaha canal in georgia in southeastern united states at time similar fossils from across north america were attributed to woolly mammoths then elephas primigenius falconer found that his specimens were distinct confirming his conclusion by examining their internal structure and studying additional molars from mexico although scientists william phipps blake and richard owen believed that e was more appropriate for species falconer rejected name he also suggested that e imperator and e two other american elephants described from molars were based on remains too fragmentary to classify properly more complete material that may be from same quarry as falconer s fragmentary holotype molar which is cataloged as specimen bmnh at british museum of natural history was reported in 2012 and could help shed more light on that specimen since doubts about its adequacy as a holotype have been raised in early 20th century taxonomy of extinct elephants became increasingly complicated in 1942 paleontologist henry fairfield osborn s posthumous monograph on proboscidea was published wherein he used various generic and names that had previously been proposed for extinct elephant species such as archidiskodon parelephas and osborn also retained names for many regional and intermediate subspecies or varieties and created such as parelephas columbi felicis and archidiskodon imperator maibeni taxonomic situation was simplified by various researchers from 1970s onwards all species of mammoth were retained in genus mammuthus and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as intraspecific variation in 2003 paleontologist larry agenbroad reviewed opinions about north american mammoth taxonomy and concluded that several species had been declared junior synonyms and that m columbi columbian mammoth and m exilis pygmy mammoth were only species of mammoth endemic to americas as other species lived both there and in eurasia idea that species such as m imperator imperial mammoth and m jefferson s mammoth were either more primitive or advanced stages in columbian mammoth evolution was largely dismissed and they were regarded as synonyms in spite of these conclusions agenbroad cautioned that american mammoth taxonomy is not yet fully resolved evolution thumb alt skeleton of a mammoth with long curved tusks one of largest mounted mammoth skeletons in world nicknamed archie at nebraska state museum of natural history is type specimen of junior synonym archidiskodon imperator maibeni earliest known members of proboscidea clade that contains elephants existed about 55 million years ago around tethys sea area closest living relatives of proboscidea are sirenians dugongs and manatees and hyraxes an order of small herbivorous mammals family elephantidae existed six million years ago in africa and includes living elephants and mammoths among many now extinct clades mastodon mammut is only a distant relative and part of distinct family which diverged 25 million years before mammoths evolved asian elephant elephas maximus is closest extant relative of mammoths following cladogram shows placement of columbian mammoth among other proboscideans based on characteristics of hyoid bone in neck since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities reconstructing evolutionary history of genus is possible through morphological studies mammoth species can be identified from number of enamel ridges or lamellar plates on their molars primitive species had few ridges and number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items crowns of teeth became taller in height and skulls became taller to accommodate this at same time skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce weight of head short tall skulls of woolly and columbian mammoths are culmination of this process thumb left alt four archeologists excavating a mammoth skeleton excavation of a pygmy mammoth which evolved from columbian mammoths on channel islands of california first known members of genus mammuthus are african species m subplanifrons from pliocene and m from pleistocene former is thought to be ancestor of later forms mammoths entered europe around 3 million years ago earliest european mammoth has been named m it spread across europe and china only its molars are known which show that it had 8 10 enamel ridges a population evolved 12 14 ridges splitting off from and replacing earlier type becoming m meridionalis about 2 0 1 7 million years ago in turn this species was replaced by steppe mammoth m trogontherii with 18 20 ridges which evolved in eastern asia around 2 0 1 5 million years ago columbian mammoth evolved from a population of m trogontherii that had crossed bering strait and entered north america about 1 5 million years ago it retained a similar number of molar ridges mammoths derived from m trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400 000 years ago in siberia and became woolly mammoth m primigenius woolly mammoths entered north america about 100 000 years ago a population of columbian mammoths that lived between 80 000 and 13 000 years ago on channel islands of california away from mainland evolved to be less than half size of mainland columbian mammoths they are therefore considered to be distinct species m exilis pygmy mammoth or a subspecies m c exilis these mammoths presumably reached islands by swimming there when sea levels were lower and decreased in size due to limited food provided by islands small areas bones of larger specimens have also been found on islands but whether these were stages in dwarfing process or later arrivals of columbian mammoths is unknown thumb alt museum skeleton with curved tusks crossing at tips specimen formerly assigned to synonym m jeffersonii also suggested to be a hybrid between columbian and woolly mammoths at american museum of natural history a 2011 study of complete mitochondrial genome inherited through female line showed that two examined columbian mammoths including morphologically typical huntington mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths this suggests that two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring one possible explanation is introgression of a haplogroup from woolly to columbian mammoths or vice versa a similar situation has been documented in modern species of african elephant loxodonta african bush elephant l africana and african forest elephant l authors of study also suggest that north american type formerly referred to as m jeffersonii may have been a hybrid between two species as it is apparently morphologically intermediate these findings were not expected by scientists nuclear dna and more specimens will have to be examined to clarify situation a 2015 study of mammoth molars confirmed that m columbi evolved from eurasian m trogontherii not m meridionalis as had been suggested earlier and noted that m columbi and m trogontherii were so similar in morphology that their classification as separate species may be questionable study also suggested that animals in range where m columbi and m primigenius overlapped formed a of hybrids with varying morphology in 2016 a genetic study of north american mammoth specimens confirmed that m columbi and m primigenius interbred extensively were both descended from m trogontherii and concluded that morphological differences between fossils may therefore not be reliable for determining taxonomy authors also questioned whether m columbi and m primigenius should be considered good species considering that they were able to interbreed after supposedly being separated for a million years but cautioned that more specimens need to be sampled description thumb left alt colored silhouette of a mammoth relative in size to a human and past and present elephants size blue compared to a human and other mammoths columbian mammoth was about tall at shoulder and weighed about it was about same size as earlier mammoth species m meridionalis and m trogontherii and was larger than modern african elephant and woolly mammoth both of which reached about males were generally larger and more robust best indication of sex is size of pelvic girdle since opening that functions as birth canal is always wider in females than in males like other mammoths columbian mammoth had a high single domed head and a sloping back with a high shoulder hump this shape resulted from spinous processes protrusions of back vertebrae decreasing in length from front to rear juveniles though had convex backs like asian elephants other skeletal features include a short deep rostrum front part of jaws a rounded mandibular symphysis where two halves of lower jaw connected and coronoid process of mandible upper protrusion of jaw bone extending above molar surfaces thumb restoration based on archie extent of fur is hypothetical apart from its larger size and more primitive molars columbian mammoth also differed from woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis dental alveoli tooth sockets of tusks were directed more laterally away from midline its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and woolly mammoth since no columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found much less is known about its appearance than that of woolly mammoth it lived in warmer habitats than woolly mammoth and probably lacked many of adaptations seen in that species hair thought to be that of columbian mammoth has been discovered in bechan cave in utah where mammoth dung has also been found some of this hair is coarse and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths however since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be woolly mammoth hair distribution and density of fur on living animal is unknown but it was probably less dense than that of woolly mammoth due to warmer habitat dentition left thumb alt mammoth skull on a dolly underside of skull of a male la brea specimen nicknamed zed showing upper molars columbian mammoths had very long tusks modified incisor teeth which were more curved than those of modern elephants largest known mammoth tusk long belonged to a columbian mammoth and others range from long columbian mammoth tusks were usually not much larger than those of woolly mammoths which reached tusks of females were much smaller and thinner about a quarter of tusks length was inside sockets they grew spirally in opposite directions from base curving until tips pointed towards each other and sometimes crossed most of their weight would have been close to skull with less torque than straight tusks would have generated tusks were usually asymmetrical with considerable variation some tusks curved down instead of outwards or were shorter due to breakage columbian mammoth tusks were generally less twisted than those of woolly mammoths at six months of age calves developed milk tusks a few centimeters long which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later annual tusk growth of continued throughout life slowing as animal reached adulthood columbian mammoths had four functional molar teeth at a time two in upper jaw and two in lower about of crown was within jaw and was above crowns of lower jaw were pushed forward and up as they wore down comparable to a conveyor belt teeth had separated ridges of enamel which were covered in prisms directed towards chewing surface wear resistant they were held together with cementum and dentin a mammoth s molars were replaced five times over animal s lifetime first molars were about size of those of a human third ones were long and sixth ones were about long and weighed with each replacement molars grew larger and gained more ridges number of plates varied between individuals growing of ridge took about 10 6 years paleobiology thumb alt large rocks rising from coastal sand outcrops on goat rock beach possibly used as rubbing rocks by columbian mammoths like that of modern elephants mammoth s sensitive muscular trunk was a limb like organ with many functions it was used for manipulating objects and social interaction although healthy adult mammoths could defend themselves from predators with their tusks trunks and size juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves and big cats bones of juvenile columbian mammoths accumulated by homotherium scimitar toothed cat have been found in cave in texas tusks may have been used in fighting for territory or mates and for display to attract females and intimidate rivals two columbian mammoths that died in nebraska with tusks interlocked provide evidence of fighting behavior mammoths could use their tusks as weapons by thrusting swiping or crashing them down and used them in pushing contests by interlocking them which sometimes resulted in breakage tusks curvature made them unsuitable for stabbing on goat rock beach in sonoma coast state park and chert outcrops nicknamed mammoth rocks show evidence of having been rubbed by columbian mammoths or mastodons rocks have polished areas above ground primarily near their edges and are similar to african rubbing rocks used by elephants and other herbivores to rid themselves of mud and parasites similar rocks exist in hueco tanks texas and on mountain in new mexico thumb left alt painting of a family of mammoths walking a 1909 restoration by charles r knight based on amnh specimen accumulations of modern elephant remains have been called elephants graveyards because these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die similar accumulations of mammoth bones have been found these are thought to be result of individuals dying near or in rivers over thousands of years and their bones being accumulated by water such as in aucilla river in florida or animals dying after becoming mired in mud some accumulations are thought to be remains of herds that died at same time perhaps due to flooding columbian mammoths are occasionally preserved in volcanic deposits such as those in tocuila mexico where a volcanic lahar mudflow covered at least seven individuals 12 500 years ago how many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown but number likely varied by season and lifecycle modern elephants can form large herds sometimes consisting of multiple family groups and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together mammoths may have formed large herds more often than modern elephants since animals living in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas although to what extent columbian mammoths migrated is unclear an isotope analysis of blackwater draw in new mexico indicated that they spent part of year in rocky mountains away study of tusk rings may aid further study of mammoth migration thumb alt remains of a mammoth buried 53 000 years ago female mammoth w specimen at waco mammoth national monument like modern elephants columbian mammoths were probably social and lived in matriarchal female led family groups most of their other social behavior was also similar to that of modern elephants this is supported by fossil assemblages such as dent site in colorado and waco mammoth national monument in waco texas where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile columbian mammoths have been found implying female led family groups latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event herd was originally proposed to have been killed by a flash flood and arrangement of some of skeletons suggests that females may have formed a defensive ring around juveniles in 2016 herd was suggested to have died by drought near a diminishing watering hole scavenging traces on bones contradict rapid burial and absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at site support this scenario another group consisting of a bull and six females was found at same site although both groups died between 64 000 and 73 000 years ago whether they died in same event is unknown at murray springs clovis site in arizona where several columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of skeletons mammoth may have made trackway before it died or another individual may have approached dead or dying

mammoth site many specimens also accumulated in natural traps such as sinkholes and tar pits hot springs mammoth site in south dakota is a 26 000 year old roughly long sinkhole that functioned for 300 to 700 years before filling with sediment site is opposite scenario of that in waco all but one of at least 55 skeletons additional skeletons are excavated each year are male and accumulated over time rather than in a single event like modern male elephants male mammoths primarily are assumed to have lived alone to be more adventurous especially young males and to be more likely to encounter dangerous situations than females mammoths may have been lured to hole by warm water or vegetation near edges slipping in and drowning or starving isotope studies of growth rings have shown that most of mammoths died during spring and summer which may have correlated with vegetation near sinkhole one individual nicknamed murray lies on its side and probably died in this pose while struggling to get free deep footprints of mammoths attempting to free themselves from sinkhole s mud can be seen in vertically excavated sections of site thumb smilodon and dire wolves fighting over a columbian mammoth carcass in la brea tar pits by robert bruce horsfall 1911 since early 20th century excavations at la brea tar pits in los angeles have yielded 100 tons of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna including several columbian mammoths many of fossils are remains of animals that became stuck in asphalt puddles that seeped to surface of pits 40 000 to 11 500 years ago dust and leaves likely concealed liquid asphalt which then trapped unwary animals mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion their corpses attracted predators which sometimes became stuck themselves fossil record of tar pits is dominated by remains of predators such as large canids and felids fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from pits tar pits do not preserve soft tissue and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade dna of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract dna from a columbian mammoth diet left thumb alt mammoth jaw with other bones on ground mandible showing lower molars in a lahar deposit at paleontological museum in tocuila mexico an adult columbian mammoth would have needed more than of food per day and may have foraged for 20 hours a day mammoths chewed their food using their powerful jaw muscles to move mandible forward and close mouth then backward while opening sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other grinding food ridges were wear resistant enabling animal to chew large quantities of food that contained grit trunk could be used for pulling up large tufts of grass picking buds and flowers or tearing leaves and branches from trees and shrubs and tusks were used to dig up plants and strip bark from trees digging is indicated on preserved tusks by flat polished sections of surface that would have reached ground isotope studies of columbian mammoths from mexico and united states have shown that their diet varied by location consisting of a mix of c3 most plants and c4 plants such as grasses and they were not restricted to grazing or browsing stomach contents from columbian mammoths are rare since no carcasses have been found but plant remains were discovered between pelvis and ribs of huntington mammoth when it was excavated in utah microscopy showed that these chewed remains consisted of sedges grasses fir twigs and needles oak and maple a large amount of mammoth dung has been found in two caves in utah dry conditions and stable temperature of bechan cave bechan is navajo for large faeces has preserved 16 000 to 13 500 year old elephant dung most likely from columbian mammoths dung consists of 95 grasses and sedges and varies from 0 to 25 woody plants between dung boluses including saltbush sagebrush water birch and blue spruce this is similar to diet documented for woolly mammoth although browsing seems to have been more important for columbian mammoth cover of dung is thick and has a volume of 227 m3 8 000 cubic ft with largest boluses in diameter bechan dung could have been produced by a small group of mammoths over a relatively short time since adult african elephants drop an average of of dung every two hours and each day giant north american fruits of plants such as osage orange kentucky and honey locust have been proposed to have evolved in tandem with now extinct american megafauna such as mammoths and other proboscideans since no extant endemic herbivores are able to ingest these fruits and disperse their seeds introduced cattle and horses have since taken over this ecological role life history thumb alt young mammoth skeleton with a large skull relative to its body skeleton of a juvenile at natural history museum of utah lifespan of columbian mammoth is thought to have been about 80 years lifespan of a mammal is related to its size columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants which have a lifespan of about 60 years age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section however ring counting does not account for a mammoth s early years early growth is represented in tusk tips which are usually worn away in remainder of tusk each major line represents a year with weekly and daily lines found in between dark bands correspond to summer making determining season in which a mammoth died possible tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from herd male elephants live with their herds until about age of 10 mammoths continued growing during adulthood as do other elephants males grew until age 40 and females until age 25 mammoths may have had gestation periods of 21 22 months like those of modern elephants columbian mammoths had six sets of molars in course of a lifetime at 6 12 months second set of molars would erupt with first set worn out at 18 months of age third set of molars lasted for 10 years and this process was repeated until sixth set emerged at 30 years of age when last set of molars wore out animal would be unable to chew and would die of starvation almost all vertebrae of huntington mammoth a very aged specimen were deformed by arthritic disease and four of its lumbar vertebrae were fused some bones also indicate bacterial infection such as osteomyelitis condition of bones suggests specimen died of old age and malnutrition distribution and habitat

columbian mammoths inhabited southern half of north america ranging from northern united states across mexico as far south as costa rica one costa rican specimen a molar was reported in 1963 but has since been lost environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in north mammoth steppe some areas were covered by grasses herbaceous plants trees and shrubs their composition varied from region to region and included grassland savanna and aspen parkland habitats wooded areas also occurred although mammoths would not have preferred forests clearings in them could provide animals with grasses and herbs columbian mammoth shared its habitat with other now extinct pleistocene mammals such as glyptodon smilodon ground sloths camelops and mastodons horses and buffalos it did not live in arctic canada which was inhabited by woolly mammoths fossils of woolly and columbian mammoths have been found in same place in a few areas of north america where their ranges overlapped including hot springs site whether two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously or if woolly mammoths entered southern areas when columbian mammoth

archaeologists discovered a 13 100 year old object made from a mammoth femur object is thought to be a shaft wrench a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear shafts inuit use similar tools earliest suggested evidence of columbian mammoth butchering in america from lovewell kansas dates from 18 000 to 21 000 years ago paleoamericans of clovis culture which arose roughly 7 000 years later may have been first humans to hunt mammoths extensively these people are thought to have hunted columbian mammoths with clovis pointed spears which were thrown or thrust although clovis points have been found with columbian mammoth remains at several sites archaeologists disagree about whether finds represent hunting scavenging dead mammoths or are coincidental a female mammoth at naco mammoth kill site in arizona found with eight clovis points near its skull shoulder blade ribs and other bones is considered most convincing evidence for hunting in modern experiments replica spears have been able to penetrate rib cages of african elephants with reuse causing little damage to points other sites show more circumstantial evidence of mammoth hunting such as piled bones bearing butcher marks some of these sites are not closely associated with clovis points lehner mammoth kill site and dent site where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with clovis points were once interpreted as killing of entire herds by clovis hunters however isotope studies have shown that accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of year so are not herds killed in single incidents many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time so are ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting thumb alt side by side rock carvings tracings of petroglyphs from utah depicting two columbian mammoths a bison carving is superimposed on one of mammoth carvings petroglyphs in colorado

columbian and woolly mammoths both disappeared during late pleistocene and early holocene alongside most of pleistocene megafauna most recent columbian mammoth remains have been dated around 10 900 years ago this extinction formed part of quaternary extinction event which began 40 000 years ago and peaked between 14 000 and 11 500 years ago scientists do not know whether these extinctions happened abruptly or were drawn out during this period 40 mammal species disappeared from north america almost all of which weighed over extinction of mammoths cannot be explained in isolation scientists are divided over whether climate change hunting or a combination of two drove extinction of columbian mammoths according to climate change hypothesis warmer weather led to shrinking of suitable habitat for columbian mammoths which turned from parkland to forest grassland and semidesert with less diverse vegetation overkill hypothesis attributes extinction to hunting by humans this idea was first proposed by paul s martin in 1967 more recent research on this subject has varied in conclusions a 2002 study concluded that archaeological record did not support overkill hypothesis given that only 14 clovis sites 12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting in contrast a 2007 study found that clovis record indicated highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in world and supported overkill hypothesis whatever actual cause of extinction large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates references external links mammoth mystery nova documentary about fighting mammoths of nebraska footage
