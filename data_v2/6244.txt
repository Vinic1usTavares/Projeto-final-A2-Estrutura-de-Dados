tennis players for soviet union his father was ranked as high as no 175 in world he was also top ranked men s player nationally while his mother was fourth highest ranked women s player they both moved from sochi to capital to train at cska moscow military run tennis club soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside country an impediment that limited how high either of sascha s parents could rise in world rankings with collapse of soviet union imminent irina went to germany to compete at a tournament in 1990 with her husband accompanying as her coach while in germany they were offered jobs as tennis instructors after initially declining they accepted an offer to work at hockey club in hamburg following year and ended up settling in country sascha began playing tennis at a very young age he has said one day when i was i think one year and five months old i just picked up a little racket and i was starting to push ball all over our apartment and since then they took me out on court i enjoy it still i enjoyed it back then when he was five years old he started to play tennis at least half an hour each day sascha was extremely competitive as a child his brother mischa said he would not understand or accept that he was losing when two would play against each other he would never want to leave court unless he won match sascha also played hockey and football as a child but decided to focus only on tennis around age of 12 after an early round loss at a high level international junior tournament in florida when sascha was young his mother was his primary coach while his father was focused on coaching his brother he has said i think i have pretty good technique which my mum did at a young age so credit to her for that my backhand in particular is 100 per cent down to my mum while his mother had a more relaxed teaching style his father had a very soviet way of doing physical training sessions that involved doing timed drills for fixed numbers of repetitions sascha s coaches aimed for him to have a riskier aggressive playing style built around hitting ball with pace and finishing points quickly this was a big contrast from how he played around age 12 when his style centered around being an unbelievable fighter from baseline in part because he was too slow to go to net initially sascha struggled to change his playing style he made a lot of errors and lost to opponents who excelled at keeping points alive however his father stuck with this strategy saying we must practice fast tennis aggressive tennis if you lose today it s

format match went to three sets in third set tiebreak both teams had a match point at 4 4 switzerland won point with federer serving to win title playing style thumb zverev hitting a forehand zverev is an aggressive baseliner he often stands far back behind baseline and aims to hit powerful groundstrokes either for winners or to wear down his opponent although his height slows him down on court it also adds to his reach and gives him ability to get more balls back in play novak djokovic has commented that he moves well for his height zverev can generate a lot of power with both his backhand and forehand his backhand in particular is regarded as his strength and one of best in game zverev uses a semi open stance and employs a western grip when hitting forehands he has a continental eastern grip on his backhand he can also hit slice backhands that require a low center of gravity in spite of his height with zverev s height of he can generate big serves at or faster at sharper angles than shorter players in spite of his height however he is better at returning than serving year zverev first broke into top 20 he was still not one of better servers on tour ranking just 38th in serve rating a statistic that combines six basic serving statistics 1st serve percentage 1st serve percentage points won 2nd serve percentage points won service games won percentage aces and double faults this was well behind him ranking 18th in return rating showing that his return game was much stronger than his serving by 2018 he had improved in both categories ranking 19th in serve rating and 8th in return rating zverev excels in particular at hitting a high percentage of first serves in landing 64 2 in 2018 in his return game he had fifth highest percentage of first serve points won that year at 32 4 thumb left zverev serving zverev is an all court player and does not aim to be better on any surface in particular he has said i feel like i can play on all surfaces i ve been to two finals or won tournaments on every single surface i don t feel like i have to focus on one i feel like i have good chances at all of them toni nadal uncle and coach of rafael nadal has praised his ability on hard courts in particular saying his best surface is in my eyes hard court because he moves better than he does on clay six of zverev s first ten titles came on hard courts while other four were on clay as of end of 2018 he has yet to win a title on grass but has reached two finals and also defeated federer on that surface zverev has ability to serve and volley as well his older brother mischa is regarded as biggest proponent of this playing style on modern tour although sascha does not employ this technique as often as his brother he has shown it can be effective in big matches such as madrid masters final against dominic thiem a player who rarely comes to net zverev s volleying technique is regarded as one of his biggest weaknesses zverev was tall but skinny and not very muscular when growing up his fitness trainer jez green has focused on making him stronger and set a goal for him to add of muscle each year initially zverev had difficulty adjusting to this training style on court saying i had no idea what was going on in my body and needed to adapt his shot technique as he became more muscular eventually he showed improvement on court green remarked he started to become less wobbly he started to absorb power so when someone hit hard he could hit ball back and everything locked into place coaching team zverev has been coached by his parents since he was very young his mother was initially his primary coach before his father took over at some point zverev made decision to hire former world no 1 juan carlos ferrero at washington open in summer of 2017 he fired ferrero following australian open after ferrero criticized rest of zverev s coaching team ivan lendl another former world no 1 joined zverev s team in august 2018 they split up in july 2019 due to disappointing results and personal differences zverev has stated that lendl was more interested in his dog or his golf game than in professional coaching rest of zverev s coaching team includes fitness trainer jez green who previously worked with andy murray and physio hugo green has worked with zverev since 2013 personal life thumb right sascha left with his older brother mischa right in

first time they met me because i can t remember they say oh i remember that junior tournament in italy we played like mini tennis with you his father remembers many instances where sascha practiced with atp professionals giving one example as we went to dusseldorf for world team cup mischa was in a team and i remember gilles simon was waiting for other players to join him i say gilles can you play with sascha for 20 minutes it was normal zverev s tennis idol is roger federer he has said federer is only player that has made him feel starstruck when zverev defeated federer to win his second career masters title at 2017 canadian open he said this one against roger is something so special for me because he was always a great idol growing up for me greatest player of all time beating him in a final not just any final but in final of a masters 1000 is amazing zverev plays other sports in his spare time such as basketball and golf he is a fan of miami heat in national basketball
