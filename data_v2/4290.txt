killer whale or orca orcinus orca is a toothed whale belonging to oceanic dolphin family of which it is largest member killer whales have a diverse diet although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey some feed exclusively on fish while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin they have been known to attack baleen whale calves and even adult whales killer whales are apex predators as no animal preys on them a cosmopolitan species they can be found in each of world s oceans in a variety of marine environments from arctic and antarctic regions to tropical seas absent only from baltic and black seas and some areas of arctic ocean killer whales are highly social some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups pods which are most stable of any animal species their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations have been described as manifestations of animal culture international union for conservation of nature assesses orca s conservation status as data deficient because of likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion habitat loss pollution by pcbs capture for marine mammal parks and conflicts with human fisheries in late 2005 southern resident killer whales which swim in british columbia and washington state waters were placed on u s endangered species list wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans but there have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks killer whales feature strongly in mythologies of indigenous cultures with their reputation

whales adult bull sperm whales which are large powerful and aggressive when threatened and fully grown adult blue whales which are possibly too large to overwhelm are not believed to be prey for killer whales prior to advent of industrial whaling great whales may have been major food source for killer whales introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float thus exposing them to scavenging however devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for killer whales and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals thus contributing to decline of these

although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted vocalizations multimedia relating to orca like all cetaceans killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation feeding and communication they produce three categories of sounds clicks whistles and pulsed calls clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in surrounding environment but are also commonly heard during social interactions northeast pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in same waters residents feed primarily on chinook and chum salmon species that are insensitive to killer whale calls inferred from of atlantic salmon in contrast marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at frequencies used in killer whale calls as such transients are typically silent probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey they sometimes use a single click called a cryptic click rather than long train of clicks observed in other populations residents are only silent when resting all members of a resident pod use similar calls known collectively as a dialect dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete repetitive calls they are complex and stable over time call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines newborns produce calls similar to their mothers but have a more limited repertoire individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members for instance family specific calls have been observed more frequently in days following a calf s birth which may help calf learn them dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness similarity in dialects likely reflects degree of relatedness between pods with variation building over time when pods meet dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase use of both call types is called increased subset call types may be distinguishing factor between pods and inter pod relations dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods but also between types resident dialects contain seven to 17 mean 11 distinctive call types all

of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to 18th century in japan during 19th and early 20th centuries global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil their smaller populations and difficulty of taking them once stocks of larger species were depleted killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in mid 20th century between 1954 and 1997 japan took 1 178 killer whales although ministry of environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1 600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s and norway took 987 extensive hunting of killer whales including an antarctic catch of 916 in 1979 80 alone prompted international whaling commission to recommend a
