liberte was a pre dreadnought battleship built for french navy in mid 1900s she was lead ship of which included three other vessels and was a derivative of preceding with primary difference being inclusion of a heavier secondary battery liberte carried a main battery of four guns like republique but mounted ten guns for her secondary armament in place of guns of earlier vessels like many late pre dreadnought designs liberte was completed after revolutionary british battleship had entered service rendering her obsolescent on entering service liberte was assigned to 2nd division of mediterranean squadron based in toulon she immediately began normal peacetime training routine of squadron and fleet maneuvers and cruises to various ports in mediterranean she also participated in several naval reviews for a number of french and foreign dignitaries in september 1909 ships of 2nd division crossed atlantic to united states to represent france at hudson fulton celebration libertes active career was cut short on 25 september 1911 when a fire broke out in one of ship s propellant magazines and led to a detonation of charges stored there destroying ship in a tremendous explosion that killed 286 of her crew blast also damaged several other vessels and killed crewmen on six neighboring ships an investigation revealed that standard french propellant poudre b was prone to decomposition that rendered it very unstable it had likely been culprit in several other ammunition fires in other ships wreck remained in toulon until 1925 when her destroyed hull was refloated towed into a drydock and broken up design thumb left line drawing of liberte class liberte class battleships were originally intended to be part of but construction of british s with their heavy secondary battery of guns prompted french naval general staff to request that last four republiques be redesigned to include a heavier secondary battery in response ironically designer louis emile bertin had proposed such an armament for republique class but general staff had rejected it since larger guns had a lower rate of fire than smaller guns that had been selected for republique design because ships were broadly similar apart from their armament libertes are sometimes considered to be a sub class of republique type liberte was long overall and had a beam of and an average draft of she displaced up to at full load battleship was powered by three vertical triple expansion steam engines with twenty two belleville boilers they were rated at and provided a top speed of coal storage amounted to which provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of she had a crew of 32 officers and 710 enlisted men libertes main battery consisted of four modele 1893 96 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets one forward and one aft secondary battery consisted of ten modele 1902 guns six were mounted in single turrets and four in casemates in hull she also carried thirteen modele 1902 guns and ten modele 1902 guns ship was also armed with two torpedo tubes which were submerged in hull on broadside ship s main belt was thick in central citadel and was connected to two armored decks upper deck was thick while lower deck was thick with sloped sides main battery guns were protected by up to of armor on fronts of turrets while secondary turrets had of armor on faces casemates were protected with of steel plate conning tower had thick sides service history thumb left postcard depicting liberte liberte was laid down at ateliers et chantiers de la loire shipyard in november 1902 launched on 19 april 1905 on 5 september 1907 liberte steamed to arsenal de brest in brest france where her armament was installed she departed brest on 18 march bound for mediterranean sea and after arriving in toulon was pronounced complete on 13 april 1908 this was over a year after revolutionary british battleship which rendered pre dreadnoughts like liberte outdated before they were completed after commissioning liberte was assigned to 2nd division of mediterranean squadron along with her sisters divisional flagship and in june and july mediterranean and northern squadrons conducted their annual maneuvers off bizerte 2nd division ships visited bizerte in october entire squadron was moored in villefranche in february 1909 and thereafter conducted training exercises off corsica followed by a naval review in villefranche for president armand fallieres on 26 april during this period of training on 17 march liberte and battleships justice and conducted shooting training using old ironclad as a target liberte democratie patrie and armored cruiser steamed into atlantic for training exercises on 2 june while at sea ten days later they rendezvoused with republique justice and protected cruiser at cadiz spain training included serving as targets for fleet s submarines in pertuis d antioche strait ships then steamed north to la pallice where they conducted tests with their wireless telegraphy sets and shooting training in quiberon bay from 8 to 15 july ships lay at brest and next day they steamed to le havre there they met northern squadron for another fleet review for fallieres on 17 july ten days later combined fleet steamed to cherbourg where they held another fleet review this time during visit of czar nicholas ii of russia on 12 september liberte and other 2nd division battleships departed brest bound for united states there they represented france during hudson fulton celebration which marked 300th anniversary of european discovery of hudson river ships arrived back in toulon on 27 october thumb liberte underway year 1910 passed uneventfully for liberte apart from typical routine of training exercises maneuvers were held for six liberte and republique class battleships off sardinia and algeria from 21 may to 4 june followed by exercises with rest of mediterranean squadron from 7 to 18 june an outbreak of typhoid among crews of battleships in early december forced navy to confine them to golfe juan to contain fever by 15 december outbreak had subsided on 16 april 1911 liberte and rest of fleet escorted verite which had aboard fallieres naval minister theophile delcasse and charles dumont minister of public works posts and telegraphs to bizerte they arrived two days later and held a fleet review that included two british battleships two italian battleships and a spanish cruiser on 19 april fleet returned to toulon on 29 april where fallieres doubled crews rations and suspended any punishments to thank men for their performance liberte and rest of 1st squadron and armored cruisers ernest renan and went on a cruise in western mediterranean in may and june visiting a number of ports including cagliari bizerte bone philippeville algiers and bougie by 1 august battleships of had begun to enter service and they were assigned to 1st squadron displacing liberte and republique class ships to 2nd squadron on 4 september both squadrons held a major fleet review for fallieres off toulon fleet then departed on 11 september for maneuvers off golfe juan and marseille returning to toulon on 16 september ships remained there for next nine days loss thumb an illustration showing extent of damage to liberte at 05 31 on morning of 25 september crewmen in other battleships began reporting seeing smoke coming from liberte originating from her forward starboard casemate shortly thereafter forward superstructure erupted in flames but it quickly appeared to observers that ship s crew was getting fire under control but at 05 53 a tremendous explosion rocked harbor liberte was badly damaged by blast with both central 194 mm turrets thrown overboard deck amidships collapsed and forward of ship was completely destroyed forward turret was blasted apart and only one of guns was recovered having been hurled into muddy bottom of harbor explosion hurled a chunk of armor plate from ship into battleship republique moored some away which caused significant damage splinters from exploding ship sank a steam pinnace and killed fifteen men aboard armored cruiser nine aboard battleship six aboard armored cruiser four aboard battleship and three aboard libertes surviving crew immediately fled ship 286 were killed in explosion and 188 were wounded fortunately 143 of crew including ship s commander had been on leave in toulon at time and thus avoided accident navy convened a commission to investigate accident on 25 september which was held aboard justice commission was led by contre amiral rear admiral and included officers from justice they considered possibility of sabotage but ruled it out investigation determined that accident was likely caused by excessive heat in magazines and deemed that standard procedures for ammunition monitoring were not sufficient french navy had earlier suffered a series of fatal accidents in toulon beginning with an explosion aboard a torpedo boat in february 1907 in which nine men were killed following month battleship blew up killing 107 men an explosion aboard a gunnery training ship killed six in august 1908 and an explosion on a cruiser killed 13 six more men were killed aboard cruiser just two weeks before liberte exploded on 10 september 1911 culprit was unstable poudre b a nitrocellulose based propellant that was also responsible for destruction of and possibly other explosions as well following disaster navy established new rules requiring that propellant charges older than four years would be discarded order was initially limited to battleship squadrons but was later extended to entire fleet navy minister also rescinded an order instructing gun crews to return propellant charges that had misfired to magazines going forward charges that had been placed in guns would either have to be fired or discarded commission had determined that magazine flooding arrangements were insufficient but navy only made modest improvements to equipment wreck of ship remained in toulon until 1925 though work on clearing or marking navigational hazards began immediately on 21 february liberte was refloated and towed into a
