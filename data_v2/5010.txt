although part of australian army for most of its existence aac was overseen by a board of senior officers that included members of royal australian navy following disbandment of afc aac was a stop gap measure intended to remain in place until formation of a permanent and independent australian air force corps primary purpose was to maintain assets of central flying school at point cook victoria but several pioneering activities also took place under its auspices aac personnel set an australian altitude record that stood for a decade made first non stop flight between sydney and melbourne and undertook country s initial steps in field of aviation medicine aac operated fighters bombers and training aircraft including some of first examples of britain s imperial gift to arrive in australia

decision to create such a service had been made in january 1919 amid competing proposals by army and royal australian navy for separate forces under their respective jurisdictions budgetary constraints and arguments over administration and control led to ongoing delays in formation of an independent air force coulthard clark third brother pp 3 7 by direction of chief of general staff major general gordon legge in november 1919 aac s prime purpose was to ensure existing aviation assets were maintained legge later added that it should also perform suitable tasks such as surveying air routes chief of naval staff rear admiral sir percy grant objected to aac s being under army control and argued that an air board should be formed to oversee aac and proposed australian air force coulthard clark third brother pp 8 9 a temporary air board first met on 29 january 1920 army being represented by williams and brigadier general thomas blamey and navy by captain wilfred nunn and

officers and thirty six other ranks following month establishment was increased by fifty four to make a total of 160 other ranks an advertising campaign was employed to garner applicants coulthard clark third brother p 22 according to age applicants needed to be aged between eighteen and forty five and returned soldiers were preferred all positions were temporary and salaries including uniform allowance and rations ranged from to ps450 as aac was an interim formation no unique uniform was designed for its members within three weeks of aac being raised a directive came down from cfs that

missing their dh 9a was last sighted flying through cloud over bass strait a court of inquiry determined aircraft had crashed and that dh 9as may not have had adequate preparation time for their task which it attributed to low staffing levels at cfs court proposed compensation of ps550 for stutt s family and ps248 for dalzell s maximum amounts payable under government regulations as men had been on duty at time of their deaths federal cabinet increased these payments three fold wreckage that may have belonged to amelia j was found at flinders island following year coulthard clark third

demonstrated that avro was not suited to tropical conditions as its engine lacked necessary power and its skin deteriorated rapidly williams recommended that activity cease until australia acquired a purpose designed seaplane coulthard clark third brother p 215 aac performed several tasks in connection with prince of wales tour of australia in 1920 in may aac was required to escort prince s ship hms renown into port melbourne and then to fly over royal procession along st kilda road aac had more aircraft than pilots available so williams gained permission from minister for defence to augment aac aircrew with former afc pilots seeking to volunteer their services for events in august aac was called upon at last minute to fly prince s mail from port augusta south australia to sydney before he boarded renown for voyage back to britain coulthard clark third brother pp 23 24 during second peace loan which commenced in august 1920 aac undertook a cross country program of tours and exhibition flying to promote sale of government bonds again williams enlisted services of former afc personnel to make up for a shortfall in number of aac pilots and mechanics available to prepare and fly nineteen aircraft allotted to program activities included flyovers at sporting events leaflet drops over melbourne and what may have been australia s first aerial derby at serpentine victoria on 27 august poor weather hindered some of program and four aircraft were lost in accidents though no aircrew were killed second peace loan gave aac personnel experience in a variety of flying conditions and air service gained greater exposure to australian public coulthard clark third brother pp 14 24 25 disbandment and legacy on 15 march 1921 brisbane courier reported that aac would disband on 30 march and be succeeded by a new air force australian air force was formed on 31 march inheriting point cook and most of its initial personnel and equipment from aac royal prefix was added to australian air force that august several officers associated with aac including williams anderson wrigley and mcnamara went on to achieve high rank in air force according to raaf s pathfinder bulletin aac kept valuable aviation skills alive until a permanent air force could be established corps was further technically separate from army and navy its director answered to minister for defence through air council in effect aac was australia s first independent air force albeit an interim one notes references category australian military aviation category aviation history of australia category
