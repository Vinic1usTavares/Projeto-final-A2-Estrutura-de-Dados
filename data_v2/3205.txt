throughout first season despite appearing in every episode was promoted to main cast in season two andy dwyer pratt s character was originally supposed to appear only in first season but producers liked pratt so much that almost immediately after casting him they decided to make andy a regular character schneider left cast after second season schur said when schneider s character mark brendanawicz was conceived it was anticipated he would eventually become a less frequent character who switched back and forth between government and private sector jobs schur claimed that both producers and schneider were interested in having character return for guest appearances in future episodes though schneider states that he is not interested in returning and has never been contacted about it rob lowe and adam scott joined parks and recreation cast starting in penultimate second season episode master plan scott left his starring role on starz comedy series party down to join parks and recreation and lowe had recently departed from abc drama series brothers sisters from beginning scott was expected to become a regular cast member and during third season eventual love interest for leslie knope while lowe was originally only intended to make a string of guest appearances in third season and then depart series however lowe later signed a multi year contract to become a regular cast member schur said even when character ben wyatt was conceived adam scott was considered dream scenario casting choice jim o heir and retta who made regular appearances as parks employees jerry gergich and donna meagle in first season continued to appear in season two although still considered guest actors their characters started to become more fully developed and play larger roles in episodes several other actors played regular supporting roles throughout second season jama williamson continued her recurring role as wendy tom haverford s ex wife who becomes a romantic interest for ron swanson mo collins and jay jackson made repeated appearances as pawnee journalists joan callamezzo and perd hapley both actors were originally expected to appear only in one episode but both

schwartz played jean ralphio an arrogant and fast talking playboy friend of tom in several episodes pamela reed reprised her recurring role as leslie s mother marlene in several second season episodes second season also included several prominent guest appearances something that distinguished parks and recreation from greg daniels other comedy series office schur said high profile guests on office would be too distracting because most episodes are confined to one setting while he said parks and recreation was a little bit more bright and colorful than office megan mullally real life wife of nick offerman appeared as ron s ex wife tammy in episode ron and tammy schur said mullally s appearance was well received and not overly distracting to viewers which made parks and recreation producers feel more comfortable about using future guest actors stand up comedian louis c k appeared in several episodes as dave sanderson a pawnee police officer and romantic interest to leslie knope although typically known for his raunchy and caustic comedy style louis c k adopted a far more deadpan sense of humor and technical tone of voice for sanderson two of amy poehler s previous cast members from saturday night live appeared in parks and recreation episodes fred armisen played vice director of a venezuelan parks department in sister city and andy samberg portrayed head of security for pawnee s parks in park safety will arnett then married to amy poehler made a guest appearance as an mri technician in set up in that same episode justin theroux started a string of a guest

former parks department director who loves marijuana detlef schrempf a retired basketball player who played for indiana pacers portrayed himself in telethon natalie morales appeared in last two episodes of season as lucy a bartender who becomes tom s girlfriend writing and filming following season one parks and recreation was originally renewed for a half season worth of episodes but was picked up for a full season in late october 2009 greg daniels said since parks and recreation characters had now been established in second season writers were able to write more specifically for actors daniels said he believed this allowed characters to become more balanced rather than simply an accumulation of flaws as they sometimes appeared in first season writing staff also made an effort to be more topical with second season episodes for example episode pawnee zoo included social commentary about same sex marriage likewise stakeout included a parody of arrest of henry louis gates a black harvard university professor who was arrested after police mistakenly thought he was breaking into his own home in cambridge massachusetts and a sex scandal involving a pawnee councilman in practice date mirrored real life 2009 scandal of south carolina governor mark sanford who publicly admitted to a long term extramarital affair with an argentinian woman writers made several other changes going from season one to season two including making scripts more focused around entire cast rather than just leslie they also tried to make leslie appear more intelligent in second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared ditzy which michael schur said was never their intention schur said in end we just felt that amy is an enormously likable presence on screen so as season went on we just tried to create situations where that would shine through during episode kaboom a major subplot was resolved when large construction pit that leslie had long sought to turn into a park was filled with dirt and turned into a lot pit was first established in premiere episode and had been a focal point of series since show began schur said while pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all characters together working toward a common goal and it was expected to only become a park during series finale however schur said he felt early episodes were too focused on pit and had led viewers to believe entire show was about filling pit which was not writers intention so they accelerated resolution of that story arc idea of ben and chris two state auditors who come in from outside pawnee to help town deal with budget problems was conceived from news reports at time of a number of states considering shutting down schools parks and other services due to global recession poehler became pregnant during latter half of season with her baby due in summer or early fall of 2010 parks and recreation producers decided not to write pregnancy into show so they decided to enter into a continuous production after season ended to bank episodes for third season six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion however in may 2010 nbc announced third season of parks and recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow network s new comedy outsourced to run in thursday two hour comedy schedule block nbc chief executive officer jeff said this move was not a reflection on parks and recreation and suggested extended hiatus would not only have no effect on show s momentum but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return in november 2010 it was announced parks and recreation would return to a 9 30 p m thursday timeslot effective january 20 2011 reception reviews first season of parks and recreation received mixed to negative reviews with many critics deeming it too similar to office which shared same mock documentary style as parks and recreation in particular several commentators said naive and well meaning leslie knope character too closely resembled office protagonist michael scott a well intentioned but dimwitted protagonist manager of a paper company sales office however most critics declared second season a vast improvement over first with some even claiming it had surpassed office and 30 rock as best comedy of nbc s thursday line up it was declared best comedy of television season by entertainment weekly writer henning fog and star ledger television columnist alan sepinwall entertainment weekly writer michael ausiello who was critical of first season called it most improved show of season time magazine writer james poniewozik included parks and recreation in his list of 10 best television shows of 2009 and ign declared it best comedy series of 2009 several reviewers called second season one of most impressive comebacks in television history amy poehler said first season struggled in part due to extremely high expectations from comparisons to office parks and recreation staff also felt part of reason for improvement was that characters have become better developed and viewers have come to like and care more about them likewise michael schur believed much of early criticism stemmed from fact that audiences were not yet familiar with characters and he believed viewers liked second season better because they had gotten to know characters better as series progressed commentators said supporting cast was now working with better material and that poehler s character had improved and become less over top and more human than in first season and more distinct from michael scott several reviewers praised decision to drop season one subplots that risked becoming stale like whether andy and ann would keep dating and leslie s long standing crush on mark others complimented decision to fill in pit during second season which they said freed show up for more stories and better scripts despite vast change in critical reception parks and recreation staff said they felt only a few minor changes were made to show itself michael schur said i don t think magical fairy dust was sprinkled over show i just think we re getting better at it nbc officials compared late rush of critical acclaim for parks and recreation to that of office which received mixed reviews during its first season before most critics agreed it found its rhythm in second season nick offerman received considerable praise for his performance as ron swanson during second season many reviewers praised offerman s subtle and understated style of comedy and said he was often funniest part of scenes he was in jonah weiner of slate magazine declared swanson parks and recreation s secret weapon and vital to show s improvement aziz ansari who was particularly acclaimed during first season for his role as tom haverford received similar praise in second season as well many reviewers were critical of pairing of mark and ann feeling couple lacked chemistry and were often least funny parts of individual episodes entertainment weekly writer margaret lyons called mark and ann show s achilles heel and sandra gonzalez also from entertainment weekly wrote no matter what they do with these two i can t help but be bored ratings despite critical success second season of parks and recreation continued to suffer in nielsen ratings by december 2009 average episode viewership was 5 3 million households average was lower than other nbc comedy shows that aired thursday night along with parks and recreation community drew an average 6 5 million households 30 rock an average 7 3 million and office an average 10 1 million by february 2010 ratings had begun to improve all of nbc s thursday comedy shows especially parks and recreation but
