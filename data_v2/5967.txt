lithuania had been part of russian empire since partitions of polish lithuanian commonwealth in late 18th century after unsuccessful uprising of 1863 lithuania was subjected to russification policies lithuanian press ban was initiated schools were required to teach in russian language roman catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land and political rights were restricted however these measures had limited effects on lithuanian national revival and a sense of lithuanian national identity continued to grow first lithuanian political parties social democratic party of lithuania and lithuanian democratic party included goals of political autonomy for lithuania within russian empire in their basic program after events of bloody sunday in january 1905 sparked a revolution in russia tsar nicholas ii was forced to make concessions in april 1905 a decree guaranteed complete freedom of religion and even allowed religious studies to be conducted in native languages most important decree october manifesto was announced on october 30 october 17 o s 1905 it guaranteed many political rights including right to form political parties and organize convocations this decree formed legal basis for assembly in vilnius october manifesto also announced intent to hold elections to russian parliament duma and lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for seimas they claimed that lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election preparations thumb a flyer with an agenda prepared by organizational committee this agenda was vetoed by delegates historians disagree about who initiated idea of organizing a national assembly some credit jonas basanavicius while others argue for jonas kriauciunas organizational activities were largely taken on by lithuanian christian democrats and by vilniaus zinios a moderate newspaper owned by petras vileisis vilniaus zinios was first legal lithuanian language daily newspaper to appear after lithuanian press ban was lifted on may 7 1904 it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6 000 copies on october 31 october 18 o s 1905 a fifteen member organizational committee chairman jonas basanavicius and secretary jonas kriauciunas was given task of convening assembly they published an appeal or a manifest to lithuanian people on november 11 october 29 o s in vilniaus zinios appeal signed by chairman and secretary aroused much interest in public invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts and to all other educated people interested in future of lithuanian state at end of appeal there was an eight point agenda to be discussed at seimas it did not include question of lithuanian autonomy on november 15 november 2 o s a controversial memorandum was adopted by organizational committee and sent to sergei witte prime minister of russian empire it was signed by only four people jonas basanavicius who was primary author donatas and it consisted of an introduction which briefly summarized history of lithuania and ten points of demands and declarations first point was most controversial it declared that kovno grodno vilna suwalki governorates and parts of courland governorate were historically lithuanian and that poles jews russians and other groups in those areas were merely invaders who had arrived in recent past belarusians were called lithuanians last point in memorandum asking that title of grand duke of lithuania not be disregarded in tsar s documents also drew criticism other points demanded lithuanian autonomy equal rights to all nationalities and social classes full political and religious freedom free universal education in lithuanian language introduction of lithuanian language to government institutions and attachment of suwalki governorate not to poland but to autonomous lithuania many of these demands were echoed by seimas those parts of memorandum that demanded lithuanian autonomy and protested possible attachment of suwalki governorate to autonomous poland were reprinted in russian publication pravitel vestnik on november 23 november 10 o s russian government sought to demonstrate that granting autonomy to both poland and lithuania would be complicated and would probably exacerbate national conflicts on november 26 november 13 o s memorandum was also reprinted in vilniaus zinios it was heavily criticized by non lithuanians for its position on minorities and by lithuanians for making demands on behalf of lithuanian nation without waiting for seimas resolutions on december 4 november 21 o s about 2 000 people arrived in vilnius half of them were officially elected as delegates by their local communities because no standard elections procedures were offered process of selecting representatives varied greatly despite irregularities it was first election in history of lithuania people from were most active while participation from samogitia and somewhat lacked some of delegates came from areas that are now part of poland and latvia as well as from areas that were then within lands of german empire lithuania minor as a result a wide variety of communities political groups government layers social classes and organizations were represented this parliament may have been first in europe to include women there were seven female delegates seimas it took two hours of intense discussion to elect presidium of seimas jonas basanavicius officially nonpartisan was elected as chairman and steponas leader of social democrats was chosen as vice chairman other members were antanas priest and juozas secretaries were gira and juozas organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for assembly this initial agenda was vetoed by delegates they adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals holding hearings on current situation in lithuania and deciding which political demands should be submitted to tsarist authorities a major portion of first day s proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight most important question was that of lithuanian autonomy there were rumors that some russian politicians were seriously considering granting autonomy to poland and that polish activists wished to incorporate lithuanian lands into their autonomous region calling on historic tradition of polish lithuanian commonwealth in light of these rumors demands of delegates were much more radical than were expected most demanded autonomy in ethnographic lithuanian lands along with any border areas that would decide to join region would be governed by a democratically elected seimas in vilnius and bound by federal ties with neighboring lands ethnographic lithuanian lands at issue were not clearly defined but resistance to tsarist authorities was to be organized in kovno grodno and vilna governorates special attention was given to suwalki governorate seimas resolution adopted on second day explicitly stated that lithuanians from suwalki governorate had decided to join fight for autonomous lithuania this was largely an attempt to prevent potential polish autonomous region from claiming suwalki then part of congress poland for itself election to seimas was to be universal equal direct and secret all persons were to be granted suffrage without regard to sex religion or nationality if election had taken place it would have been first in europe where women were granted an equal right to vote this demand was far reaching and required transformation of empire into a federal state placing lithuania on a par with grand duchy of finland within russian constitutional system heated discussions continued on means to achieve this transformation some argued for armed resistance but were reminded that previous uprisings in november 1831 and january 1863 had failed others suggested peaceful and passive resistance refusing to pay taxes boycotting products from monopolistic companies mostly those selling alcoholic beverages not allowing children to attend russian schools evading drafts into russian army and organizing factory worker strikes delegates who were mostly small farmers also discussed land reform demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it however no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening in other parts of russian empire at end of second day seimas adopted a four paragraph resolution first paragraph declared that tsarist government was lithuania s most dangerous enemy second paragraph demanded autonomy third outlined means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable resistance was to be peaceful and passive fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by people seimas unlike 1917 vilnius conference did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a lithuanian government after seimas rural areas were left on their own without central guidance after resolution was adopted by seimas near midnight jonas basanavicius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing use of lithuanian language in churches within diocese of vilnius church matters had not been discussed during sessions but majority agreed to proposal by a show of hands because attachment was not fully discussed social democrats did not consider it officially adopted aftermath thumb left litas commemorative coin dedicated to 100th anniversary of great seimas of vilnius during night from december 5 to december 6 petras vileisis printed 36 000 copies of resolution for distribution after assembly notorious for its loud lengthy and intense debates delegates returned to their communities and started to carry out its resolutions old russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of 280 volosts 82 in kaunas 33 in suvalkai and 10 in vilnius governorates these communities elected their own representatives organized their own schools where classes were taught in lithuanian language and stopped paying taxes while first russian responses were disorganized and confused authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned situation back to normal process was relatively peaceful there were only a few clashes between armed groups of peasants and tsarist military forces unlike in neighboring latvia or estonia peasants did not rise against their landlords a number of most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to siberia lithuanian democratic party and used seimas as an opportunity to organize peasant union which largely represented interests of large and mid size farmers union helped spread influence of seimas into countryside a few days after seimas jonas basanavicius founded lithuanian national democratic party lithuanian partija first nationalistic party in lithuania plan for autonomy was not accomplished at this time but seimas was an important development in lithuanian bid for independence it consolidated efforts spearheaded organization of political parties strengthened national conscience and energized rural populace assembly resolutely rejected ideas to restore old grand duchy of lithuania and for first time voiced demands for autonomy many of political and religious rights that were granted by october manifesto were retained a
