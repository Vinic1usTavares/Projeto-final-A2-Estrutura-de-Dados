devil s advocate this album was based off movie devil s advocate not theme wise at all but just in feel of album devil s advocate is a very dark movie but at same time visually it s beautiful album is based off of that because i speak about harsh realities of street life but there s a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that if you just look at it at face value you might think it sounds a bit like he s glorifying street life but when you get tuned into record you realize that you get both sides of it in 2012 in an interview pusha t spoke on inspiration behind album title basically i tried to pick a title that embodied who i am as an artist i wanted people to understand like pusha is everything that i really really am actually there is a line in pain where i say my name is my name

my name is my name received widespread acclaim from critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album received an average score of 81 based on 27 reviews mike powell of rolling stone stated he s still a witty quietly vicious rapper capable of tearing apart spare street tracks like nosetalgia and numbers on board while barely raising his voice but set in more commercial contexts of kelly rowland features and dream s fluorescent r b he can sound like a fish out of some pretty expensive water who pusha was is gone but who he is still sometimes unclear david jeffries of allmusic said with pusha s pen at full force and his performance a proper combination of cold and tense album is as if clipse s hell hath no fury were atom smashed into something more artful and unstable my name is my name is a remarkable and vital solo debut jesse cataldo writing for slant magazine said yet despite its pedigree album puts too much overall emphasis on guest spots and not enough on establishing a distinctive identity for rapper full of retrograde lyrical conceits seemingly at odds with its futuristic backdrops my name is my name is a reminder that pusha t hasn t changed and his stubborn reliance on maintaining his brand is probably not wisest strategy in today s shifting hip hop climate jon hadusek of consequence of sound stated a few poor production choices and uneven sequencing do slow album but it shows flashes of real brilliance best tracks here are produced by kanye and pharrell and they re concentrated at beginning and end smattering in middle of tracklist is handled by host of collaborators not all of them effectively complimenting pusha s rawness while not defining statement it could ve been my name is my name shows different sides of pusha t as he becomes a more multidimensional rapper weekes of exclaim said a majority of my name is my name s sounds are wrapped in minimalistic saran wrap that allows pusha t s cold delivery to flourish with more abstract drug references than a paranoid dealer over a tapped phone line reed jackson writing for xxl stated certain songs like trap house anthem no regrets or early 2000s sounding let me love you are entertaining but don t have inventiveness or excitement of album s other tracks with standing at a lean 12 songs these missteps are hard to gloss over regardless pusha t accomplishes a lot here crafting a record that is big in concept but is still rooted in longstanding hip hop tradition that lyricism is king brandon soderberg of spin said don t tell king push but my name is my name bears a weird resemblance to drake s nothing was same here is another deeply considered collection of top shelf beats and uncompromising though still pop enough raps that justifies fairly awful personalities driving it which depending on your tolerance for wounded narcissism and a complete lack of insight is either fascinating or frustrating randall roberts of los angeles times stated album s haunting highlight and one of best hip hop tracks of year is last one called s n i t c h it thrives on understated tension as pusha and guest vocalist pharrell recount an interaction with an old friend who had decided to become a police informant it s perfect conclusion to a consistently surprising hip hop album lauren martin of fact gave album three and a half stars out of five saying in short on my name is my name pusha doesn t really give much away about his past present or future and it s a disconcerting thought for an album posited as a vanguard for a more real presentation of rap russ bengtson of complex said it s a never hit skip album made by a 36 year old rapper with more hunger than most 15 years his junior accolades closing out year my name is my name was named to multiple best albums of year lists it was ranked at number 33 on rolling stones list of 50 best albums of 2013 they commented saying cockier half of clipse didn t choose to go solo he had to after his brother found god pusha in turn found kanye west whose stark and twisted production helped make my name is my name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own yeezus it s year s sharpest hit of street philosophy complex named it third best album of 2013 they elaborated saying everything clicks because of way it was calculated songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other each track a background for next in that way it brings pusha t fan up to speed with what he s evolved into without leaving them in unfamiliar territory if you were reluctant we want that old pusha t fan then it fed you teaspoon of updated classic with medicine of his reinvention and by end you appreciated both sides nick catucci of entertainment weekly named it eighth best album of 2013 saying with these beats private stash stuff from likes of his label boss kanye west and pharrell williams he could sell fire in hell in fact pusha his emotional depths breaking down his parents divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother exclaim named it second best hip hop album of 2013 xxl named it fourth best album of 2013 they commented saying song for song it s tough to put any album in same category as pusha s proper solo debut in space of a trim 46 minutes push coaxed best verse of rick ross year on hold on made kendrick lamar get dark and grim on nosetalgia and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip hop track on king push all while keeping his lyricism at absolute highest level worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list if this is what a post yeezus world sounds like sign us up immediately spin positioned it at number 46 on their list of best 50 albums of 2013 they said push is in fighting form incorporating a mature point of view on his drug dealer past while rapping with confidence of a man who knows game is his to lose nme positioned it at number 48 on their list of 50 best albums of year they said my name is my name was moment clipse member pusha t finally hit home run he promised for so long beats snapped hard guests including kendrick lamar rick ross and 2 chainz glittered and overall vibe was dirty but triumphant paste ranked it number 34 on their list of 50 best albums of 2013 saying each bar has of a lion smelling scent of fresh blood among his contemporaries pusha t is sharp witted wordsmith who makes you feel like you re listening to a master at work devilishly cooking up something as pure and addictive as he possibly can it was named third best hip hop album of 2013 by popmatters they commented saying my name is my name is easily one of most impressive displays of lyricism of year and contains some of 2013 s best verses as pusha shows off his versatility production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn t overshadow pusha s performance beats are big and full of bass giving life to album and forming a unique theme with a reunion with pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia my name is my name has substance style and passion and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now consequence of sound positioned it at number 44 on their list of 50 best albums of year commercial performance my name is my name debuted at number 4 on us billboard 200 selling 74 000
