technology he will always be iron man cast robert downey jr as tony stark iron man a self described genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist with mechanical suits of armor of his own invention stark now struggles to come to terms with his near death experience in avengers suffering from anxiety attacks on making a third iron man film downey said my sense of it is that we need to leave it all on field whatever that means in end you can pick several different points of departure for that on following up avengers downey said they tried to be practical in a post avengers world what are his challenges now what are some limitations that might be placed on him and what sort of threat would have him as usual ignore those limitations screenwriter drew pearce compared tony to an american james bond for both being heroes with a sense of danger to them and le even if stark was a free agent instead of an authority figure like bond he also likened tony to protagonists of 1970s films such as french connection where idiosyncrasies of heroes is what made them exciting gwyneth paltrow as virginia pepper potts stark s girlfriend longtime associate and current ceo of stark industries paltrow says of her character s relationship to tony she still adores tony but she absolutely gets fed up with him he gets caught in a feedback loop kevin feige commented on pepper s role in film love triangle in this movie is really between tony pepper and suits tony pepper and his obsession with those suits and obsession with technology feige also stated that film uses character to play with damsel in distress trope and posits question is pepper in danger or is pepper savior don cheadle as james rhodey rhodes iron patriot stark s best friend and liaison between stark industries and u s air force in department of acquisitions rhodes operates redesigned upgraded war machine armor taking on an american flag inspired color scheme similar to iron patriot armor from comics feige said of rhodes and armor notion in movie is that a red white and blue suit is a bold statement and it s meant to be with rhodey he s very much foil to tony s eccentricities and in this one you get to see this and be reminded of trust and friendship between them in that great shane black buddy cop fashion in film president asks rhodey to take up moniker iron patriot and don red white and blue suit in order to be government s american hero in response to events in avengers guy pearce as aldrich killian creator of extremis virus and founder and owner of science and development organization advanced idea mechanics who adopts mantle of mandarin as his own killian develops extremis to cure his own debilitating disability in addition to his regenerative healing qualities he has superhuman strength and ability to generate extreme heat prolonged exposure to extremis also grants him ability to breathe fire on taking role pearce said i feel a little more experimental in what i ll take on these days but i still don t know that i would want to play superhero myself since i m playing a different kind of character in this film main difference was that when i did time machine i was pretty much in all of it so it was a really grueling experience prometheus and iron man are really kind of cameo stuff so experience of shooting them i mean on some level it s tricky because you feel like a bit of an outsider you don t really live experience that you do when you re there all day every day with everybody but at same time it can be more fun sometimes because you re just working in concentrated spurts pearce described his character as a man who came into this world with a number of physical disabilities he s never been able to accept those limitations though and has spent most of his life trying to overcome them in any way he can his tenacity and blind determination in fighting for a better life are seen by some as irritating as he often comes across as obnoxious he just won t accept cards he was dealt and being as intelligent as he is has real drive to change and become a different person shane black specified ultimately we do give you mandarin real guy but it s guy pearce in end with big dragon tattooed on his chest he elaborated do they hand me a blank check and say go break something or go violate some long standing comic book treaty that fans have supported for years no but they ll say let s break something together so it s okay to come up with these crazy things these far out ideas and they ll fly it s just that marvel guys have to be in room rebecca hall as maya hansen a geneticist whose work helped killian create extremis hall said hansen would be a strong female character and described her decision to take role saying i decided to do iron man 3 because i ve never done hurry up and wait movie before even studio movies i ve done have been small studio movies or indie films that we made on a wing and a prayer i love those but iron man is refreshing in a way because it s something out of my realm of experiences hall confirmed that her character s role was greatly reduced in final film saying i signed on to do something that was a substantial role she wasn t entirely villain there have been several phases of this but i signed on to do something very different to what i ended up doing ty simpkins as harley keener a boy who lives in rose hill tennessee he assists tony stark when latter breaks into his garage in order to repair his suit he later helps stark investigate various incidents associated with extremis project and afterwards he is rewarded by stark with a garage full of modern engineering tools and equipment simpkins reprises his role as harley in a cameo in avengers endgame simpkins has stated that he has a three picture deal with marvel studios stephanie szostak as ellen brandt a war veteran who becomes an assassin after her exposure to extremis describing brandt szostak says extremis was a second chance at life we talked about what you feel like and i think it almost makes you a fuller version of who you are all your weakness and your qualities just everything gets enhanced i saw it as very freeing almost you become your true self and your fantasy self all at once writers originally envisioned brandt as killian s main henchman which would return throughout movie to fight tony but eventually that role was reassigned to eric savin james badge dale as eric savin killian s extremis powered henchman dale stated that his character in film was loosely based on comic version of character according to dale ben kingsley is mouthpiece guy pearce is brain i m muscle jon favreau as happy hogan tony stark s former bodyguard and chauffeur who now serves as stark industries head of security department favreau who served as both actor and director on previous two iron man films said participating in new film was like being a proud grandfather who doesn t have to change diapers but gets to play with baby ben kingsley as trevor slattery a british actor whom killian hired to portray mandarin a terrorist persona in jammed television broadcasts in which he is depicted as leader of international terrorist organization ten rings kingsley was filming ender s game when he was cast and said that quite soon i ll be with everybody and we ll be discussing look and feel and direction of character it s very early days yet but i m so thrilled to be on board on his performance kingsley stated i wanted a voice that would disconcert a western audience i wanted a voice that would sound far more homegrown and familiar a familiarity like a teacher s voice or a preacher s voice rhythms and tones of an earnest almost benign teacher trying to educate people for their own good mandarin was initially set to appear in first iron man film but he was put off for a sequel as filmmakers felt that he was too ambitious for a first film on character feige stated mandarin is iron man s most famous foe in comics mainly because he s been around longest if you look there s not necessarily a definitive mandarin storyline in comics so it was really about having an idea shane black explains that ben kingsley s mandarin is not chinese in film as he is in comics in order to avoid fu manchu stereotype we re not saying he s chinese we re saying he in fact draws a cloak around him of chinese symbols and dragons because it represents his obsessions with sun tzu in various ancient arts of warfare that he studied filmmakers also cited colonel kurtz from apocalypse now as an influence for character videos where mandarin gives historical background to attacks expressed how it emerged as product of a think tank of people trying to create a modern terrorist thus mandarin represents every terrorist in a way from south american insurgency tactics to videos of osama bin laden paul bettany reprises his role from previous films as j a r v i s stark s ai system ashley hamilton portrays taggart one of extremis soldiers william sadler plays president ellis named after warren ellis who wrote extremis comics arc that primarily influenced film s story and miguel ferrer plays vice president rodriguez adam plays gary a cameraman who helps stark shaun toub reprises his role as from first iron man film in a brief cameo and stan lee makes a cameo appearance as a beauty pageant judge dale dickey plays mrs davis mother of an extremis subject that is framed as a terrorist wang xueqi briefly plays dr wu in general release version of film a cut of film produced for release exclusively in china includes additional scenes featuring wang and an appearance by fan bingbing as one of his assistants mark ruffalo makes an uncredited cameo appearance reprising his role as bruce banner from avengers in a post credits scene comedians bill maher and joan rivers and fashion police co host george have cameo appearances as themselves on their respective real world television programs as do newscasters josh elliott megan henderson pat kiernan and thomas roberts production development following release of iron man 2 a conflict between paramount pictures which had distribution rights to certain marvel properties and walt disney company marvel entertainment s then new corporate parent clouded timing and distribution arrangement of a possible third film on october 18 2010 walt disney studios agreed to pay paramount at least 115 million for worldwide distribution rights to iron man 3 with disney marvel and paramount announcing a may 3 2013 release date for film iron man and iron man 2 director jon favreau said in december 2010 that he would not direct iron man 3 opting to direct magic kingdom instead he remained an executive producer of director joss whedon s crossover film avengers and also served as an executive producer of iron man 3 also in 2010 downey reached out to shane black who directed him in 2005 s kiss kiss bang bang to write and direct film in february 2011 black entered final negotiations to join project and in march it was announced that drew pearce who marvel had originally hired for a runaways script would work with black on script downey said bringing in shane black to write and direct iron man 3 to me is basically only transition from favreau to a next thing that favreau and audience and marvel and i could ever actually sign off on writing shane black described his take on film as not being two men in iron suits fighting each other and more like a tom clancy thriller with iron man fighting real world type villains drew pearce added that they would avert magic and space with iron man 3 being a techno thriller set in a more real world than even avengers duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting script while writing focus was to avoid scenes of pure exposition making every moment propel other narrative points forward some elements from comics were used even if in different connotations such as making rhodes wear norman osborn s iron patriot armor and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in marvel universe such as eric savin and jack taggart film s plot is influenced primarily from extremis 2005 2006 iron man comics storyline written by warren ellis first two acts would remain character centric albeit in shane black s words more hectic frenetic and large scale to fulfill its sequel obligations with third act going for more over top action to what drew pearce described as giving a sense of opera middle act was compared to sullivan s travels in having tony meeting various people on his journey and writers made sure to not make characters too similar initial draft had maya hansen herself leading villainous operation with mandarin and killian emerging as antagonists in later versions of script during one of writing sessions pearce suggested that mandarin was a fake and black agreed by going with making him an actor which in turn pearce detailed as an overacting british stage performer black explained who would be fool enough to declare that is an international terrorist if you re smart whatever regime you re part of you d put a puppet committee and remain your house in turn killian would hide slattery in his own frat house in kind of a drug related house arrest to keep secret alive according to black reveal of actual villain being hansen was like remington steele you think it s man but at end woman has been running whole show role was eventually shifted to killian because of objections by marvel entertainment executives who were concerned with apparent merchandising losses that could come with having a female villain roles of several other major female characters were also made smaller in final film compared to earlier drafts both opening and ending of film were reworked in various ways first it would begin with a flashback to tony s childhood then like iron man it would begin in medias res with tony crashing in tennessee before a voice over that would lead to how he got there until it got changed to final version for climactic tanker battle it was originally considered that brandt would show up in james bond tradition of henchman coming back for heroes instead they chose to use killian himself and have pepper whom he abused earlier cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice final dialogue was originally written as i am tony stark to be a response to first film s ending but eventually it changed to i am iron man to enhance mythical qualities on setting film around christmas black said i think it s a sense of if you re doing something on an interesting scale that involves an entire universe of characters one way to unite them is to have them all undergo a common experience there s something at christmas that unites everybody and it already sets a stage within stage that wherever you are you re experiencing this world together i think that also there s something just pleasing about it to me pearce added that he would have wanted to see a third iron man film set at christmas adding that when you re telling a story about taking characters apart it almost has more resonance if you put it at christmas and if you re also telling a story about lonelier characters as well that loneliness is heightened at christmas black also felt character harley keener embodied ghost of christmas past for stark pre production in september 2011 marvel studios reached an agreement to shoot film primarily out of eue screen gems studios in wilmington north carolina michigan was also in contention to land production but michigan film office could not match north carolina s tax incentives in april 2012 ben kingsley entered into negotiations to play a villain in iron man 3 following week producer kevin feige revealed that iron man 3 would begin shooting in north carolina in five weeks and said that it is a full on tony stark centric movie very much inspired by first half of iron man h e s stripped

dolby atmos to enhance immersive experience music film is scored by brian tyler who signed on in october 2012 according to tyler he was approached more for his thematic scores such as greatest game ever played annapolis and partition rather than his modern action scores such as fast and furious films with kevin feige asking a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones to employ deeply thematic component with a strong melody score employs mostly orchestra sounds main theme for iron man focuses on horns and trumpets to be both a march and anthem tyler mentioned that john williams work in raiders of lost ark was first thing he thought of as an influence and cue for well of souls in raiders influenced extremis motif as tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a technology so advanced that nears magic echoing mandarin s amalgamated personality his theme was religious music that borrows from many cultures from monastic gothic and christian chants to music from middle east score was recorded with london philharmonic orchestra at abbey road studios tyler is third primary composer to score an iron man film following ramin djawadi of iron man and

consensus reads with help of its charismatic lead some impressive action sequences and even a few surprises iron man 3 is a witty entertaining adventure and a strong addition to marvel canon metacritic gave a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 44 critics indicating generally favorable reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale same score as both its predecessors in an early review by trade magazine hollywood reporter todd mccarthy said that after nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010 iron man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment that benefits immeasurably from irreverent quicksilver humor of co writer and director shane black calling film darker and more serious than its predecessors kenneth turan of los angeles times credited black for chang ing this billion dollar plus franchise s tone for better while keeping same actor as tony stark there is quite a bit of black s trademark attitude and humor here as well things like a throwaway reference to sci fi classic westworld and a goofy character who has tony stark s likeness tattooed on his forearm black and company throw all kinds of stuff at audience and though it doesn t all work a lot of it does and attempt to be different and create twists is always appreciated rafer guzman of newsday characterized iron man as anti batman all zip and zingers he s also suddenly rather family friendly some of movie s best moments are shared by stark and kid harley ty simpkins who mock their budding father son relationship while acting it out psychology today concluded that film presented an accurate portrayal of tony stark s posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms michael arbeiter of hollywood com praised film as marvel s first true action comedy commenting that tony s camaraderie with preteen tech geek harley keener is one gigantic superhero 90s kid sidekick laugh riot friggin kid s name is harley keener is there anything more 90s kid sidekick sounding than that nick de semlyen of uk film magazine empire had criticisms even while giving film four of five stars finding it a swinging caper with wit balls heart and exploding baubles he said villainous super soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage are visually interesting but their motivation is murky and unconvincing likewise joshua rothkopf of time out new york bestowed 3 of 5 stars saying black has massively upped verbal sparring and kept broad inventiveness of comic book malleability in mind most wonderful of black s surprises harkens back to his 80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here but he asked w hy finally are we down at docks in dark no less for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes energy bleeds out of film it s as if producers were scared crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness reacting more negatively stephen whitty of star ledger found film slickly enjoyable for visual effects but said t here s something empty about film like tony s suits it s shiny and polished but this time there s nobody inside this movie has neither emotionalism of first film nor flashy villains of second tony s relationship with girlfriend pepper potts is in inexplicable jeopardy and then simply fixes itself a supposedly cute kid sidekick a true sign of authorial desperation is introduced and then dropped michael phillips of chicago tribune echoed this saying i n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience a few years too young for violence in iron man 3 i d say stark befriends a bullied 8 year old ty simpkins who becomes his tag along and sometime savior stark no longer needs to be in iron man suit he s able to operate thing remotely when needed movie s like that too it s decent superhero but rather remote and vaguely secondhand at this point even with black s flashes of black humor machinery is more or less taking care of itself offering roughly half of genial wit and enjoyment of first iron man accolades year award film festival category recipient s result 2013 golden trailer awards best in show
