hms invincible was lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for royal navy during first decade of twentieth century and first battlecruiser to be built by any country in world during first world war she participated in battle of heligoland bight in a minor role as she was oldest and slowest of british battlecruisers present during battle of falkland islands invincible and her sister ship sank armoured cruisers and almost without loss to themselves despite numerous hits by german ships she was flagship of 3rd battlecruiser squadron during battle of jutland in 1916 squadron had been detached from admiral beatty s battlecruiser fleet a few days before battle for gunnery practice with grand fleet and acted as its heavy scouting force during battle she was destroyed by a magazine explosion during battle after armour of one of her gun turrets was penetrated design and description invincible was significantly larger than her armoured cruiser predecessors of she had an overall length of a beam of and a draft of at deep load she displaced at load and at deep load nearly more than earlier ships roberts pp 43 44 invincible class ships were formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an admiralty order of 24 november 1911 unofficially a number of designations were used until then including cruiser battleship dreadnought cruiser and battle cruiser roberts pp 24 25 propulsion invincible had two paired sets of parsons turbines each of which was housed in a separate engine room and drove an outboard and inboard shaft high pressure ahead and astern turbines were coupled to outboard shafts and low pressure turbines to inner shafts a cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft these were not used often and were eventually disconnected her three bladed propellers were in diameter on inner shafts while outer propellers were in diameter turbines were powered by thirty one yarrow water tube boilers in four boiler rooms roberts pp 70 75 and were designed to produce a total of but reached nearly during trials in 1908 she was designed for but reached during trials roberts pp 76 80 invincible carried of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on coal to increase its burn rate roberts p 76 at full fuel capacity she could steam for at a speed of gardiner and gray p 24 her electrical power was provided by four 200 kw turbo generators and motor generators with capacity of 100 kw armament invincible carried eight bl mk x guns in four twin turrets for evaluation purposes these were electrically driven bix and bx turrets two each built by vickers and armstrongs roberts p 83 they proved to be a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at a cost of ps151 200 situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in october 1908 that captain of royal navy s chief gunnery school described their operation in following manner when order was given to train turret elevate or run a gun in or out it was only necessary to push a button or move a switch but result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill turret admiral sir reginald tupper quoted in roberts p 85 her secondary armament consisted of sixteen qf mk iii guns during 1915 turret roof guns were transferred to superstructure and total number of guns was reduced to twelve all of remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect gun crews from weather and enemy action roberts pp 96 97 her anti aircraft armament consisted of a single qf 3 inch 20 cwt aa gun on a high angle mkii mount at aft end of superstructure that was carried between october november 1914 and from april 1915 onwards a 3 pounder hotchkiss gun on a high angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60deg was also mounted in november 1914 five 18 in 450 mm submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on invincibles two on each side and one in stern fourteen torpedoes were carried for them armour waterline belt was 6 inches thick roughly between fore and aft 12 inch gun turrets but was reduced to four inches from fore turret to bow and did not extend aft of rear turret gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour except for turret roofs which used of krupp non cemented armour knc thickness of main deck was and lower deck armour was mild steel torpedo bulkheads of 2 5 inch thickness were fitted abreast magazines and shell rooms roberts pp 109 112 construction and career thumb invincible anchored at spithead in june july 1909 ship was built at sir w g armstrong whitworth co ltd on tyneside she was laid down on 2 april 1906 and launched at 15 00 on 13 april 1907 by lady allendale times london monday 15 april 1907 p 10 on 28 december 1907 while still fitting out she was hit by swedish collier oden which resulted in buckling of beams and frames in hull and five bottom plates being stove in tarrant p 17 she was officially completed on 16 march 1909 on 18 march she sailed from tyne to portsmouth where she would be commissioned on way she collided with brigantine mary ann and stood by until lifeboat john birch arrived from yarmouth to take brigantine in tow tarrant p 18 she was commissioned into 1st cruiser squadron of home fleet on 20 march 1909 and participated in fleet manoeuvres in april and june 1909 spithead review on 12 june 1909 times london saturday 12 june 1909 p 7 and fleet review off southend on 2 july she was refitted between 17 august and 17 january 1910 in an attempt to cure electrical problems with her turrets but they were still unsatisfactory another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in spring of 1911 but this too was unsuccessful and decision was made following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power this was delayed until after her deployment to join mediterranean fleet at end of 1912 on 17 march 1913 she collided with submarine but collision was ruled fault of submarine she returned to uk in december 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle worthy tarrant p 26 first world war her refit at portsmouth dockyard began in march 1914 and was interrupted by declaration of war on germany on 4 august she d been formally recommissioned day prior but turret work required another week to complete invincible was first battlecruiser to be fitted with a new fire control director but this could not be completed in allotted time and would remain inoperable until she was refitted after battle of falkland islands roberts pp 92 93 122 she was declared operational on 12 august when rear admiral sir archibald gordon moore commanding 2nd battlecruiser squadron hoisted his flag in her he was ordered to humber along with battlecruiser where he could better support british ships patrolling broad fourteens tarrant pp 29 30 battle of heligoland bight invincibles first action was as part of battlecruiser force under command of admiral beatty during battle of heligoland bight operation on 28 august 1914 beatty s ships had originally been intended as distant support of british cruisers and destroyers closer to german coast in case large units of high seas fleet sortied in response to british attacks they turned south at full speed at 11 times used in this section are in coordinated greenwich mean time which is one hour behind cet which is often used in german works when british light forces failed to disengage on schedule and rising tide meant that german capital ships would be able to clear bar at mouth of jade estuary brand new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in battle and was under fire from german light cruisers and when beatty s battlecruisers loomed out of mist at 12 37 strassburg was able to duck into mists and evade fire but coln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from squadron beatty was distracted from task of finishing her off by sudden appearance of elderly light cruiser directly to his front he turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range under at 13 10 beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire massie pp 109 113 at this time invincible trailing main body of battlecruisers opened fire on coln she fired 18 rounds all misses tarrant p 33 before beatty s main body encountered crippled coln shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from battle of falklands west indies squadron of rear admiral christopher cradock was destroyed by german german east asia squadron commanded by vice admiral graf maximilian von spee during battle of coronel on 1 november 1914 in response admiralty ordered that a squadron be sent to destroy germans squadron under command of vice admiral sir doveton sturdee consisted of invincible flag and inflexible they departed on 11 november and rendezvoused with several other cruisers under rear admiral stoddard at abrolhos rocks off coast of brazil on 26th they departed following day and reached port stanley in falklands on morning of 7 december massie pp 248 251 spee making a leisurely voyage back to atlantic wanted to destroy radio station at port stanley and sent armoured cruiser and light cruiser to see if harbour was clear of british warships on morning of 8 december they were spotted at 07 30 although pre dreadnought grounded in stanley harbour to defend town and its wireless station did not receive signal until 07 45 sturdee was not expecting an engagement and most of his ships were coaling and hence temporarily defenceless armoured cruiser and light cruiser had one or both of their engines under repair armed merchant cruiser macedonian was patrolling outer harbour entrance while armoured cruiser was anchored in outer harbour scheduled to relieve macedonian at 08 00 german ships were not expecting resistance and first salvo from guns at 09 20 caused them to sheer off from their bombardment of wireless station and fall back on spee s main body massie pp 254 261 sturdee s ships did not sortie from harbour until 09 50 although they could see retreating german ships on southwest horizon invincibles fresh out of dry dock had a advantage over spee s ships which all had fouled bottoms that limited their speeds to no more than light cruiser lagged behind other ships and inflexible opened fire when range dropped to at 12 55 invincible opened fire shortly afterward and both ships began straddling leipzig as range closed to at 13 20 spee ordered his squadron to separate and ordered his light cruisers to turn to southwest while his armoured cruisers turned north east to cover their retreat german ships opened fire at 13 30 and scored their first hit at 13 44 when struck invincible though shell burst harmlessly on belt armour both sides fired rapidly during first half hour of engagement before sturdee opened up distance to put his ships outside effective range of german guns british gunnery was very poor scoring only four hits out of 210 rounds fired primary cause was smoke from guns and funnels since british were downwind of germans massie pp 261 266 though one gun of invincibles a turret jammed at 13 42 and was out of action for thirty minutes tarrant p 61 right thumb invincible underway spee turned to south in an attempt to disengage while british had their vision obscured but only opened range to before his course change was spotted british battlecruisers gave chase at forty minutes later british opened fire again at eight minutes later spee turned again to east to give battle his strategy was to close range so he could bring his secondary armament into play he was successful and 15 cm guns were able to open fire at 15 00 at maximum elevation smoke bothered both sides but multiple hits were scored those of german ships either failed to detonate or hit armoured areas however gneisenau s starboard engine room was put out of action sturdee ordered his ships at 15 15 to cross their own wakes to gain windward advantage spee turned to northwest as if to attempt to cross british t but actually to bring scharnhorsts undamaged starboard guns to bear as most of those on his port side were now out of action british continued to hit scharnhorst and gneisenau regularly and scharnhorst ceased fire at 4 00 before capsizing at 16 17 with no survivors gneisenau had been slowed by earlier damage and was battered for another hour and a half by inflexible and invincible at ranges down to despite damage her crew continued to fire back until she ceased firing at 16 47 her ammunition exhausted sturdee was ready to order cease fire at 17 15 when an ammunition hoist was freed up and she made her last shot british then pounded her until 17 50 after her captain had given order to scuttle her at 5 40 she slowly capsized at 18 00 and british were able to rescue 176 men from freezing waters massie pp 261 273 invincible had fired 513 shells from her main guns during battle gardiner and gray p 25 but had been hit twenty two times two of her bow compartments were flooded and one hit on her waterline abreast p turret had flooded a coal bunker and temporarily given her a 15deg list nevertheless only one man had been killed and five wounded aboard battlecruisers massie p 280 after battle invincible made temporary repairs at port stanley and headed for gibraltar where she could be drydocked for more permanent repairs this took a month and opportunity was taken to extend height of her fore funnel by to reduce amount of smoke blocking visibility from bridge and spotting top invincible sailed to england on 15 february 1915 and joined grand fleet on 21 february british battlecruiser force was organised into three squadrons of battlecruiser fleet with 3rd battlecruiser squadron bcs that was to consist of three invincible class ships once inflexible arrived from mediterranean she was refitted between 25 april and 12 may to have four worn out 12 inch guns replaced and secondary armament reduced and given casemates rear admiral horace hood took command of 3rd bcs on 27 may 1915 and hoisted his flag in invincible tarrant pp 76 80 84 1st and 3rd bcs had sortied in response to german bombardment of yarmouth and lowestoft on 24 25 april 1916 but failed to locate german ships in heavy weather during return home invincible was rammed by patrol yacht at 23 07 bow was embedded in invincibles side which partially stove in invincibles speed was reduced to through flooding and she was forced to haul out of line and proceed independently to rosyth for repairs which lasted until 22 may 1916 tarrant pp 95 96 battle of jutland thumb left invincible exploding at jutland taken from a destroyer nearby some naval historians believe that this photo was doctored with from a peacetime photo main reasons are absence of a bow wave no shell splashes from german salvoes and destroyers ahead of her which do not match any battle descriptions source at end of may 1916 3rd battlecruiser squadron was temporarily assigned to grand fleet for gunnery practice on 30 may entire grand fleet along with admiral beatty s battlecruisers had been ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by german high seas fleet in order to support beatty admiral hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of grand fleet at about 14 30 invincible intercepted a radio message from british light cruiser attached to beatty s battlecruiser force reporting sighting of two enemy cruisers this was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through skagerrak and ordered an increase in speed to at 15 11 and steered east southeast to cut off fleeing ships twenty minutes later invincible intercepted a message from beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging enemy on a south easterly course at 16 06 hood ordered full speed and a course of south southeast in an attempt to converge on beatty at 16 56 with no british ships in sight hood requested beatty s course position and speed but never received a reply tarrant pp 98 99 hood continued on course until 17 40 when gunfire was spotted in direction to which his light cruiser had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes chester encountered four light cruisers of hipper s 2nd scouting group and was badly damaged before hood turned to investigate and was able to drive german cruisers away from chester at 17 53 invincible opened fire on and other two invincibles followed two minutes later german ships turned for south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18 00 and attempted to find shelter in mist as they turned invincible hit wiesbaden in engine room and knocked out her engines while inflexible hit once 2nd scouting group was escorted by light cruiser and 31 destroyers of 2nd and 9th flotillas and 12th half flotilla which attacked 3rd bcs in succession they were driven off by hood s remaining light cruiser and five destroyers of his escort in a confused action germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled destroyer with gunfire having turned due west to close on beatty s ships three invincible class battlecruisers were broadside to oncoming torpedoes but invincible turned north while inflexible and indomitable turned south to present their narrowest profile to torpedoes all torpedoes missed although one passed underneath inflexible without detonating as invincible turned north her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix problem but this was quickly done and squadron reformed heading west tarrant pp 103 105 right thumb two shattered halves of invincible temporarily standing on seabed at 18 21 with both beatty and grand fleet converging on him hood turned south to lead beatty s battlecruisers hipper s battlecruisers were away and invincibles almost immediately opened fire on hipper s flagship and indomitable hit derfflinger three times and seydlitz once campbell pp 185 87 while lutzow quickly took 10 hits from inflexible and invincible including two hits below waterline forward by invincible that would ultimately doom her campbell p 183 at 18 30 invincible abruptly appeared as a clear target before lutzow and derfflinger two german ships then fired three salvoes each at invincible and sank her in 90 seconds at least one 305 mm 12 inch shell from third salvo struck her
