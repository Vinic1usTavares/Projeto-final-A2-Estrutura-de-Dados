museum of curiosity formerly titled professor of curiosity is a comedy talk show on bbc radio 4 that was first broadcast on 20 february 2008 it is hosted by john lloyd professor of ignorance at university of buckingham and later at southampton solent university he acts as head of fictional titular museum while a panel of three guests typically a comedian an author and an academic each donate to museum an object that fascinates them radio medium ensures that suggested exhibits can be absolutely anything limited only by guests imaginations bill bailey acted as co host of programme in first series under title of curator of museum bailey left show after he initially decided to retire from panel games and was replaced by sean lock in second series each subsequent series has seen a different comedian take over as sidekick curator with jon richardson dave gorman jimmy carr humphrey ker phill jupitus sarah millican noel fielding jo brand ranganathan sally phillips lee mack and bridget christie assuming role in third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth and fourteenth series respectively gorman also stood in for richardson for one episode of third series after richardson was stranded due to eruption of eyjafjallajokull ker also functioned as a stand in this time for jimmy carr when carr was unable to attend one episode in series 5 programme has often been compared to television panel game qi both were co created by lloyd several of museum s curators and comic guests have appeared regularly on qi and qi elves qi s research team who provide hosts stephen fry and sandi toksvig with live information as required during programme provide research as a result some critics consider radio show to be a spin off of tv programme and some have further ventured that museum of curiosity is not as good as its forerunner most reviews of museum of curiosity however are positive format in series one programme began with bailey introducing show and playing its theme tune which he performed in a slightly different way in each episode in subsequent series theme tune was instead performed by house of strange studios of east london host professor and curator sidekick introduce themselves they then give a short guide to museum followed by introduction of advisory committee a guest panel made up of celebrities and academic experts during which lloyd reads their cvs aloud this introductory section takes up about half programme then each member of committee donates something to museum donation can be anything regardless of its size cost tangibility or even existence examples of donations include a yeti battle of waterloo and absolutely nothing lloyd and curator then decide what form exhibit could take and where in museum it could be displayed in series one programme ended either with lloyd and bailey reading audience suggestions for additional exhibits or asking audience curious questions bailey ended show by giving a humorous comment on a bertrand russell quote both of these ideas were dropped in series two from series two onward show has maintained a standard format it is presented in two halves in first half lloyd and curator introduce three guests provide an explanation of who they are and five engage in a general discussion in second half curator declares museum open for donations and each guest explains what they wish to donate to museum again as museum is fictional nothing is actually exchanged questioning of all three guests ensures that everyone says something about each donation

to series was mixed phil in guardian described show as being unusual and eclectic chris campling who wrote a preview of first episode highlighted it in his radio choice column for times gillian reynolds highlighted programme as one of her radio choices in daily telegraph rosanna in scotland on sunday compared show positively to qi also created by lloyd while frances lass from radio times said it was better claiming it was qi with even more jokes made me bark with laughter that lord reith would be so proud and programme was pornography for brain miranda sawyer of observer criticised show saying that it s no qi because joy of that programme rests almost entirely in host stephen fry and his subversion of prissy clever character we re familiar with in qi fry is clever but relaxed museum of curiosity is presented partly by bill bailey and mostly by john lloyd producer of qi are you getting a theme lloyd may well be a nice chap but we haven t a clue who he is and on evidence of this he isn t a big or witty enough character for us to feel desperate to get to know him nicholas lezard in independent on sunday was lukewarm about show saying that combination of comedian and scientist guests more or less worked but he felt show may not have been greenlit without lloyd and bailey s involvement kate chisholm in spectator found show a welcome change from smutty jokes and banal innuendo usually associated with timeslot and compared series to paul merton s room 101 but without ego elisabeth mahoney in guardian was critical of second series while praising discussion between guests as funny and flowing and quite endearingly quirky she found that programme fizzled away when it reached what ought to have been its crux donation of kooky items to imaginary museum instead we had a reminder of what they were and then a sudden ending that was both limp and abrupt after appearing on show in series 6 richard herring wrote on his blog what a delightful and fascinating programme this is and one that i think might benefit from an extended podcast release two hours of material is recorded for 27 minute show and it s pretty much all gold at times i was so enjoying listening to others talking that i almost forgot that i was meant to be taking part it was a wide ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts pianists with crippling mechanical little fingers changing meridian and okapi sex can you guess what i contributed show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and i love way it has a panel comprising comedians scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of different disciplines while most tv panel shows including to some extent even qi gravitate to putting in same well known comedy faces you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit zoologist dr christofer clemente came up with funniest lines of show but would they book him on mock week it s intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of tv and even radio leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in i discussed this with one of razor minded team after show tv companies insist on getting big names into all shows which takes up all budget and seems to ignore fact that pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring but glad that a few shows designed to expand mind rather than crush spirit still exist on 13 september 2016 museum of curiosity won rose d or in radio talk show category footnotes references external
