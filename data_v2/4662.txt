siege of kamarja was fought in 729 between arab muslims of umayyad caliphate and turgesh khaganate along with its soghdian allies umayyad conquest of transoxiana had been undone in 720s by uprisings of local soghdian princes and turgesh invasions by 729 small fortress of kamarja near samarkand in modern uzbekistan was one of last remaining arab strongholds in transoxiana when it was attacked by turgesh under personal direction of their ruler suluk subsequent siege for which a detailed account survives in history of al tabari lasted for 58 days and ended with negotiated withdrawal of its garrison to samarkand stubborn defence of kamarja was celebrated in arabic literature but arab hold over region was broken after battle of defile two years later it was only following collapse of turgesh khaganate after 738 that arabs re established their rule over transoxiana background region of transoxiana arabic ma wara al nahr had been conquered by umayyad leader qutayba ibn muslim in reign of al walid i r 705 715 following muslim conquests of persia and khurasan in mid 7th century loyalty to caliphate of transoxiana s native iranian and turkic populations and of autonomous local rulers remained questionable and in 719 latter requested aid from chinese and their turgesh vassals in response from 720 on turgesh launched a series of attacks against muslims in transoxiana coupled with uprisings against caliphate among local soghdians umayyad governors initially managed to suppress unrest although control over ferghana valley was lost in 724 governor muslim ibn sa id al kilabi and his army suffered a heavy defeat so called day of thirst at hands of turgesh when he tried to recapture ferghana this defeat pushed arabs on defensive and even though no pitched battles took place over next few years arab position in transoxiana collapsed swiftly by 728 in face of turgesh attacks and a widespread anti arab revolt only samarkand and two fortresses of kamarja and dabusiyya on zarafshan river remained in arab hands in all of transoxiana siege in 729 new arab governor ashras ibn abdallah al sulami managed to cross oxus river and reach bukhara against stiff opposition by turgesh and their soghdian allies arab victory was narrow and turgesh were able to withdraw unmolested back towards region of samarkand which brought them near arab fortress of kamarja a fortified town some seven farsakhs roughly west of samarkand subsequent siege of kamarja narrated in al tabari s history of prophets and kings is in words of historian hugh n kennedy one of most vividly described set pieces of war turgesh army under khagan suluk which included contingents of ferghana al taraband capital of shash modern tashkent a town near samarkand and bukhara approached along bukhara samarkand road when they reached kamarja turgesh and their allies left road and made camp but town s garrison was unaware of their approach as their movements were screened by a hill next morning when arabs took their animals out to water them and climbed hill they were amazed to encounter mountain of steel of their enemies army as al tabari writes arabs sent some of their animals down hill towards river to lure turgesh that way and hastened back to town turgesh soon discovered them and began pursuit but arabs knew terrain better and managed to reach town and find refuge behind its earthworks just before their pursuers caught up with them a fierce fight developed as turgesh attacked gates and tried to enter town until arabs threw burning bundles of wood at them driving them back across moat in evening turgesh withdrew and arabs burned wooden bridge that spanned moat khagan then sent two emissaries to besieged first to approach wall was khosrau a grandson of last sassanid persian ruler yazdegerd iii r 632 651 khosrau s father peroz had fled to tang court in china and now khosrau accompanied turgesh in hopes of recovering his ancestral throne when he approached garrison he urged them to surrender and offered them a safe conduct while proclaiming restoration of his realm arabs however indignantly refused to hear him and hurled abuses at him as orientalist scholar h a r gibb writes presence of khosrau might be taken as an indication that rebels were receiving encouragement from china also though chinese records are silent on this expedition after khosrau s failure khagan sent a local bazaghari to parley with garrison bringing a few arab captives along with him to intimidate them khagan offered to take up arab garrison into his own army doubling their salary but this proposal too was rejected with disdain by arab negotiator yazid ibn sa id al bahili chosen because he spoke a little turkish with words how can arabs who are wolves be with turgesh who are sheep his reply infuriated bazaghari s companions who threatened to kill him so yazid offered to split garrison up one half with their portable wealth would be allowed to retreat safely while other half would remain in service with turgesh bazaghari accepted this offer and sent yazid back to convey terms to garrison but once he was back inside wall he rejected terms and exhorted his fellow arabs to resist khagan then ordered his men to fill moat with green wood so that it would not burn which garrison countered by throwing in dry wood as well after six days when moat was full arabs set it afire aided by a strong wind hard work of turgesh was put to nought arab archers also proved effective exacting a heavy toll among turgesh including bazaghari turgesh then executed a hundred arab captives in full view of garrison in response arabs killed 200 young locals they held as hostages despite their desperate resistance narrative of siege in al tabari evidently drawing from eyewitness accounts continues with isolated episodes determined turgesh assault on gate with five of them managing to climb wall before being repelled soghdian prince of al taraband who with his companions assaulted a breach in wall which led into a house only to be killed by house s elderly and sick owner and his family how arabs used wooden boards lining irrigation ditches to improve their earthworks or time when khagan coming to inspect arab fortifications received an arrow shot in face but was saved by his helmet s nose guard stubborn defence of garrison irritated khagan who blamed his soghdian allies for claiming that there were fifty donkeys in this town and that we would take it in five days but now five days have become two months at length khagan resumed negotiations and offered safe conduct for either dabusiyya or samarkand which were still in arab hands garrison sent a rider to samarkand to ask for advice and was told to choose dabusiyya which was closer to kamarja after fifty eight days out of which according to al tabari garrison did not water their camels for thirty five days siege was over arabs and turgesh exchanged five hostages each including one of suluk s most important nobles kursul after mutual massacre of captives early in siege arabs mistrust was such that they refused to leave until khagan and his army had departed and an arab with a dagger in his hand was seated behind each of turgesh hostages who wore no armour as arab garrison of kamarja approached dabusiyya latter s garrison at first believed that kamarja had fallen and that soldiers coming towards them were turgesh but as they arrayed themselves for battle a rider sent by kamarja troops alerted them as to real situation and men of al dabusiyya galloped forward to carry whoever was too weak to walk or was wounded at this hostages began being released with arabs sending a hostage back and turgesh in turn releasing one of hostages they held in end when last two hostages were left neither side was willing to let its own hostage go first until arab hostage volunteered to go last for this act of chivalry he was richly rewarded by kursul with a suit of armour and a horse aftermath as gibb writes fame of defence of kamarja spread far and wide but it brought little relief to pressure on arabs almost all of transoxiana except for bukhara and samarkand was lost and even in neighbouring a revolt broke out which was nonetheless swiftly suppressed by local arab settlers samarkand remained last major outpost of arab rule deep in soghdia and subsequent operations by both sides focused around it it was while attempting to relieve turgesh siege of city in 731 that arabs suffered calamitous battle of defile which was followed by complete collapse of arab position in transoxiana arabs were not able to recover until murder of suluk in 738 which led to outbreak of civil war and brought about rapid decline of turgesh power in 739 741 under governorship of nasr ibn sayyar arabs managed to re establish caliphate s authority up to samarkand references sources category 720s conflicts category 729 kamarja kamarja kamarja category samarqand region category 720s in umayyad caliphate
