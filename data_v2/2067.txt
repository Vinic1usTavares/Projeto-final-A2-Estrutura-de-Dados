phellodon is a genus of tooth fungi in family bankeraceae species have small to medium sized fruitbodies with white spines on underside from which spores are released all phellodon have a short stalk or stipe and so genus falls into group known as stipitate hydnoid fungi tough and leathery flesh usually has a pleasant fragrant odor and develops a cork like texture when dry neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together sometimes producing large mats of joined caps phellodon species produce a white spore print while individual spores are roughly spherical to ellipsoid in shape with spiny surfaces genus with about 20 described species has a distribution that includes to asia europe north america south america australia and new zealand about half of species are found in southeastern united states including three species added to genus in 2013 14 several phellodon species were placed on a preliminary red list of threatened british fungi because of a general decline of genus in europe species grow in a symbiotic mycorrhizal association with trees from families fagaceae beeches and oaks and pinaceae pines accurate dna based methods have been developed to determine presence of phellodon species in soil even in extended absence of visible fruitbodies although phellodon fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh type species p niger is used in mushroom dyeing taxonomy phellodon was circumscribed in 1881 by finnish mycologist petter karsten to contain white toothed fungi karsten included three species p p melaleucus and type p niger originally published with epithet nigrum p nigrum was originally described by elias fries in 1815 as a species of hydnum some early authors did not consider phellodon distinct enough to be a separate genus and folded species assigned to this genus into hydnellum hydnellum is classified in family bankeraceae which was circumscribed by marinus anton donk in 1961 donk s original family concept included genera bankera and phellodon whose species produce hyaline translucent and echinulate spores covered with small spines donk also noted that bankeraceae species lacked clamp connections when clamp connections were discovered in phellodon fibulatus and tuberculate spore ornamentation presence of small nodules on spores was found in p niger kenneth harrison thought family bankeraceae was superfluous and placed phellodon and bankera in family hydnaceae this taxonomic rearrangement was rejected by rudolph arnold maas geesteranus in 1974 who showed that tuberculate spores of p niger were result of an immature specimen richard baird and saeed khan investigated spore ornamentation in north american phellodon species using scanning electron microscopy and rejected placement of phellodon in bankeraceae preferring to leave it and bankera in hydnaceae modern molecular phylogenetic analysis places phellodon in clade roughly equivalent to order thelephorales along with related genera bankera hydnellum and sarcodon although status of bankeraceae has not been fully clarified with molecular genetic techniques phellodon is classified in this family by authorities on fungal taxonomy generic name is derived from meaning cork and don meaning tooth in north america phellodon species are commonly known as cork british mycological society in their recommended list of common names for fungi in united kingdom name phellodon species in form descriptor word plus tooth fused tooth p confluens grey tooth p melaleucus black tooth p niger and woolly tooth p tomentosus description thumb left caps of some phellodon species p tomentosus pictured can fuse together during growth fruit bodies of phellodon species have caps and stipe and thus fall into general category stipitate hydnoid fungi cap surfaces are initially velvety to tomentose eventually becoming matted surface is rough with pits and ridges and sometimes with zones of color or texture color can vary considerably from cream to yellowish brownish greenish greyish or black neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together forming intertwined caps and partially fused stipes alexander h smith wrote of p tomentosus it often occurs in large mats of fused caps almost producing a ceiling over large areas of moss under conifers phellodon fruitbodies can envelop nearby grass or twigs stipe is thickly tomentose or smooth typically same color as cap or darker in p niger outer covering of stipe is a thick layer of mycelium that absorbs water like a sponge hymenophore fertile spore bearing surface is on underside of cap spines become grey at maturity in conditions of high humidity p niger can form striking drops of black liquid on actively growing caps thumb right spines of phellodon tomentosus fibrous flesh is single to double layered duplex layering results from differences in compactness or in alignment of constituent hyphae tough and leathery when fresh flesh develops a texture when dry in dried state it often has an odor of or curry powder phellodon species are often free of insect damage suggesting that they may have defensive chemicals that deter predation fruitbodies are not considered edible due to their fibrous flesh hyphal system is monomitic containing only generative hyphae these hyphae are not less than 6 mm in diameter all european species lack clamp connections but they are present in north american species p fibulatus and p mississippiensis basidia spore bearing cells are four spored cystidia are either absent or present infrequently as incompletely differentiated sterile cells about size of an immature basidium in mass spores are white spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical and covered with small spines they are also hyaline and inamyloid habitat and distribution fruit bodies grow on ground phellodon species like all members of order thelephorales are thought to be mycorrhizal forming symbiotic relationships with trees usual hosts include species from families fagaceae beeches and oaks and pinaceae ectomycorrhizae that p niger forms with norway spruce picea abies has been comprehensively described it is distinguished from ectomycorrhizae of other thelephorales species by unique shape of its stable isotope ratio analysis of abundance of stable isotope carbon 13 shows that p niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host many phellodon species are known from southeastern united states where they have been extensively researched according to baird and colleagues there are nine distinct phellodon species from great smoky mountains and surrounding southern appalachian mountains three additional species from this area p mississippiensis p brunneo olivaceus and p fuligineoalbus were added to genus in 2013 14 conservation thumb left phellodon melaleucus phellodon species like other members of family bankeraceae are sensitive to air pollution and soil pollution and are in general decline in western europe in a preliminary assessment for a red list of threatened british fungi p confluens p tomentosus and p melaleucus are considered vulnerable and p niger is rare conservation efforts for stipitate hydnoid fungi are hampered by a dearth of information about their basic ecology and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi in case of phellodon tomentosus for example there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below ground mycelium making it hard to determine distribution and rarity of fungus with standard surveying techniques phellodon melaleucus and p niger were included in a scottish study to develop species specific pcr primers that can be used to detect mycelia of stipitate in soil dna testing of collections labelled as p melaleucus and p niger from united kingdom revealed additional cryptic species pcr analysis can be used to determine presence of a phellodon species up to four years after appearance of fruitbodies allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction chemistry phellodon species contain thelephoric acid a metabolite of shikimic acid pathway thelephoric acid is a terphenyl quinone a 1 4 benzoquinone wherein positions carbon 2 and carbon 5 are substituted with phenyl groups derivative phellodonic acid is found in p melaleucus phellodonic acid which exhibits antibiotic activity towards bacteria and other fungi was first bioactive compound reported from any member of order thelephorales a total synthesis was described for phellodonic acid in 2008 using cis 1 2 as starting material compound atromentin was reported to occur in fruitbodies of p melaleucus but this was not confirmed in a later analysis p niger has been a source for several bioactive compounds cyathane type diterpenoids a and b a nitrogenous terphenyl derivative 2 3 3 4 5 6 4 p terphenyl and 4 o acid p niger has also been used for mushroom dyeing in which it produces gray blue and green colors species thumb right phellodon atratus thumb right phellodon sinclairii
