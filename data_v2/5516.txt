indian river inlet bridge officially charles w cullen bridge is a cable stayed bridge located in sussex county delaware in united states it carries four lanes of delaware route 1 de 1 over indian river inlet between indian river bay and atlantic ocean bridge also carries delaware bicycle route 1 bike route 1 across inlet bridge is within delaware seashore state park between dewey beach and bethany beach indian river inlet bridge is maintained by delaware department of transportation deldot bridge is long and wide with a span of and overhead clearance of prior to current bridge four other bridges have spanned indian river inlet opened in 1934 1940 1952 and 1965 latter widened by an additional span added in 1976 all were known informally as indian river inlet bridge and all but first officially were named charles w cullen bridge 1965 bridge a steel girder bridge was subject to scouring from inlet leading to need to replace it initial plans for a tied arch bridge over inlet in 2004 were over budget and 2006 plans for a 1 400 foot 427 meter cable stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems construction of current 2 600 foot 792 meter bridge began in 2008 as part of a design build project with skanska awarded contract to build bridge current indian river inlet bridge opened partially in january 2012 and completely in may 2012 at a cost of 150 million description thumb left indian river inlet bridge photographed from an altitude of 2 000 feet 610 meters looking westward from over atlantic ocean toward indian river bay indian river inlet bridge crosses indian river inlet connecting atlantic ocean to east and indian river bay to west bridge is located within delaware seashore state park and carries de 1 and bike route 1 between dewey beach to north and bethany beach to south it carries four 12 foot 3 7 meter lanes of traffic two northbound and two southbound a 4 foot 1 2 meter interior and 10 foot 3 meter exterior shoulder in each direction and a 12 foot 3 7 meter wide sidewalk on east side of bridge for pedestrians and bicycles indian river inlet bridge is a cable stayed bridge consisting of four pylon towers with 152 stays supporting bridge pylons are located on land in order to avoid erosion from inlet bridge has a total length of and a total width of span of bridge is with an overhead clearance of height of pylon towers is above sea level bridge has a fiber optic system that monitors it for issues that could affect its structural integrity bridge is designed to last 100 years officially named charles w cullen bridge bridge is fourth one at indian river inlet to be named in honor of charles w cullen july 8 1865 july 10 1948 a lawyer and judge from georgetown he served on delaware state highway commission from 1930 to 1940 and as its chairman from 1938 to 1939 during which time he oversaw construction of second bridge to span indian river inlet replacing a 1934 timber bridge this bridge was dedicated in may 1940 as charles w cullen bridge but became popularly known as indian river inlet bridge 2012 bridge s dedication plaque located at pedestrian entrance at south end of bridge reads as follows this bridge is named in honor and remembrance of charles west cullen 1865 1948 a man who dedicated his life to public service and to citizens of delaware between 1930 and 1940 he served on state highway commission eventually being elevated to chairman of commission from 1938 1939 while he was chairman work was started on a new bridge to span indian river inlet in recognition for his service on commission bridge was dedicated on may 28 1940 in his name for his advocacy for proper opening of inlet and internal development of indian river two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned inlet since that time this fifth bridge to span inlet waterway is also being dedicated in his name as this bridge serves public let us not forget lifetime of service that he gave history thumb right indian river inlet bridge at night in 2014 increase in private automobile ownership and growing popularity of delaware s beach resort towns during first half of 20th century led delaware to construct ocean highway present day de 1 and now known as coastal highway between rehoboth beach and bethany beach completed in 1933 ocean highway lacked a link to carry it across indian river inlet until 1928 indian river inlet was a natural waterway that shifted up and down a two mile 3 2 km stretch of coast dredging kept inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937 and in 1938 united states army corps of engineers built jetties that hold it in place with inlet in a fixed place it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it and completion of ocean highway in 1933 prompted delaware to build a span to connect northern and southern segments of highway earlier bridges five bridges have been constructed across indian river inlet first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934 its timbers deteriorated quickly in maritime environment prevailing at inlet it was replaced by a concrete and steel swing bridge first to be named for cullen construction of which began in 1938 this swing bridge which included a 4 foot 1 2 meter pedestrian walkway and cost 165 900 opened with a dedication ceremony on may 28 1940 but collapsed on february 10 1948 succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring inlet bottom under its piers a pickup truck on bridge at time of collapse fell into inlet killing three men who drowned inside truck another concrete and steel swing bridge completed in 1952 second to be named for cullen also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage next bridge to be constructed at site was an 860 foot 262 meter steel girder bridge third to be named for cullen its first span opened in 1965 and it was widened by addition in 1976 of a second span slightly to west of first one newer span carrying southbound traffic while older span became one way northbound when first span opened in 1965 inlet was 23 feet 7 meters deep but inlet currents led to scouring of piers of bridge first noticed in 1980s by late 1980s scouring was severe enough to allow u s army corps of engineers divers to swim beneath one of span s concrete footings corps installed protective riprap around bridge piers in 1989 but this was only a temporary solution realizing that bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement scouring had increased inlet s depth to over 100 feet 30 meters by 1999 leading corps of engineers and delaware officials to question stability of pilings and their protective riprap by 2005 various reports gave bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013 by 2007 bridge carried 14 000 cars on an average day and an average of 28 000 cars per day during summer months and disruption to traffic if bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern current bridge thumb right indian river inlet bridge looking south in 2012 early plans and problems on august 20 2003 delaware officials unveiled plans at a public workshop for a new bridge to replace 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition a tied arch design spanning inlet slightly west of 1976 addition to 1965 bridge new bridge would have had longest arched span in world with a length of 1 000 feet 305 meters with an estimated cost of 65 million new bridge would have had no piers in water avoiding scouring problems that had plagued earlier spans delaware officials hoped that work could begin in autumn of 2004 and be completed two years later however tied arch design deterred all but one bidder on construction contract and that bid came in much higher than expected and was more than deldot could afford at time by autumn of 2005 a 200 million shortfall in state transportation budget had delayed construction projects all over delaware and forced state to put plans for new bridge on hold and in meantime rising labor and materials costs drove cost of bridge up to 200 million 50 million above budget deldot scrapped plans for tied arch bridge and put bids out in 2006 for a design build project for a new bridge of a cable stayed design 1 400 feet 427 meters long and without piers in water construction of earthen approach ramps for new bridge began on either side of inlet in february 2006 ramp on north side of inlet was completed in december 2006 and that on south side was finished in february 2007 however concerns over instability of these ramps arose in autumn of 2006 and by march 2007 it had become clear that movement of ramps was greater than expected legal problems also began to affect progress when an unsuccessful bidder on new construction contract questioned process by which it had been awarded to another company that had made a bid of 124 9 million 800 000 more than lowest bid but had nonetheless won contract based on ambiguous pricing and technical criteria labor union leaders also complained that winning bidder had not promised to use delaware union labor unlike lower bidder faced with possibility of a lawsuit deldot in october 2007 decided to cancel construction of bridge under existing contract have unstable approach ramps removed and rebid contract for a longer 2 600 foot 792 meter cable stayed bridge again without piers in water of a new design that did not require flawed approach ramps during 2008 approach ramps were removed and delaware legislature passed a new bond bill making it easier for state officials to award a bid under clearer pricing and technical criteria construction thumb left indian river inlet bridge under construction in 2011 in august 2008 skanska was awarded 150 million design build contract to build new bridge skanska started driving test pilings into ground in later part of 2008 in may 2009 public voting for aesthetic design features of bridge decided that cables would be blue pylon tops would be slanted with railings and lighting fixtures for walkway would have a nautical theme test pilings for bridge were completed in june 2009 construction of pylons began in july 2009 with pouring of concrete into first pylon by december 2009 construction had begun on approach foundations and edge girders with work continuing on pylon towers and side abutments completion of design phase of project and beginning of concrete pour for bridge deck took place in april 2010 in may 2010 bridge received 1 79 million in federal funding for pedestrian and bike paths by this time new indian river inlet bridge was about halfway complete thumb indian river inlet bridge in 2012 steel girder bridge built in 1965 and widened with an additional span in 1976 is in foreground on january 28 2011 deldot filed a lawsuit against bridge design firm figg bridge engineers and engineering and consulting for geotechnical errors in february 2011 deldot awarded george lynch an 11 6 million contract to build approach roads to new indian river inlet bridge as well as to demolish old bridge a minor fire occurred on north side of bridge construction site no damage was reported to bridge structure north side of bridge was finished in august 2011 when form travelers were removed over 250 people were employed in construction of bridge new indian river inlet bridge opened to southbound traffic on january 20 2012 delaware governor jack markell u s senator tom carper and deldot secretary bhatt rode in first car across bridge on january 30 2012 one northbound lane of new bridge opened on may 6 2012 indian river inlet bridge was officially dedicated in a public ceremony in which visitors were able to walk across bridge all remaining lanes of four lane bridge as well as its pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened that day demolition of 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition began in spring of 2012 and
