teresa sampsonia born sampsonia after marriage lady shirley 1589 1668 was a noblewoman of safavid empire of iran she was wife of elizabethan english adventurer robert shirley whom she accompanied on his travels and embassies across europe in name of safavid king shah abbas great 1588 1629 teresa was received by many of royal houses of europe such as english prince henry frederick and queen anne her child s godparents and contemporary writers and artists such as thomas herbert and anthony van dyck herbert considered robert shirley greatest traveller of his time but admired undaunted lady teresa even more following death of her husband from dysentery in 1628 and due to impediments from grandees at court and authorities during reign of abbas s successor and grandson safi 1629 1642 teresa decided to leave iran she lived in a convent in rome for rest of her life devoting her time to charity and religion as a pious christian and because of her love for her husband teresa had shirley s remains transported to rome from isfahan and reburied on headstone of their mutual grave she mentions their travels and refers to her noble circassian origins thanks to her exploits teresa has been described as someone who subverted patriarchal gender roles common to muslim and christian cultures of her time due to their hybrid identities and adventures teresa and her husband became subject of several contemporary literary and visual works nevertheless story of teresa as an important woman of 17th century has been largely overshadowed and obscured by tale of her husband robert and his brothers sources travels of teresa and robert shirley were recorded in many contemporaneous english italian latin and spanish sources including eyewitness accounts according to penelope tuson main sources that deal with teresa s life are predictably semi hagiographic accounts stored in archives of vatican and carmelite order these vatican and carmelite sources were compiled edited and published by herbert chick in 1939 in his chronicle of carmelites in persia though chronicle of carmelites in persia evidently portrays a positive image of teresa tuson notes that accounts are patchy and contradictory on some occasions furthermore narrative is considered to be from viewpoint of european catholicism other sources that help create a modern scholarly account of teresa include only document she is known to have written in english a petition to king james i of england 1603 1625 paintings and to a lesser extent official letters signed by king shah abbas great 1588 1629 early life

contemporaneous italian traveller pietro della valle referred to teresa as an ambassadress of king of persia which nocentelli interprets as putting teresa on an equal footing with her husband in 2009
