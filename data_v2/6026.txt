managed same feat against south korea in 1986 following tournament messi stated that he would not participate in argentina s friendlies against guatemala and colombia in september 2018 and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for remainder of calendar year messi s absence from national team and his continued failure to win a title with argentina prompted

for three months from international football and was fined 50 000 by conmebol for his comments against referee s decisions this ban meant he would miss argentina s friendly matches against chile mexico and germany in september and october player profile style of play thumb a versatile forward messi is regarded as a classic number 10 due to his short stature messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players which gives him greater agility allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles this has led spanish media to dub him la pulga atomica atomic flea despite being physically he possesses significant upper body strength which combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with his short strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of ball when dribbling at speed his former barcelona manager pep guardiola once stated messi is only player that runs faster with ball than he does without it although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid 20s messi is predominantly a left footed player with outside of his left foot he usually begins dribbling runs while he uses inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists thumb left messi preparing to shoot with his dominant left foot during final of 2014 fifa world cup alt one of most prolific goalscorers and clinical finishers of all time messi is known for his powerful and accurate striking ability from both inside and outside area as well as his positioning quick reactions and ability to make attacking runs to beat defensive line while he is renowned for his eye for goal he also functions in a playmaking role courtesy of his vision and precise passing moreover he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons although his conversion rate from free kicks was initially low towards beginning of his career he later developed into one of best free kick takers in world and is even considered by certain pundits to be one of greatest set piece specialists of all time messi s pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal in particular during counterattacks usually starting from halfway line or right side of pitch widely considered to be best dribbler in world and one of greatest of all time with regard to this ability his former argentina manager diego maradona has said of him ball stays glued to his foot i ve seen great players in my career but i ve never seen anyone with messi s ball control beyond his individual qualities he is also a well rounded hard working team player known for his creative combinations in particular with former barcelona midfielders xavi and andres iniesta thumb 230x230px messi is known for dropping deep linking up with midfielders orchestrating his teams attacking plays and creating chances for other players tactically messi plays in a free attacking role a versatile player he is capable of attacking on either wing or through centre of pitch his favoured position in childhood was playmaker behind two strikers known as enganche in argentine football but he began his career in spain as a left winger or left sided forward upon his first team debut he was moved onto right wing by manager frank rijkaard from this position he could more easily cut through defence into middle of pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates under guardiola and subsequent managers he most often played in a false nine role positioned as a centre forward or lone striker he would roam centre often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him in order to create and exploit spaces for passes other teammates attacking runs off ball messi s own dribbling runs or combinations with xavi and iniesta under stewardship of luis enrique messi initially returned to playing in right sided position that characterised much of his early career in manager s 4 3 3 formation while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper free playmaking role in later seasons under valverde messi played in a variety of roles while he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role from which he could make runs from behind into box or even on right wing or as a false nine he was also used in a more offensive central role in a 4 2 3 1 or as a second striker in a 4 4 2 formation where he was once again given licence to drop deep link up with midfielders orchestrate his teams attacking plays and create chances for his attacking partner suarez as his career advanced and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of pitch and developed into one of best passers and playmakers in world football his work rate off ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed by covering less ground on pitch and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed he was able to improve his efficiency movement and positional play and was also able to avoid muscular injuries despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis indeed while he was injury prone in his early career he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off ball and by adopting a stricter diet training regime and sleep schedule with argentina national team messi has similarly played anywhere along frontline under various managers he has been employed on right wing as a false nine as an out and out striker in a supporting role alongside another forward or in a deeper free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind strikers reception a prodigious talent as a teenager messi established himself among world s best players before age 20 diego maradona considered 18 year old messi best player in world alongside ronaldinho while brazilian himself shortly after winning ballon d or commented i m not even best at barca in reference to his protege four years later after messi had won his first ballon d or by a record margin public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to possibility that he was greatest player in history an early proponent was his then manager pep guardiola who as early as august 2009 declared messi to be best player he had ever seen in following years this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits managers former and current players and by end of barca s second treble winning season messi s superiority ahead of maradona and pele had become predominant view among insiders in continental europe a frequent dismissal however has centred on fact that messi has not won fifa world cup with argentina leading some in sport to instead cite him as best club player in history thumb upright 1 09 argentina fans with messi and maradona banners at 2018 world cup in his career messi has been compared with his compatriot diego maradona due to their similar playing styles as diminutive left footed dribblers initially he was merely one of many young argentine players including his boyhood idol pablo aimar to receive new maradona moniker but as his career progressed messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders establishing himself as greatest player argentina had produced since maradona jorge who won 1986 world cup alongside maradona said in october 2013 messi is maradona every day for last five years messi has been maradona of world cup in mexico cesar menotti who as manager orchestrated their 1978 world cup victory echoed this sentiment when he opined that messi plays at level of best maradona other notable argentines in sport such as osvaldo ardiles javier zanetti and diego simeone have expressed their belief that messi has overtaken maradona as best player in history in argentine society messi is generally held in lesser esteem than maradona a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with national team but also of differences in class personality and background messi is in some ways antithesis of his predecessor where maradona was an extroverted controversial character who rose to greatness from slums messi is reserved and unassuming an unremarkable man outside of football an enduring mark against him is fact that although through no fault of his own he never proved himself in argentine primera division as an upcoming player achieving stardom overseas from a young age while his lack of outward passion for albiceleste shirt he does not sing national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays have in past led to false perception that he felt catalan rather than truly argentine despite having lived in spain since age 13 messi has said argentina is my country my family my way of expressing myself i would change all my records to make people in my country happy moreover several pundits and footballing figures including maradona have also questioned messi s leadership with argentina at times despite his playing ability in november 2016 with argentine football association being run by a fifa committee for emergency due to an economic crisis it was reported that three of national team s security staff told messi that they haven t been given their salaries for six months he stepped in and paid salaries of three members comparisons to cristiano ronaldo thumb upright messi has been compared to cristiano ronaldo left throughout much of their careers among his contemporary peers messi is most often compared and contrasted with portuguese forward cristiano ronaldo as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like muhammad ali joe frazier rivalry in boxing bjorn borg john mcenroe rivalry in tennis and ayrton senna alain prost rivalry from formula one motor racing although messi has at times denied any rivalry they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be best player in world since 2008 messi has won six ballons d or to ronaldo s five six fifa world s best player awards to ronaldo s five and six european golden shoes to ronaldo s four pundits and fans regularly argue individual merits of both players beyond their playing styles debate also revolves around their differing physiques ronaldo is with a muscular build and contrasting public personalities with ronaldo s self confidence and theatrics a foil to messi s humility from 2009 10 to 2017 18 messi faced ronaldo at least twice every season in el clasico which ranks among world s most viewed annual sports events off pitch ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary sponsorships and social media fanbase in popular culture
