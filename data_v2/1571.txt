according to film actress nicole kidman was targeted for wiretapping by scientology in an effort to break her marriage to tom cruise after she was labeled a potential trouble source by church whereas travolta has been forced to stay in church in fear that secrets from his personal life will be exposed development left thumb upright alex gibney director of going clear film is based on pulitzer prize winning journalist lawrence wright s book going clear scientology hollywood and prison of belief which was published in january 2013 and was a national book award finalist hbo announced in december 2014 that alex gibney an oscar winning director who made enron smartest guys in room 2005 taxi to dark side 2007 and armstrong lie 2013 was directing a film based on book to be released at 2015 sundance festival it was first time that hbo had tackled scientology directly though not first time it had clashed with church in 1998 protesters mounted demonstrations outside hbo s headquarters because of a documentary that presented anti depressant drugs which are fiercely opposed by scientology in a positive light gibney began working on going clear in 2013 after becoming intrigued by wright s book he collaborated with wright who came on board as a producer to explore book s underlying theme of how people become prisoners of faith in various ways gibney saw scientology as one of toughest subjects he has had to tackle in his career as a documentarian alongside government complicity in torture corporate financial malfeasance and clerical sexual abuse fear of scientology s litigiousness rendered american networks unwilling to license any material to filmmakers which gibney found astounding he commented that he found it interesting that universally this subject more than any other provoked all networks to decline to license i think at end of day that tells you more about scientology than it does about networks which is how ruthless they ve been in trying to silence any criticism church s reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret sometimes for on camera interviews we d set up gear in somebody s house and i d make sure i d be there hours before then person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody s house explaining why he chose to make a film about scientology gibney told reuters that he considered it an important topic not only about this church of scientology which everybody s fascinated with partially because of celebrities but partially because of way that church seems to turn people to do things that i think they would normally never do if had they not entered church gibney wright and former scientologists who appeared in film told a post screening question and answer session that they hoped film would raise public awareness about alleged abuses committed by church of scientology and would prompt media and law enforcement agencies to investigate further gibney later called in a los angeles times opinion piece for scientology s tax exemption to be revoked in light of allegations of abuse documented in film distribution and screenings united states going clear made its world premiere on january 25 2015 at sundance film festival in park city utah wall street journal described it as hottest ticket at

unusual occurrence for a sundance presentation spanky taylor s appearance on stage along with daughter from whom church had forced her to disconnect reduced many in audience to tears film was subsequently shown in a limited number of new york city los angeles and san francisco theaters from march 13 2015 initial theatrical release was deliberately small scale most likely undertaken to ensure that going clear met eligibility criteria for an oscar nomination due to continuing public demand hbo announced in july 2015 that it would be releasing film more widely from september 25

june 25 sky atlantic a co distributor of film along with hbo documentary films originally planned to broadcast going clear in uk and ireland soon after its us tv premiere however this was stalled due to potential legal problems because northern ireland is not subject to defamation act 2013 which reformed libel laws in other parts of uk and because sky cannot differentiate its signal between regions film may be subject to legal challenge in northern ireland church of scientology successfully blocked publication or distribution of original book going clear in uk and ireland and indicated a willingness to sue broadcasters saying in a statement that it will be entitled to seek protection of both uk and irish libel laws in event that any false or defamatory content in this film is

thoroughly disquieting but impossible to ignore going clear scientology and prison of belief is a searing investigative work from a master documentarian metacritic gave film a score of 80 100 based on 11 critics indicating generally favorable reviews variety s chief film critic scott foundas praised level of detail in going clear and called it a powder keg documentary that illustrates dangers of blind faith lesley felperin of hollywood reporter characterized it as an impeccably assembled and argued film that represents a brave timely intervention into debates around organization that have been simmering for some time slate called film a stunning expose of an organization and religion too long shrouded in mystery screen daily s anthony kaufman felt that some of re enactments in film were heavy handed or sensationalistic but commended it overall as a serious strange and unsettling account of brainwashing greed and gross misuses of power writing in guardian brian moylan described going clear as entertaining and dismaying viewing in which story of scientology with all its strange players emerges as comedy rather than horror but criticised its reliance on a small group of defectors and lack of any involvement by church he felt that this made film a bit one sided and that it was easy to be skeptical about some of more outlandish claims made by former members sasha of huffington post called film a shocking and eye opening work that would leave those who did not know much about scientology spellbound bbc s owen gleiberman praised it as most exciting and disturbing work of cinematic non fiction in a long time and awarded going clear five stars describing it as having scary intensity of a thriller following initial hbo broadcast of going clear saturday night live

a sequel to going clear might be in works there s a lot more material already that i ve received more to come out and so far irs has not revoked its tax exemption protection so there s a lot more to be done on december 1 film was selected as one of 15 shortlisted for academy award for best documentary feature it also won writers guild of america award for best documentary screenplay in 2015 scientology reaction right thumb church of scientology stood in strong opposition to film ten days before film s premiere church of scientology took out full page advertisements in new york times and los angeles times to denounce going clear comparing it to story a rape on campus published by rolling stone magazine gibney subsequently said that he was grateful for church s advertising as it had attracted much publicity for film he only wished they d put in head of hbo documentary films sheila nevins commented that when she saw advertisements she knew that going clear would be a big success docs don t get full page ads and when they do they do really well church also published a special report attacking film on one of its websites started a new twitter account which claimed to be taking a resolute stand against broadcasting and publishing of false information and bought numerous ads around google search results relating to film in order to direct searchers to its anti going clear pages additionally church posted a series of short films on its website attacking filmmakers and their interviewees with titles such as alex gibney documentary going clear propaganda marty rathbun a violent psychopath mike rinder wife beater sara goldberg home wrecker and paul haggis hypocrite of hollywood church complained that gibney had declined to interview 25 of its members whom it had put forward to him according to gibney miscavige travolta and cruise all declined interviews instead church offered a delegation of 25 unidentified individuals presumably to smear people in our film which did not interest him church also denounced film s interviewees as usual collection of obsessive disgruntled former church members kicked out as long as 30 years ago for malfeasance who have a documented history of making up lies about church for money campaign against film interviewees and critics according to gibney church mounted an organized and brutal response to appearance of its former members in film some of them have had physical threats people threatening to take their homes away private investigators following them that s part that s really heartbreaking in march 2015 a new york private investigator named eric saldarriaga pleaded guilty to federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking after he illegally gained access to at least 60 email accounts on behalf of undisclosed clients one of main ones reportedly being someone who has done investigations on behalf of church of scientology among those targeted were mike rinder and journalist tony ortega both interviewees in film names of saldarriaga s clients were not revealed and prosecutors declined to pursue action against anyone else citing a lack of evidence a few weeks after film s tv premiere paul haggis reported that a suspected scientology spy posing as a reporter for time had attempted to interview him in a possible attempt to obtain material to use against him church denied claim tony ortega and another interviewee in film former scientologist marc headley reported that investigators from church had surveilled them at salt lake city airport as they made their way to sundance film festival church contacted film critics complaining that their reviews of going clear were filled with bald faced lies and demanding that critics should publish a church statement rebutting film jason bailey of flavorwire wrote that pretty much every critic who wrote about going clear received an email from scientology spokesperson karin he commented that church did not seem to realise that film critics do not usually try to interview people for reviews and noted how neatly it with film s portrayal of church as a hive of shady paranoid control freaks in an email to flavorwire gibney observed that anytime someone writes something film criticism or social criticism about scientology church of scientology counter attacks by smearing critics indiewire s max o connell criticised church s approach for being counterproductive he predicted that their campaign against film is going to be best publicity that alex gibney and company could ever hope for if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and this is no small thing a nightmare for ex cos members who dared to speak out against church s practices but then they don t seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn t do a lot of good for your image paul haggis who was labeled and pasty by church likewise felt that attacks were backfiring you don t think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way i m an imperfect human being and i ve made many many mistakes in my life so you can absolutely publicize any of those but this really you re thinking that makes you look good filmmakers reported receiving lots of cards and letters from church though in their case it had limited its response to loads of legal paperwork hbo had earlier said that it had put probably 160 lawyers onto task of reviewing film in anticipation of challenges from notoriously litigious church sheila nevins of hbo commented that she could not believe how aggressive church had been not only did it effectively provide free advertising for film but its hostility had made hbo documentary films even more determined to produce film i thought they really don t want us to do it all reason more to do it campaign to influence oscar awards following film s success at emmys church was reported to have mounted an aggressive campaign to deny it recognition at oscars church s campaign included producing an anti gibney film and approaches to members of academy s documentary branch responsible for selecting contenders for awards several members of documentary branch reported receiving approaches from church s magazine freedom in connection with a planned profile of gibney although church denied that its actions had anything to do with oscars lawrence wright suggested that its more feverish attention to documentary had to do with it feeling threatened by possibility that hollywood community would examine church more closely as oscars approached in january 2016 according to hollywood reporter film and gibney were reported to have been snubbed by oscar voters and not included in best documentary category of 88th academy awards references external links preview footage from film
