operation vrbas 92 was a military offensive undertaken by army of republika srpska vojska republike srpske vrs in june october 1992 during bosnian war goal of operation was destruction of a salient around central bosnian town of jajce which was held by croatian defence council hrvatsko vijece obrane hvo and army of republic of bosnia and herzegovina armija republike bosne i hercegovine arbih intensity of fighting varied considerably and involved several major vrs offensive efforts interspersed by relative lulls in fighting jajce fell to vrs on 29 october 1992 and town s capture was followed by destruction of all its mosques and roman catholic churches fighting improved safety of vrs lines of communication south of bosnian serb capital of banja luka and displaced between 30 000 and 40 000 people in what foreign observers called largest and most wretched single exodus of bosnian war arbih and hvo in jajce were not only outnumbered and outgunned but their units were also plagued by inadequate staff work compounded by lack of coordination between separate command and control structures maintained by two forces throughout battle defence of jajce also suffered from worsening croat bosniak relations and skirmishes between arbih and hvo along resupply route to jajce ultimately outcome of battle itself fueled greater bosniak croat animosities which eventually led to croat bosniak war vrs saw cracking of arbih hvo alliance as a very significant outcome of operation background as yugoslav people s army jugoslovenska narodna armija jna withdrew from croatia following acceptance and start of implementation of vance plan its 55 000 officers and soldiers born in bosnia and herzegovina were transferred to a new bosnian serb army which was later renamed army of republika srpska vojska republike srpske vrs this reorganisation followed declaration of serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina on 9 january 1992 ahead of 29 february 1 march 1992 referendum on independence of bosnia and herzegovina this declaration would later be cited by bosnian serbs as a pretext for bosnian war on 4 april jna artillery began shelling sarajevo at same time jna and bosnian serb forces clashed with hvo at kupres plateau capturing kupres by 7 april jna and vrs in bosnia and herzegovina faced army of republic of bosnia and herzegovina armija republike bosne i hercegovine arbih and croatian defence council hrvatsko vijece obrane hvo reporting to bosniak dominated central government and bosnian croat leadership respectively as well as croatian army hrvatska vojska hv which occasionally supported hvo operations in late april vrs was able to deploy 200 000 troops hundreds of tanks armoured personnel carriers apcs and artillery pieces hvo and croatian defence forces hrvatske obrambene snage hos could field approximately 25 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons while arbih was largely unprepared with nearly 100 000 troops small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons arming of various forces was hampered by a un arms embargo introduced in september 1991 by mid may 1992 when those jna units which had not been transferred to vrs withdrew from bosnia and herzegovina to newly declared federal republic of yugoslavia vrs controlled approximately 60 percent of bosnia and herzegovina even though graz agreement negotiated by bosnian serbs and bosnian croats aiming to partition bosnia and herzegovina in early may proclaimed cessation of hostilities between two groups heavy fighting broke out between hvo and vrs in june in eastern herzegovina operation jackal and in sava river basin operation corridor 92 in north of bosnia and herzegovina timeline thumb upright 1 25 right map of operation vrbas 92 while fighting related to operation corridor 92 was still in progress vrs prepared to attack and destroy a salient around town of jajce in central part of bosnia and herzegovina held jointly by hvo and arbih salient threatened bosnian serb lines of communication south of vrs held banja luka and contained two hydroelectric power plants critical for electrical supply of banja luka region salient was held by between 3 400 and 5 500 hvo and arbih troops manning strong fortifications in difficult terrain vrs committed 7 000 8 000 troops of 30th infantry division of 1st krajina corps to offensive codenamed operation vrbas 92 30th division was under command of colonel stanislav until he was replaced by colonel dragan in early september vrs troops included 1st 11th and 17th light infantry brigades and 1st mixed antitank artillery battalion besides numerical superiority vrs held a clear advantage in armour deploying 20 30 tanks and adding 30 50 heavy artillery pieces to force defence of jajce was organised at municipal crisis headquarters level by mayor midhat karadzic while hvo force in jajce was commanded by stjepan blazevic initial combat jajce salient was supported via a road running through a narrow corridor to town of travnik in july vrs attempted to cut supply corridor and isolate jajce from travnik before any effort was made to capture salient but attacks failed to accomplish any significant headway this prompted vrs to switch to a gradual advance along three separate axes converging on jajce directly instead move was designed to minimize vrs casualties and allow a systematic elimination of hvo and arbih defences around town arbih hvo successfully defended jajce from vrs in part thanks to area s mountainous surroundings in same month feuding between croatian democratic union hdz and party of democratic action sda over political control began and hvo forcibly disbanded bosniak led war presidency in jajce in exchange for one that was pro croat vrs launched first major attack along western approach to jajce in mid august attack pushed through town s defences and vrs arrived to within of jajce after this breakthrough frontline stabilised for nearly a month before vrs made another push towards jajce advance came from southwest of town and defenders were pushed back to within from town in order to relieve jajce arbih and hvo launched a joint attack north of bugojno and novi travnik against a flank of vrs force attacking jajce but offensive failed gaining no ground at all and hardly making any impact on vrs deployments around jajce vrs continued shelling jajce and started small scale airstrikes in area that led united nations un to declare whole of bosnia and herzegovina a no fly zone a central intelligence agency cia analysis concluded that it is possible that failure of arbih hvo counterattack prompted hvo to agree on a short lived truce with vrs in early october besides a ceasefire agreement promised bosnian serbs power supply from hydroelectric power plants in jajce salient if serbs stopped their offensive final attack relations between arbih and hvo deteriorated in area of nearby town of prozor and novi travnik in late summer strained relations escalated rapidly and led to an armed clash between two forces in novi travnik on 18 october low scale conflicts spread in region and two forces engaged each other along supply route to jajce three days later on 21 october as a result of an arbih roadblock set up previous day on authority of coordinating committee for protection of muslims rather than arbih command just as roadblock was dismantled a new skirmish occurred in town of vitez following day developments also meant that supply of ammunition for jajce defenders was unable to move further than prozor and prompted commander of hvo central bosnia operational zone colonel tihomir blaskic to consider pulling a part of hvo troops from jajce to reopen jajce prozor route blaskic s position was weakened by hvo headquarters since 18 october when a quarter of heavy weapons at his disposal were removed to capljina ahead of hv s operation aimed at dubrovnik hinterland overall poor situation culminated in battle of prozor fought between hvo and arbih battle began on 23 october just after united nations protection force unprofor managed to calm situation in vitez and novi travnik end of fighting in and around prozor was arranged on 26 october coming into effect two days later vrs seized opportunity to launch a fresh advance towards jajce amid arbih hvo clashes attacking along three axes towards town on 25 october putting their conflict aside hvo and arbih deployed in jajce fought back for four days before vrs entered town on 29 october as vrs capture of town appeared inevitable defending force pulled out following its capture serb radio and television declared jajce a liberated town and a part of free serbian republic aftermath exodus and destruction of religious sites thumb right 220px ruins of st luke s catholic church on outskirts of town after vrs entered jajce hvo and arbih pulled out from remainder of salient towards travnik they were joined by civilian population of jajce forming a column of between 30 000 and 40 000 refugees that stretched and among which thousands were vulnerable to vrs sniping and shelling foreign observers described this as largest and most wretched single exodus of bosnian war upon their arrival in travnik refugees were attended to by unhcr staff assisted by unprofor troops at least seven died at travnik hospital while about 60 were treated for injuries approximately 20 000 bosniak refugees from jajce were resettled in central bosnia providing manpower for several new arbih brigades croat refugees headed toward croatia due to rising tensions between bosniaks and croats in central bosnia and overcrowding in travnik by november pre war population of jajce had shrunk from 45 000 to just several thousand bosniaks had previously accounted for 39 percent of population croats 35 percent and serbs 19 percent in weeks following its capture all of mosques and roman catholic churches in jajce were demolished as retribution for hvo s destruction of town s only serbian orthodox monastery in mid october vrs converted town s franciscan monastery into a prison and its archives museum collections and artworks were looted monastery church was completely destroyed by 1992 all religious buildings in jajce had been destroyed save for two mosques whose perilous positioning on a hilltop made them unsuitable for demolition legacy thumb jajce town centre while conflict between hvo and arbih contributed to weakening defence of jajce military superiority of vrs was principal reason behind town s capture besides advantage in troop size and firepower vrs staff work and planning was significantly superior to organisational efforts of defenders of jajce principal problem for defence of jajce was that town was defended by two separate command structures one having authority over arbih troops and other over hvo units humanitarian workers and foreign military observers had suspicions that croats deliberately abandoned jajce as well as territories lost in operation corridor 92 to vrs in exchange for prevlaka peninsula south of dubrovnik even though croatia and several western diplomats denied this claim european community envoy david owen urged un to impose sanctions against croatia suspicion was fueled by an october 1992 agreement between croatian president franjo tudman and yugoslav president dobrica cosic to withdraw jna from prevlaka however jna withdrawal from croatian soil had also been a part of vance plan which was accepted by both croatia and yugoslavia it is unclear who pulled out of jajce first and it remains a point of mutual recrimination bosniaks complained that hvo was to blame for loss of jajce since its units were first to pull out when vrs entered town conversely bosnian croat leader publicly complained about conduct of arbih in central bosnia blaming extremists among arbih personnel for hindering resupply of jajce his stance was reflected in croatian daily list newspaper assumed a confrontational position regarding bosniaks while maintaining that bosniak leadership was not entirely anti croat croat bosniak relations gradually deteriorated leading to croat bosniak war in 1993 in october 1993 vrs major general momir commander of 1st krajina corps during operation vrbas 92 said that capture of jajce was first step in dismantling of alliance between bosnian croats and bosniaks croat bosniak rift would not be mended before washington agreement signed in march 1994 but not completely after hvo recaptured jajce in hv led operation mistral 2 on 13 september 1995 town was and bosniak refugees were not allowed to return by 1998 most croat refugees had returned to jajce while only 5 000 bosniaks did so arbih and hvo lost 103 soldiers defending jajce a further 492 were wounded and five remain missing in 2008 prosecutor s office of bosnia and herzegovina indicted two members of vrs for war crimes committed against bosniaks in september 1992 citing killing of 23 bosniak civilians and wounding of a number of others in 2010 prosecutor s office began an investigation against seven members of arbih hvo and hos on suspicion that they committed war crimes between 27 may and 29 october 1992 against 35
