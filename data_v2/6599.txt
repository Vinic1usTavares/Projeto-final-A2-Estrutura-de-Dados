uranium is a chemical element with symbol u and atomic number 92 it is a silvery grey metal in actinide series of periodic table a uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons of which 6 are valence electrons uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable half lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159 200 years and 4 5 billion years most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium 238 which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 of uranium on earth and uranium 235 which has 143 neutrons uranium has highest atomic weight of occurring elements its density is about 70 higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten it occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil rock and water and is commercially extracted from uranium bearing minerals such as uraninite in nature uranium is found as uranium 238 99 2739 99 uranium 235 0 0 and a very small amount of uranium 234 0 0050 0 uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle half life of uranium 238 is about 4 47 billion years and that of uranium 235 is 704 million years making them useful in dating age of earth many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties uranium 235 is only naturally occurring fissile isotope which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons however because of tiny amounts found in nature uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium 235 is present uranium 238 is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium 239 in a nuclear reactor another fissile isotope uranium 233 can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology uranium 238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons uranium 235 and to a lesser degree uranium 233 have a much higher fission cross section for slow neutrons in sufficient concentration these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction this generates heat in nuclear power reactors and produces fissile material for nuclear weapons depleted uranium 238u is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing lemon yellow to green colors uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light it was also used for tinting and shading in early photography 1789 discovery of uranium in mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth who named new element after recently discovered planet uranus eugene melchior peligot was first person to isolate metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by henri becquerel research by otto hahn lise meitner enrico fermi and others such as j robert oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in nuclear power industry and in little boy first nuclear weapon used in war an ensuing arms race during cold war between united states and

tungsten and gold 19 3 g cm3 uranium metal reacts with almost all non metal elements with exception of noble gases and their compounds with reactivity increasing with temperature hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium but non oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack element very slowly when finely divided it can react with cold water in air uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry uranium 235 was first isotope that was found to be fissile other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable but not fissile on bombardment with slow neutrons its uranium 235 isotope will most of time divide into two smaller nuclei releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons if too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium 235 nuclei a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or in special circumstances an explosion in a nuclear reactor such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison absorbing some of free neutrons such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control

politically and environmentally contentious after use of such munitions by us uk and other countries during wars in persian gulf and balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in soil see gulf war syndrome depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials while metal itself is radioactive its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces as ballast for missile re entry vehicles and as a shielding material due to its high density this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity uranium being only a weak alpha emitter during later stages of world war ii entire cold war and to a lesser extent afterwards uranium 235 has been used as fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons initially two major types of fission bombs were built a relatively simple device that uses uranium 235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium 239 derived from uranium 238 later a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission fusion bomb thermonuclear weapon was built that uses a plutonium based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion such bombs are jacketed in a non fissile unenriched uranium case and they derive more than half their power from fission of this material by fast neutrons from nuclear fusion process civilian thumb most visible civilian use of uranium is as thermal power source used in nuclear power plants alt photograph featuring sunflowers in front and a plant on back plant has a wide smoking chimney

experiments leading to discovery of uranium s ability to fission break apart into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann in hahn s laboratory in berlin lise meitner and her nephew physicist otto robert frisch published physical explanation in february 1939 and named process nuclear fission soon after fermi hypothesized that fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 and later work found that on average about 2 5 neutrons are released by each fission of rare

elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron uranium is only naturally formed by r process rapid neutron capture in supernovae and neutron star mergers primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in r process because s process slow neutron capture is too slow and cannot pass gap of instability after bismuth besides two extant primordial uranium isotopes 235u and 238u r process also produced significant quantities of 236u which has a shorter half life and has long since decayed completely to 232th which was itself enriched by decay of 244pu accounting for observed higher

phosphate or other similar organic phosphates after one day one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals this creates possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium polluted water geobacter has also been shown to uranium in ground water mycorrhizal fungus increases uranium content in roots of its symbiotic plant

each of 238u atom and also 49 by 234u since latter is formed from former and about 2 0 of them by 235u when earth was young probably about one fifth of its uranium was uranium 235 but percentage of 234u was probably much lower than this uranium 238 is usually an a emitter occasionally it undergoes spontaneous fission decaying through uranium series which has 18 members into lead 206 by a variety of different decay paths decay chain of 235u which is called actinium series has 15 members and eventually decays into lead 207 constant rates of decay in these decay series makes comparison of ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating uranium 234 which is a member of uranium series decay chain of uranium 238 decays to lead 206 through a series of relatively short lived isotopes uranium 233 is made from thorium 232 by neutron bombardment usually in a nuclear reactor and 233u is also fissile its decay chain forms part of neptunium series and ends at bismuth 209 and thallium 205 uranium 235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons because it is only uranium isotope existing in nature on earth in any significant amount that is fissile this means that it can be split into two or three fragments fission products by thermal neutrons uranium 238 is not fissile but is a fertile isotope because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium 239 another fissile isotope indeed 238u nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce radioactive isotope uranium 239 decays by beta emission to neptunium 239 also a beta emitter that decays in its turn within a few days into plutonium 239 239pu was used as fissile material in first atomic bomb detonated in trinity test on 15 july 1945 in new mexico enrichment thumb cascades of gas centrifuges are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes alt a photo of a large hall filled with arrays of long white standing cylinders in nature uranium is found as uranium 238 99 and uranium 235 0 isotope separation concentrates enriches fissionable uranium 235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium 235 must impact other uranium 235 atoms to sustain nuclear chain reaction concentration and amount of uranium 235 needed to achieve this is called a critical mass to be considered enriched uranium 235 fraction should be between 3 and 5 this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium 235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium 238 called depleted uranium or du to be considered depleted uranium 235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0 3 price of uranium has risen since 2001 so enrichment tailings containing more than 0 35 uranium 235 are being considered for re enrichment driving price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above 130 per kilogram in july 2007 from 5 in 2001 gas centrifuge process where gaseous uranium hexafluoride is separated by difference in molecular weight between and using high speed centrifuges is cheapest and leading enrichment process gaseous diffusion process had been leading method for enrichment and was used in manhattan project in this process uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver zinc membrane and different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium 235 molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever bond between uranium 235 and fluorine this leaves uranium 238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium 235 metal to precipitate from solution an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers another method used is liquid thermal diffusion human exposure a person can be exposed to uranium or its radioactive daughters such as radon by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food amount of uranium in air is usually very small however people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used or live or work near a coal fired power plant facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel may have increased exposure to uranium houses or structures that are over uranium deposits either natural or man made slag deposits may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas occupational safety and health administration osha has set permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in workplace as 0 25 mg m3 over an 8 hour workday national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of 0 2 mg m3 over an 8 hour workday and a short term limit of 0 6 mg m3 at levels of 10 mg m3 uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion only 0 5 is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium such as its oxide are ingested whereas absorption of more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5 however soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through body whereas insoluble uranium compounds especially when inhaled by way of dust into lungs pose a more serious exposure hazard after entering bloodstream absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium s affinity for phosphates uranium is not absorbed through skin and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate skin incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions which accumulate in bone liver kidney and reproductive tissues uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and aquifers effects and precautions normal functioning of kidney brain liver heart and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because besides being weakly radioactive uranium is a toxic metal uranium is also a reproductive toxicant radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation primary form of 238u decay has a very short range and will not penetrate skin alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers uranyl ions such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals while cdc has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium exposure to uranium and its decay products especially radon are widely known and significant health threats exposure to strontium 90 iodine 131 and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons chart of nuclides us atomic energy commission 1968 although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities those deaths were associated with generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it compilation of 2004 review on uranium levels of protein excretion urinary catalase and to proximal convoluted tubules necrotic
