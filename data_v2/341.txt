thumb 300px geographic definition of polynesia polynesian dog canis lupus familiaris formerly canis pacificus refers to a few extinct varieties of domesticated pariah dogs from islands of polynesia these dogs were used for both companionship and food and were introduced alongside poultry and pigs to various islands they became extinct as a result of cross breeding that occurred after other breeds of dogs were introduced modern studies done on dna of polynesian dogs indicate that they descended from domesticated dogs of southeast asia and may have shared a remote ancestor with dingo taxonomy in 1839 british naturalist charles hamilton smith classified this canine as canis pacificus in his 1840 book natural history of dogs canidae or genus canis of authors including also genera hyaena and in third edition of mammal species of world published in 2005 mammalogist w christopher wozencraft listed under wolf canis lupus taxon familiaris 1758 domestic dog wozencraft then listed canis pacificus c e h smith 1839 as junior taxonomic synonym for domestic dog history and distribution these dogs were introduced by ancestors of polynesian people during their settlement of far flung islands with a few major archipelagos developing isolated breeds notable breeds include hawaiian poi dog introduced to hawaiian islands kuri introduced to new zealand marquesan dog introduced to marquesas islands tahitian dog introduced to society islands dog introduced to tuamotus this may have been a longer haired version of tahitian dog described by british naturalist georg forster thumb kuri specimen museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa 1924 distribution of polynesian dogs on other islands was somewhat patchy islands like mangareva tokelau and marquesas possessed domesticated dog populations after initial settlement that went extinct before arrival of european explorers on easter island no evidence or traces of dogs have been found in middens around island or in oral tradition of rapa nui people they were virtually absent from western polynesia i e samoa and tonga by time europeans arrived however dogs brought on european ships were recognized by natives when they were introduced as items of trade indicating a universal cultural recognition of dogs across islands while maori brought dogs to new zealand had no dogs in chatham islands at time of european discovery relationship to humans polynesians raised dogs for companionship and for food along with domesticated pigs and chickens dog meat was an important animal protein source for human populations of polynesia for most part they were fed a vegetarian diet of either breadfruit coconut yam or poi made from taro while larger kuri predominantly subsisted on a diet of fish they never became feral because of scarcity of food in native forests diet and environment of islands resulted in a dog with small stature and a docile disposition and european explorers described them as lazy they were said to rarely bark but would howl occasionally distinct breeds of polynesian dog became extinct during 19th and early 20th century due to interbreeding with introduced european dog breeds declining consumption of dog meat was another contributing factor in mythology dogs were an important part of polynesian narrative they are often associated with legendary exploits of demigod maui according to maori narrative maui transformed his brother in law husband of hina into first dog which was used to explain human characteristics of dogs in tongan narrative maui atalaga and his son brother maui kijikiji attempted to hunt down an enormous man eating dog larger than a horse living in a cave on fijian island of however atalaga is killed and dragged into a cave by monster which is later slain by maui kijikiji who wastes away mourning his dead father genetic studies thumb right proposed route for migration of dogs based on mdna haplotype a29 relates most to australian dingo and new guinea singing dog ancient polynesian arc2 to modern polynesian indonesian and ancient new zealand dogs and ancient polynesian arc1 is indistinguishable from a number of widespread modern haplotypes dna evidence indicates that polynesian dogs descended from domesticated dogs of southeast asia and may have shared a remote ancestor with dingo study of mtdna show they carried two haplotypes arc1 and arc2 in 2011 mdna of dogs from malay peninsula found that two most common dog haplotypes of indonesian region in particular bali and kalimantan were mdna haplotype a75 40 and dingo founder haplotype a29 8 also present were haplotypes a120 and all 4 haplotypes fall within a2 mdna sub haplogroup study also looked at archaeological specimens of ancient polynesian dogs from which only a short haplotype a short sequence could be derived this short haplotype was named arc2 and corresponds to mdna haplotypes a75 and a120 and it could be found in 70 of samples found as far away as hawaii and new zealand no dogs from taiwan nor philippines carried dingo or polynesian haplotypes which indicates that dogs did not enter pacific from a northeastern route in 2015 a study looked at mdna sequences taken from ancient new zealand kuri dog samples discovered at an archaeological site at wairau bar and found they correspond to a2 mdna sub haplogroup dog samples all carried mdna haplotype which has only been reported in some modern village dogs from bali indonesia when compared with two ancient polynesian haplotypes arc1 and arc2 all of wairau bar dogs matched arc2 dogs from wairau bar likely represent part of initial population of dogs introduced to new zealand having arrived with people around beginning of fourteenth century all of these dogs carry haplotypes that fall under mdna a2 sub haplogroup and are therefore descendants of a dog chinese wolf hybrid ancestor in 2015 most comprehensive study of mdna haplotypes to date found that a2 sub haplogroup represents 3 of all dogs in southeast asia 22 in indian subcontinent and 16 in east asia references bibliography further reading category dog meat category extinct dog breeds category extinct animals of oceania
