prevailed weeks later at first city council meeting under mayor sawyer ucc funding was restored shiller said restoring grant to ucc would affect only 48th ward not her ward i was not going to have them operating in 46th shiller said claiming she had reached an agreement to keep ucc services out of her ward several days before washington s death mayor sawyer had nothing to do with this shiller claimed he had recommended no changes low income housing consent decree as early as 1966 uptown was among possible sites proposed for a northeast side commuter campus in city colleges of chicago community college district uptown site west of wilson chicago transit authority cta station was opposed by those concerned for displacement of low income residents largely blacks southern whites and american indians project was mired in heated controversy for decades avery v pierce a federal lawsuit filed in 1975 alleged that razing of about 3 000 low income housing units for development of harry s truman college constituted misspending of funds by city and chicago housing authority plaintiffs were represented by shiller s former campaign manager attorney james p chapman of uptown peoples law center in 1985 randall h langer a young real estate developer active in apartment rehabilitation in neighborhood aided creation of a local historic district sheridan park historic district which

1983 cook county had a program to afford local governments opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing prior to county s scavenger sale to public if local government had a specific development plan on october 28 1987 shiller urged tax delinquency subcommittee of cook county board to accept a no cash bid from city for 19 tax delinquent parcels in uptown a decision was deferred when commissioner rosemarie love requested a delay on grounds that washington administration had not provided a development plan subcommittee chairman commissioner richard siebel said county s no cash sales program was designed to place property back on tax rolls as quickly as possible not for land banking it s not appropriate for us to pass this until city tells us parcel by parcel what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it another commissioner noted that city already owned 7 000 tax delinquent properties and another added properties we gave to city 12 years ago are still war zones i don t want same thing to happen here as a bench ruling in avery v pierce neared shiller proposed an ordinance that directed city to settle and accept a consent decree consent decree would have put most vacant parcels in uptown into a land bank for future affordable housing administered by a community development corporation funded by city with 100 000 over two years consent decree also would have made a desirable goal of 3 000 low income housing units in uptown on november 16 1987 committee on finance of chicago city council chaired at time by shiller ally alderman timothy evans voted 21 to 2 to recommend consent decree shiller gloated during committee hearings that with mayor harold washington s backing decree could not be stopped pulitzer prize winning commentator mike royko wrote in chicago tribune one of most depressing sections of chicago is uptown area on north side shabby apartment buildings vacant stores wino bars littered vacant lots junkies muggers and career down and it also has a new alderman helen shiller and she has a vision of what that seedy old neighborhood should be in future and apparently her vision is that uptown should remain a seedy old neighborhood in 1988 royko wrote of shiller her main motive was that she was building a political power base which included as many winos as she and coleman could drag to voting booth shiller s proposal was criticized in a series of editorials chicago tribune called proposal silly editorializing it would have enabled her shiller to strangle commercial development in her uptown ward and keep it poor it was a flagrantly bad idea and deserved its defeat it would have put helen shiller and her sidekick slim coleman in charge of a community development corporation whose avowed purpose would be to block private investment in 46th ward and use all available space for low cost housing this would consolidate their own power by ensuring a constituency of poor and dependent voters in 2003 shiller explained editorials when i first became alderman there was a developer up here who felt very threatened by me he hired a publicist to really go after me any time i talked about development without displacement they would ream me they went to press and got some of most vicious editorials published on december 3 1987 16 of parcels were sold to private bidders at cook county s annual scavenger sale and langer and partnerships langer controlled bought 13 of parcels on december 9 1987 at first regular business meeting of city council after death of mayor washington in office

supported u s representative bobby rush in his unsuccessful challenge to daley in 1999 arguably single most important legislative responsibility that aldermen have is voting on city budget each year

re election in 2003 shiller cited daley s commitment to affordable housing and in particular his planning department s work on wilson yard project columnist mark brown wrote in chicago sun times last squeaky wheel in city council had been greased last independent voice had joined chorus shiller s endorsement of daley is all more amazing when you look at where she started about as close to a marxist as you d ever find at city hall shiller defeated reed again in 2003 this time with 58 of vote shiller again joined in unanimous support for daley s 2004 budget shiller was only alderman who

when we do development we should make sure that people who are here today will be here when that is complete my most singular perspective was to prove that that is possible we have to have a city that is not just inclusive about our diversity but is serious and honest about making sure that everyone has a place here on closing her ward office shiller wrote i am most proud of my achievements in
