iii began rapping at age fourteen in 1996 his debut album infinite which was recorded at a recording studio owned by bass brothers was released under their independent record label web entertainment infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by detroit radio stations disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style after that record every rhyme i wrote got angrier and angrier a lot of it was because of feedback i got motherfuckers was like you re a white boy what fuck are you rapping for why don t you go into rock roll all that type of shit started pissing me off after release of infinite eminem s personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt disappointment of infinite inspired eminem to create alter ego slim shady boom name hit me and right away i thought of all these words to rhyme with it slim shady served as eminem s vent for his frustrations and in spring of 1997 he recorded eight song extended play slim shady ep during this time eminem and his girlfriend kim scott lived in a high crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter hailie where their house was burglarized numerous times

his group n w a as a teenager was nervous to work with him on album i didn t want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much i m just a little white boy from detroit i had never seen stars let alone dr dre bozza 2003 p 24 however eminem became more comfortable working with dr dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions stubbs 2006 p 58 recording process generally began with dr dre creating a beat and eminem using tracks as a template for his freestyle raps every beat he would make i had a rhyme for eminem recalled he later said every time i sat down with a pen everything was just like fuck you fuck this fuck them fuck that fuck world fuck what everybody thinks fuck them on first day of recording eminem and dr dre finished my name is in an hour three other songs including role model were also recorded that day 97 bonnie clyde which was formerly featured on slim shady ep as just two of us was rerecorded for slim shady lp to feature his daughter hailie s vocals because song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend s corpse eminem was not comfortable with explaining situation to kim and instead told her that he would be taking hailie to chuck e cheese s however he really took her to recording studio he explained when she found out i used our daughter to write a song about killing her she fucking blew we had just got back together for a couple of weeks then i played her song and she bugged fuck out eminem also said when she hailie gets old enough i m going to explain it to her i ll let her know that mommy and daddy weren t getting along at time none of it

winkler daughter of actor henry winkler tells a friend that she was disgusted by eminem s music he met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use recording on album during mixing process of slim shady lp at same time kid rock was recording his fourth studio album devil without a cause being friends with kid rock eminem asked kid rock to record scratching for eminem s song my fault which appears on slim shady lp in return eminem delivered a guest rap verse on kid rock s song fuck off for devil without a cause production album s production was handled primarily by bass brothers dr dre and eminem beats have been compared to west coast hip hop and g funk musical styles kyle anderson of mtv wrote that beats are full of bass heavy hallucinations and create huge scary that allow em to play according to staff at ign 97 bonnie clyde is backed by serenity of a super silky groove cum on everybody which features guest vocals from american singer dina 2006 p 78 contains an upbeat dance rhythm while my name is which is built around a piano sample from british musician labi siffre s i got features a prominent bassline and psychedelic style keyboards i m shady was

eminem s vocal inflection on record has been described as a nasal whine jon pareles of new york times likened his calmly sarcastic delivery to early beastie boys turned cynical writing for chicago tribune columnist greg kot compared rapper s vocals to pee wee herman with a nasal midwestern accent a skit entitled lounge appears before my fault featuring eminem and bass brothers imitating rat pack crooners jeff bass came up with line i never meant to give you mushrooms for skit which in turn inspired eminem to write my fault stubbs 2006 p 75 lyrical themes many of songs from slim shady lp are written from perspective of eminem s alter ego slim shady and contain cartoonish depictions of violence which he refers to as made up tales of trailer park stuff rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value likening his music to horror film genre why can t people see that records can be like movies only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren t on a screen some of lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators eminem acknowledged accusations and clarified i have a fairly salty relationship with women but most of time when i m saying shit about women when i m saying bitches and hoes it s so ridiculous that i m taking stereotypical rapper to extreme i don t hate women in general they just make me mad sometimes despite album s explicit nature eminem refused to say word nigga on album with rapper noting it s not in my vocabulary slim shady lp begins with a public service announcement introduction performed by producer jeff bass of bass brothers and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing album s explicit lyrical content later in album a skit entitled paul features a phone call from paul rosenberg to eminem telling him to tone down his lyrics hasted 2011 p 111 guilty conscience is a concept song featuring dr dre song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations while dr dre and eminem serve as angel and devil sides of characters conscience respectively song draws inspiration from a scene in 1978 comedy film national lampoon s animal house in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party in film he ends up deciding not to go through with rape but in guilty conscience outcome is unclear on my fault eminem tells story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave bozza 2003 p 49 97 bonnie clyde features eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife s corpse it is an epilogue to song kim although 97 bonnie clyde was released first eminem wrote song at a time in which he felt that kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic explained that there have been more violent songs in rap but few more disturbing and it s not because of what it describes it s how he describes it how perfectly modulated phrasing enhances horror and black humor of his words on song brain damage eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school particularly recalling a traumatic incident where he sustained a serious concussion after he was severely beaten by a bully although many of lyrics on album are intended to be humorous several songs depict eminem s frustrations with living in poverty when discussing slim shady lp anthony bozza of rolling stone described eminem as probably only mc in 1999 who boasts low self esteem his rhymes are jaw droppingly perverse a minimum wage life devoid of hope flushed with rage and weaned on sci fi and slasher flicks eminem was inspired to write rock bottom after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter s birthday song bemoans human dependency on money discussing its ability to brainwash an individual he illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter describing himself as discouraged hungry and malnourished if i had follows a similar theme as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is tired of jobs starting off at 5 50 an hour hartigan 2005 p 162 in song he expresses his irritation with fitting white trash stereotype hartigan 2005 p 161 critical reception album was met with general acclaim from music critics stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave album five stars out of five praising rapper s expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination adding that years later as shock has faded it s those lyrical skills and subtle mastery of music that still resonate and they re what make slim shady lp one of great debuts in both hip hop and modern pop music david browne of entertainment weekly described album s unapologetic outrageousness as a reaction to soul positivity of conscious hip hop noting that slim shady lp marks return of irreverent attitude to genre heard throughout album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch soren baker of los angeles times gave album three and a half stars out of four and stated that he isn t afraid to say anything his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it s a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass time but lamented sometimes flat production that takes away from power of eminem s verbal mayhem many reviewers commented on album s lyrical content gilbert rodman of popular communications states eminem s music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics but simply to reduce it to these as many critics do doesn t help to explain eminem it merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away rob sheffield of rolling stone enjoyed record s comedic nature writing simply put eminem will crack you up but also felt that misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome noting that wife killing jokes of 97 bonnie and clyde aren t any funnier than garth brooks and my fault belongs on some sorry ass bloodhound gang record nathan rabin of a v club felt that although album is sophomoric and uninspired at times eminem s surreal trailer trash post gangsta rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that s despairingly low on new ideas mike rubin of spin noted that his scenarios are so far fetched songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are chris dafoe of globe and mail opined that abused by fellow students and teachers cheated on by his girlfriend despised by society shady goes over top now and then or rather way over top but dre s lean production full of strange voice and comic interjections hold things together reviewing for village voice in 1999 robert christgau called record a platinum bound cause celebre and despite succumbing to dull sensationalism toward end eminem shows more comic genius than any pop musician since possibly loudon wainwright iii accolades rolling stone magazine ranked slim shady lp number 275 on its list
