garnered generally positive reviews from music critics michael paoletta from billboard gave it a very positive review calling album a reminder of why decade has been dion s signature era and why future looks bright for her according to him regarding seven new songs all way a decade of song is dion s most focused album yet drawing on a team of collaborators that understands this artists s strengths among highlights paoletta mentioned first single that s way it is a welcome uptempo number i want you to need me a consummate love song ripe for a second single if walls could talk then you look at me a characteristically roof raising fan stoking dion anthem her beyond pale duet with frank sinatra on all way and first time ever i saw your face a remake that affirms dion s ability to lay low and still chuck taylor from billboard also praised that s way it is he wrote that dion at last ups tempo with irresistible first single according to taylor this new track a joyful ode to holding faith but allowing love to take its course when it s ready matches dion with a new team of collaborators consistent hitmakers max martin kristian lundin and andreas carlsson replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as ever splendid vocal this song is destined to enrapture top forty and ac first time through at last stripping away mainstream radio s gripe that dion is too adult he said that youthful and yet elegant and glowing brightly with warmth song also represents a bold step forward for martin who is best known for his work with chart topping youth acts all in all that s way it is is one of most compelling radio releases yet from one of core voices of decade chuck taylor also reviewed i want you to need me and wrote that linking dion and diane warren has always been about as fine a fit as a trusty pair of thom s between warren s heart drenched words and dramatic melody writing and dion s potent vocals straight from has never sounded so mighty according to him for fans of dion s high caliber power ballads this is truly among best ever and a highlight on all way a decade of song longing for romantic attention dion sings i want you to need me like air you breathe i want you to feel me in everything i want you to see me in your every dream way that i taste you feel you breathe you need you taylor stated that warren s trusty melody is wholly natural and free flowing while production from usually rock oriented matt serletic is sheer perfection it all peaks from glorious midsection through to end where dion delivers exactly what we ve come to expect a crescendo as spine tingling as those first few times we heard my heart will go on although stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave album four out of five stars he criticized it for including seven new songs and just nine hits according to him if it had been a straight hits collection with that s way it is and if walls could talk added to end it would have been fine but padding it with nearly a full album worth of new material hurts it he also noticed that dion s first american hit where does my heart beat now isn t here nor is her duet with barbra streisand tell him erlewine stated that best of hits like meat loaf ian epic it s all coming back to me now and my heart will go on are certainly among best adult contemporary songs of decade in comparison to new material he felt that danceable that s way it is and pretty ballad if walls could talk work but he did not like first time ever i saw your face and all way according to him remaining three new songs aren t bad but they re not particularly memorable especially compared to hits commercial performance all way a decade of song debuted at number three on us billboard 200 with sales of 303 000
