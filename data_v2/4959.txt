happy it might make a few people unhappy but ultimately i m not convinced that s what is going to raise profile in january 2012 in preparation for 2012 edition of u s open cup u s soccer announced several changes to tournament format included in these changes was introduction of a new host selection process beginning in 2012 for all rounds of tournament through quarterfinals a random host selection process would be used while in previous years a blind bidding system was used to determine host of a match new process has host determined by blind draw if both teams venues meet minimum standards blind bidding system for hosting rights remained in effect for semifinals and final of 2012 tournament however u s soccer announced in 2013 that hosting for all rounds of tournament would be determined randomly as long as both venues met minimum standards references external links seattle s emerald city supporters tifo final 2011 lamar hunt u s open cup final category soccer in seattle
