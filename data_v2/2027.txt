mikoyan gurevich mig 1 was a soviet fighter aircraft of world war ii that was designed to meet a requirement for a high altitude fighter issued in 1939 to minimize demand on strategic materials such as aluminum aircraft was mostly constructed from steel tubing and wood flight testing revealed a number of deficiencies but it was ordered into production before they could be fixed although difficult to handle one hundred were built before design was modified into mig 3 aircraft was issued to fighter regiments of soviet air forces vvs in 1941 but most were apparently destroyed during opening days of operation barbarossa german invasion of soviet union in june 1941 design and development design phase mig 1 was designed in response to a requirement for a high altitude fighter with an inline engine issued by vvs in january 1939 initially aircraft designated i 200 was designed in polikarpov construction bureau work started in june 1939 under direction of nikolai polikarpov and his assistant m polikarpov himself preferred radial engines and promoted his i 180 design at that time but when powerful mikulin am 37 inline engine became available he decided to use it in a fighter approach that he selected was to build smallest possible aircraft around intended powerplant thereby minimizing weight and drag philosophy of light fighter as specified aircraft was to be capable of reaching 670 km h 417 mph in august 1939 polikarpov fell out of favor with joseph stalin and as a result when polikarpov went in november 1939 to tour germany s aviation works soviet authorities decided to scatter his construction team and create a new experimental construction section oko headed by artem mikoyan and mikhail gurevich which remained formally subordinated to polikarpov bureau until june 1940 further work upon i 200 design was assigned to mikoyan and gurevich who later became recognized not with full justice as its designers gordon 2008 pp 95 96 mig 1 was a low wing monoplane with a tailwheel undercarriage of mixed construction due to shortages of light alloys rear fuselage was made from wood but front fuselage from propeller to rear of cockpit was a welded steel tube truss covered by duralumin bulk of wing was wooden but center section was all metal with a steel i section main spar wing used a clark yh profile it was evenly tapered with rounded tips and outer wing panels had 5deg of dihedral all three landing gear wheels retracted hydraulically main units inwards into wing center section cockpit was situated well aft which seriously limited forward vision when landing and taxiing am 37 engine was not yet available and less powerful v 12 mikulin am 35a had to be substituted it had six exhaust ejectors one for each pair of cylinders that provided some additional thrust it drove a vish controllable pitch propeller in diameter air intakes for supercharger were in wing roots and oil cooler was on port side of engine cowling radiator was underneath cockpit armament included two fuselage mounted shkas machine guns and one ubs machine gun gordon 2008 pp 96 97 result was a highly conventional aircraft that first flew on schedule on 5 april 1940 at khodynka aerodrome in moscow with chief test pilot arkadij at controls on 24 may first prototype attained a speed of 648 5 km h 402 9 mph at 6 900 m 22 638 ft it could not however attain speed originally specified by air force with this engine second prototype took to air on 9 may but third aircraft first to be armed was forced to wait until 6 june as problems with its synchronization gear prolonged ground firing tests on 5 august was reached at using maximum boost time to altitude figures were 5 1 minutes to and 7 2 minutes to and speeds at lower altitudes were at and at production and improvements i 200 was ordered into production almost immediately on 31 may 1940 gordon 2008 p 96 in contrast to other competing designs i 26 yak 1 and i 301 lagg 3 i 200 successfully completed state trials in august on its first attempt but trials revealed a number of serious defects including inadequate visibility when taxiing poor quality plexiglas in canopy obscuring pilot s view heavy controls poor longitudinal stability difficulty in opening canopy an excessively hot cockpit and a dangerous propensity to flick from a simple stall into a spin from which it was almost impossible to recover gordon 2008 p 97 a number of improvements were ordered to be made to aircraft as a result of deficiencies discovered during trials but only a few of them were able to be implemented before production began as vvs was very anxious to get modern fighters into service these included an additional air intake on starboard side of nose for oil cooler rubber sheaths around fuel tanks to make them self sealing two underwing bomb racks each capable of carrying a fab 100 bomb a 1 gunsight and each shkas was given 375 rounds and ubs 300 rounds from ninth aircraft onwards side opening canopy was replaced by a rear sliding canopy that could be jettisoned in flight on 9 december 1940 first 100 i 200s were designated as mig 1 after initials of mikoyan and gurevich gordon 2008 p 98 improvement process continued throughout production run though they were not immediately implemented in production line but were instead incorporated in a fourth prototype for evaluation this aircraft first flew on 29 october 1940 and was a significant improvement over i 200s then in production it passed its state acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated in production line from 101st i 200 these were designated as mig 3 on 9 december although first production mig 3 was not completed until 20 december 1940 gordon 2008 pp 98 100 additional testing i 200 prototypes were used to evaluate a number of proposals for example second prototype was fitted with a prototype of am 37 engine and first flew with that engine on 6 january 1941 it experienced severe vibration problems and despite efforts to cure problems failed during a flight on 7 may and was destroyed in ensuing crash third prototype was generally used for armament trials experimenting with rs 82 rockets among other weapons for another trial it was equipped with experimental mp 3 autocannon carried underneath wings in external pods and redesignated as ip 201 12 7 mm ubs gun was removed for these tests and space freed up was used to install an extra fuel tank initially cannon had low rate of fire of only 300 rounds per minute but this was soon doubled and gun was renamed mp 6 installation of guns was difficult despite aircraft s metal outer wing panels and wings deformed when cannon were first mounted it made its first and only flight on 1 december 1940 carrying two mp 6s and two 12 7 mm ap 12 7 machine guns but a blocked fuel line caused a forced landing before guns could be fired testing on a variety of other aircraft revealed very unsatisfactory performance from guns and their development was canceled designers were arrested on 15 may 1941 and executed on 28 october 1941 gordon 2008 p 99 operational history on 3 december 1940 vvs ordered that 41st fighter regiment istrebitel polk based at crimean town of was to conduct operational trials on i 200 and that they were to be transferred to 146th fighter regiment at yevpatoria also in crimea for pilot training after conclusion of trials by 22 february 1941 89 had been issued to regular fighter units notably 89th fighter regiment at kaunas lithuania and 41st fighter regiment at bialystok poland both places under soviet occupation since 1939 40 on 1 june 1941 they were spread out a bit more with 31 in baltic military district 37 in western special military district one in kiev military district and eight in odessa military district for a total of 77 on hand of which only 55 were operational an additional eight mig 1s were assigned to soviet navy however only four pilots were trained to handle either mig 1 or mig 3 bergstrom p 12 little is known of performance of mig 1 in combat as most were likely destroyed during opening days of operation barbarossa however one was still in inventory of vvs as late as 1944
