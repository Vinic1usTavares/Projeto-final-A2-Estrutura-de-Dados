members in utah but lacking funds for full teams of oxen or horses nearly 3 000 mormon pioneers from england wales scotland and scandinavia made journey from iowa or nebraska to utah in ten handcart companies trek was disastrous for two of companies which started their journey dangerously late and were caught by heavy snow and severe temperatures in central wyoming despite a dramatic rescue

representing faithfulness and sacrifice of pioneer generation they continue to be recognized and honored in events such as pioneer day church pageants and similar commemorations background to migration latter day saints were first organized in 1830 early members of church often encountered hostility primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs their neighbors felt threatened by church s rapid growth in numbers its tendency to vote as a bloc and acquire political power its claims of divine favor and later practice of polygamy o dea 1957 pp 41 49 72 75 violence directed against church and its members caused body of church to move from ohio to missouri then to illinois despite frequent

about 16 000 european latter day saints traveled to united states by ship through eastern states by rail and to utah by ox and wagon although most of these emigrants paid their own expenses church established perpetual emigration fund to provide financial assistance for poor emigrants to trek west which they would repay as they were able contributions to expand fund were encouraged hafen and hafen 1981 pp 22 27 when contributions and loan repayments dropped off in 1855 after a poor harvest in utah young decided to begin using handcarts because church members who remained in europe were

route 6 after crossing missouri river they paused for a few days at a mormon outpost in florence nebraska now part of omaha for repairs before beginning remaining journey along mormon trail to salt lake city kimball 1979 initial problems with carts occurred because wood used to construct them was said to have been green timber with many more breakdowns than anticipated when first handcart company reached winter quarters edmund ellsworth had a member of company tin wooden axles and also installed thick hoop iron skeins which enabled handcart axles to turn more easily and resist breakage much better this feature became a standard part of handcarts in following years including frequent greasing to keep wheels lubricated with no method of communicating back up trail however this needed set of fixes did not reach fourth and fifth companies in time companies made good time and their trips were largely uneventful emigrant companies included many children and elderly individuals and

departure because emigrants were unfamiliar with trail and climate they deferred to returning missionaries and church agents one of returning missionaries levi savage urged them to spend winter in nebraska he argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of elderly women and young children would lead to suffering sickness and even death all of other church elders argued that trip should go forward expressing optimism that company would be protected by divine intervention some members of company perhaps as many as 100 decided to spend winter in florence or in iowa but majority

from hypothermia or frostbite after wading through frigid river they set up camp at red bluffs unable to continue forward through snow meanwhile original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at devil s gate where they had been instructed to wait for rest of rescue party if they had not found martin company when main rescue party rejoined them another scouting party consisting of joseph young abel garr and daniel webster jones was sent forward martin company remained in their camp at red bluffs for nine days until three scouts finally arrived on october 28 by time scouts arrived 56 members of company had died scouts urged emigrants to begin moving again during this interval party was met by ephraim hanks bringing meat from a recently slaughtered buffalo likely saving many lives as nutritive value of protein and fat in meat was much higher than that of exhausted flour supplies etc he also performed many blessings and helped in some amputations etc to stop progression of frostbite and gangrene that would have otherwise killed more members of company three days later main rescue party met martin company and hodgett and hunt wagon companies and

days company moved into martin s cove a few miles west of devil s gate as it was much more protected than open plains just to east this is where famous crossing of sweetwater river on november 4 occurred see more information below during this season river though shallow about was also wide stream temperature was frigid and clogged with floating ice some of men of rescue party spent hours

have wintered east of rockies so they turned back when word of returning backup relief party was communicated to young he ordered courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found handcart company but several days had been lost on november 18 backup party met martin company with greatly needed supplies at last all members of handcart party were now able to ride in

one of most persistent and popular stories regarding mormon pioneers was about three of rescuers who helped pioneers cross sweetwater river most popular telling by solomon kimball states this version was quoted by gordon b hinckley james e faust and was previously taught in sunday school in lds church for both adults and children chad orton notes it would be physically impossible for three boys to carry five hundred people across river in two hours orton 2006 pp 16 18 in actuality rescue party had several rescuers instead of three eighteen of which have been positively identified as being at sweetwater crossing rescuers brought ten rescue wagons in addition to wagons martin company had with them many survivors wrote about riding wagons across orton 2006 pp 18 21 however because of time constraints not everyone could ride wagons some were carried but other survivors wrote that they crossed river themselves or with help of people other than three boys boys mentioned in story did help some people across but not nearly every member as reported in mythologized version of story while three boys were among those that helped several across ages were wrong c allen huntington was 24 david p kimball was 17 and george w grant was 16 orton 2006 pp 14 there is no medical evidence that they died from effects of crossing and most lived active and relatively long lives orton 2006 pp 24 29 outside of kimball s account there is no other account of brigham young promising everlasting salvation to rescuers based on a single act orton notes that such a promise is inconsistent with church doctrine orton 2006 pp 29 32 john thomas notes that solomon kimball did not witness crossing but relied heavily on other sources particularly orson f whitney s 1888 account who also claimed that all of boys died from event even though huntington was still alive in 1888 faithfulness of survivors another common myth is that none of survivors of willie or martin handcart companies ever complained and they never apostatized from church most popular source came from william palmer who paraphrased a comment francis webster had made in a sunday school class in cedar city he writes this was later quoted by david o mckay in 1948 and later by gordon b hinckley james e faust and was taught to children however several people in willie or martin handcart companies did leave church including john chislett john ahmanson elizabeth sermon henry augustus squires henry kemp and deborah jane chapman many of survivors complained palmer gave quote during a radio series of men you should know describing life of webster about forty years after webster died palmer said that he was paraphrasing webster and given lapse of time and casual nature of a sunday school class orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote orton believes palmer was trying to emphasize webster s character rather than give a definitive statement on faithfulness of all members of willie martin handcart company and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote orton also finds it unlikely that webster knew all of survivors given that they spread throughout utah after they arrived and didn t have a reunion until after webster s death orton believes webster was only referring to pioneers in cedar city where quote was given responsibility for tragedy american west historian wallace stegner described inadequate planning and improvident decisions leading to tragedy when he wrote stegner 1992 p 222 as early as november 2 1856 while willie and martin companies were still making their way to safety brigham young responded to criticism of his own leadership by rebuking franklin richards and daniel spencer for allowing companies to leave so late christy 1997 pp 22 1992 pp 256 258 richards was highest ranking church official in area at time companies left florence and spencer was church s agent in iowa city however many authors argued that young as author of plan was responsible ann eliza young daughter of one of men in charge of building carts and a former plural wife of brigham young described her ex husband s plan as a cold blooded scheming blasphemous policy stegner described richards as a scapegoat for young s fundamental errors in planning though howard christy professor emeritus and former senior editor of scholarly publications at brigham young university byu noted that richards as highest ranking official in florence nebraska area was in fact official who would have had authority and capability to have averted tragedy by halting their late departure stegner 1992 p 1997 pp 21 56 christy also pointed out that brigham young and other members of church s first presidency had consistently pointed out that departure from what is now omaha nebraska needed to happen by end of may to safely make journey christy 199 0 p 12 many survivors of tragedy refused to blame anyone survivor john jacques wrote i blame nobody i am not anxious to blame anybody i have no doubt that those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do best they could under circumstances christy 1997 p 57 another survivor francis webster was quoted as having said was i sorry that i chose to come by hand cart no neither then nor any minute of my life since price we paid to become acquainted with god was a privilege to pay and i am thankful that i was privileged to come in martin hand cart company on other hand survivor john chislett who later left church wrote bitterly of richards promising them that we should get to zion in safety stegner 1992 p 143 in may 2006 a panel of researchers at annual conference of mormon history association blamed tragedy on a failure of leadership carter a trails historian said franklin d richards was responsible in my mind for late departure because he started snowball down slope that eventually added up to disaster christy agreed that leadership from top from outset was seriously short of mark robert briggs an attorney said it s almost a foregone conclusion there is evidence of negligence with leaders all way up to brigham young there was mismanagement on other hand rebecca bartholomew and leonard j arrington wrote memories of what was perhaps worst disaster in history of western migration have been by what could also be regarded as most heroic rescue of mormon frontier bartholomew and arrington 1993 p 44

church to continue handcart system while avoiding another disaster never again would a handcart company depart florence later than july 7 construction of handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs handcarts would now be regularly greased arrangements were made to replenish supplies along route hafen and hafen 1981 pp 143 144 by 1857 perpetual emigration fund was exhausted almost all of handcart emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way with increased cost number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2 000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857 hafen and hafen 1981 pp 148 149 193 nevertheless in 1857 two companies made trek both arriving in salt lake city by september 13 perhaps most notable incident was when a captain of u s army s utah expedition on its way to utah to enforce federal authority over young and latter day saints donated an ox to hungry emigrants hafen and hafen 1981 pp 153 164 with uncertainty caused by utah war church called off all european emigration for 1858 in 1859 one handcart company crossed plains emigrants were now able to travel by rail to saint joseph missouri after which they went by riverboat to florence where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies when 1859 company reached fort laramie they discovered their food was running dangerously short so they cut back on rations when they reached devil s gate last flour was distributed emigrant b beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough mountain men fed hungry emigrants one of mountain men then asked a young woman from company to stay with him which tired woman agreed to do william atkin recalled another version of story in which two young women married two mountain men hafen and hafen 1981 pp 173 174 hunger worsened when expected

hafen and hafen 1981 pp 179 190 outbreak of american civil war likely hastened handcart system s demise by disrupting immigration from europe and placing severe restrictions on rail travel from east coast in any case by end of that conflict church had implemented a new system of emigration in which wagon trains travelled east from salt lake city in spring and returned with emigrants in summer
