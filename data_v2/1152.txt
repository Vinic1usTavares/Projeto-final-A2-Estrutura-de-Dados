move was only checked by artillery fire from somerset battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for mounted riflemen to maintain their position and on flanks light horse were also held up german and ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards a gap between new zealanders and 2nd light horse brigade but 5th light horse regiment covered gap and german and ottoman advance was halted chauvel ordered 3rd light horse brigade which had been unable to turn german and ottoman flank to move towards new zealanders who renewed their efforts but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks as australians were unable to conform to their forward movement by 10 30 all progress had stopped new zealand mounted rifles brigade continued to hold on in centre while both flanks were bent back by pressure from strong german and ottoman force result was that new zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on forward slopes of

of enemy shellfire falls 1930 pp 197 8 a further withdrawal by 3rd light horse brigade made new zealand mounted rifles brigade s position critical and at 17 30 chauvel gave orders for a general

withdrawal continued back to el arish anzac mounted division s lines of communication were now fully extended and difficulties of supplying mounted troops from romani made it impossible for british empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time arrangements were made to hold and garrison country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements from katia eastwards to

guns a complete camel pack machine gun company 2 300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition two complete field hospitals with all instruments fittings and drugs while a great quantity of stores in supply depot at bir el abd was destroyed all captured arms and equipment were made in germany and camel pack machine gun company s equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare many of rifles were of latest pattern and made of steel murray estimated total german and ottoman casualties at about 9 000 while a german estimate put loss at one third of force 5 500 to 6 000 which seems low considering number of prisoners powles 1922 pp 38 9 tactics employed by anzac mounted division were to prove effective throughout coming campaigns in sinai and in levant also known at time as palestine key to mounted rifles and light horse s approach was to quickly move onto tactical ground and then to effectively operate as infantry once dismounted pugsley 2004 p 134 in defence artillery and machine guns wrought havoc on enemy attacks and during mounted advance they covered and supported british empire mounted force this battle was fought under extreme conditions in sinai desert in midsummer heat over many days causing much suffering to man and beast and demanding tenacity and endurance on part of all who took part battle of romani marked end of german and ottoman campaign against suez canal offensive had passed decisively into hands of british empire force led by anzac mounted division after battle von kressenstein s force was pushed back across sinai peninsula to be beaten at battle of magdhaba in december 1916 and back to border of ottoman empire controlled palestine to be defeated at battle of rafa in january 1917 which effectively secured egyptian sinai peninsula this successful seven month long british empire campaign begun at romani in august ended at first battle of gaza in march 1917 falls 1930 p 201 some criticisms battle of romani has however been surrounded with controversy and criticism it has been suggested that like attack on suez canal in 1915 it was merely a raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of canal that ottoman empire s intention was to strongly occupy romani and kantara is supported by preparations in southern territory of palestine adjacent to and extending into sinai these included extending palestine railway system to wadi el arish with a good motor road beside railway cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at wadi el arish enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in december 1916 when anzac mounted division reached that place just before battle of magdhaba powles 1922 p 40 murray lawrence and chauvel have all been criticised for letting von kressenstein s force escape further it has been asserted that tactics of mounted troops actually helped enemy withdrawal by concentrating on direct assaults rather than flank attacks bruce 2002 pp 46 8 official british historian acknowledges disappointment caused by successful retirement of german austrian and ottoman force but he also notes quality of successive rearguard positions constructed during advance and strength determination and endurance of enemy strength of rearguards was clearly demonstrated at bir el abd on 9 august when mounted force attempted to outflank large entrenched force they failed because they were greatly outnumbered downes 1938 pp 580 1 indeed if anzac mounted division had succeeded in getting round flank without infantry support they would have been faced with vastly superior forces and could have been annihilated woodward 2006 p 51 it has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on 5 august to encircle and capture invading austrian german and ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to katia infantry s difficulties regarding supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training together with lawrence s confusing orders for infantry in 52nd lowland division to move south and east stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off retreating force in early hours of second day s battle falls 1930 p 201 general lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend romani that strong enemy attack on 1st and 2nd light horse brigades during first night s battle pushed them so far back that planned flanking attack by new zealand mounted rifles brigade became almost a frontal attack lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at kantara which was considered to be too far from battlefield and that this contributed to his loss of control of battle during first day when telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with romani lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise execution of his orders on 5 august when there was a failure to coordinate movements of 3rd light horse brigade and mobile column bruce 2002 p 1955 pp 56 7 chauvel responded by pointing out that criticisms of battle were in danger of obscuring significance of victory awards murray lavished praise on anzac mounted division in cables to governors general of australia and new zealand and in his official despatch and in letters to robertson writing every day they show what an indispensable part of my forces they are i cannot speak too highly of gallantry steadfastness and untiring energy shown by this fine division throughout operations these anzac troops are keystone of defence of egypt hill 1978 p 95 but he failed to ensure fighting qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours further despite claims that chauvel alone had a clear view of battle that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining victory his name was omitted from long list of honours published on new year s day 1917 murray did offer chauvel a lesser award a distinguished service order for romani which he declined hill 1978 pp 86 1955 p 57 on reading murray s description in his official despatch covering battle and reprinted in a paris edition of daily mail chauvel wrote to his wife on 3 december 1916 i am afraid my men will be very angry when they see it i cannot understand why old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much and whole thing is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled hill 1978 p 86 it was not until after victory at battle of rafa that chauvel was made a knight commander of order of st michael and st george but this particular order is awarded for important non military service in a foreign country it was not just his military service at romani which had not been recognised but also service of all those who fought in anzac mounted division at romani at el arish at magdhaba and at rafa dennis et al 2008 p 1978 p 94 in september 1917 not long after general edmund allenby became commander in chief of egyptian expeditionary force chauvel wrote to ghq to point out injustice done to his front line troops acknowledging that it was difficult to do anything now to right this but consider commander in chief should know that there is a great deal of bitterness over it hill 1978 p 122 notes references bibliography further reading external links
