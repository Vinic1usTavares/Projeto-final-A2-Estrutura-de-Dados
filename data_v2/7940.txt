hanna and sr 29 current us 35 took place during 1950s us 30 in fort wayne was rerouted to a circumurban highway that was built along portions of alignments of road and california road to bypass most of fort wayne but this circumurban route later renamed coliseum boulevard since it passes directly by allen county war memorial coliseum quickly became a congested urban highway in its own right as it was not built to freeway standards in 1998 us 30 in fort wayne was again rerouted onto i 69 and i 469 becoming a true controlled access freeway bypass for most of fort wayne and new haven on north and east side of two cities old coliseum boulevard routing was assigned sr 930 designation as a result when local officials refused to let indot fully decommission route and turn responsibility for it
