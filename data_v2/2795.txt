chroogomphus vinicolor commonly known as wine cap chroogomphus or pine spike is a species of mushroom in family found in north america and dominican republic mushrooms grow on ground under pine trees fruit bodies have reddish brown shiny caps up to wide atop tapered stems up to long gills are thick initially pale orange before turning blackish and extend a short way down length of stem although mushroom is edible and sold in local markets in mexico it is not highly rated distinguishing this species from some other similar chroogomphus species is difficult as their morphology is similar and cap coloration is too variable to be a reliable characteristic c vinicolor is differentiated from european c rutilus and north american c ochraceus by thickness of its cystidial walls taxonomy species was first described as gomphidius vinicolor in 1898 by american mycologist charles horton peck based on specimens collected near lake mohonk in ulster county new york peck noted a resemblance to gomphidius roseus which he thought was closely related it was transferred to newly created genus chroogomphus by orson k miller jr in 1964 molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer dna sequences shows that c vinicolor groups in a clade with closely related c jamaicensis and c pseudovinicolor all of these species feature darkly amyloid flesh and thick walled cystidia based on this analysis miller considered c jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from c vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species however as of 2012 both mycobank and index fungorum list it as a valid species specific epithet vinicolor means wine colored it is commonly known as wine cap chroogomphus or pine spike description fruit body of c vinicolor has caps that are initially conical to convex before later flattening out sometimes developing a small umbo or a central depression caps measure wide its color is highly variable ranging from wine red to reddish brown to orange brown or yellow brown wine red stains develop where surface has dried or become rotten smooth cap surface is shiny somewhat sticky when wet and often radially streaked flesh is thick and orangish to ochraceous in color its taste and odor have been variously described as not distinctive or pleasant thick gills are decurrent attached to and extending a short ways down stem well spaced ochraceous buff to pale orange when young but turning to blackish after spores mature in his original description peck noted that gills when viewed with a hand lens appear velvety due to abundant spores fruit bodies are initially covered with a thin web like partial veil that soon disappears as cap expands cylindrical stem measures long by thick and taper towards base it is ochraceous to wine red or reddish brown with a dry smooth to fibrillose surface partial veil sometimes leaves an indistinct thin fibrous ring on upper stem spore print is greyish black spores are narrowly elliptical to spindle shaped smooth and measure 17 23 by 4 5 7 5 mm cystidia are somewhat spindle shaped or narrowly club shaped and measure 112 164 by 13 20 um they have characteristically thick walls up to 7 5 um wide in middle portion although mushroom is edible and is often free of insect damage it is not highly recommended except as fillers to include with more flavorful species flavor may improve with drying c vinicolor mushrooms are sold in local markets at tetela del volcan in state of morelos mexico there is a report of this species causing a contact sensitivity in which an individual who had handled mushroom developed a burning sensation in eyes and an itchy rash on eyelid after rubbing eyes similar species thumb right chroogomphus pseudovinicolor is larger and has a thick wooly or scaly stem two other chroogomphus species with a morphology and coloration similar to c vinicolor include c rutilus and c ochraceous c vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these on basis of having thick walled cystidia up to 5 7 5 mm at widest part other two species have been separated on basis of color with c ochraceous having brighter colors yellowish orange to ochraceous than c rutilus molecular analyses of european and north american collections suggest that c rutilus is restricted to europe c ochraceous only occurs in north america and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination another nearly identical species is c jamaicensis found in dominican republic jamaica and greater antilles it is distinguished microscopically by its slightly smaller spores measuring 17 20 by 4 5 6 mm cystidia with more uniformly thickened walls up to 5 mm thick and cuticular hyphae that measure 2 5 mm wide fruit bodies of c pseudovinicolor are more robust with wooly or scaly reddish stems up to thick further this species tends to produce spore prints that are greener than those of c vinicolor habitat and distribution mycorrhizal fungus sometimes fruits singly but more often in scattered or groups on ground under pines and other conifers fruiting usually occurs in cooler weather of later summer and autumn in coastal california however fruiting occurs in winter it is often found near suillus luteus and suillus brevipes and is known to parasitize mycelium of both those and truffle like species chroogomphus vinicolor has a widespread range in north america extending south to mexico it has also been recorded from dominican republic references category edible fungi category boletales category fungi described in 1964 category fungi of north america category fungi of
