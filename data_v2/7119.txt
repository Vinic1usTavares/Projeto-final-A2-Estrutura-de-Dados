was a pair of semi dreadnought battleships built for imperial japanese navy ijn in first decade of 20th century they were first battleships to be built in japan and marked a transitional stage between pre dreadnought and true dreadnought designs they saw no combat during world war i although led a squadron that occupied several german colonies in pacific ocean in 1914 both ships were disarmed and expended as targets in 1922 1924 in accordance with terms of washington naval treaty of 1922 background thumb left line drawing of battleship satsuma from brassey s naval annual 1912 aki similar but three funnels satsuma class was ordered in late 1904 under 1904 war naval supplementary program during russo japanese war itani lengerer rehm takahara p 53 unlike previous pre dreadnought battleships they were first battleships ordered from japanese shipyards although first ship in class satsuma used many imported components evans peattie p 159 they were originally intended to mount a dozen gun in four twin and four single gun turrets but combination of a shortage of japanese built 12 inch guns and their additional expense caused ships to be redesigned to carry four 12 inch and twelve guns all in twin gun turrets gardiner gray p 238 intended armament of these ships laid down before would have made them first all big gun battleships in world had they been completed to their original design probably reflecting extensive british technical assistance satsuma class ships greatly resembled an enlarged version of british with single gun amidships intermediate turrets replaced by twin gun turrets preston p 195 with their heavy intermediate armament ships were considered to be semi dreadnoughts a transitional stage between pre dreadnoughts with their light intermediate armament and dreadnoughts solely equipped with large guns jentschura jung mickel p 23 description construction of was delayed since she could not be laid down until slipway occupied by armored cruiser was freed by that ship s launching ijn took opportunity provided by delay to modify ship to accommodate steam turbines and various other changes that generally increased her size changes were great enough that aki is generally considered a half sister to satsuma crew ranged from 800 to 940 officers and enlisted men satsuma had an overall length of a beam of and a normal draft of she displaced at normal load aki was long overall had a beam of and same draft as her half sister she displaced at normal load propulsion satsuma was powered by a pair of vertical triple expansion steam engines each driving one propeller shaft using steam generated by 20 miyabara water tube boilers using a mixture of coal and fuel oil engines were rated at a total of and were designed to reach a top speed of during ship s sea trials she reached from satsuma carried a maximum of of coal and of oil which allowed her to steam for at a speed of unlike her half sister she only had two funnels aki was intended use same type of engines as her sister but ijn decided fit her with a pair of curtiss steam turbine sets after she was launched in 1907 itani lengerer rehm takahara p 60 turbines each powered one propeller shaft using steam from 15 miyabara boilers turbines were rated at a total of for a design speed of ship reached a top speed of during her sea trials from jentschura jung mickel pp 23 24 she carried a maximum of of coal and of oil gave her same range as her half sister armament ships were completed with four 45 caliber 12 inch 41st year type guns in two gun turrets one each fore and aft of superstructure they fired armor piercing ap shells at a muzzle velocity of friedman p 272 this gave a maximum range of itani lengerer rehm takahara p 67 intermediate armament was much more numerous than in preceding katori class with six twin gun turrets equipped with 45 caliber type 41 10 inch guns three turrets on each side of superstructure guns had a muzzle velocity of when firing shells friedman p 274 other major difference between two ships was that akis secondary armament consisted of eight 45 caliber 6 inch 152 mm 41st year type guns mounted in casemates in sides of hull gun fired a ap shell at a muzzle velocity of friedman p 276 satsuma in contrast was equipped with a dozen quick firing qf 40 caliber 4 7 inch 120 mm 41st year type guns mounted in casemates in sides of hull gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of friedman p 278 ships were also equipped with four satsuma or eight aki 40 caliber qf 12 pounder 12 cwt guns cwt is abbreviation for hundredweight 12 cwt referring to weight of gun and four 28 caliber qf 12 pounder guns both of these guns fired shells with muzzle velocities of and respectively friedman p 279 in addition battleships were fitted with five submerged torpedo tubes two on each broadside and one in stern armor waterline main belt of satsuma class vessels consisted of krupp cemented armor that had a maximum thickness of amidships and tapered to a thickness of inches at ends of ship a strake of armor protected casemates barbettes for main guns were thick armor of satsumas main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of inches and those of aki were an inch thicker deck armor was thick and conning tower was protected by six inches of armor ships shipbuilderlaid naval arsenalsilverstone p may november march as a target ship 7 september

these ships were obsolete even before they were completed ijn recognized that fact when it drew up first iteration of its eight eight fleet building plan for eight first class battleships and eight battlecruisers in 1910 and did not include them evans peattie pp 159 160 aki was refitting at kure and satsuma was assigned to 1st battleship squadron when world war i began in august 1914 latter served as rear admiral tatsuo matsumura s flagship in second south seas squadron as it seized german possessions of caroline and palau islands in october 1914 peattie pp 42 43 satsuma rejoined 1st battleship squadron in 1915 was refitted at sasebo naval arsenal in 1916 and served with 1st squadron for rest of war aki was also assigned to 1st squadron upon completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to 2nd battleship squadron in 1918 in years immediately following end of war united states britain and japan all launched huge naval construction programs all three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill advised and so convened washington naval conference to discuss arms limitations which produced washington naval treaty signed in february 1922 evans peattie pp 191 94 japan was well over tonnage limits and all of her obsolete predreadnought and semi dreadnought battleships had to be disposed of by end of 1924 washington naval treaty chapter i article ii both ships were disarmed at yokosuka in 1922 stricken from navy list during 1923 and converted into target ships aki was sunk by battlecruiser and battleship in tokyo bay on 2 september 1924 satsuma was sunk by battleships and five days later in same area notes footnotes references external links materials of imperial japanese navy category battleship classes
