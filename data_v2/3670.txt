1998 pacific hurricane season was a below average pacific hurricane season it had six major hurricanes which was well above average season officially started on may 15 in eastern pacific and on june 1 in central pacific and ended on november 30 these dates conventionally delimit period during which most tropical cyclones form in that region first tropical cyclone developed on june 11 about ten days later than normal start of season final storm of year hurricane madeline dissipated on october 20 storm activity in central pacific hurricane center s warning zone was low with just one tropical depression observed in region two tropical cyclones from eastern pacific darby and estelle also entered central pacific former did so as a hurricane most notable tropical cyclone of year was hurricane isis which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern baja california sur and coastal sinaloa in mexico isis caused considerable damage in nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars it later produced sporadic rainfall in southwestern united states leading to some traffic accidents in addition to isis tropical storm javier moved ashore coast of jalisco in mexico nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms all of which remained offshore one tropical cyclone hurricane lester affected central america causing two deaths in guatemala three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to southwestern united states and one hurricane produced rough surf along coast of california hurricane madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern texas seasonal summary season produced 13 named storms slightly below average of 15 named storms per season however season total of nine hurricanes was one above average and total of six major hurricanes surpassed average of three activity during season was hindered by northward movement of intertropical convergence zone itcz itcz which is normally situated south of gulf of tehuantepec shifted northward into central and southern mexico making cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures hence limiting number of storms that formed during season although a semi permanent anticyclone persisted through summer of 1998 causing most of storms to remain at sea some storm did threaten baja california peninsula due to a weakness in anticyclone except for hurricane kay all of storms of season originated from tropical waves accumulated cyclone energy is broadly speaking a measure of power of a storm multiplied by its duration so longer lived hurricanes have higher aces total ace for season was 133 97 x 104 kt2 because several storms in 1998 were long lasting or intense season s ace was near normal hurricane howard had highest ace measuring 29 27 x 104 kt2 systems tropical storm agatha a poorly defined tropical wave crossed central america into eastern pacific ocean on june 8 as it tracked westward under influence of a ridge to its north a broad circulation developed gradually dominant center of circulation became better defined with increasingly organized convection and developing banding features by early on june 11 center became sufficiently associated with convection for national hurricane center nhc to classify system as tropical depression one e this occurred while area of unsettled weather was about 460 miles 765 km south southwest of acapulco mexico center of depression was not initially well defined with restricted outflow in eastern half of circulation as such depression failed to attain any significant organization in days subsequent to its formation later an approaching tropical wave merged with depression resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization by june 13 nhc upgraded depression to tropical storm status and gave it name agatha agatha was about 650 miles 1050 km south southeast of cabo san lucas when it became a tropical storm as agatha became a tropical storm forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further due to its forecast track passing over cooler waters however agatha quickly strengthened developing a curved band of convection wrapping around its center and early on june 11 it attained a peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h while about 615 miles 985 km southwest of southern tip of baja california agatha maintained peak winds for about 12 hours before moving over colder waters and gradually weakening on june 15 it degenerated back into a tropical depression and a day later it dissipated over open waters of pacific ocean storm never affected land tropical depression two e a few days later another westward moving tropical disturbance paralleled southern coast of central america and mexico convection in area organized steadily and late on june 19 system developed into tropical depression two e about 260 miles 420 km south southwest of manzanillo mexico on becoming a tropical depression system maintained a large elongated low level circulation with some banding features and restricted outflow due to wind shear national hurricane center first predicted that depression would intensify reaching winds of 50 mph 80 km h though two computer models projected it to quickly dissipate under influence of a ridge over mexico depression moved to west northwest and under influence of increasing wind shear depression failed to organize significantly by june 20 circulation center was partially exposed and was located to northeast of primary convection traits that signal a weak storm two e approached tropical storm status though deep convection waned after system moved over cooler waters on june 21 national hurricane center issued last advisory on depression stating that depression maintained a very well defined low level circulation but had no convection associated with system locally heavy rains fell across southwest mexico in association with this system peaking at at las gaviotas compostela hurricane blas on june 8 a tropical wave emerged off coast of africa wave remained weak and nondescript as it crossed atlantic ocean and entered eastern pacific ocean on june 19 an area of convection developed and organized along wave s axis and national hurricane center began to employ dvorak classifications on june 20 convective banding features increased as broad circulation became better defined and on june 22 disturbance developed into tropical depression three e about 575 miles 925 km south of gulf of tehuantepec well defined steering currents resulted in a general west northwestward movement deep convection concentrated near center and about 12 hours after becoming a tropical depression system strengthened into tropical storm blas about 400 miles 640 km south of puerto angel oaxaca tropical storm blas continued to organize as it moved parallel to mexican coast banding features increased and on june 23 storm attained hurricane status about 345 miles 555 km southwest of acapulco next day an eye developed and became apparent on satellite imagery while upper level outflow became better defined blas quickly strengthened and reached its peak intensity on june 25 with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 225 km h while about 575 miles 925 km south southeast of southern tip of baja california temperatures warmed in convection around eye though eye remained visible for several days as blas turned west under influence of a ridge to its north on june 28 it degenerated into a tropical storm after entering an area of cooler water blas weakened to a tropical depression on june 30 and a day later was considered to have dissipated due to a lack of convection near center a remnant low level cloud swirl persisted for several days passing well to south of hawaii on july 5 before dissipating associated press attributed 4 deaths from a mudslide in michoacan to blas however as primary convection remained offshore national hurricane center did not consider deaths related to hurricane threat of blas prompted officials in acapulco to close port to all navigation tropical storm celia on july 1 another tropical wave emerged off coast of africa it moved westward due to strong wind shear without further organization and crossed central america into eastern pacific ocean on july 11 an area of organizing convection developed along wave axis and dvorak classifications began on july 13 while tropical wave was south of gulf of tehuantepec cloud pattern soon became disorganized and area of disturbed weather continued west northwestward on july 16 convection increased and organized into banding features early on july 17 system developed into tropical depression four e about 150 miles 240 km south of manzanillo mexico soon after becoming a tropical depression storm rapidly organized and intensified into tropical storm celia six hours after becoming a tropical depression tropical storm initially moved northwestward and briefly threatened southern baja california as a result government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning on july 18 for la paz southward shortly thereafter a mid to upper level anticyclone turned celia to west northwest and forced it to pass about 150 miles 240 km south southwest of cabo san lucas on july 19 celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection storm degenerated into a tropical depression on july 20 and celia dissipated early on july 21 well away from mexican coastline precursor tropical disturbance produced locally heavy rainfall along south coast of mexico authorities in mexico closed port at acapulco to small fishing and recreational boats and advised larger craft to use caution damage from storm if any is unknown hurricane darby a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on july 4 it tracked westward across atlantic ocean with little increase in convection and crossed central america into pacific ocean on july 16 three days later convection began to increase along wave axis while wave was well to south of acapulco mexico on july 21 dvorak classifications began as cloud pattern displayed curvature on satellite images convective banding features gradually developed and it is estimated that system organized into tropical depression five e early on july 23 about 720 miles 1160 km south of southern tip of baja california peninsula under influence of a mid to upper level ridge to its north depression tracked west northwestward convection became more concentrated as outflow organized further and 18 hours after depression first developed it intensified into tropical storm darby located in an area conducive to further development darby attained hurricane status on july 24 subsequent to development of a 17 mile 27 km wide eye eye became more distinct while surrounded by an area of deep convection and on july 25 hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h about 850 miles 1370 km southwest of cabo san lucas eye soon disappeared on satellite imagery believed to be from an eyewall replacement cycle and darby s winds weakened to about 105 mph 170 km h a 25 mile 40 km eye next developed and on july 26 hurricane re intensified to reach peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h for a 30 hour period darby attained characteristics of an annular hurricane retaining a well defined structure with few banding features for an extended period hurricane began to weaken while entering an area of cooler water and increased wind shear and after crossing into jurisdiction of central pacific hurricane center darby weakened to a tropical storm on july 29 storm degenerated into a tropical depression on july 31 and early on august 1 darby dissipated a moderate distance north of hawaiian islands it never affected land hurricane estelle on july 18 a tropical wave exited western coast of africa and moved westward across atlantic ocean with sporadic convection but no development wave moved across caribbean sea and southern gulf of mexico before crossing central america into eastern pacific ocean on july 28 early on july 29 dvorak classifications began on system and subsequent to formation of banding features and a surface circulation system developed into tropical depression six e about 170 miles 275 km southeast of manzanillo mexico depression continued to organize with increasing convection and distinct upper level outflow and early on july 30 depression intensified into tropical storm estelle tropical storm estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west northwestward a motion caused by a large anticyclone to its north on july 31 storm attained hurricane status about 550 miles 885 km south southeast of southern tip of baja california its intensification continued as a well defined eye about 30 miles 48 km in diameter became visible on satellite imagery and on august 2 estelle reached its peak intensity of 135 mph 215 km h hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and eye disappeared on satellite imagery two days after peaking in intensity estelle weakened to tropical storm status late on august 4 convection associated with storm dissipated and next day storm weakened to tropical depression status convection briefly re developed on august 6 though increased wind shear and cooler water weakened depression further two days later estelle dissipated about 400 miles 645 km east northeast of hawaiian islands high surf from estelle impacted southern california resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues storm disrupted trade winds around hawaii resulting in light winds and rain showers on kauai and oahu tropical storm frank on july 19 a tropical wave moved off coast of africa a mid level circulation developed to south of cape verde on july 22 though wave became less distinct as it continued westward wave axis crossed central america into eastern pacific ocean on july 31 convection steadily increased though it was not until august 4 that convection began to organize dvorak classifications began on august 4 and subsequent to formation of a low level circulation system developed into tropical depression seven e on august 6 about 550 miles 885 km south of southern tip of baja california peninsula depression tracked generally northward under influence of a ridge over mexico and a mid level trough to its west center of depression was initially elongated with northerly wind shear impacting structure of cyclone this at first prevented further strengthening though convection increased and organized into banding features as it moved through an area of warm water on august 8 depression intensified into tropical storm frank and it soon turned to north northwest brushing western coastline of baja california on august 9 frank reached peak winds of 45 mph 75 km h about 105 miles 170 km west northwest of ciudad constitucion it turned to northwest with a portion of circulation of land and steadily weakened after moving over cooler water on august 10 frank dissipated a short distance off baja california on august 8 government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning for portions of southwestern baja california peninsula officials ordered evacuation of some residents near cabo san lucas whose port was closed due to threat of mudslides gusty winds and moderate rainfall were reported in a localized area of baja california sur with rainfall peaking at 9 61 inches 244 mm at santa anita near los cabos moisture from frank extended into southwestern united states producing more than 2 inches 50 mm of rain in southern california and arizona one news agency attributed three deaths to storm though elsewhere there were no reports of damage hurricane georgette a tropical wave was first observed in eastern pacific ocean on august 4 in association with intertropical convergence zone it tracked westward and by august 9 a low level circulation formed well to south of mexico banding features increased as system detached from intertropical convergence zone and on august 11 system developed into tropical depression eight e about 730 miles 1170 km southwest of acapulco on becoming a tropical cyclone depression maintained an area of concentrated deep convection near center national hurricane center initially predicted that depression would slowly intensify and reach winds of 70 mph 115 km h within 72 hours for much of rest of storm s duration national hurricane center underestimated intensity of cyclone depression tracked steadily northwestward caused by its location along western periphery of a subtropical ridge it would retain that direction for most of its remaining duration late on august 11 it intensified into tropical storm georgette and two days later it attained hurricane status after developing a 40 mile 65 km eye about 615 miles 990 km south southwest of cabo san lucas eye became increasingly distinct while banding features became very well organized georgette attained peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h while centered 690 miles 1110 km west southwest of southern tip of baja california hurricane soon moved over cooler water and began to weaken as convection warmed and decreased on august 16 it degenerated into a tropical storm and georgette dissipated on august 17 without ever affecting land tropical depression one c an area of convection developed in association with a northward bulge of near equatorial convergence zone it tracked west northwestward under influence of a ridge to its north and organized into tropical depression one c on august 19 about 1000 miles 1600 km southeast of hawaiian islands depression failed to organize significantly as it turned westward high wind shear from an upper level trough continually weakened system and on august 19 central pacific hurricane center issued final advisory on tropical depression about 365 miles 585 km south of hilo on island of hawaii it never affected land hurricane howard a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on august 7 as it moved across atlantic ocean it failed to organize on reaching eastern pacific ocean on august 17 however an area of convection developed along wave axis dvorak classifications began next day and a broad center of circulation gradually formed convection was intermittent at first though it gradually organized and persisted near center and on august 20 disturbance developed into tropical depression nine e about south of puerto angel mexico it tracked generally west northwestward developing more pronounced banding features and on august 21 depression intensified into tropical storm howard center of howard became embedded within deep convection and storm quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status late on 21st an eye developed as outflow organized further and howard began to rapidly intensify to reach peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h about 600 miles 965 km south southeast of southern tip of baja california at time of its peak intensity eye was small and located within a very cold central dense overcast shortly after peaking in intensity eye of hurricane howard gradually became larger resulting in a slight weakening trend after weakening to winds of 125 mph 200 km h eye reached a diameter of about 30 miles 50 km and structure of hurricane transitioned into that of an annular hurricane similar to that of darby earlier in season howard strengthened again into a category 4 hurricane on august 25 before weakening slightly following day hurricane retained annular characteristics for about 48 hours before moving over cooler water on august 28 it weakened to a tropical storm and early on august 30 howard was considered to have dissipated a small low level swirl of clouds devoid of convection persisted for a few days before dissipating howard never affected land hurricane isis isis developed on september 1 out of interaction between a tropical wave and a large low level circulation to southwest of mexico it moved northward striking extreme southeastern portion of baja california peninsula before attaining hurricane status in gulf of california isis made landfall at topolobampo in state of sinaloa on september 3 and quickly lost its low level circulation remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in us state of idaho in mexico isis destroyed more than 700 houses and killed 14 people primarily due to heavy rainfall of more than 20 inches 500 mm in southern baja california sur rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways stranding thousands of people moisture from remnants of isis extended into southwestern united states resulting in light rainfall dozens of traffic accidents and power outages for thousands of residents in san diego county tropical storm javier javier is believed to have originated from a tropical wave that moved off coast of africa on august 22 a convective disturbance along northern portion of wave developed into atlantic hurricane danielle on august 24 while southern portion of wave axis continued westward wave remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed atlantic on september 3 an area of convection began to develop near acapulco at same time and location where wave would have been based on extrapolation disturbance became better defined on september 5 as it tracked west northwestward and on september 6 convection became sufficiently organized and persistent for national hurricane center to classify it as tropical depression eleven e while it was located about 200 miles 330 km southwest of manzanillo mexico easterly wind shear initially dislocated circulation center to eastern edge of convection subtropical ridge to its north resulted in a general west northwest motion and depression slowly intensified into tropical storm javier late on september 7 banding features in system did not organize significantly and on september 8 javier attained a peak intensity of 60 mph 95 km h which coincided with a sharp increase in convection over center steering currents soon weakened and storm turned to east while convection quickly decreased by september 9 center was exposed from diminishing deep convection and that night it degenerated into a tropical depression on september 11 national hurricane center issued its final advisory on javier though later analysis indicates that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward at times it became difficult to distinguish javier from broader area of disturbed weather that persisted over tropical eastern pacific though a brief increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40 mph 65 km h indicate that javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on september 12 it turned to northeast and reached winds of 50 mph 80 km h before weakening due to waning convection javier made landfall about 35 miles 55 km east southeast of cabo corrientes jalisco early on september 14 and dissipated within 12 hours of moving ashore national hurricane center advised small craft along coastal areas of mexico to monitor progress of storm javier produced moderate rainfall along coastal regions of mexico including a 24 hour peak of 7 36 inches 187 mm in colima 6 69 inches 170 mm in michoacan and 3 34 inches 85 mm in jalisco puerto vallarta reported highest total rainfall at 17 33 inches 440 mm hydrometeorological prediction center 2007 tropical storm javier retrieved on february 12 2007 damage if any is unknown tropical depression twelve e a tropical disturbance developed persistent convection in association with a low level circulation and organized into tropical depression twelve e late on october 1 about 350 miles 565 km west northwest of manzanillo mexico within an environment of weak steering currents depression was initially forecast to track slowly west northwestward and reach winds of 60 mph 95 km h but instead it drifted eastward before turning slowly to west depression failed to organize and gradually worsened in appearance early on october 2 two ships reported southwest winds much further to north with national hurricane center indicating that either center was exceedingly small that no center existed at time or that center was located far to north of thunderstorm activity operationally center was relocated further to north then relocated about to south six hours later based on visible satellite images then again relocated to north coinciding with officials issuing last advisory on system by early october 3 depression possessed only intermittent convection and later that day it dissipated to southwest of baja california peninsula heavy rains from its eastern periphery fell across southwest mexico with a maximum total of at las gaviotas compostela hurricane kay a small low level circulation separated itself from intertropical convergence zone on october 10 several hundred miles southwest of baja california circulation was well defined though its convection was initially minimal and disorganized on october 12 convection increased greatly and system was sufficiently organized to be classified tropical depression thirteen e early on october 13 about 715 miles 1150 km southwest of cabo san lucas dvorak classifications also indicated winds of about 35 mph 55 km h operationally depression was forecast to intensify to reach peak winds of 45 mph 70 km h while tracking steadily west northwestward storm center was at first ill defined and post season analysis estimates that it intensified into tropical storm kay about 6 hours after developing after becoming a tropical storm kay rapidly organized as it tracked generally westward a pinhole eye developed in center of convection and kay attained hurricane status late on october 13 about 18 hours after developing after remaining a hurricane for about 12 hours eye disappeared and convection weakened and early on october 14 kay degenerated into a tropical storm within an environment of weak steering currents storm turned to southwest then to south after weakening to a tropical depression on october 15 convection sporadically redeveloped but failed to persist kay turned to southeast and later to east and system dissipated on october 17 about 330 miles 530 km south southwest of its origin kay never affected land hurricane lester a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on september 29 and on october 5 an area of convection along wave developed into atlantic hurricane lisa wave axis continued westward and after crossing central america convection increased as it tracked northwestward and system organized into tropical depression fourteen e on october 15 about 200 miles 320 km south of guatemala it moved northwestward and late on 15th it intensified into tropical storm lester about 115 miles 185 km h south of border of mexico and guatemala before attaining hurricane status on october 16 lester continued westward and strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115 mph 185 km h on october 22 late on october 23 it degenerated into a tropical storm and several days later lester dissipated on october 26 early in its lifetime lester produced heavy rainfall across southwestern guatemala rainfall destroyed some houses and killed livestock and a mudslide from heavy precipitation killed two children in honduras rainfall from hurricane destroyed a bridge in tegucigalpa affecting about 1 000 people moisture brought around northeast periphery of sierra madre occidental led to a narrow band of heavy rainfall along upslope side of mountain range with a local precipitation maximum exceeding 14 inches 360 mm hydrometeorological prediction center 2007 hurricane lester retrieved on february 12 2007 though no surface reports are available it is estimated that tropical storm force winds occurred along coastal areas of southern mexico hurricane madeline a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on september 25 and remained disorganized while crossing atlantic ocean before crossing central america into pacific ocean it continued westward and on october 15 began to steadily organize until developing into tropical depression fifteen e on october 16 about 230 miles 370 km west southwest of manzanillo mexico at western end of a mid level ridge depression tracked north northwestward 12 hours after first developing depression intensified into tropical storm madeline banding features gradually improved in organization and late on october 17 madeline attained hurricane status on october 18 madeline attained peak winds of 85 mph 140 km h about 95 miles 150 km southwest of san blas nayarit late on october 19 hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm and early on october 20 madeline dissipated in southern portion of gulf of california some of rainbands from madeline moved over portions of southwest mexico with close to 9 inches 560 mm falling at cabo corrientes hydrometeorological prediction center 2007 hurricane madeline retrieved on february 12 2007 no damage or casualties were reported as a result of storm in mexico moisture from madeline contributed to heavy rainfall across southeastern texas reaching over 22 inches 560 mm in some locations thirty one people died due to
