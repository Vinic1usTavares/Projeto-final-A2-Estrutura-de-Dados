el chal is a pre columbian maya archaeological site located in upper san juan river valley of southeastern peten basin region guatemala site is situated approximately to north of modern town of dolores near contemporary village settlement of same name lying some to south el chal was occupied from approximately 300 bc through to 1300 ad from late preclassic through to early postclassic periods of mesoamerican chronology although some middle preclassic activity has been identified in acropolis late preclassic occupation of city was concentrated around an e group ceremonial complex some north of later site core quezada et al 1998 pp 3 11 12 site s major period of occupation was during late classic period when it was an important centre in southeastern peten region laporte 2005 p 212 among structures at site is a large quadrangular residential complex a structural type that is uncommonly found at southern maya lowland sites although there is a smaller one with similar characteristics at machaquila very little restorative work has been undertaken at site archaeological site is protected by guatemalan instituto de antropologia e historia morales 1995 p 493 location thumb left entrance to archaeological site el chal is located in municipality of dolores in department of peten in northern guatemala el chal is south of flores departmental capital 1998 p 354 archaeological site is within southern area of a village also named el chal to south of highway to flores morales 1995 p 494 site is situated in central peten wet savanna in a well drained area not subject to seasonal flooding local topography is karstic in nature and includes hills that support some of city s architecture morales et al 1994 p 368 el chal is located within valley of san juan river which is a tributary of pasion river at an altitude of above mean sea level site is situated on a natural north south communication route between maya mountains and central peten region this route was used during colonial period and was likely to have been inherited from pre conquest times some of major architecture of site core is covered by secondary forest including some large trees while much of city s remains lie within modern village including mounds of various sizes morales 1993 p 14 some mounds were destroyed in order to build modern streets in other cases mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction there are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms modern houses had previously also occupied outskirts of acropolis but were relocated during guatemalan civil war in late 20th century due to guerrilla activity morales 1993 p 15 history el chal was first occupied in middle preclassic period with ceramics associated with a burial being recovered from acropolis late preclassic occupation has only been identified in a few residential groups in site core morales 1995 p 499 quezada et al 1998 p 20 during preclassic centre of city was probably situated some distance to northeast of late classic centre where a large ritual complex is located thumb right badly eroded lower panel of stela 4 depicting three kneeling captives major period of occupation at site was during late classic when most of major architecture was built morales 1995 p 499 at this time city centre was moved to site core around newly built acropolis complex quezada et al 1998 p 20 sculpted monuments of city indicate that it was important enough during late classic to possess its own emblem glyph city experienced a period of intensive construction lasting from late classic through to terminal classic all hieroglyphic texts sculpted on monuments at el chal date to 8th century ad although inscriptions are heavily eroded residential groups constructed upon platforms in panorama sector were built in late classic when a flint workshop was in production in panorama group 19 during late classic occupation also expanded throughout other sectors of city arrepentimiento municipal and central during terminal classic el chal maintained its primary place in san juan valley laporte 2005 p 225 this is evidenced by major building activity in site core where massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by erection of new monuments to accompany already existing late classic monuments laporte 2005 p 228 continued importance of el chal in terminal classic resulted in other centres in region being eclipsed such as el eden and el to west and la puente and el to southeast during terminal classic el chal developed its own ceramic production industry in spite of continued intensive activity in site core in panorama sector and other peripheral residential sectors there was a diminishing of activity compared to late classic perhaps leading up to abandonment of city postclassic period occupation of el chal has been identified from ceramic fragments recovered from structure 1 in northwest plaza chocon 2008 p 404 a few postclassic potsherds were also excavated from group 15 in central sector modern history name el chal first appears on a spanish colonial watercolour from 1735 together with other villages in region with name of el chal or el chacal it also appears on a map of central and southeastern peten from 1860 together with poptun concepcion san clemente and ruins of ixkun morales 1995 pp 493 494 some of stonework from ruins has been stripped to be used in construction of modern village site was visited by archaeologists richard kirsch and ian graham in 1974 and 1975 but their work was never published in 1989 atlas arqueologico de guatemala mapped site and catalogued remaining monuments in 1993 first test excavations took place and an area of around site core was explored in 1970s some sculpted monuments were removed from el chal by fydep fomento y desarrollo del peten peten patronage and development and were later transferred to tikal national park by mid 1990s exact location and identity of these monuments had been lost further excavations have taken place since 1990s including investigations of west plaza in 2003 east plaza in 2004 acropolis in 2005 2006 and

acropolis and three ceremonial plazas in which majority of sculpted monuments were found east plaza west plaza and northeast plaza there are also a number of other plazas in site core plazas and majority of residential structures were laid out upon naturally level terrain while acropolis was built upon a natural limestone hill and a very few residential groups were built upon artificial basal platforms a reservoir is located to northwest of acropolis it was built with irregular limestone blocks and measures across in rain season it fills to a depth of and contains a second natural reservoir is located to south of artificial reservoir and west of acropolis morales 1993 p 17 in rain season it also fills to a depth of large ritual complex of el chal was located a considerable distance to northeast of civic centre of city and was probably first built in preclassic period archaeologists have mapped 268 structures clustered in 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in site core morales 1995 p 496 residential structures were concentrated in area surrounding ceremonial centre especially on north and west sides near to reservoir residences tended to be larger closer they were to reservoir residential area of el chal was extensive and archaeologists have divided it into four sectors municipal consists of area occupied by modern village el arrepentimiento is northeastern portion of site panorama is northwestern area and central is site core quezada et al 1998 p 1 central el chal contains 25 groups arrepentimiento contains 40 groups panorama contains 53 groups and municipal contains 18 groups laporte 2005 p 212 quezada et al 1998 pp 15 16 panorama was an area of chert production while municipal is associated with ritual complex of city central sector

material excavated from area around stairway where it joined base of acropolis has been dated to late and terminal classic patio d itself was laid out at very beginning of late classic period it was resurfaced a number of times in late classic and earliest of surrounding structures were built at this time additional structures were built in terminal classic and patio area was extended with construction of adjacent patio g patio e was also accessed via a stairway from base of acropolis although it is very poorly preserved ceramics recovered from western portion of lower terrace dated it to late and terminal classic corzo et al 2005 p 78 a low platform was excavated in extreme southwestern corner of lower terrace although most of ceramic finds were dated to terminal classic some

one residential patio group patio f formed by five structures patio a patio a was formed by a group of 5 buildings serving a dual residential and administrative function reyes 2008 p 245 evidence of this is fact that structures in group were divided into multiple rooms with internal benches a form of architecture that is recognised as being a palace and that may serve for either elite domestic or administrative activity seibert 2006 p 110 stone blocks used in construction measured approximately on each side with a finely dressed front face tapering towards back in order to grip structural fill
