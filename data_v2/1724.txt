thumb right 300px barton aqueduct shortly before its demolition in 1893 barton aqueduct opened on 17 july 1761 carried bridgewater canal over river irwell at barton upon irwell in historic county of lancashire england designed largely by james brindley under direction of john gilbert it was first navigable aqueduct to be built in england one of seven wonders of canal age according to industrial archaeologist mike nevell construction proceeded quickly but disaster almost struck when aqueduct was first filled with water and one of its three arches began to buckle under weight remedial work took several months but aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after enabling act of parliament had been passed on 17 july 1761 it remained in use for more than 100 years until construction of manchester ship canal necessitated its demolition in 1893 replaced by barton swing aqueduct background original intention was for bridgewater canal to reach salford from duke of bridgewater s coal mines in worsley by remaining on north bank of irwell work began in 1759 but it was quickly decided to alter route by building a masonry aqueduct to carry waterway over irwell at barton and terminate instead in manchester to south of river a bill to authorise new route was presented to parliament on 13 november 1759 and in january following year brindley travelled to london to give evidence before a parliamentary committee in support of proposal although a gifted engineer brindley had no formal education and rarely if ever committed his designs to paper when questioned by parliamentary committee about composition of puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence he had a mass of clay brought into committee room he then formed clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a watertight seal if it had been worked with water to form puddle thus it is said brindley that i form a watertight trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross path of canal later when asked to produce a drawing of bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model he then went out and bought a large round of cheshire cheese which he divided into two equal halves saying here is my model then to amusement of committee he used two halves of cheese to represent semicircular arches and laid a long rectangular object over top to demonstrate position of river flowing under aqueduct and canal flowing over it although duke had seen navigable aqueducts in use on canals when travelling abroad on his grand tour idea of an such a structure carrying a canal over a river was new to england and was ridiculed by contemporary engineers one brought in to review plans at brindley s request commented in a report to duke of bridgewater that i have often heard of castles in air but never before saw where one was to be erected necessary act of parliament was passed in march 1760 and was quite specific about form aqueduct had to take to protect viability of mersey irwell navigation below there was already a three arch road bridge barton bridge passing over irwell and aqueduct was required not to restrict traffic on river any more than road bridge already did it had to have same number of arches foundations for which had to be fixed in river bed and arches had to be at least as wide and high as those of road bridge construction thumb watercolour pen and ink drawing of barton aqueduct in 1793 by g f yates at about long wide and above river at its highest point aqueduct was for its time an enormous construction early illustrations show aqueduct s piers to have been flat faced but an engraving of 1864 shows them to have pointed cutwaters extending beyond spring of arch it is likely that piers were refaced in early 1820s arches were composed of several rings of brickwork with masonry used for decorative keystones all masonry used in structure was coursed ashlar on day it was first tested water was allowed to flow in but one of arches began to buckle under weight brindley overcome with anxiety retired to his bed at bishop blaize tavern in nearby stretford gilbert realising that brindley had placed too much weight on sides of arch removed clay and laid layers of straw and freshly puddled clay when water was allowed to flow in again masonry held firm according to a statement by francis egerton 8th earl of bridgewater printed in 1820 his uncle duke had told him that there was a distortion of one of arches and that gilbert had addressed problem by placing more weight on crown of arch and less on haunches arch was then covered with straw and allowed to stand until following spring when mortar was set and arch had become stable but its curve remained irregular operation and legacy aqueduct was opened to traffic on 17 july 1761 only 15 months after enabling act had been passed and it was soon being used by duke s barges to carry coal to manchester from his mines at worsley construction of aqueduct excited great admiration and writers of day often remarked on strange and novel sight afforded by canal where it crossed irwell structure became one of wonders of age and crowds came from all over country to view it along with drilling of for duke s worsley navigable levels those who saw it were often struck by advantages of still water navigation when they saw ten or twelve men slowly hauling a single barge against flow of irwell while above a horse mule or perhaps two men could be seen hauling several linked barges across still waters of aqueduct although aqueduct was wide overall waterway it carried was only half that width bridgewater canal had been built to accommodate mersey flat boats then in common use which had a beam of about making two way traffic impossible a signalling system was therefore installed to control access to aqueduct a pole high in centre of arch at stretford bank supported a semaphore system with two arms on each side operated by levers at ground level although gilbert later had to resurface aqueduct structure remained in use for more than 100 years in first volume of his lives of engineers 1862 scottish author samuel smiles said of construction that humble though it now appears it was parent of magnificent aqueducts of rennie and telford and viaducts of stephenson and brunel replacement barton aqueduct s fate was sealed with passage of manchester ship canal act 1885 which allowed for construction of a navigable waterway large enough to accommodate ocean going vessels from estuary of river mersey into manchester partly along irwell as arches of aqueduct were too small to allow large ships to pass through it was demolished in 1893 and replaced by barton swing aqueduct still in use today so solidly built was old aqueduct that dynamite had to be used to expedite its demolition some of stonework of brindley s aqueduct has been preserved in nearby
