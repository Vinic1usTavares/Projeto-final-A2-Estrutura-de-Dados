nemegtomaia is a genus of oviraptorid dinosaur from what is now mongolia that lived in late cretaceous period about 70million years ago first specimen was found in 1996 and became basis of new genus and species n barsboldi in 2004 original genus name was nemegtia but this was changed to nemegtomaia in 2005 as former name was preoccupied first part of generic name refers to nemegt basin where animal was found and second part means good mother in reference to fact that oviraptorids are known to have brooded their eggs specific name honours palaeontologist rinchen barsbold two more specimens were found in 2007 one of which was found on top of a nest with eggs but dinosaur had received its genus name before it was found associated with eggs nemegtomaia is estimated to have been around 2 m 7 ft in length and to have weighed 40 kg 85 lb as an oviraptorosaur it would have been feathered it had a deep narrow and short skull with an arched crest it was toothless had a short snout with a parrot like beak and a pair of tooth like projections on its palate it had three fingers first was largest and bore a strong claw nemegtomaia is classified as a member of oviraptorid subfamily ingeniinae and is only known member of this group with a cranial crest though nemegtomaia has been used to suggest that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds clade is generally considered a group of non avian dinosaurs nesting nemegtomaia specimen was placed on top of what was probably a ring of eggs with its arms folded across them none of eggs are complete but they are estimated to have been 5to 6 cm 2to 2 3in wide and 16 cm 5to 6in long when intact specimen was found in a stratigraphic area that indicates nemegtomaia preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft sandy substrate and food nemegtomaia may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers skeleton of nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was scavenged by skin beetles diet of oviraptorids is uncertain but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been herbivorous nemegtomaia is known from nemegt and baruungoyot formations which are thought to represent humid and arid environments that coexisted in same area description thumb left size compared to a human nemegtomaia is estimated to have been around 2 m 7 ft in length and to have weighed 40 kg 85 lb a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives as an oviraptorosaur it would have been feathered neural spines of neck cervical vertebrae were short and neural arches had an x shaped appearance middle three of these vertebrae were largest scapula shoulder blade appears to have been 185 mm 7 in in total length humerus upper arm bone had a fossa depression in a position similar to modern birds but atypical among oviraptorosaurs and appears to have been 152 mm 6 in long radius of lower arm was straight oval in cross section and may have been 144 mm 5 in long first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual claw bone and was more massive than two other fingers second finger was slightly longer than first and third finger was smallest upper margin of ilium of pelvis was straight and though both ilia were close to each other they were not fused together pubic shaft was turned backwards femur thigh bone is estimated to have been 286 mm 11 in long and tibia of lower leg 317 mm long 12 in thumb restoration of a nesting individual skull of nemegtomaia was deep narrow and short compared to rest of body and reached 179 mm 7 in in length it had a well developed crest formed by nasal and premaxilla bones mainly latter of snout nearly vertical front margin of holotype s crest formed an almost 90degree angle with upper margin of skull compared to other oviraptorids nasal processes projections of premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above where they connected with nasal bones on highest points of crest crest extended hindwards and down forming a round arch at highest point diameter of orbit eye opening was 52 mm 2 in eyes looked large due to shortness of skull antorbital cavity in front of eye consisted of two fenestrae openings a large antorbital fenestra at back and a small maxillary fenestra at front nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that frontal bone on midline of skull was about 25 length of parietal bone from front to back nares external nostrils were relatively small and placed high on skull thumb left preserved parts and reconstruction of specimen mpc d107 15 s skull jaws of nemegtomaia were toothless and like other oviraptorid dinosaurs it had a short snout with a deep robust and somewhat parrot like beak it had a hard palate formed by premaxillae vomers and maxillae like other oviraptorids palate was strongly concave downwards projecting and had a cleft on central part as in other oviraptorids it had a pair of tooth like projections on palate that were directed downwards a feature that has been called pseudo teeth nemegtomaia had small foramina openings on sides of suture joint between premaxillae at front of snout which may have been nutrient openings and which indicate presence of a keratinous bill lower jaw was short and deep with a convex lower surface and reached 153 mm 6 in in length dentary bone of lower jaw reached 50 mm 2 in at its highest point mandibular symphysis where two halves of lower jaw connected was short deep and very pneumatised with air spaces mandibular fenestra was large and was located at front part of lower jaw as in most other oviraptorids front of lower jaw was down turned though nemegtomaia does not possess any single feature that distinguishes it from other oviraptorids autapomorphies combination of a crest an enlarged first finger and a high number of sacral vertebrae eight is unique to this taxon history of discovery thumb maps showing nemegt locality a b and where nemegtomaia specimens have been found c in 1996 japanese palaeontologist yoshitsugu kobayashi as part of mongolian highland international dinosaur project team found an incomplete skeleton of an oviraptorid dinosaur in nemegt formation of gobi desert in southwestern mongolia specimen mpc d100 2112 at mongolian palaeontological center formerly pc and 2112 consists of a nearly complete skull and a partial skeleton including cervical dorsal sacral and caudal vertebrae a left scapula lower ends of both humeri right radius both ilia upper ends of both pubic bones both ischia and upper end of a femur specimen was described as a new specimen of genus ingenia referred to as ingenia sp of uncertain species by chinese palaeontologist lu junchang and colleagues in 2002 and used to highlight similarities between oviraptorosaurs and birds lu j dong z azuma y barsbold r y 2002 oviraptorosaurs compared to birds in zhou z zhang f eds proceedings of 5th symposium of society of avian paleontology and evolution beijing science press pp 175 189 thumb left skeletal diagrams showing preserved elements of three known specimens in grey composite on right in 2004 lu and colleagues determined that skeleton belonged to a new distinct taxon and made it holotype specimen of nemegtia barsboldi genus name refers to nemegt basin and specific name honours mongolian palaeontologist rinchen barsbold leader of team that found specimen in 2005 describers discovered after being notified by a biologist that name nemegtia had already been used for a genus of freshwater seed shrimp from same formation in 1978 and was therefore preoccupied they proposed instead new genus name nemegtomaia maia means good mother in greek and full name means good mother of nemegt making reference to then recent discovery that oviraptorids brooded eggs rather than stealing them though no trace of a nest or eggs had yet been found associated with nemegtomaia itself first known member of oviraptorid family was found with a nest of eggs originally thought to have belonged to ceratopsian genus protoceratops and was therefore named oviraptor in 1924 this name means egg in 1990s more oviraptorid specimens were discovered associated with nests and eggs wherein oviraptorid embryos were found thereby proving that eggs belonged to oviraptorids themselves ingenia was similarly renamed as ajancingenia in 2013 since former genus name was preoccupied by a roundworm nematoda thumb nest diagram a bones of nesting specimen that covered eggs b d and a lower layer of eggs e g in 2007 two new specimens of nemegtomaia were found by dinosaurs of gobi expedition and were described by italian palaeontologist federico fanti and colleagues in 2013 first specimen mpc d107 15 was found by fanti who nicknamed it mary in baruungoyot formation and consists of a nest with presumed parent on top as fourth genus of oviraptorid found on top of a nest after oviraptor citipati and cf nemegtomaia had therefore received a genus name referring to this feature before it was itself found associated with eggs specimen was excavated from a vertical cliff under difficult circumstances including heavy rain and collapsing sandstone blocks skeleton preserves parts of skull both scapulae left arm and hand right humerus pubic bones ischia femora tibiae fibulae and lower portions of both feet this specimen was found less than 500 m 1640 ft from holotype and was of same size it was assigned to nemegtomaia due to its similar anatomical features and geographical proximity it was collected in a single block so that spatial relationship of bones and eggs would be preserved second specimen mpc d107 16 was found by american palaeontologist nicholas r longrich in nemegt formation and consists of hands a partial left ulna and radius ribs a partial pelvis and both femora this specimen was 35 smaller than others and was assigned to nemegtomaia due to its hands having same characteristics as those of specimen mpc d107 15 it is possible that hands may have belonged to a different individual as they were not found articulated with rest of skeleton other oviraptorids are known from quarries with multiple skeletons but this cannot be confirmed classification in their 2004 phylogenetic analysis lu and colleagues classified nemegtomaia as a derived or advanced oviraptorosaur and found it to be most closely related to genus citipati in 2010 longrich and colleagues determined that nemegtomaia belonged in family oviraptoridae as part of subfamily ingeniinae making it only member of latter group with a prominent crest members of other recognised subfamily all possess crests ingeniines are distinguished by smaller size short and robust forelimbs with weakly curved claws number of vertebrae in as well as certain features of feet and pelvis longrich and colleagues suggested that presence of a crest on nemegtomaia makes it possible that this feature evolved or disappeared several times among oviraptorids or that animal may not have been an ingeniine in 2010 american palaeontologist gregory s paul suggested that crestless oviraptorids were either juveniles or females of otherwise crested species and that number of genera in group was therefore exaggerated he listed nemegtomaia as citipati nemegtomaia barsboldi considering it very similar to that genus but in 2016 he instead listed it as conchoraptor nemegtomaia barsboldi in 2012 fanti and colleagues also found nemegtomaia to be part of ingeniinae as a derived member closest to heyuannia due to proportions of hands of two new specimens relatively short with a robust first finger they stated that though presence of crests is generally associated with rather than ingeniines feature may be correlated with size and maturity they pointed out that nasal and frontal bones of ingeniine conchoraptor were pneumatic and could potentially have grown into a crest as animal matured though all known skeletons of that genus are of same small size and one specimen appears to have been fully grown cladogram below shows placement of nemegtomaia within oviraptoridae according to fanti etal 2012 thumb restorations of oviraptorid heads shown to scale k is nemegtomaia evolution thumb left 350px hand bones of oviraptorosaurs compared p is hand of nemegtomaia grouped within ingeniinae clade oviraptorosauria is generally regarded as a group of non avian or non bird theropod dinosaurs and their similarity to birds aves has often been noted fossils of oviraptorosaurs in family have historically been confused with those of birds and some researchers have gone so far as to consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non avian dinosaurs in 2002 lu and colleagues used then unnamed nemegtomaia to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs and found latter group to be closer to birds than to bird like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs they therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds rather than non avian dinosaurs and noted that boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult to delineate other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to birds together forming group paraves oviraptorosaurs therizinosaurs and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and paraves is called and this group is defined by presence of pennaceous feathers feathers with a stalk oviraptorosaurs are known from asia where they may have originated and north america and are mainly known from deposits that date from campanian maastrichtian ages of cretaceous period group includes small to large members and they are characterised by their short skulls and beaks elongated fingers and short tails basal or primitive members had teeth which disappeared in derived members of group those within superfamily which includes oviraptoridae they were at least partially herbivorous and brooded their nests in a bird like posture though they are all thought to have to been feathered they appear to have been flightless cranial crests appear to have evolved convergently in different lineages within group family oviraptoridae to which nemegtomaia belongs consisted of generally small members and is exclusively known from upper cretaceous of asia with most genera having been discovered in gobi desert of mongolia and china including nemegtomaia at least nine oviraptorid genera have been discovered in a relatively small geographical area in gobi desert palaeobiology reproduction thumb diagram showing remains and body outline of nesting specimen nemegtomaia specimen mpc d 107 15 was found associated with a nest with eggs its feet were placed in centre of what was probably a ring of eggs with arms folded across tops of eggs on each side of body a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids collected part of nest is about 90 cm 35 in wide and 100 cm 30 in long skeleton occupies upper 25 cm 10 in of block whereas remaining 20 cm 8 in is occupied by broken eggs and shells there is no evidence of plant material in nest but there are fragments of undetermined bones nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos which prevents determination of size shape number and arrangement of eggs in nest it is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below body and there do not appear to have been eggs in centre of nest most eggs seven distinct eggs have been identified and egg fragments were recovered either in lower layer of nest or under skull neck and limbs of specimen and bones either rested directly on eggs or were within 5 mm 0 2 in of their surfaces that skeleton was directly positioned on top of it shows that nest was not completely covered by sand though placement of eggs does not suggest a specific arrangement in nest most other oviraptorid nests show that eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles eggs of mpc d107 15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial or by external factors such as strong winds sandstorms or predators this also supports idea that upper layer of eggs was not buried as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors thumb left details of eggs preserved with nesting specimen oviraptorid eggs appear to have been 17 cm 6 in long on average and most complete eggs found with mpc d107 15 are thought to have been 5to 6 cm 2to 2 3in wide and 14 to 16 cm 5to 6in long when intact eggs are nearly identical to some that have previously been found in mongolia and have therefore been assigned to oofamily egg taxon family elongatoolithidae eggshells are relatively thin between 1 2 mm 0 0 and their outer surface is covered by ridges and nodes that rise about 0 3 mm 0 01 in above shell micro structure of eggshells could not be properly studied as calcite has been heavily altered and re crystallized nesting specimen was found in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric receiving a small amount of moisture many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods similar to modern birds such as ostrich emu and black breasted buzzard which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in nest for large parts of day and for eggs and nestlings due to heat stress choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat it has also been suggested that evolution of tail feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests that second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to robust first finger may be explained by a change in function it may be related to presence of long wing feathers that were attached to second finger these wing feathers were probably used to protect eggs during nesting when second finger began functioning as a feather support its ability to grasp was reduced and this function was taken over by first finger which therefore became more robust third finger was reduced in size too probably because it was positioned behind wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping in 2018 taiwanese palaeontologist tzu yang and colleagues identified cuticle layers on egg shells of maniraptoran dinosaurs including oviraptorids in modern birds such layers which consist mainly of lipids and serve to protect eggs from dehydration and invasion of microbes researchers suggested that cuticle coated eggs would have been a trait adapted for enhancing their reproductive success in variable environments where nemegtomaia and other oviraptorids nested thumb brooding behaviour of oviraptorids is thought to have been similar to that of birds here a male somali ostrich various studies have suggested that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual possibly a male in 2010 american palaeontologist david j varricchio and colleagues found that relatively large clutch size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs birds and crocodilians closest living relatives of dinosaurs that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care as seen in such as ostriches and emus this reproductive system pre dates origin of birds and would therefore be ancestral condition for modern birds with care where both parents participate being a later development many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had on end of their tails which suggests presence of feather fans american palaeontologist w scott persons and colleagues suggested in 2013 that these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals diet and feeding thumb left lower jaw of holotype specimen with beak on right diet of oviraptorids has been interpreted in various ways since time oviraptor was wrongly thought to have been a predator of eggs it has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores which is supported by gastroliths stomach stones found in and wear facets in teeth of in 2010 longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods four limbed animals especially those of dicynodonts an extinct group of synapsid stem mammals oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short deep and toothless mandibles elongated dentary symphyses elongated mandibular fenestrae and a downwards projecting bar in palate modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises latter group also has tooth like projections on their premaxillae longrich and colleagues concluded that due to similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in formations they are known from similar to pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs as more energy was available at their lower trophic level in food chain jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food such as xerophytic vegetation adapted for environments with little water that would have grown in their environment but this is not possible to demonstrate as little is known about flora of area at time a 2013 study by lu and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their hind limb proportions throughout ontogeny growth which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals in 2017 canadian palaeontologist gregory f funston and colleagues suggested that parrot like jaws of oviraptorids may indicate a frugivorous diet that incorporated nuts and seeds thumb diagrams showing hands of specimen mpc d 107 15 and 107 16 in 1977 barsbold suggested that oviraptorids fed on molluscs but longrich and colleagues rejected idea that they practised shell crushing altogether since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces instead shape of dentary bones in lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp edged beak used for shearing tough food not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs symphyseal shelf at front of dentary may have given some ability for crushing but as this was a relatively small area it was probably not main function of jaws fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them longrich and colleagues pointed out that robust forelimbs and enlargement of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites such as anteaters and pangolins but of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous researchers found that function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear but suggested that they could have been used for scratching tearing or digging though not prey capture in 2004 lu and colleagues proposed that articulation between quadrate and quadratojugal bones in skull of nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other which would have affected how jaws functioned in 2015 belgian palaeontologist christophe hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that nemegtomaia and other had bird like kinesis in their skulls due to quadrate bone being immobile palaeoecology thumb left map and diagram showing relation between interfingering baruungoyot and nemegt formations nemegtomaia is known from nemegt and baruungoyot formations which date to upper campanian lower maastrichtian ages of late cretaceous period about 70million years ago though this taxon is known only from nemegt locality unidentified oviraptorid remains from other localities may belong to it nemegt massif has numerous canyons or gorges up to deep which have some of best exposures of these formations rock facies of nemegt formation are thought to represent a humid fluvial associated with rivers and streams environment whereas those of baruungoyot formation are thought to represent an arid or semi arid environment with aeolian affected by wind beds these two formations with their diverse fossils were historically thought to represent sequential time periods with different environments but in 2009 canadian palaeontologist davida eberth and colleagues found that there was partial overlap across transition between them two formations across a stratigraphic interval that is about 25 m 82 ft thick which suggests that fluvial and aeolian environments coexisted when area was sedimented thumb photos of interfingering contacts between formations environment of nemegt formation has been compared to okavango delta of present day botswana habitats in and around nemegt rivers provided a home for a wide array of organisms aquatic animals include molluscs fish turtles and crocodylomorph shamosuchus fossils of mammals such as multituberculates have been found and birds such as gurilynia judinornis and teviornis are known herbivorous dinosaurs of nemegt formation include ankylosaurids such as tarchia pachycephalosaurian prenocephale hadrosaurids such as saurolophus and barsboldia and sauropods such as nemegtosaurus and opisthocoelicaudia other theropods include tyrannosauroids such as tarbosaurus alioramus and bagaraatan troodontids such as borogovia tochisaurus and therizinosaurs such as therizinosaurus and ornithomimosaurians such as deinocheirus anserimimus and gallimimus other oviraptorosaur genera known from nemegt formation include basal oviraptorids rinchenia and ajancingenia and caenagnathid elmisaurus in addition conchoraptor is known from baruungoyot formation in spite of high number of oviraptorid taxa in these formations nemegt has highest known diversity of them anywhere none of them were closely related nemegt formation is unique in having both oviraptorid and caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs and in 1993 canadian palaeontologist phillip j currie and colleagues suggested this diversity was due to two groups preferring different environments in area in 2016 japanese palaeontologist takanobu and colleagues suggested that oviraptorids may have preferred drier environments while caenagnathids preferred fluvial environments based on type of formations they have been found in funston and colleagues suggested that oviraptorids were found in both xeric and mesic environments but were more abundant in former whereas other oviraptorosaur groups avoided xeric environments and that coexistence of families can be explained by niche partitioning in diet environment of nemegt formation may have acted as an oasis and thereby attracted oviraptorids taphonomy thumb feeding traces from skin beetles on nesting specimen nesting specimen mpc d 107 15 has provided much information about taphonomic processes changes during decay and fossilisation in baruungoyot formation specimen is preserved in facies that are thought to have been deposited through a sandstorm or dune shift it does not seem to have been transported after death but body appears to have shifted slightly to right indicating sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side neck is curved to left left hand is folded backwards and legs are folded into a crouching position vertebral column neck and hips deteriorated during burial and much of damage to skeleton is thought to have been caused by activity of invertebrates borings in bones burrows and reworked sediments perhaps caused by construction of pupal chambers in specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles dermestidae and perhaps other scavenging insects there are many feeding traces in joints of skeleton and almost all surfaces where bones articulated have been obliterated there are also tunnels in nest under neck and skull and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials and their activity is prevented by rapid burial it is therefore thought that specimen mpc d107 15 was only partially buried at first with upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop some damage to skeleton especially in vertebral column may also have been caused by scavenging of small mammals see also timeline of oviraptorosaur research references category nemegt fauna category
