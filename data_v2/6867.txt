include most of united states and some international schools patton and bardos served on board in these two executive positions for first 10 years of usad and not only personally contributed significantly both financially and in personal effort to organization in those early day when there were no corporate sponsors they along with robert peterson were major three factors in bringing corporate sponsors to program during these challenging growth years eventually resulting in a financially self sustaining organization in 2015 academic decathlon held its first ever international competition in shanghai china once known as united states academic decathlon on march 1 2013 it began operating as academic decathlon academic decathlon is designed to include students from all

all three divisions gold silver and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores to earn a spot at national competition in april teams must advance through local regional and state competitions though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states online competitions separated into small medium and large categories are also offered usad has expanded to include an international academic decathlon and has created an academic pentathlon for middle schools ten events require knowledge in art economics language and literature math music science and social science these topics with exception of math are thematically linked each year one of multiple choice events alternating between science and social science is chosen for super quiz in addition to seven objective events there are three subjective events graded by judges essay interview and speech over years there have been various small controversies most infamous being scandal involving steinmetz high school team which was caught cheating at 1995 illinois state finals this event was later dramatized in 2000 film cheaters academic decathlon has been criticized by educators for amount of time it requires students to spend on material as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond one provided by school around turn of millennium several coaches protested usad s decision to publish error ridden resource guides rather than provide topics for students to research history thumb right dr robert dea peterson left receives an award from orange county department of education for originality of academic decathlon concept academic decathlon was founded in 1968 by robert peterson superintendent of schools in orange county california marvin cobb executive director of california academic decathlon in 2003 said after peterson s death that peterson intended competition to encourage not only highest level students who already competed in academic competitions adding a little glory as president of orange county academic decathlon association put it in 1970 but also to change c students lives inaugural competition held in december 1968 hosted 103 students from 20 local high schools at first only regional contests were held organized by orange county academic decathlon corporation ocad with assistance of orange county department of education in 1971 when grand jury recommended that orange county department of education should no longer play a part in competition full control was handed over to ocad thumb left a letter from president ronald reagan to competitors at 1981 united states academic decathlon reagan had been governor of california when academic decathlon was originally formed and had met with winners of 1970 orange county academic decathlon in 1979 first statewide competition was held and just over two years later newly formed united states academic decathlon association held first national competition in april 1982 at loyola marymount university in california 200 high schools from 16 states and district of columbia competed for chance to attend peterson inspired by 1984 summer olympics in los angeles hoped to make academic decathlon an international event at 1984 nationals 32 states as well as canada mexico new zealand and south korea fielded teams inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence however there was no more international participation until 1989 when teams from northern ireland and rio de janeiro competed since then only a handful of international schools have competed for a list of schools not from states of united states of america that have competed in national championship see following link after a 1986 trial competition dr peterson founded a international decathlon for academics in 1990 competitions were held in 1990 1991 and 1992 but for a number of reasons competition did not continue in april 2009 usad announced that it would be regularly hosting an online international competition international academic decathlon after a successful trial event in 2008 however all 2009 participants but southbank opted out leading usad to issue southbank an invitation to attend 2009 u s national competition instead academic decathlon was originally organized differently than current competition original ten events were aesthetics music and visual arts conversation essay writing mathematics practical arts formal speech physical science social science current events extracurricular activities and english literature grammar and reading over time those events evolved into economics essay fine arts interview language and literature math science social sciences speech and super quiz it was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests art and music due to this division super quiz took place of one of other subjects each year in 1998 super quiz replaced economics from 1999 until 2012 it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing two from 2003 to 2012 beginning with 2013 season super quiz consisted of a relay portion only encompassing questions from respective year s science language and literature music social science art and economics curriculum more than just events were changed during 1998 99 season style of study required of students changed prior to that season students had performed their own research for each event and test writers did not have to base their questions on material usad published however after a policy change at beginning of 1999 2000 competition year test writers were required to base tests on official usad materials after change in policy scores vastly increased across country that year at nationals james e taylor high school had highest team score yet seen at competition following season usad once again altered their testing policies 50 of test questions were to come from usad published resource guides and 50 were to come from unspecified sources economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for previous 19 years a decrease in scores followed these changes national winner that year el camino real high school scored 5 923 fewer points than james e taylor high school had previous year following year usad settled on an organization of test materials that it would use for almost a full decade with a mixture of questions from provided material and independent research a number of curriculum changes were reversed though events finally stabilized during 2000 01 season usad administration changed dramatically that year when program s executive director james alvino resigned alvino had written a religious article that had been included in that year s super quiz resource guide his critics and usad board regarded inclusion as a conflict of interest as material was a persuasive essay that heavily pushed alvino s point of view season was also significant in that it was first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to national competition small schools are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students however this practice was short lived and was discontinued after 2002 season instead a small school e nationals was introduced during 2005 06 school year medium school e nationals was established two years later for those schools with between 650 and 1 300 students in 2010 california academic decathlon announced that a large school e nationals would be held for second highest performing school in each state in 2009 usad announced launch of an online middle school pentathlon program a competition similar to academic decathlon with only essay language and literature mathematics geography or social science and science as events either science or social science would be designated as super quiz topic in 2010 it was announced that high school students who don t have access to a school team or whose team has been eliminated in an earlier round can participate in an online individual competition participation team makeup and eligibility usad requires a diversity of achievement within each team teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by gpa honors category is composed of students with gpas between 3 75 and 4 0 scholastic category consists of students with gpas between 3 0 and 3 74 final group varsity category contains students whose gpa ranges from 0 00 to 2 99 usad uses a modified gpa scale in which performance based classes such as music art or physical education are omitted from gpa calculation a grade counts for face value regardless of whether it is from an advanced placement honors regular or remedial class an a is counted as a 4 0 a b as a 3 0 a c as a 2 0 a d as a 1 0 and a f as a 0 only final grades taken from previous two complete school years are used to calculate gpa a team typically consists of nine competitors three honors three scholastic and three varsity however since only top two scores from each category count towards team s total score a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction students may compete in a higher category than one they are assigned to but generally it is to students advantage to compete in lowest category they can scores in varsity are typically lower than those in scholastic and those in scholastic are typically lower than those in honors levels of competition there are four official levels of competition local scrimmage regional state and national rounds 1 2 3 and 4 respectively with exception of round 1 only top finishers in each round advance to next level california state with largest academic decathlon holds local scrimmages using round 1 tests which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a team can compete at regional level which uses round 2 tests in 2008 09 season 43 states participated in statewide academic though only 35 and an international school participated in national competition events thumb left section from book of dead of nany from 2004 2005 students were to learn facts such as length of scroll whom nany was a singer for and whom her coffin was a sculpture of like an athletic decathlon academic decathlon has ten events art economics essay interview language and literature math music science social science and speech prior to 2013 super quiz replaced one of seven objective events each year from 2003 2012 it alternated between replacing science and social science usad releases topics and theme of following year s competition in early march giving students time to prepare for a competition season that runs from november to april curriculum is developed by a ten member panel of former usad coaches known as usad curriculum advisory group group contracts with curriculum developers who must have at least a bachelor s degree in their respective subject to create subject area outlines resource guides and notebook dividers super quiz resource guide was formed mostly from articles from peer reviewed journals but also includes non peer reviewed articles which are looked over by a panel of five reviewers and then checked for accuracy by another reviewer use of this format was continued for science packet in 2012 2013 season events are split up into two groups seven objective tests art economics language and literature math music science and social science three subjective events essay interview and speech in addition there is a superquiz relay event former seven are given as half hour multiple choice tests whereas latter three are graded by judges multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each with exception of math which has 35 questions beginning in 2012 2013 season superquiz written test was dropped and oral relay was changed to include questions from six of objective subjects art economics language and literature music science and social science objective events in general objective events follow a set organizational outline from year to year language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections which tend to be poems or excerpts from short stories art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information economics remains fairly static 85 of material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics and remaining 15 focuses on year s topic for example in 2005 themed material covered economics of ancient egypt and rome science and social science reflect season s theme unlike other events there is no basic information that carries over math

offers a culminating championship event super quiz consisted of a forty question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013 in 2013 multiple choice portion was eliminated and relay portion expanded to include six of objective subjects generally referred to as super quiz relay it is only event viewable by general public relay starts with varsity students followed by scholastic and honors students each group is given 10 or 15 questions depending on format decided by state coordinator these questions are read aloud to audience and are printed or projected for competitors after questions and answers are read students are allowed seven seconds to select correct answer answer is checked on spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to audience subjective events subjective events allow students more creativity than objective events speech event is divided into prepared and impromptu sections a three and a half to four minute long prepared speech is delivered student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one and a half to two minute impromptu speech example prompts have included it has been said about our modern times that necessity is mother of invention please discuss math has been described as universal language discuss and why is light light and dark dark in interview students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment questions range from who is your role model to how would you alert someone that their zipper is down in both speech and interview competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or

themes and topics thumb right la calavera catrina by jose guadalupe posada was one of selections chosen for art event during 2008 2009 competition season as competition has evolved more of events have been tied into a central theme for example 2008 2009 theme was latin america with a focus on mexico language and literature was based on six short selections of literature as well as novel bless me ultima by rudolfo anaya art focused on art of mexico and featured several pieces of work ranging from olmec earthenware to jose guadalupe posada s la calavera catrina music event included questions on latin american music and included works by musicians as varied as manuel de silvestre astor piazzolla and xavier social science and economics focused on history and economy of mexico respectively super quiz covered an introduction to evolutionary biology historical development of theory of evolution natural selection speciation mutation gene flow genetic drift and evolutionary developmental biology information was also included on charles darwin s voyage aboard hms beagle study materials united states academic decathlon publishes a variety of study materials for objective events profits from which support program resource guides and basic guides constitute majority of usad corpus an art reproduction booklet and music cd contain a particular year s relevant pieces and are issued separately from resource guides study guides are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject these outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond material included in resource guides usad also offered research guides until 2010 which outlined basics of what students ought to research however in 2010 2011 competition season usad announced that it would be eliminating independent research based questions from competitions resource guides are offered for art economics language and literature music science social science and super quiz events super quiz resource guide is a compendium of previously published articles whereas other resource guides are composed by individual writers under contract with usad aim of resource guide is to assist students in their study of topics listed in subject area outlines as an example in 2003 music topic was romantic music subsequently music resource guide focused on development of romantic music its characteristics and influence of classical era on romantic era a large part of guide focused on information about that year s composers beethoven berlioz rossini chopin mendelssohn verdi mussorgsky wagner bizet brahms tchaikovsky mahler and strauss similarly art topic assigned was romantic art in european tradition art resource guide included sections detailing lives and works of relevant artists such as joseph mallord william turner claude monet albert bierstadt and camille pissarro in 1990s various companies were established to research subjects and provide practice tests to teams two of major ones were cards and exams and formed by former coach dan and former decathlete daniel respectively two offer exams and study guides that can augment or replace usad s official materials usad explicitly discouraged teams from ordering materials from third party companies in late 1998 though it later removed their discouragement from curriculum page usad republished their discouragement just a few weeks after removing it but did not publish such a warning in 2002 in 2000 several coaches who had led their teams to nationals during 1990s resigned in protest over academic decathlon s decision to sell nearly 1 000 of study materials rather than simply providing topics for students to independently research teams felt obligated to buy guides because usad based official tests on them teams also denounced hundreds of errors they found in official guides coaches were sometimes forced to instruct their students to deliberately give wrong answer in official competition richard coach of 1996 j frank dobie high school team that won national competition said that decision to market guides shifted academic decathlon s emphasis to memorization over critical thinking coach jim hatem of los angeles and coach mark johnson of el camino s 1998 winning team fumed over esoteric trick questions that usad had begun asking james alvino usad s executive director at that time argued that expensive study materials were necessary to continue funding nearly 75 of program s 1 750 000 operating budget and to provide a fairer playing field for less wealthy schools but did acknowledge that usad would attempt to reduce prices remove more trivial questions and base smaller portions of tests on official resource guide basic guides were formerly issued for students which unlike resource guides remained same from year to year art basic guide focuses on art fundamentals such as elements of art principles of composition and different 2 d and 3 d techniques additionally a brief introduction to art history is included economics basic guide reviews fundamental economic concepts in addition to basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics language and literature basic guide provides students with a basic grounding in analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche metonymy assonance and aphorism math basic guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math including algebra geometry trigonometry calculus and statistics music basic guide begins by introducing student to topics in music theory such as harmonics rhythm tempo and circle of fifths it also includes information on a wide variety of instruments and a brief history of western music however beginning in 2010 2011 competition season basic guides were incorporated into year s resource guides national association of secondary school principals nassp has criticized intense amount of studying required by students as excess fact mongering in 1980s association did not endorse academic decathlon citing what it believes was an excessive amount of time involved with studying necessary to win it stated that while it is not opposed to academic portion of competition it disliked national dimension of it however beginning in 2008 association placed usad on their national advisory list of student contests and activities list consists of programs that a nassp committee believes meets their requisite quality standards scoring and winning thumb right bronze silver and gold medals from e nationals competition which are same as those of national competition each of ten events is worth 1 000 points for a possible 10 000 point individual total only top two scores from honors scholastic and varsity divisions are counted for team score until 2013 60 000 was maximum possible team score in 2013 super quiz became a 10 000 point event that only counts for team score making maximum possible team score 70 000 with exception of math and super quiz objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece math test is weighted more heavily with 35 questions worth approximately 28 6 points per question until 2013 super quiz written test contained 40 questions each worth 15 points depending on state director relay component of super quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions each worth 80 or 40 points respectively starting in 2013 super quiz contained only relay component with 5 or 10 questions each worth approximately 333 3 or 166 7 questions respectively written test was sometimes omitted at state level even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh super quiz relay more heavily perfect scores of 1 000 in events are recorded regularly and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near perfect scores gold silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division honors scholastic and varsity all tying participants are awarded medals medals design is ad portion of official usad logo encircled by united states at top academic decathlon at bottom and four stars of increasing size on either side though medals are given out only to winners of competitions teams can order them along with other study materials medals given at state and local competitions are of a different design than those given at nationals interview and speech events are graded by two to three judges scores from judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1 000 points per event essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged if difference between judges scores differs by 200 points or more then a third reader is asked to grade student s essay two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give final score a benchmark for decathlon elite is obtaining an individual score of over 9 000 points it was not until 1992 24 years after program s inception that tyson rogers achieved this feat at national competition since then numerous students have broken 9 000 point barrier current highest individual score is 9 707 9 achieved by hannah lee from high school at 2019 texas state regionals competition state champion scores vary greatly from year to year as an example for 2002 03 season scores ranged from 24 785 to 49 910 points national champion scores have been as low as 45 857 0 points and as high as 54 195 1 points 54 195 1 score produced by 2016 granada hills charter high school team at national championship stands as record for highest team score controversies three days before 1995 illinois state competition steinmetz high school obtained copies of tests from devry institute of technology where state finals were being held team was therefore able to look up and memorize answers cheating allowed steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse whitney young magnet high school who had won illinois state finals in 22 of previous 23 years six of twelve students in nation who scored over 900 points on math test came from steinmetz high school prompting illinois state academic decathlon to suspect cheating steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of test and its coach eventually resigned incident was dramatized in movie cheaters catholic memorial high school coach john burke was at center of a dispute over results of 2003 wisconsin state final confusion arose over a catholic memorial student s essay after results of competition were released essay had only received 390 points out of a possible 1000 and burke contended that it had been scored improperly he was well within his rights to contest score however gerhard fischer president of wisconsin academic decathlon said that way burke handled appeal was highly questionable and inflammatory though burke was reprimanded parents of catholic memorial students believed punishment a three year suspension for burke and a one year suspension for catholic memorial was due to personality differences between burke and wisconsin academic decathlon officials controversy eventually led to a more thorough investigation of previous issues involving burke wisconsin academic decathlon board discovered that burke had previously been accused of m ore than a year of repeated attacks on another school s pupils including allegations of cheating on tests and ineligibility national championship thumb right president barack obama with academic decathlon team from high school 2009 national champions winning teams have often been invited to meet president of united states national championship pits winning school from each state against all others for an overall title occasionally a number of international schools compete as well schools compete based on size and are divided into three divisions i ii and iii however this separation is limited to overall team score and overall individual score nine overall team medals are awarded gold silver and bronze for each division similarly 27 overall individual medals are awarded gold silver and bronze for honors scholastic and varsity in each division top prepared speeches are honored at speech showcase while rest of medals for example gold in art for honors or silver in math for varsity are awarded to top scoring persons during awards banquet regardless of division other awards given out include kristin caperton award for overcoming personal or physical challenges among others certain awards occasionally come with monetary prizes these often vary from year to year since first national event in 1982 all national championship winners have come from three states california texas and wisconsin as of 2019 granada hills charter high school has won seven national titles in past nine years virtual competition in 2006 small school virtual competition was created for schools with 650 or fewer students two years later medium school virtual competition was added to accommodate schools with a student population between 650 and 1 300 these two separate contests are held via internet and as such interview and speech events are excluded remaining eight tests are completed on computer and results are submitted electronically to usad for scoring because only seven multiple choice tests and essay are used team scores are out of 48 000 points instead of 60 000 although it is only a virtual competition winning schools are awarded trophies and medals for their efforts university high school from fresno california has won 6 of 7 small school national championships coached by sean
