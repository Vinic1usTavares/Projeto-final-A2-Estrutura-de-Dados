400px thumb 2007 pony swim history of human activity in chincoteague on eastern shore of virginia begins with native americans until european settlers possessed island in late 17th century chincoteague indians used it as a place to gather shellfish but are not known to have lived there chincoteague island lacked suitable soil for their agriculture island s name derives from those early visitors by one popular tale chincoteague meant beautiful land across water in their language use of chincoteague island by european settlers began in 17th century when island was granted to a virginia colonist legal disputes followed and it was not until 1691 that title was determined by courts although a few people were living on island by 1700 it was primarily used as a place to graze livestock this was probably origin of chincoteague ponies feral horses that long roamed in area they are no longer present in wild on chincoteague island during american revolutionary war islanders supported new nation s bid for independence local fishing and seafood resources began to be systematically exploited in early 19th century in civil war islanders supported union despite being located in a seceded state and war touched chincoteague only lightly oysters became a major industry in postwar years chincoteague s relative isolation ended in 1876 with arrival of railroad at franklin city virginia across chincoteague bay from island and initiation of a dedicated steamboat service between two settlements nevertheless contemporary visitors found chincoteague primitive part of island was incorporated as town of chincoteague within accomack county in 1908 municipality annexed remainder of island in 1989 automobile traffic could reach island with completion of a causeway in 1922 two devastating fires in that decade caused establishment of chincoteague fire department in 1925 new volunteer company took over traditional pony penning and soon had ponies from nearby assateague island swim narrow channel between two islands as part of that roundup carnival pony swim and subsequent auction constitute a highlight of town s calendar attracting tens of thousands to island seafood and poultry industries thrived through much of 20th century but neither is important to island s economy today chincoteague is a major tourist destination on virginia s eastern shore with many coming to

end of assateague island assateague shelters chincoteague from atlantic and stretches north almost to ocean city maryland local native americans called by europeans chincoteague indians did not in fact reside on chincoteague island itself but lived on mainland where there was suitable land for hunting and agriculture they lived near what was at first called chincoteague creek on mainland and is today little mosquito creek tribe moved to a new village site every few years and visited chincoteague island to obtain shellfish although many references state that name chincoteague is native american word for beautiful land across water according to local historian kirk mariner this legend is of 20th century origin invented to promote a song by that name by an islander name he states instead derives from tribe s word for large stream or inlet chincoteague indians gradually withdrew northwards in late 17th century as european colonization grew most settled on a reservation at present day snow hill maryland with allied tribes of native americans though some may have remained in their traditional area they were later forced from reservation and their descendants are among

virginia was settled in 1607 with advent of jamestown colony it was not until 1680 that europeans occupied chincoteague island a patent to chincoteague island had been granted by british colonial authorities to daniel jenifer in 1671 that interest had been transferred to thomas welburn husband of jenifer s stepdaughter and prominent local merchant who lived on mainland side of chincoteague bay to fulfill terms of patent and gain title holder or his designee had to live on land for a year in contemporary term to seat land welburn and several employees built a house there and cleared land for a small farm his employee and tenant robert scott lived there only for required year once it had expired house was abandoned but welburn despite considering land his own did not register his efforts to perfect title unaware that welburn had seated land authorities declared chincoteague island abandoned and issued another patent for land in december 1684 to john clayton who conveyed it to colonel william kendall of northampton when welburn learned that kendall was planning to seat land himself he threatened to shoot trespassers on island instead welburn sued and case dragged on in accomack county courts until local justices transferred it to general court in capital of williamsburg welburn lost case as general court ruled in 1691 that as jenifer had never lived on island he had not conveyed a valid patent to welburn fresh patents were then issued dividing island between kendall and another prominent citizen of northampton major john robins with dividing line near present day church street once ownership of island was settled it was used mostly as a place to house livestock since there was no need for fences or other enclosures to prevent animals from straying and they could feed off of marsh grasses this usage was most likely origin of ponies that have made chincoteague and assateague islands famous though there are legends that ponies ancestors survived a shipwreck of a spanish vessel one such ship did run aground on assateague island in 1750 but according to john jr in his account of his efforts to locate that vessel mystery of origin of wild ponies became fused with oldest memories of spanish shipwreck an early inhabitant was henry who had seated island for kendall in 1686 he bought land from kendall on island lived there and sold it in 1709 first permanent residents were likely george and hannah blake originally tenants their son john bought land from kendall in 1690s blake s point which extends out into chincoteague bay testifies to their residence on western side of island will of john robins recorded in 1709 documents presence of horses on chincoteague he bequeaths one and mentions that his livestock were on island he also willed a mulatto boy charles son of hannah which said boy is now on my part of island through 18th century population slowly expanded until by end of it about 200 people mostly tenant farmers and

islanders in june petitioned for a repeal or exemption as they had petition stated most fervent desire to do everything in their power to defeat enemies of american liberty as well as a militia of some forty men able to repel british raiders convention allowed chincoteague and other islands along atlantic coast to retain their livestock in mid 1776 convention voted to fortify chincoteague s harbor it was then being used by ships evading british blockade of chesapeake bay smuggled goods were unloaded on mainland and taken down eastern shore toward more populated areas resulting fort was built on wallops island across inlet from chincoteague smuggling route maintained its importance as american revolutionary war continued and in august 1779 sole action in area took place a british privateer pretending to be a smuggler disabled fort s guns and captured a cargo ship at anchor in chincoteague bay island legend holds that four men from chincoteague fought for americans at battle of yorktown in october 1781 and that one was delayed in returning to island because general george washington had soldier transport battle flag to general s home at mount vernon by 1800 original large parcels of land on chincoteague island were being broken into plots of or larger there were some 200 people living on chincoteague or assateague but there were no stores or other retail enterprises a school unusual for virginia s eastern shore at time was erected sometime before 1804 three island families were free african americans two other households had black servants or slaves one of free african americans became a major island landowner born in africa and transported by slave ship he was freed in 1787 and was supposedly 130 years old when he died around 1840 but was more likely aged about 100 his holdings included what today are carnival grounds south of downtown chincoteague in first half of 19th century chincoteague became a source of seafood as cities along eastern seaboard such as new york and philadelphia continued to expand their local areas could not supply them with enough shellfish islanders saw opportunity and many abandoned agriculture instead harvesting sea villagers of chincoteague petitioned virginia general assembly three times between 1833 and 1851 seeking repeal of various fishing laws first post office was established in 1854 and first doctor arrived four years later by 1860 there were 150 families resident on chincoteague 126 oystermen on island and others belonging to allied trades that year a hotel was operating on island located in what today is downtown area in mid 19th century that part of island developed as chincoteague s commercial core first accounts of pony penning are from an 1835 letter to editor published in farmer s register by thompson holmes of chincoteague that is mainland opposite island then also called by that name according to his letter few horses remained wild on chincoteague island and residents would go over to assateague to build temporary corrals to place local herds in selected horses were branded gelded and sold holmes told about an earlier practice to drive horses directly into water which had been abandoned because too many had drowned holmes mourned that pony pennings of his day were only a shadow of their former glory pennings letter related nevertheless attracted crowds from far and near civil war 1861 65 thumb right john whealton leader of chincoteague union loyalists outbreak of american civil war in 1861 left chincoteague residents with a stark choice if they left union as virginia sought to do they might lose access to their seafood markets refusal to do so might isolate chincoteague from rest of its state in referendum on secession held in virginia on may 23 1861 northampton county in southern eastern shore voted unanimously for secession and there was also a majority for leaving union in accomack county nevertheless residents of chincoteague along with those on tangier island part of accomack in chesapeake bay chose not to leave union in chincoteague s case by a vote of 134 or 135 to 1 or 2 sources differ as to exact tally despite this lopsided tally some from chincoteague supported south or even fought for it even before vote commerce between north and virginia had been forbidden by union officials residents sent john a m whealton a merchant and staunch union loyalist to philadelphia to seek release of confiscated supplies he was able to gain support of local officials and sailed cautiously for home with goods aware that permission of philadelphia s mayor did not bind u s navy he found assateague lighthouse extinguished by southern sympathizers and bay again used for smuggling in september an ironclad arrived with orders to secure area against smugglers and within days one smuggler s ship was burned in engagement known as battle of cockle creek and another captured two days later naval vessel received a warm welcome from islanders who promptly took oaths of allegiance to union after a petition on behalf of 800 inhabitants of island was passed up chain of command secretary of navy gideon welles granted islanders right to continue to engage in trade in november 1861 same month eastern shore was taken for north with little bloodshed louisiana was sent away to more troubled waters in december 1861 arousing fears by islanders that they would be abused by confederate loyalists on mainland there were some incidents of this sort but they ceased as mainlanders adjusted to military presence and war did not again come near chincoteague union soldiers were stationed on chincoteague island for about four months in 1863 and 1864 to guard against a rumored attack on assateague lighthouse by sympathizers maryland militia were initially used followed by a regiment of african american soldiers but in march 1864 they were removed and local men in eastern shore volunteers formed in 1863 but not called into service until following year guarded island and other local points postwar prosperity 1865 1908 years after civil war brought prosperity to chincoteague with expansion of oyster trade as law required an to be a virginia resident for a year before harvesting in virginia waters many in that trade bought lots along main street running along west side of island or across bay in new village of virginia just south of maryland line other new residents on island were freed african americans or northerners who sought opportunities in southern states chincoteague oysters especially those from tom s cove at southern point of island gained a reputation for taste and marketed across country as chincoteague salt oysters became famous thumb left howard pyle sketch from his 1876 visit to chincoteague in 1876 art student howard pyle visited chincoteague he wrote of his experiences including viewing pony penning which took place behind his hotel following year in scribner s magazine accompanying text with first known contemporary drawings of event pyle was struck by quaintness of chincoteague describing it as an enchanted island cut loose from modern progress and left drifting some seventy five years backward in ocean of time publicity in a national magazine did nothing to reduce crowds coming to chincoteague for penning island s status as an isolated backwater began to end in 1876 when a rail line reached franklin city on shores of bay and only from chincoteague island with a steamship supplying remaining connection this improvement gave oystermen an efficient means of getting their wares to market and also brought early tourists to chincoteague seeking respite from sweltering summers in city due to popularity of oysters chincoteague continued to grow commercial buildings were built along main street in 1890 island acquired its first barbershop and about 500 barrels of oysters were being sent to mainland daily on steamer gas illumination arrived by 1900 first telephone exchange in 1902 and rural free delivery by united states post office department in 1905 although there were few shops or public buildings there was a shoe store and a notary public roads were made of dirt covered with sea shells entering modern era 1908 46 in early 20th century according to mariner chincoteague was a curious mixture of progressive and primitive of worldly wise townsfolk and isolated country people beginning in about 1900 residents sought to be incorporated as a town gaining a municipal charter from general assembly would allow ordinances to be passed to keep livestock off streets without seeking redress from state government in richmond or county government in accomac in 1908 legislature incorporated part of island as town of chincoteague and on july 4 a frank matthews became first mayor 1910 united states census showed a population of 3 295 for island of whom 1 419 lived in town few resided in interior of island most lived in single family houses facing water across roads that ran just above high tide line population of island had increased to about 3 600 as of 1916 there were about 100 african americans all of whom lived on same part of island most islanders of working age were part of or supported seafood trade at that time most houses got their water from shallow dug wells located in many cases close by primitive privies water from such wells was also used to wash oysters and to make ice to preserve them almost all chincoteague oysters were sent out of state and federal public health service intervened in 1916 to get mayor and town council to order improved sanitation with islanders living outside town line agreeing to abide by ordinances thumb a display of chincoteague oyster cans although dwarfed in population by neighboring island assateague was still populated by a few families a penning was still held on assateague along with one on chincoteague but assateague event was suspended after 1920 as largest landowner refused to allow access beginning in 1923 assateague herd was transported to chincoteague for a joint penning most likely by boat as idea of swimming ponies had not yet been adopted refusal of assateague landowner to allow islanders to cross his land made it difficult for them to get to work and assateague became depopulated with most of buildings disassembled and rebuilt on chincoteague island most of assateague island was sold to federal government in 1943 in 1919 john b whealton chincoteague born though a florida resident persuaded virginia general assembly to grant a charter to his chincoteague toll road and bridge company to build a causeway from mainland to island whealton submitted winning bid to build causeway as well as gaining charter for his company to operate it road was originally a toll crossing and early plans had it reaching island south of downtown near site of today s carnival grounds but whealton persuaded town council to have terminal point be downtown near atlantic hotel island s largest road was close to completion when a major fire destroyed much of downtown including hotel on february 5 1920 there was then only a small ill equipped fire company in chincoteague and fire was fought by men of coast guard from stations near island hotel was underinsured and not rebuilt though others took its place and council took advantage of disaster to straighten main street fire and poor weather in winters of 1921 and 1922 delayed causeway which was officially opened on november 15 1922 by virginia governor e lee most vehicles on first day wound up mired in mud once a downpour turned causeway into a quagmire nevertheless causeway proved a success and by year s end over 100 vehicles were crossing it on an average day water from mainland wells was piped along causeway allowing town to offer running water thumb left ponies are paraded through downtown chincoteague on this postcard postmarked 1941 second devastating fire in four years destroyed much of downtown chincoteague on february 25 1924 and caused town s leaders to conclude that a better organized volunteer fire department was needed to replace chincoteague s fire brigade chincoteague volunteer fire company was founded in june 1925 though it needed much equipment including a fire truck to raise funds fire company took over 1925 chincoteague pony penning which had been declining and sold some horses at fixed prices auctioning began not later than 1932 fifteen thousand people attended penning and other festivities proceeds from event were over 6 000 enabling department to buy a pump truck public fascination with pony swim inaugurated that year at narrowest point of channel between two islands led to increased attendance in following years except during war years of 1943 and 1944

had a population of 2 130 in 1930s poultry farming became popular on island and by 1950s produced over a million birds per year although oystering was still a common occupation trade was increasingly regulated causing much of production and canning to be done by large companies and many watermen turned to fishing clamming and crabbing others shot ducks and other waterfowl indigenous to island locals carved duck decoys to aid in hunt these remain a popular collectible and souvenir of island in 1941 united states entered world war ii early following year germans torpedoed two merchant ships

assateague island where there is a beach along atlantic shoreline they were led by wyle maddox a wealthy chicken farmer who had significant business interests on chincoteague island first proposed around 1950 bridge and roadway across assateague by then uninhabited and under federal jurisdiction took over a decade to approve and finally opened in september 1962 bridge to assateague is at east end of maddox boulevard that crosses chincoteague island north of downtown and was developed by wyle maddox town remained busy and prosperous in postwar years especially by standards of rural eastern shore and locals took pride in this in early 1950s town twice finished second in a competition for cleanest community in america and then won award for its size classification in 1954 and 1955 main street was so crowded with cars that parking meters were installed when oyster parasites and overfishing combined to devastate oyster industry in 1950s clams became island s major industry burton clamming company promoted itself as largest in world sending 1 3 million clams to market on a typical day in 1957 final delay in completion of assateague bridge was caused by ash wednesday storm of march 1962 that devastated both islands as well as other points along atlantic seaboard although no one died on chincoteague storm flooded virtually all buildings on chincoteague island and wiped out poultry industry not only were an estimated quarter million birds killed buildings used in chicken farming were destroyed an estimated 100 ponies were killed by storm both on assateague island and at

except during annual carnival and pony penning were sportsmen there to fish or hunt waterfowl publicity generated by misty franchise and easy access to beach and recreational facilities on assateague island brought many tourists to chincoteague who were uninterested in shooting wildlife except with cameras combined with continued decline of seafood industry economy of chincoteague gradually shifted from being based on harvesting its waters to tourism many souvenir shops and other tourist enterprises were built along maddox boulevard especially in years after 1962 at first motels were buildings converted from other uses but by late 1960s purpose built structures were being erected along maddox boulevard some with swimming pools although misty died in 1972 at age 26 island continued

increased real estate prices many from chincoteague sold their land and moved to less expensive property on mainland seafood industry ceased to be a major factor in island s economy most of oyster shucking houses which had continued in operation using imported shellfish despite local decline in oystering finally closed in 1980s and 1990s clam industry sought bivalves from deeper waters and
