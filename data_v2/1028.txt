milk allergy is an adverse immune reaction to one or more proteins in cow s milk when allergy symptoms occur they can occur rapidly or have a gradual onset former may include anaphylaxis a potentially life threatening condition which requires treatment with epinephrine among other measures latter can take hours to days to appear with symptoms including atopic dermatitis inflammation of esophagus enteropathy involving small intestine and proctocolitis involving rectum and colon in united states 90 of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods with cow s milk being most common recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens including dairy on food labels food allergen labelling and information requirements under eu food information for consumers regulation no 1169 2011 technical guidance april 2015 one function of immune system is to defend against infections by recognizing foreign proteins but it should not over react to food proteins heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured meaning to lose their 3 dimensional configuration and thus lose for this reason dairy containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients in people with rapid reactions ige mediated milk allergy dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly declaration of presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country with exception of brazil milk allergy affects between 2 and 3 of babies and young children to reduce risk recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months preferably six months before introducing cow s milk if there is a family history of dairy allergy then soy infant formula can be considered but about 10 to 15 of babies allergic to cow s milk will also react to soy majority of children outgrow milk allergy but for about 0 4 condition persists into adulthood oral immunotherapy is being researched but it is of unclear benefit signs and symptoms food allergies can have rapid onset from minutes up to 2 hours delayed onset up to 48 hours or even 1 week or combinations of both depending on mechanisms involved difference depends on types of white blood cells involved b cells a subset of white blood cells rapidly synthesize and secrete immunoglobulin e ige a class of antibody which bind to antigens i e foreign proteins thus immediate reactions are described as ige mediated delayed reactions involve non ige mediated immune mechanisms initiated by b cells t cells and other white blood cells unlike with ige reactions there are no specific biomarker molecules circulating in blood and so confirmation is by removing suspect food from diet and see if symptoms resolve ige mediated symptoms include rash hives itching of mouth lips tongue throat eyes skin or other areas swelling of lips tongue eyelids or whole face difficulty swallowing runny or congested nose hoarse voice wheezing shortness of breath diarrhea abdominal pain lightheadedness fainting nausea and vomiting symptoms of allergies vary from person to person and may also vary from incident to incident serious danger regarding allergies can begin when respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected former can be indicated by wheezing a blocked airway and cyanosis latter by weak pulse pale skin and fainting when these symptoms occur allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis anaphylaxis occurs when ige antibodies are involved and areas of body that are not in direct contact with food become affected and show severe symptoms untreated this can proceed to vasodilation a low blood pressure situation called anaphylactic shock and very rarely death for milk allergy non ige mediated responses are more common than ige mediated presence of certain symptoms such as angioedema or atopic eczema is more likely related to ige mediated allergies whereas non ige mediated reactions manifest as gastrointestinal symptoms without skin or respiratory symptoms within non ige cow s milk allergy clinicians distinguish among food protein induced syndrome fpies food protein induced allergic proctocolitis fpiap and food protein induced enteropathy fpe common trigger foods for all are cow s milk and soy foods including soy infant formula fpiap is considered to be at milder end of spectrum and is characterized by intermittent bloody stools fpe is identified by chronic diarrhea which will resolve when offending food is removed from infant s diet fpies can be severe characterized by persistent vomiting 1 to 4 hours after an allergen containing food is ingested to point of lethargy watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea can develop 5 to 10 hours after triggering meal to point of dehydration and low blood pressure infants reacting to cow s milk may also react to soy formula and vice versa international consensus guidelines have been established for diagnosis and treatment of fpies mechanisms conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to mechanism of allergic response ige mediated classic most common type manifesting as acute changes that occur shortly after eating and may progress to anaphylaxis non ige mediated characterized by an immune response not involving ige may occur hours to days after eating complicating diagnosis ige and non ige mediated a hybrid of above two types allergic reactions are hyperactive responses of immune system to generally innocuous substances such as proteins in foods we eat some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not one theory is resistance to digestion thinking being that when largely intact proteins reach small intestine white blood cells involved in immune reactions will be activated food reactions allergies org kent england 2005 accessed 27 apr 2010 heat of cooking structurally degrades protein molecules potentially making them less allergenic mayo clinic causes of food allergies april 2010 allergic responses can be divided into two phases an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen which can then either subside or progress into a late phase reaction prolonging symptoms of a response and resulting in more tissue damage in early stages of acute allergic reaction lymphocytes previously sensitized to a specific protein or protein fraction react by quickly producing a particular type of antibody known as secreted ige which circulates in blood and binds to ige specific receptors on surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils both of these are involved in acute inflammatory response activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators cytokines interleukins leukotrienes and prostaglandins into surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects such as vasodilation mucous secretion nerve stimulation and smooth muscle contraction this results in runny nose itchiness shortness of breath and potentially anaphylaxis depending on individual allergen and mode of introduction symptoms can be system wide classical anaphylaxis or localized to particular body systems asthma is localized to respiratory system while eczema is localized to skin after chemical mediators of acute response subside late phase responses can often occur due to migration of other white blood cells such as neutrophils lymphocytes eosinophils and macrophages to initial reaction sites this is usually seen 2 24 hours after original reaction cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in persistence of long term effects late phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils six major allergenic proteins from cow s milk have been identified as1 b and k casein from casein proteins and a lactalbumin and b from whey proteins there is some cross reactivity with soy protein particularly in non ige mediated allergy heat can reduce allergenic potential so dairy ingredients in baked goods may be less likely to trigger a reaction than milk or cheese for milk allergy non ige mediated responses are more common than ige mediated former can manifest as atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms especially in infants and young children some will display both so that a child could react to an oral food challenge with respiratory symptoms and hives skin rash followed a day or two later with a flare up of atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms including chronic diarrhea blood in stools gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd constipation chronic vomiting and colic diagnosis thumb skin prick testing for allergies for a positive response skin will become red and raised diagnosis of milk allergy is based on person s history of allergic reactions skin prick test spt patch test and measurement of milk protein specific serum ige a negative ige test does not rule out non ige mediated allergy also described as cell mediated allergy confirmation is by double blind placebo controlled food challenges conducted by an allergy specialist spt and ige have a sensitivity of around 88 but specificity of 68 and 48 respectively meaning these tests will probably detect a milk sensitivity but may also be false positive for other allergens attempts have been made to identify spt and ige responses accurate enough to avoid need for confirmation with an oral food challenge a systematic review stated that in children younger than two years cut offs for specific ige or spt seem to be more homogeneous and may be proposed for older children tests were less consistent it concluded none of cut offs proposed in literature can be used to definitely confirm cow s milk allergy diagnosis either to fresh pasteurized or to baked milk differential diagnosis symptoms of milk allergy can be confused with other disorders that present similar clinical features such as lactose intolerance infectious gastroenteritis celiac disease non celiac gluten sensitivity inflammatory bowel disease eosinophilic gastroenteritis and pancreatic insufficiency among others lactose intolerance thumb left hydrolysis of disaccharide lactose to glucose and galactose milk allergy is distinct from lactose intolerance which is a food sensitivity due to lack of enzyme lactase in small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose unabsorbed lactose reaches large intestine where resident bacteria use it for fuel releasing hydrogen carbon dioxide and methane gases these gases are cause of abdominal pain and other symptoms lactose intolerance does not cause damage to gastrointestinal tract there are four types primary secondary developmental and congenital primary lactose intolerance is when amount of lactase declines as people age secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to small intestine such as from infection celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease or other diseases developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth prevention research on prevention addresses question of whether it is possible to reduce risk of developing an allergy in first place reviews concluded that there is no strong evidence to recommend changes to diets of pregnant or nursing women as a means of preventing development of food allergy in their infants for mothers of infants considered at high risk of developing cow s milk allergy because of a family history there is some evidence that nursing mother avoiding allergens may reduce risk of child developing eczema but a cochrane review concluded that more research is needed guidelines from various government and international organizations recommend that for lowest allergy risk infants be exclusively breastfed for 4 6 months there does not appear to be any benefit to extending that period beyond six months if a nursing mother decides to start feeding with an infant formula prior to four months recommendation is to use a formula containing cow s milk proteins a different consideration occurs when there is a family history either parents or older siblings of milk allergy three options to avoiding formula with intact cow s milk proteins are substituting a product containing either extensively hydrolyzed milk proteins or a non dairy formula or one utilizing free amino acids process breaks intact proteins into fragments in theory reducing allergenic potential in 2016 u s food and drug administration fda approved a label claim for hydrolyzed whey protein being hypoallergenic labeling of infant formula guidance for industry u s food and drug administration 2016 accessed 11 december 2017 however a meta analysis published same year disputed this claim concluding that based on dozens of clinical trials there was insufficient evidence to support a claim that a partially hydrolyzed formula could reduce risk of eczema soy formula is a common substitution but infants with milk allergy may also have an allergic response to soy formula hydrolyzed rice formula is an option as are more expensive amino acid based formulas treatment need for a dairy free diet should be reevaluated every six months by testing milk containing products low on milk ladder such as fully cooked i e baked foods containing milk in which milk proteins have been denatured and ending with fresh cheese and milk desensitization via oral immunotherapy is considered experimental treatment for accidental ingestion of milk products by allergic individuals varies depending on sensitivity of person an antihistamine such as may be prescribed sometimes prednisone will be prescribed to prevent a possible late phase type i hypersensitivity reaction severe allergic reactions anaphylaxis may require treatment with an epinephrine pen i e an injection device designed to be used by a non healthcare professional when emergency treatment is warranted a second dose is needed in 16 35 of episodes avoiding dairy most people find it necessary to strictly avoid any item containing dairy ingredients reason is that individual threshold dose capable of provoking an allergic reaction can be quite small especially in infants an estimated 5 react to less than 30 milligrams of dairy proteins and 1 react to less than 1 milligram a more recent review calculated that eliciting threshold dose for an allergic reaction in 1 of people with confirmed cow s milk allergy is 0 1 mg of cow s milk protein beyond obvious anything with milk cheese cream curd butter ghee or yogurt in name in countries where allergen labeling is mandatory ingredient list is supposed to list all ingredients anyone with or caring for a person with a dairy protein allergy should always carefully read food package labels as sometimes even a familiar brand undergoes an ingredient change in u s for all foods except meat poultry and egg processed products and most alcoholic beverages if an ingredient is derived from one of required label allergens then it must either have food name in parentheses for example casein milk or as an alternative there must be a statement separate but adjacent to ingredients list contains milk and any other of allergens with mandatory labeling dairy sourced protein ingredients include casein whey and lactalbumin among others u s fda has a recall process for foods that contain undeclared allergenic ingredients university of wisconsin has a list of foods that may contain dairy proteins yet are not always obvious from name or type of food this list contains following examples bread baked goods and desserts caramel and nougat candies cereals crackers food bars chewing gum chocolate milk and dark cream of soups creamy pasta sauces creamy salad dressings eggnog flavored potato chips hot dogs and lunch meat instant mashed potatoes margarine medical food beverages non dairy creamer sherbet pudding and custard there is a distinction between contains and may contain first is a deliberate addition to ingredients of a food and is required second addresses unintentional possible inclusion of ingredients in this instance dairy sourced during transportation storage or at manufacturing site and is voluntary and is referred to as precautionary allergen labeling pal milk from other mammalian species goat sheep etc should not be used as a substitute for cow s milk as milk proteins from other mammals are often cross reactive nevertheless some people with cow s milk allergy can tolerate goat s or sheep s milk and vice versa milk from camels pigs reindeer horses and donkeys may also be tolerated in some cases products have been tested and some found to contain milk proteins which were not always indicated on labels cross reactivity with soy infants either still 100 breastfeeding or on infant formula and also young children may be prone to a combined cow s milk and soy protein allergy referred to as milk soy protein intolerance a u s state government website presents concept including a recommendation that nursing mothers discontinue eating any foods that contain dairy or soy ingredients in opposition to this recommendation a published scientific review stated that there was not yet sufficient evidence in human trial literature to conclude that maternal dietary food avoidance during lactation would prevent or treat allergic symptoms in breastfed infants a review presented information on milk allergy soy allergy and cross reactivity between two milk allergy was described as occurring in 2 2 to 2 8 of infants and declining with age soy allergy was described as occurring in zero to 0 7 of young children according to several studies cited in review between 10 and 14 of infants and young children with confirmed cow s milk allergy were determined to also be sensitized to soy and in some instances have a clinical reaction after consuming a soy containing food research did not address whether cause was two separate allergies or a cross reaction due to a similarity in protein structure as which occurs for cow s milk and goat s milk recommendations are that infants diagnosed as allergic to cow s milk infant formula be switched to an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula rather than a soy whole protein formula prognosis milk allergy typically presents in first year of life majority of children outgrow milk allergy by age of ten years one large clinical trial reported resolutions of 19 by age 4 years 42 by age 8 years 64 by age 12 years and 79 by 16 years children are often better able to tolerate milk as an ingredient in baked goods relative to liquid milk childhood predictors for adult persistence are anaphylaxis high milk specific serum ige robust response to skin prick test and absence of tolerance to milk containing baked foods resolution was more likely if baseline serum ige was lower or if ige mediated allergy was absent so that all that was present was cell mediated non ige allergy people with confirmed cow s milk allergy may also demonstrate an allergic response to beef more so to rare beef versus well cooked beef offending protein appears to be bovine serum albumin milk allergy has consequences in a u s government diet and health surveys conducted in 2007 2010 6 189 children ages 2 17 years were assessed for those classified as cow s milk allergic at time of survey mean weight height and body mass index were significantly lower than their non allergic peers this was not true for children with other food allergies diet assessment showed a significant 23 reduction of calcium intake and near significant trends for lower vitamin d and total calorie intake epidemiology percentage of babies in developed countries with milk allergy is between 2 and 3 this estimate is for antibody based allergy figures for allergy based on cellular immunity are unknown percentage declines as children get older national survey data in u s collected from 2005 2006 showed that from age six and older percentage with ige confirmed milk allergy was under 0 4 for all age groups a review conducted in europe estimated 0 6 had milk allergy society and culture dairy allergy was one of earliest food allergies to be recorded an ancient greek medical text attributed to doctor hippocrates 460 370 bc notes in context of a description of how some foods are harmful to certain individuals but not others cheese does not harm all men alike some can eat their fill of it without slightest hurt nay those it agrees with are wonderfully strengthened thereby others come off badly text attempts to explain reaction to cheese in terms of hippocratic humorism stating that some constitutions are naturally hostile to cheese and are roused and stirred to action under its influence with passage of mandatory labeling laws food allergy awareness has definitely increased with impacts on quality of life for children their parents and their immediate caregivers in u s food allergen labeling and consumer protection act of 2004 falpa causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus school systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into school despite all these precautions people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples houses at school or in restaurants food fear has a significant impact on quality of life finally for children with allergies their quality of life is also affected by actions of their peers there is an increased occurrence of bullying which can include threats or acts of deliberately being touched with foods they need to avoid also having their allergen free food deliberately contaminated regulation of labeling thumb upright 1 3 an example of a list of allergens in a food item in response to risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or byproducts of major allergens among ingredients intentionally added to foods nevertheless there are no labeling laws to mandatory declare presence of trace amounts in final product as a consequence of cross contamination except in brazil ingredients intentionally added in u s falpa requires companies to disclose on label whether a packaged food product contains a major food allergen added intentionally cow s milk peanuts eggs shellfish fish tree nuts soy and wheat this list originated in 1999 from world health organisation codex alimentarius commission to meet falcpa labeling requirements if an ingredient is derived from one of required label allergens then it must either have its food sourced name in parentheses for example casein milk or as an alternative there must be a statement separate but adjacent to ingredients list contains milk and any other of allergens with mandatory labeling dairy food listing is also mandatory in european union and more than a dozen other countries falcpa applies to packaged foods regulated by fda which does not include poultry most meats certain egg products and most alcoholic beverages however some meat poultry and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients such as added milk proteins these products are regulated by food safety and inspection service fsis which requires that any ingredient be declared in labeling only by its common or usual name neither identification of source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor use of statements to alert for presence of specific ingredients like contains milk are mandatory according to fsis in u s there is no federal mandate to address presence of allergens in drug products falcpa does not apply to medicines nor to cosmetics falcpa also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants trace amounts as a result of cross contamination value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial this concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross contact or cross contamination at any point along food chain during raw material transportation storage or handling due to shared equipment for processing and packaging etc experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling termed precautionary allergen labeling pal also known as may contain statements for possible inadvertent trace amount cross contamination during production pal labeling can be confusing to consumers especially as there can be many variations on wording of warning pal is regulated only in switzerland japan argentina and south africa argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010 and instead puts onus on manufacturer to control manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in products south africa does not permit use of pal except when manufacturers demonstrate potential presence of allergen due to cross contamination through a documented risk assessment despite adherence to good manufacturing practice in australia and new zealand there is a recommendation that pal be replaced by guidance from vital 2 0 vital incidental trace allergen labelling a review identified eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1 of population as 0 01 mg for cow s milk this threshold reference dose and similar results for egg peanut and other proteins will provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labelling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond may contain vital 2 0 was developed by allergen bureau a food industry sponsored non government organization vital program allergen bureau australia and new zealand eu has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but it is not expected to be published before 2024 lack of compliance with labeling regulations is also a problem as an example fda documented failure to list milk as an ingredient in dark chocolate bars fda tested 94 dark chocolate bars for presence of milk only six listed milk as an ingredient but of remaining 88 fda found that 51 of them actually did contain milk proteins many of those did have pal wording such as may contain dairy others claimed to be dairy free or vegan but still tested positive for cow s milk proteins in brazil since april 2016 declaration of possibility of cross contamination is mandatory when product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives but good manufacturing practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent presence of accidental trace amounts milk of all species of is included among these allergenic foods research desensitization which is a slow process of consuming tiny amounts of allergenic protein until body is able to tolerate more significant exposure results in reduced symptoms or even remission of allergy in some people and is being explored for treatment of milk allergy this is called oral immunotherapy sublingual immunotherapy in which allergenic protein is held in mouth under tongue has been approved for grass and ragweed allergies but not yet for foods http org allergies allergy treatment allergy immunotherapy sublingual immunotherapy slit sublingual therapy slit american college of allergy asthma and immunology oral desensitization for cow s milk allergy appears to be relatively safe and may be effective however further studies are required to understand overall immune response and questions remain open about duration of desensitization there is research not specific to milk allergy on use of probiotics and combination of two as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies from reviews there appears to be a treatment benefit for eczema but not asthma wheezing or several reviews concluded that evidence is sufficient for it to be
