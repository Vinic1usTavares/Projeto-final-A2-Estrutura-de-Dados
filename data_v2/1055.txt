was reorganised to replicate numerical designations of aif units and perpetuate their honours and traditions as a result 12th light horse regiment was re raised in new england region of new south wales and headquartered at armidale in re forming regiment drew lineage from citizens forces 12th new england light horse which had existed parallel to aif light horse regiment and had remained in australia during war this regiment through a complex series of reorganisations traced its lineage to 6th australian light horse regiment which had been raised in 1903 and perpetuated units that had contributed personnel to fight in south africa during boer war during this time regiment was assigned to 2nd cavalry brigade along with 15th and 16th light horse regiments in 1927 when territorial designations were adopted 12th light horse regiment became known as new england light horse at same time regiment adopted motto of fortuna comes fortune comes initially strength of part time units was maintained through both voluntary and compulsory service but after election of scullin labor government in 1929 30 compulsory service ended and citizens force was replaced with all volunteer militia economic hardships of great depression and reduced training opportunities resulted in a decline in number of volunteers and consequently a number units were disbanded or amalgamated amidst austerity of inter war years regiment remained in existence until 1 october 1936 when it was merged with 24th light horse to form 12th 24th light horse these two units were later delinked in 1938 as militia was

redesignated 12th armoured car regiment and assigned to 3rd armoured division during this period a process of mechanisation resulted in last of light horse units giving up their horses throughout 1943 australian army was faced with a manpower shortage and as japanese threat to mainland australia decreased many militia armoured units were broken up and their personnel sent to other units as reinforcements as a result regiment was disbanded on 19 october 1943 having only undertaken garrison duty within australia when australia s part time military force was reformed in 1948 as citizens
