domenico correct modern spelling of many of early doges is difficult to pinpoint in some older texts one might encounter domenigo selvo hazlitt or domenicum silvium sansovino among a whole host of other spellings but most common spelling tends to be domenico selvo as can be seen in most of references for this article including norwich and official website for st mark s basilica died 1087 was 31st doge of venice serving from 1071 to 1084 during his reign as doge his domestic policies alliances that he forged and battles that venetian military won and lost laid foundations for much of subsequent foreign and domestic policy of republic of venice he avoided confrontations with byzantine empire holy roman empire and roman catholic church at a time in european history when conflict threatened to upset balance of power at same time he forged new agreements with major nations that would set up a long period of prosperity for republic of venice through his military alliance with byzantine empire emperor alexios i komnenos awarded venice economic favors with declaration of a golden bull that would allow for development of republic s international trade over next few centuries within city itself he supervised a longer period of construction of modern st mark s basilica than any other doge basilica s complex architecture and expensive decorations stand as a testament to prosperity of venetian traders during this period essentially democratic way in which he not only was elected but also removed from power was part of an important transition of venetian political philosophy overthrow of his rule in 1084 was one of many forced abdications in early history of republic that further blurred lines between powers of doge common electorate and nobility background thumb 300px right map of italy in 1000 showing byzantine control over southern italy and subsequent proximity to holy roman empire beginning with reign of pietro ii candiano in 932 venice saw a string of inept leaders such as pietro iii candiano pietro iv candiano and reputed arrogance and ambition of these doges caused deterioration of relationship with holy roman empire in west of relationship with byzantine empire in east and discord at home in republic norwich a history of venice pp 39 48 however in 991 pietro ii orseolo became doge and spent his reign pushing boundaries of republic further east down western coast of balkan peninsula with his conquests in dalmatia in 1000 wolff venice and slavs of dalmatia pp 428 455 this strengthened commercial bonds with empires of east sicily northern africa and holy roman empire and put an end to infighting among citizens of venice molmenti venice p 117 pietro ii s negotiations with byzantine emperor basil ii to decrease tariffs on venetian produced goods helped foster a new age of prosperity in republic as venetian merchants could undercut competition in international markets of byzantine empire nicol byzantium and venice pp 43

of free trade between two states and exempting all venetians from taxes in holy roman empire norwich a history of venice pp 49 64 as power and reputation of pietro ii grew venetian people began to wonder if he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy their fears were confirmed when his son otto orseolo named after otto iii assumed title of doge upon pietro ii s death in 1009 thereby becoming youngest doge in venetian history at age of 16 hazlitt venetian republic pp 115 133 scandal marked much of otto s reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power in 1026 he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to constantinople but his successor pietro barbolano had such difficulty in attempting to unite city that it seemed infighting would once again seize venice in 1032 barbolano himself was deposed by those who wished to restore power to otto orseolo but former doge lay dying in constantinople and was unable to return from exile domenico orseolo a younger brother of otto and a rather unpopular figure in venice attempted to seize throne without waiting for formality of an election but as soon as he tried this his many enemies including those who pushed for reinstatement of otto grew outraged that an orseolo would assume throne simply because he was son of pietro ii power of doge was severely checked and domenico flabanico a successful merchant was called by people to position of doge during his 11 year reign flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict power of future doges including a law forbidding election of a son of a doge mcclellan oligarchy of venice pp 39 43 doge domenico contarini 1043 1071 had a relatively uneventful reign healing rift between doge and his subjects and regaining territory that had been lost in east to kingdom of croatia in years following deposition of otto orseolo however one fact remained based on their actions in first half of 11th century majority of people of venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class this reality coupled with fresh memories of power hungry doges set stage for domenico selvo biography life before dogeship what little is known of selvo s past is based mostly on accounts of his reputation when he entered his dogeship details of his family origins and even year of his birth are unknown but it can be assumed that he was a venetian noble because with rare exception of domenico flabanico only members of this class were elected to position of doge at this point in republic s history selvo supposedly belonged to a family in patrician class from of who were allegedly of ancient roman origin possibly from one of tribunes hazlitt venetian republic pp 134 143 he had also apparently been an ambassador to holy roman emperor henry iii and he was certainly ducal counselor to domenico contarini prior to his election as doge rendina i dogi storia e segreti pp 16 18 being connected to

election was recorded by an eyewitness a parish priest of church of san michele archangelo by name of domenico tino gallicciolli delle memorie venete antiche pp 124 126 account gives historians a valuable glimpse of power of popular will of venetian people over previous two centuries rule of quasi tyrannies had plagued popular belief that venetians held democratic control over their leaders grubb when myths lose power pp 43 94 events of selvo s election occurred in spring of 1071 when nearly thirty year reign of doge domenico contarini came to an end upon his death norwich a history of venice p 641 according to tino s account on day of election selvo was attending mass for funeral of late doge at new monastery church of san nicolo built under domenico contarini on lido an island in venetian lagoon location was ideal for funeral of a doge not only because st mark s basilica was under construction at time but new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people wiel venice pp 76 79 location also proved ideal for election of a new doge for very same reasons after funeral a large crowd assembled in their gondolas and armed galleys domenico tino says an innumerable multitude of people virtually all venice was there to voice their opinion on selection of a new doge norwich a history of venice pp 67 70 after bishop of venice asked who would be worthy of his nation crowds chanted domenicum silvium et laudamus we want domenico selvo and we praise him sansovino venetia p 477 people according to account had clearly spoken and with these cries election was over a group of more distinguished citizens then lifted doge elect above roaring crowd and he was transported as such back to city molmenti venice p 209 barefoot in accordance with tradition selvo was led into st mark s basilica where amidst construction materials and scaffolding he prayed to god received his staff of office heard oaths of fidelity from his subjects and was legally sworn in as 31st doge of venice though venetian legends consider selvo to be 31st doge first two doges paolo lucio and marcello are hard to verify historically norwich calls selvo 29th doge but others e g hazlitt rendina either call him solely 31st doge or provide some distinction to clarify issue peace and prosperity 1071 1080 during first decade of his rule selvo s policies were largely a continuation of those of domenico contarini there were few armed conflicts at home or abroad and doge enjoyed a period of popularity due to prosperous economic conditions relations with holy roman empire were gradually strengthened to a level unknown since reign of last orseolo through relatively free trade and good relationship that selvo maintained with emperor henry iv importance of economic alliance between two nations became increasingly crucial when historically shared power of holy roman emperor and pope was challenged by investiture controversy between henry iv and pope gregory vii selvo had to walk an extremely tight line of competing priorities on one hand he wanted to maintain trade agreement venice had with lands occupied by henry iv but on other hand venetians were religiously loyal to roman catholicism as opposed to eastern orthodoxy jacobs andrew s christian history maps part two middle ages university of california riverside retrieved on march 27 2007 at height of controversy pope gregory vii privately threatened to excommunicate selvo and put an interdict on venetian republic but selvo was able to narrowly escape this by diplomatically asserting venice s religious power as reputed holders of remains of st mark muir civic ritual in renaissance venice pp 78 84 in east selvo not only maintained good trade relations with byzantine empire but also married into their royal family to consolidate alliance that had existed for many years between two nations in 1075 selvo married theodora doukas daughter of constantine x and sister of reigning emperor michael vii nicol byzantium and venice pp 51 52 though venetians especially nobles were wary of pageantry that accompanied marriage and royal bride strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for venetian

of early years of selvo s reign forces that would eventually lead to his deposition had already swung into action in southern italy duke of apulia and calabria robert guiscard had spent majority of his reign consolidating norman power along heel and toe of lo by expelling byzantine armies guiscard was pushing north toward papal states to which duchy of apulia and calabria was allied and was threatening byzantine control of cities along ionian and adriatic seas skinner family power in southern italy pp 3 5 in may 1081 guiscard led his army and navy across sea to lay siege to port city of durazzo as it was one end of famous via egnatia a direct route to byzantine capital of constantinople alexios i komnenos newly crowned byzantine emperor dispatched an urgent message to selvo asking for mobilization of venetian fleet in defense of durazzo in return for great rewards doge wasted no time in setting sail for besieged city in charge of his fleet of 14 warships and 45 other vessels selvo was motivated not only by his familial ties and promise of reward but also realization that norman control over strait of otranto would be just as great of a threat to venetian power in region as it would be to their ally in east nicol byzantium and venice pp 57 59 when selvo approached city guiscard s ships had already anchored in harbor at durazzo though battle was fierce superior tactics

left fleet under command of his son and returned to venice a hero because of help given to byzantine empire republic of venice was awarded a golden bull a decree by emperor alexios i komnenos granting

in coming months guiscard would regroup his forces and defeat a large byzantine army led by alexios i himself in 1082 guiscard took city of durazzo and as venetian sailors were forced out of city and their ships vacated harbor of durazzo first victory by venice against norman fleet appeared just a temporary setback for normans due to new trade privileges and fact that virtually no damage was inflicted on venetians during this siege selvo remained very popular in venice meanwhile guiscard advanced rapidly across balkan peninsula but his march was halted by an urgent dispatch and a call for help from his greatest ally pope gregory vii guiscard responded by returning to italy and marching on rome to temporarily expel henry iv but in process he lost almost all territories he had gained in balkans knowing that guiscard was gone in 1083 selvo sent venetian fleet to recapture both durazzo and island of corfu to south norwich a history of venice pp 71 75 defeat and deposition 1084 thumb left robert guiscard as depicted on a coin in 1084 guiscard returned to balkans and planned a new offensive against corfu where a combined greek venetian fleet commanded by selvo awaited his arrival when normans approached island combined fleets dealt guiscard an even greater defeat than he had received in naval battle at durazzo guiscard ordered another attack three days later but results were still more disastrous for normans selvo was completely convinced of his fleet s victory and sent all damaged ships north to venice for repairs to free them for other uses and to report of their victory doge then retired with remaining ships to albanian coast to await departure of normans acting on doge s belief that a third attack would be unlikely and that presence of a slightly depleted venetian fleet meant greater odds for victory guiscard summoned every floating vessel he could find and led normans into a surprise attack his strategy though perhaps risky was ultimately well calculated as it caused mass confusion among venetians who were overwhelmed on all flanks while greeks fled what they assumed to be a losing battle selvo barely managed to retreat with remainder of his fleet but not before 3 000 venetians died and another 2 500 were taken prisoner hazlitt and norwich list different numbers of casualties but it is more probable that norwich who says 13 000 venetians died is mistaken as only source he cites alexiad by anna komnene and hazlitt cites several sources that state that only 13 000 venetians were present at battle at all entirety of venetian fleet was not destroyed so hazlitt s numbers seem to be more believable entirety of anna komnene s account can be found in book vi of alexiad which is referenced below venetians also lost 9 great galleys largest and most heavily armed ships in their war fleet j norwich a history of venice 72 when battered fleet returned to venice news of defeat spread throughout city to mixed reactions though some were willing to forgive defeat considering circumstances many others needed someone to blame for loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms but also symbolically people of venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience though guiscard would die next year and norman threat would quickly disappear a scapegoat was needed at that moment it is difficult to tell if selvo truly was at fault for defeat in third battle with norman fleet near corfu but according to hazlitt and norwich almost all accounts name selvo as an heroic figure who nearly overcame an unlikely counterattack this claim is based mostly on anecdotal evidence and it clearly did not weigh heavily enough on minds of venetians who overthrew selvo based on outcome of battle a faction of influential venetians possibly led by vitale faliero based on later writings led a popular revolt to depose selvo and in december 1084 they succeeded selvo apparently did not make

retrieved on march 27 2007 legacy after selvo was deposed it took several years for venice to recover from defeat at corfu and for venetians to fully realize immediate impact of his actions as doge when venice provided military aid to byzantine empire they were awarded a golden bull by emperor alexios i that would provide venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout eastern empire for centuries according to terms of decree annual grants were awarded to all churches in venice including a special gift to coffers of st mark s republic was granted whole sections of golden horn in constantinople and venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout territories of byzantine empire not only did this aid rapid economic growth of venice in next few centuries by giving venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods but it initiated a long period of artistic cultural and military relationships between venice and byzantium this combination of eastern and western cultural influences made venice a symbolic gateway between east and west in southern europe thumb right 200px mosaics in st mark s basilica were first

changes of power in a society that was in process of moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official following battles at corfu selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling duties that a doge must perform his apparent squandering of nearly entire fleet coupled with a decade long distrust for his royal wife caused selvo to become unpopular in venice
