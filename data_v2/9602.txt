broadcast nbc renewed office for a full fourth season which came as no surprise to media pundits beginning his review buddy tv s oscar dahl declared andy was one of most devastatingly annoying characters on television dahl liked dwight s scenes at staples and wrote that series was becoming more and more difficult to write about it s really funny consistently funny great episodes week after week breed little in way of discussion we have to appreciate greatness while it s here office is in midst of a historic run of consistently great episodes bask in it aol tv writer michael sciannamea agreed with dahl s initial assessment of andy and called him most obnoxious sitcom character in last few years sciannamea enjoyed seeing more of angela s and michael s personalities and believed andy was a short timer to series entertainment weekly contributor abby west praised angela kinsey s performance noting that she brought wonderful contradictions to her prickly office priss west also enjoyed love triangle for being so skillfully kept as subplot it should be it is as much due to light touches of three actors as to writers it s refreshing that jim and karen have mostly been so mature and honest but that s a sure sign that relationship will devolve because setup for success for most long term tv romances requires miscommunication and no confrontation in his review of third season travis fickett of ign highlighted a scene of episode he commented watching andy slowly meltdown when he can t find his cell phone is one of better moments of season references external links
