windmills in a stamp booklet called windmills usa it originally operated as a custom grinding mill history during mid 19th century fabyan windmill was constructed by german craftsmen louis and his brother in law brockmann on a site at meyers road near 16th street in york township between elmhurst and oak brook illinois now lombard illinois by early 20th century windmill had fallen into a state of disrepair in 1914 george fabyan purchased disused windmill for approximately 8 000 from mrs fred runge he then had it moved to its present location in geneva township on east side of fox river close to illinois route 25 in july 1915 fabyan spent an estimated 75 000 to have it moved reconstructed and restored edgar e belding company of west chicago was contracted by fabyan to move windmill from york center it was slowly dismantled piece by piece with roman numerals carved into beams and braces to facilitate correct reconstruction some of largest beams had to be hauled by a team of mules windmill was reassembled on its present site by a danish millwright named rasmussen with assistance of john johnson and six others from wilson bros construction co after nineteen months relocation and reconstruction were completed mill was a wonder in its day because it is thought to be only fully automatic wind driven mill of its type george fabyan died in 1936 and his wife died two years later estate was then sold by executors of will to kane county forest preserve district for 70 500 structure giant cypress wood beams trimmed with black walnut are all hand joined and with wood dowels in fact there are no metal nails used inside structure even original gearing was handmade of hickory and maple with all five floors containing different mechanisms windmill was a functioning mill used by for grinding several types of grain including corn wheat rye and oats it also served as a grain mill for fabyan s herd of prized jersey cattle at mill s top or cap is a huge wheel called brake wheel which was turned by wind blowing against sails sails are covered with canvas to help catch wind sails had to be entirely reconstructed by rasmussen and john johnson because they were missing when fabyan bought mill sails span 74 feet 4 inches brake wheel located in cap rotates an upright shaft running height of mill this shaft supplied power to all of mill s operations there is a set of belt driven elevators remarkable for its time that moved grains from chutes to hoppers and even from floor to floor making mill almost fully automatic most other mills required workers to hand shovel materials between operations during its reconstruction colonel had a new foundation poured which created a basement in basement he had ovens installed whose vents and chimney extended underground beneath route 25 to a structure that once stood on other side in addition to ovens marble slabs and cooling racks were also installed it is thought that at one time windmill basement was an operating bakery during flour rationing of world war i bakery supposedly produced bread for fabyan family and even for their two bears tom and jerry however extent of use of mill s bakery is debatable due to an inadequate oven draft significance wind powered mill is a type that was rarely built in united states where grist mills are usually powered by water its wooden gears and nail less construction techniques are of interest both technically and architecturally mill is also an example of an america folly a structure built primarily to enhance landscape or view in this case george fabyan a wealthy merchant purchased and moved by then inoperative mill to beautify his estate but maintained it as a private mill with no commercial value today kane county considered windmill s demolition as early as 1990 when it became structurally unsafe for public inspection however local citizens began fighting to keep mill intact in 1997 forest preserve district contracted third generation dutch windmill maker lucas to fully restore windmill for a cost of over 900 000 it made its public debut in june 2005 grinding mechanisms to make flour have been restored and are in use today by mill volunteers who do demonstrations to public even now varnish from 1915 is in near perfect condition because climate inside mill varies little from season to season due to its superior construction and
