could be conferred by emperor of japan during their relationship lady saigo influenced ieyasu s philosophies choice of allies and policies as he rose to power during late sengoku period and she thus had an indirect effect on organization and composition of tokugawa shogunate although less is known of her than some other figures of era she is generally regarded as power behind throne and her life has been compared to a cinderella story of feudal japan 2000 2013 once she was in a respected and secure position as first consort and mother to ieyasu s heir lady saigo used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes a devout buddhist she donated money to temples in suruga province where she resided as consort of ieyasu first in hamamatsu castle and later in sunpu castle as she was quite near sighted she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support lady saigo died at a fairly young age under somewhat mysterious circumstances although murder was suspected no culprit was identified lady saigo bore four children she had a son and a daughter saigo katsutada and tokuhime while married and she later bore two sons

regnant name term saigo no tsubone used in most historical texts is an official title rather than a name as an adult she was adopted into saigo clan so she was permitted to use surname later when she was named first consort of tokugawa ieyasu title tsubone pronounced was appended to surname title was one of several titular suffixes conferred on high ranking women others include kata and bestowal of a title depended on social class and relationship with her samurai lord such as whether she was a legitimate wife or a concubine and whether or not she had had children by him downer 2008 hata 2008 pp 172 190 pp 175 178 word tsubone indicates living quarters reserved for ladies of a court griffis 1915 p 88 and it became title for those who had been granted private quarters such as high ranking concubines with children this title tsubone was in use for concubines from heian period until meiji period from eighth century to early twentieth century akiyama 1990 and is commonly translated to english title lady murdoch 1996 p 3 though lady saigo s given name does not appear in surviving documents from time there is good evidence it was masako but this name is very rarely used her most commonly used name was oai or meaning love and most sources agree this was a nickname she gained as a child hodai in 2010 kobayashi and makino 1994 p 392 hyodo et al 2007 p 546 nakashima 1999 p 79 nihon 2007 pp 78 79 intimate friends and family would call her oai throughout her life and it is name most often used in modern popular cultural references following death she was bestowed with a buddhist posthumous name and an abbreviation of that name hodai in is sometimes used out of pious respect background saigo family was one branch of distinguished kikuchi clan of kyushu that had migrated northward to mikawa province in fifteenth century in 1524 forces of matsudaira kiyoyasu 1511 1536 grandfather of tokugawa ieyasu stormed and took saigo clan s headquarters at yamanaka castle during his conquest of mikawa region shortly after battle saigo third head of saigo submitted to matsudaira clan kobayashi and makino 1994 p 610 following untimely death of kiyoyasu in 1536 and ineffectual leadership and early death of matsudaira 1526 1549 leaderless matsudaira clan finally submitted to imagawa yoshimoto 1519 1560 of suruga province east of mikawa when matsudaira fell to imagawa clans of their retainers which included saigo likewise submitted to imagawa following battle of 1560 saigo masakatsu attempted to re assert independence of clan while yielding some land concessions to imagawa in response imagawa arrested thirteen saigo men and had them vertically impaled near yoshida castle kobayashi and makino 1994 p 612 executions did not deter saigo and in 1562 imagawa launched punitive invasions of east mikawa and attacked two main saigo castles masakatsu was killed in battle of castle his eldest son motomasa was killed during battle for castle clan leadership passed to masakatsu s son saigo kiyokazu 1533 1594 who pledged his loyalty to matsudaira clan under leadership of tokugawa ieyasu in their mutual struggle against imagawa in 1569 power of imagawa ended with siege of kakegawa castle sadler 1937 p 73 2000 p 122 neither name of lady saigo s mother nor her dates of birth or death are recorded in any existing documents although it is known that she was elder sister of saigo kiyokazu kobayashi and makino 1994 p 394 lady saigo s father was tadaharu of province under direct control of imagawa clan marriage between tadaharu and his wife was very likely arranged by imagawa clan biography early life lady saigo was born in 1552 at nishikawa castle a branch castle of saigo clan aichi 1998 p 101 and very likely given name of masako soon after birth japanese marriages are not usually ueno 2009 pp 199 201 but tadaharu may have been assigned to nishikawa castle as an agent of imagawa masako spent her childhood with her two siblings in bucolic eastern mikawa province and at some point gained nickname oai in 1554 her father tadaharu died in battle of omori between imagawa and hojo clan kobayashi and makino 1994 p 399 two years later her mother married hattori masanao union resulted in four children though only two survived to adulthood kobayashi and makino 1994 p 393 kobayashi and makino 1994 p 395 some sources state that upon reaching adulthood oai married but was widowed soon afterward husband s name is not mentioned and there were apparently no children other sources do not mention marriage or suggest that there never was an earlier first marriage it is known with certainty that in 1567 oai married saigo yoshikatsu her cousin and son of motomasa who had already had two children by his late wife kobayashi and makino 1994 p 398 oai bore two children by yoshikatsu their son saigo katsutada was born about 1570 they also had a daughter possibly named tokuhime kobayashi and makino 1994 p 373 nakashima 1999 p 91 in 1571 saigo yoshikatsu was killed at battle of takehiro fighting invading forces of takeda clan led by akiyama nobutomo kobayashi and makino 1994 p 372 soon after yoshikatsu s death oai was formally adopted by her uncle saigo kiyokazu then head of saigo clan though she chose to live with her mother in house of her stepfather tokugawa ieyasu thumb tokugawa ieyasu oai first met tokugawa ieyasu at about age of 17 or 18 when he visited saigo family and oai served him tea nakashima 1999 p 80 it is believed she caught his eye on that occasion but as she was still married nothing came of it at time later during 1570s it is believed that friendship and genuine affection developed between two this view contradicts a common impression which maintains that ieyasu was a ruthless leader who treated all women in his life and all of his offspring as commodities to be used as needed to serve clan or his own ambitions sadler 1937 p 284 however it is also known that he valued personal merit over bloodlines during this time ieyasu had a house built in eastern mikawa far from residence of his wife lady tsukiyama in okazaki kobayashi and makino 1994 p 400 sadler 1937 p 75 marriage between ieyasu and lady tsukiyama had been arranged by her uncle imagawa yoshimoto ostensibly to help cement ties between two clans though ieyasu found it difficult to live with his wife s jealousy tempestuous moods and eccentric habits sadler 1937 pp 75 92 totman 1983 p 32 starting around time of battle of 1573 perhaps in its aftermath ieyasu began to confide in oai and sought her counsel on various matters it may have been during this period that two commenced an amorous relationship oai is credited with advising ieyasu as battle of 1575 approached a major turning point in both ieyasu s career and history of japan kobayashi and makino 1994 p 384 it is also thought that ieyasu continued to seek her advice concerning other battles and alliances even as late as campaign 1584 in spring of 1578 oai moved to hamamatsu castle where she took over management of kitchen she became very popular with unit of warriors from her native province who not only admired her beauty but regarded her as a gentle and virtuous example of women of mikawa while her manners and gentility were exemplary she could when occasion warranted be outspoken or sarcastic in speech probable result of growing up around rustic warriors in a remote castle outpost with her move to court of ieyasu oai entered a bitter arena where prospective concubines schemed and competed with each other for a chance to bear ieyasu s child bearing child of a powerful samurai especially a son was one way an ambitious young woman of period could elevate her status ensure a comfortable life and guarantee prosperity of her family beard 1953 p 4 8 these women usually relied on their physical attributes and sexual prowess to keep their lord s attention and some resorted to use of aphrodisiacs unlike these courtesans oai already had attention of ieyasu which would have undermined ambitions of some and very likely made her a target of resentment hostility and intrigues that were common in japanese harems levy 1971 p 39 thumb right tokugawa hidetada son of ieyasu and lady saigo while ieyasu s marriage was arranged for political reasons and many of his later concubines were chosen in same spirit it is thought that he chose his relationship with lady saigo despite image of ieyasu as a calculating and stoic warlord there was no new political advantage to match as saigo were already loyal vassals and thus texts about lady saigo refer to her as most beloved of ieyasu s women moreover ieyasu valued her for her intelligence and sound advice and it is believed that he enjoyed her company and calm demeanor as well as their common background in mikawa province on may 2 1579 oai gave birth to ieyasu s third son who would become known as tokugawa hidetada news was probably a shock to all who had an interest in ieyasu but with event oai s position became more secure and she was accepted as first consort of ieyasu based on this relationship and out of respect for her gentle manner and devotion to ieyasu she became known by respectful title of saigo no tsubone or lady saigo kobayashi and makino 1994 p 614 in same year oda nobunaga was informed that lady tsukiyama had conspired against him with takeda clan although evidence was weak ieyasu re assured his ally by having his wife executed by shore of lake in hamamatsu sadler 1937 p 94 tokugawa nobuyasu ieyasu s first son by lady tsukiyama was held in confinement until ieyasu ordered him to commit seppuku with their deaths lady saigo s position at court was unassailable with death of nobuyasu hidetada became ieyasu s heir apparent griffis 1883 p 272 sadler 1937 p 141 ieyasu s fourth son second by lady saigo was born on october 18 1580 he would become known as matsudaira tadayoshi after he was adopted by matsudaira head of branch of matsudaira clan totman 1983 p 191 in same year lady saigo had a temple founded in her mother s memory indicating she had died by that point in 1586 lady saigo was at side of ieyasu when he entered newly reconstructed sunpu castle in triumph this was a highly symbolic celebration of his victories over his enemies and subjugation of region but it was also a visible and symbolic gesture to lady saigo a way that ieyasu could credit her for her assistance and publicly demonstrate esteem in which he regarded her charity while at sunpu castle lady saigo worshipped at a buddhist temple called ryusen ji she became devoted to teachings of pure land sect and was known for her piety and charity because she suffered a high degree of myopia she often donated money clothing food and other necessities to blind women and organizations that assisted them she eventually founded a co operative school with living quarters near ryusen ji that assisted indigent blind women by teaching them how to play shamisen

hardships were taking their toll on her health but nothing could be done to help her lady saigo died on july 1 1589 at age of 37 cause of her early death was never determined and while murder was suspected at time no culprit was identified there were later rumors that she was poisoned by a maidservant devoted to ieyasu s late wife lady tsukiyama nakashima 1999 p 81 by time of her death lady saigo was treated as ieyasu s wife in deed if not in word kobayashi and makino 1994 p 411 remains of lady saigo were interred at ryusen ji at her death a number of blind women reportedly gathered in front of temple and prayed kobayashi and makino 1994 p 408 legacy tokugawa ieyasu continued his campaigns allied with toyotomi hideyoshi after their victory at siege of odawara castle in 1590 ieyasu
