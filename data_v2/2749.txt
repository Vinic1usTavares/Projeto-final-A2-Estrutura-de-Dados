apollo 8 was first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and first to reach moon orbit it and return its three astronaut crew frank borman james lovell and william anders were first humans to fly to moon to witness and photograph an earthrise and to escape gravity of a celestial body apollo 8 launched on december 21 1968 and was second crewed spaceflight mission flown in united states apollo space program after apollo 7 which stayed in earth orbit apollo8 was third flight and first crewed launch of saturn v rocket and was first human spaceflight from kennedy space center located adjacent to cape canaveral air force station in florida originally planned as second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early 1969 mission profile was changed in august 1968 to a more ambitious command module only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december as lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight astronaut jim mcdivitt s crew who were training to fly first lunar module flight in low earth orbit became crew for apollo 9 mission and borman s crew were moved to apollo8 mission this left borman s crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned and replaced planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training apollo 8 took 68 hours almost three days to travel distance to moon crew orbited moon ten times over course of twenty hours during which they made a christmas eve television broadcast in which they read first ten verses from book of genesis at time broadcast was most watched tv program ever apollo 8 s successful mission paved way for apollo 11 to fulfill u s president john f kennedy s goal of landing a man on moon before end of 1960s apollo8 astronauts returned to earth on december 27 1968 when their spacecraft splashed down in northern pacific ocean crew members were named time magazine s men of year for 1968 upon their return background in late 1950s and early 1960s united states was engaged in cold war a geopolitical rivalry with soviet union on october 4 1957 soviet union launched sputnik 1 first artificial satellite this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around world it not only demonstrated that soviet union had capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances it challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority launch precipitated sputnik crisis and triggered space race president john f kennedy believed that not only was it in national interest of united states to be superior to other nations but that perception of american power was at least as important as actuality it was therefore intolerable to him for soviet union to be more advanced in field of space exploration he was determined that united states should compete and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning soviet union had better booster rockets which meant kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond capacity of existing generation of rocketry one where us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality something spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such a project to land a man on moon and return him to earth this project already had a name project apollo an early and crucial decision was adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous under which a specialized spacecraft would land on lunar surface apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components a command module cm with a cabin for three astronauts and only part that would return to earth a service module sm to provide command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a two stage lunar module lm which comprised a descent stage for landing on moon and an ascent stage to return astronauts to lunar orbit this configuration could be launched by saturn v rocket that was then under development framework prime crew initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander michael collins as command module pilot cmp and william anders as lunar module pilot lmp for third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november 20 1967 collins was replaced by jim lovell in july 1968 after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair this crew was unique among pre space shuttle era missions in that commander was not most experienced member of crew lovell had flown twice before on gemini vii and gemini xii this would also be first case of a commander of a previous mission lovell gemini xii flying as a non commander backup crew backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander lovell as cmp and buzz aldrin as lmp for third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at same time as prime crew when lovell was reassigned to prime crew aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp armstrong would later command apollo 11 with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp haise served on backup crew of apollo 11 as lmp and flew on apollo 13 as lmp support personnel during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as support crew support crew maintained flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes support crew developed procedures in simulators especially those for emergency situations so that prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training for apollo8 support crew consisted of ken mattingly vance brand and gerald carr capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at mission control center in houston texas who was only person who communicated directly with flight crew for apollo8 were michael collins gerald carr ken mattingly neil armstrong buzz aldrin vance brand and fred haise mission control teams rotated in three shifts each led by a flight director directors for apollo8 were clifford e charlesworth green team glynn black team and milton maroon team mission insignia and callsign thumb apollo 8 space flown silver robbins medallion triangular shape of insignia refers to shape of apollo cm it shows a red looping around earth and moon to reflect both mission number and circumlunar nature of mission on bottom of are names of three astronauts initial design of insignia was developed by jim lovell who reportedly sketched it while riding in back seat of a t 38 flight from california to houston shortly after learning of apollo8 s re designation as a lunar orbital mission crew wanted to name their spacecraft but nasa did not allow it crew would have likely chosen name of giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in jules verne s 1865 novel from earth to moon apollo 11 cm was named columbia in part for that reason preparations mission schedule on september 20 1967 nasa adopted a seven step plan for apollo missions with final step being a moon landing apollo 4 and apollo 6 were a missions tests of saturn v launch vehicle using an uncrewed block i production model of command and service module csm in earth orbit apollo 5 was a b mission a test of lm in earth orbit apollo 7 scheduled for october 1968 would be a c mission a crewed earth orbit flight of csm further missions depended on readiness of lm it had been decided as early as may 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions apollo8 was planned as d mission a test of lm in a low earth orbit in december 1968 by james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart while borman s crew would fly e mission a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollo 9 in early 1969 f mission would test csm and lm in lunar orbit and g mission would be finale moon landing thumb left upright first stage of as 503 being erected in vehicle assembly building vab on february 1 1968 production of lm fell behind schedule and when apollo8 s lm 3 arrived at kennedy space center ksc in june 1968 more than a hundred significant defects were discovered leading bob gilruth director of manned spacecraft center msc and others to conclude that there was no prospect of lm 3 being ready to fly in 1968 indeed it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march 1969 following original seven step plan would have meant delaying d and subsequent missions and endangering program s goal of a lunar landing before end of 1969 george low manager of apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august 1968 to keep program on track despite lm delay since next csm designated as csm 103 would be ready three months before lm 3 a csm only mission could be flown in december 1968 instead of repeating c mission flight of apollo 7 this csm could be sent all way to moon with possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to earth new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollo 10 scheduled f mission this also meant that medium earth orbit e mission could be dispensed with net result was that only d mission had to be delayed and plan for lunar landing in mid 1969 could remain on timeline on august 9 1968 low discussed idea with gilruth flight director chris kraft and director of flight crew operations donald slayton they then flew to marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama where they met with ksc director kurt debus apollo program director samuel c phillips rocco petrone and wernher von braun kraft considered proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint debus and petrone agreed that next saturn v as 503 could be made ready by december 1 and von braun was confident pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted apollo6 had been fixed almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission citing confidence in both hardware and personnel along with potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost only person who needed some convincing was james e webb nasa administrator backed by full support of his agency webb authorized mission apollo8 was officially changed from a d mission to a c prime lunar orbit mission with change in mission for apollo 8 slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it mcdivitt turned it down his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test lm and that was what he still wanted to do slayton then decided to swap prime and backup crews of emissions this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft requiring borman s crew to use csm 103 while mcdivitt s crew would use csm 104 since cm 104 could not be made ready by december david scott was not happy about giving up cm 103 testing of which he had closely supervised for cm 104 although two were almost identical and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on a flight with no lm instead in order that spacecraft would have correct weight and balance apollo8 would carry lm test article a boilerplate model of lm 3 added pressure on apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by soviet union s zond 5 mission which flew some living creatures including russian tortoises in a cislunar loop around moon and returned them to earth on september 21 there was speculation within nasa and press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before end of 1968 thumb right erection and mating of spacecraft 103 to launch vehicle as 503 in vab for apollo8 mission apollo 8 crew now living in crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife anne morrow lindbergh night before launch they talked about how before his 1927 flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure distance from new york city to paris on a globe and from that calculated fuel needed for flight total he had carried was a tenth of amount that saturn v would burn every second next day watched launch of apollo8 from a nearby dune saturn v redesign saturn v rocket used by apollo8 was designated as 503 or 03rd model of saturnv 5 rocket to be used in apollo saturn as program when it was erected in vehicle assembly building on december 20 1967 it was thought that rocket would be used for an uncrewed earth orbit test flight carrying a boilerplate command and service module apollo 6 had suffered several major problems during its april 1968 flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two second stage engine failures and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit without assurances that these problems had been rectified nasa administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved saturn v was ready teams from msfc went to work on problems of primary concern was pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant g forces on a crew a task force of contractors nasa agency representatives and msfc researchers concluded that engines vibrated at a frequency similar to frequency at which spacecraft itself vibrated causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in rocket a system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed thumb left apollo8 atop saturnv being rolled out to pad 39a of equal importance was failure of three engines during flight researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two when an automatic shutoff attempted to close liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it had accidentally shut down engine three s liquid oxygen due to a connection as a result engine three failed within one second of engine two s shutdown further investigation revealed same problem for third stage engine a faulty igniter line team modified igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches teams tested their solutions in august 1968 at msfc a saturn stage ic was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate team s solution to problem of pogo oscillation while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions once nasa administrators were convinced that problems had been solved they gave their approval for a crewed mission using as 503 apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of rocket on september 21 and rocket made slow journey to launch pad on testing continued all through december until day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from december5 through 11 final testing of modifications to address problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on december 18 three days before scheduled launch mission parameter summary thumb upright 3 0 mission profile as first crewed spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body apollo8 s profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal circular earth parking orbit apollo8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of with an inclination of 32 51deg to equator and an orbital period of 88 19 minutes propellant venting increased apogee by over 2hours 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in parking orbit this was followed by a trans lunar injection tli burn of s ivb third stage for 318 seconds accelerating command and service module and lm test article from an orbital velocity of to injection velocity of which set a record for highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled this speed was slightly less than earth s escape velocity of but put apollo8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit close enough to moon to be captured by moon s gravity standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal circular orbit above moon s surface initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a of and an of at an inclination of 12deg from lunar equator this was then at by with an orbital period of 128 7 minutes effect of lunar mass concentrations on orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over course of ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours orbital distance was to by apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from earth of launch and trans lunar injection thumb left apollo 8 during launch apollo 8 launched at 12 51 00 utc 07 51 00 eastern standard time on december 21 1968 using saturn v s three stages to achieve earth orbit s ic first stage landed in atlantic ocean at and s ii second stage landed at s ivb third stage injected craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform tli burn that would put spacecraft on a trajectory to moon once vehicle reached earth orbit both crew and houston flight controllers spent next 2hours and 38 minutes checking that spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli proper operation of s ivb third stage of rocket was crucial and in last uncrewed test it had failed to reignite for this burn collins was first capcom on duty and at 2hours 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch he radioed apollo8 you are go for tli this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for apollo8 to go to moon s ivb engine ignited on time and performed tli burn perfectly over next five minutes spacecraft s speed increased from after s ivb had placed mission on course for moon command and service modules csm remaining apollo8 spacecraft separated from it crew then rotated spacecraft to take photographs of spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it as crew rotated spacecraft they had their first views of earth as they moved away from it this marked first time humans had viewed whole earth at once borman became worried that s ivb was staying too close to csm and suggested to mission control that crew perform a separation maneuver mission control first suggested pointing spacecraft towards earth and using small reaction control system rcs thrusters on service module sm to add to their velocity away from earth but borman did not want to lose sight of s ivb after discussion crew and mission control decided to burn in earth direction to increase speed but at instead time needed to prepare and perform additional burn put crew an hour behind their onboard tasks thumb apollo 8 s ivb rocket stage shortly after separation five hours after launch mission control sent a command to s ivb to vent its remaining fuel changing its trajectory s ivb with test article attached posed no further hazard to apollo8 passing orbit of moon and going into a solar orbit with an inclination of 23 47deg from plane of ecliptic and an orbital period of 340 80 days it became a derelict object and will continue to orbit sun for many years apollo 8 crew were first humans to pass through van allen radiation belts which extend up to from earth scientists predicted that passing through belts quickly at spacecraft s high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x ray or mgy during a year average human receives a dose of 2to to record actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a personal radiation that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed cumulative radiation experienced by crew by end of mission crew members experienced an average radiation dose of 1 6 mgy sec 2 ch 3 lunar trajectory lovell s main job as command module pilot was as navigator although mission control normally performed all actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into spacecraft measuring angle between a star and earth s or moon s horizon this task was made difficult by a large cloud of debris around spacecraft which made it hard to distinguish stars by seven hours into mission crew was about 1hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan because of problems in moving away from s ivb and lovell s obscured star sightings crew placed spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also called barbecue roll in which spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across surface of spacecraft in direct sunlight parts of spacecraft s outer surface could be heated to over while parts in shadow would be these temperatures could cause heat shield to crack and propellant lines to burst because it was impossible to get a perfect roll spacecraft swept out a cone as it rotated crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as cone pattern got larger and larger thumb left first image taken by humans of whole earth probably photographed by william anders 003 42 55 south is up with south america in middle first mid course correction came eleven hours into flight crew had been awake for more than 16 hours before launch nasa had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise borman started first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of constant radio chatter and mechanical noises testing on ground had shown that service propulsion system sps engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first by burning engine for a short period this first correction burn was only 2 4 seconds and added about velocity prograde in direction of travel this change was less than planned because of a bubble of helium in oxidizer lines which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure crew had to use small rcs thrusters to make up shortfall two later planned mid course corrections were canceled because apollo8 trajectory was found to be perfect about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman obtained permission from ground control to take a seconal sleeping pill pill had little effect borman eventually fell asleep and then awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea this left spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces which crew cleaned up as well as they could borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control crew decided to use data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed after recording a description of borman s illness they asked mission control to check recording stating that they would like an evaluation of voice comments apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on second and third floors only one of which was used during a mission conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that borman s illness was either a 24 hour flu as borman thought or a reaction to sleeping pill researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini because those astronauts could not move freely in small cabins of those spacecraft increased cabin space in apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and later astronaut rusty schweickart during apollo 9 thumb right still from film of crew taken while they were in orbit around moon frank borman is in center cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of flight except for crew s checking that spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch apollo8 crew used a camera that broadcast in black and white only using a vidicon tube camera had two lenses a very wide angle lens and a telephoto 9deg lens during this first broadcast crew gave a tour of spacecraft and attempted to show how earth appeared from space however difficulties aiming narrow angle lens without aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing earth impossible additionally without proper filters earth image became saturated by any bright source in end all crew could show people watching back on earth was a bright blob after broadcasting for 17 minutes rotation of spacecraft took high gain antenna out of view of receiving stations on earth and they ended transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday by this time crew had completely abandoned planned sleep shifts lovell went to sleep 32 and a half hours into flight 3 and a half hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill crew was unable to see moon for much of outward cruise two factors made moon almost impossible to see from inside spacecraft three of five windows fogging up due to out gassed oils from silicone sealant and attitude required for passive thermal control it was not until crew had gone behind moon that they would be able to see it for first time apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into flight this time crew rigged up filters meant for still cameras so they could acquire images of earth through telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver entire spacecraft crew was able to broadcast back to earth first television pictures of earth crew spent transmission describing earth what was visible and colors they could see transmission lasted 23 minutes lunar sphere of influence thumb left this photograph of moon was taken from apollo8 at a point above 70 degrees east longitude at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into flight and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit crew of apollo8 became first humans to enter gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body in other words effect of moon s gravitational force on apollo8 became stronger than that of earth at time it happened apollo8 was from moon and had a speed of relative to moon this historic moment was of little interest to crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to launch pad at kennedy space center they would continue to do so until they performed their last mid course correction switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit last major event before lunar orbit insertion loi was a second mid course correction it was in retrograde against direction of travel and slowed spacecraft down by effectively reducing closest distance at which spacecraft would pass moon at exactly 61 hours after launch about from moon crew burned rcs for 11 seconds they would now pass from lunar surface at 64 hours into flight crew began to prepare for lunar orbit loi 1 this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on far side of moon out of contact with earth after mission control was polled for a go no go decision crew was told at 68 hours that they were go and riding best bird we can find lovell replied we ll see you on other side and for first time in history humans travelled behind moon and out of radio contact with earth with ten minutes remaining before loi 1 crew began one last check of spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position at that time they finally got their first glimpses of moon they had been flying over unlit side and it was lovell who saw first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating lunar surface loi burn was only two minutes away so crew had little time to appreciate view lunar orbit sps was ignited at 69 hours and 16 seconds after launch and burned for and placing apollo8 spacecraft in orbit around moon crew described burn as being longest four minutes of their lives if burn had not lasted exactly correct amount of time spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even been flung off into space if it had lasted too long they could have struck moon after making sure spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at moon which they would orbit for next 20 hours on earth mission control continued to wait if crew had not burned engine or burn had not lasted planned length of time crew would have appeared early from behind moon exactly at calculated moment however signal was received from spacecraft indicating it was in a orbit around moon after reporting on status of spacecraft lovell gave first description of what lunar surface looked like thumb a portion of lunar far side as seen from apollo8 lovell continued to describe terrain they were passing over one of crew s major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on moon especially one in mare that was planned as apollo 11 landing site launch time of apollo8 had been chosen to give best lighting conditions for examining site a film camera had been set up in one of spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of moon below bill anders spent much of next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest by end of mission crew had taken over eight hundred 70 mm still photographs and of 16 mm movie film throughout hour that spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how data for sps looked he wanted to make sure that engine was working and could be used to return early to earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a go no go decision before they passed behind moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of moon crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of lunar surface anders described craters that they were passing over at end of this second orbit they performed an 11 second loi 2 burn of sps to circularize orbit to throughout next two orbits crew continued to check spacecraft and to observe and photograph moon during third pass borman read a small prayer for his church he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st christopher s episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to apollo8 flight he was unable to attend a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during service earthrise when spacecraft came out from behind moon for its fourth pass across front crew witnessed an earthrise in person for first time in human history nasa s lunar orbiter 1 had taken first picture of an earthrise from vicinity of moon on august 23 1966 anders saw earth emerging from behind lunar horizon and called in excitement to others taking a black and white photograph as he did so anders asked lovell for color film and then took earthrise a now famous color photo later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of century due to synchronous rotation of moon about earth earthrise is not generally visible from lunar surface this is because as seen from any one place on moon s surface earth remains in approximately same position in lunar sky either above or below horizon earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting moon and at selected surface locations near moon s limb where libration carries earth slightly above and below lunar horizon left thumb apollo 8 genesis reading anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of spacecraft so that borman could rest despite difficulty resting in cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night s sleep in over three days he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that rest of flight plan regarding observing moon be scrubbed anders initially protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed anders finally agreed under condition that borman would set up camera to continue to take automatic pictures of moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted crew to be alert for next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at helm as they rounded moon for ninth time astronauts began second television transmission borman introduced crew followed by each man giving his impression of lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that crew had a message for all those on earth each man on board read a section from biblical creation story from book of genesis borman finished broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth his message appeared to sum up feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit borman said and from crew of apollo8 we close with good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of you all of you on good earth ch 20 9 only task left for crew at this point was to perform trans earth injection tei which was scheduled for hours after end of television transmission tei was most critical burn of flight as any failure of sps to ignite would strand crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape as with previous burn crew had to perform maneuver above far side of moon out of contact with earth burn occurred exactly on time spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re emerged from behind moon at 89 hours 28 minutes and 39 seconds exact time calculated when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly current capcom replied that s affirmative you are best ones to know spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december 25 christmas day unplanned manual realignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering module to view various stars by using computer keyboard however he accidentally erased some of computer s memory which caused inertial measurement unit imu to contain data indicating that module was in same relative orientation it had been in before lift off imu then fired thrusters to correct module s attitude once crew realized why computer had changed module s attitude they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell computer module s actual orientation it took lovell ten minutes to figure out right numbers using thrusters to get stars rigel and sirius aligned and another 15 minutes to enter corrected data into computer sixteen months later during apollo 13 mission lovell would have to perform a similar manual realignment under more critical conditions after module s imu had to be turned off to conserve energy cruise back to earth and reentry thumb left reentry december 27 1968 photographed from a kc 135 stratotanker at 40 000 feet alt white streaks of light with bright spots on right side of them fill bottom of frame a larger yellow tinted sphere with a streak is in center of frame background is black space cruise back to earth was mostly a time for crew to relax and monitor spacecraft as long as trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly spacecraft would reenter earth s atmosphere two and half days after tei and splash down in pacific on christmas afternoon crew made their fifth television broadcast this time they gave a tour of spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they finished broadcasting they found a small present from slayton in food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in same kind of pack given to troops in vietnam another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy which borman ordered crew to leave alone until after they landed they remained unopened even years after flight there were also small presents to crew from their wives next day at about 124 hours into mission sixth and final tv transmission showed mission s best video images of earth during a four minute broadcast after two uneventful days crew prepared for reentry computer would control reentry and all crew had to do was put spacecraft in correct attitude with blunt end forward in event of computer failure borman was ready to take over separation from service module prepared command module for reentry by exposing heat shield and shedding unneeded mass service module would burn up in atmosphere as planned six minutes before they hit top of atmosphere crew saw moon rising above earth s horizon just as had been calculated by trajectory specialists as module hit thin outer atmosphere crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around spacecraft spacecraft started slowing down and deceleration peaked at with computer controlling descent by changing attitude of spacecraft apollo8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to ocean at drogue parachute deployed stabilizing spacecraft followed at by three main parachutes spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in north pacific ocean southwest of hawaii at 15 51 42 utc on december 27 1968 thumb left crew of apollo8

position as they were buffeted by a swell borman was sick waiting for three flotation balloons to right spacecraft about six minutes after splashdown command module was righted into a normal apex up orientation by its inflatable bag system first frogman from aircraft carrier arrived 43 minutes after splashdown forty five minutes later crew was safe on flight deck of yorktown legacy historical importance apollo 8 came at end of 1968 a year that had seen much upheaval in united states and most of world even though year saw political assassinations political unrest in streets of europe and america and prague spring time magazine chose crew of apollo8 as its men of year for 1968 recognizing them as people who most influenced events in preceding year they had been first people ever to leave gravitational influence of earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even crew themselves had rated as having only a fifty fifty chance of fully succeeding effect of apollo8 was summed up in a telegram from a stranger received by borman after mission that stated simply thank you apollo8 you saved 1968 one of most famous aspects of flight was earthrise picture that crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of moon this was first time that humans had taken such a picture while actually behind camera and it has been credited as one of inspirations of first earth day in 1970 it was selected as first of life magazine s 100 photographs that changed world thumb left apollo 8 astronauts return to houston after their mission apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said eight s momentous historic significance was foremost while space historian robert k poole saw apollo8 as most historically significant of all apollo missions mission was most widely covered by media since first american orbital flight mercury atlas 6 by john glenn in 1962 there were 1 200 journalists covering mission with bbc s coverage broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov chairman of soviet program who described flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and
