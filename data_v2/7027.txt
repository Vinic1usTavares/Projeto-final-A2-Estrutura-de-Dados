theodore john kaczynski born may 22 1942 also known as unabomber is an american domestic terrorist anarchist and former mathematics professor he was a mathematics prodigy but he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle between 1978 and 1995 he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology in conjunction with this effort he issued a social critique opposing industrialization while advocating a nature centered form of anarchism in 1971 kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near lincoln montana where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self sufficient he witnessed destruction of wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable he began his bombing campaign in 1978 in 1995 he sent a letter to new york times and promised to desist from terrorism if times or washington post published his essay industrial society and its future in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large scale organization kaczynski was subject of longest and most expensive investigation in history of federal bureau of investigation fbi before his identity was known fbi used acronym unabom university and airline bomber to refer to his case which resulted in media naming him unabomber fbi and attorney general janet reno pushed for publication of industrial society and its future which led to a tip from kaczynski s brother david who recognized writing style after his arrest in 1996 kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid death penalty as he did not believe that he was insane in 1998 a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole early life childhood theodore john kaczynski was born on may 22 1942 in chicago illinois to working class second generation polish americans wanda theresa nee and theodore richard kaczynski a sausage maker his parents told his younger brother david kaczynski that ted had been a happy baby until severe hives forced him into hospital isolation with limited contact with others after which he showed little emotion for months wanda recalled ted recoiling from a picture of himself as an infant being held down by physicians examining his hives she said he showed sympathy to animals who were in cages or otherwise helpless which she speculated stemmed from his experience in hospital isolation from first to fourth grade kaczynski attended sherman elementary school in chicago where administrators described him as healthy and well adjusted in 1952 three years after david was born family moved to southwest suburban evergreen park illinois ted transferred to evergreen park central junior high school after testing scored his iq at 167 he skipped sixth grade kaczynski later described this as a pivotal event previously he had socialized with his peers and was even a leader but after skipping ahead he felt he did not fit in with older children and was bullied neighbors in evergreen park later described kaczynski family as civic minded folks with one stating that parents sacrificed everything they had for their children both ted and david were intelligent but ted stood out in particular one neighbor said she had never known anyone who had a brain like he did while another said that ted was strictly a loner who didn t play an old man before his time his mother recalled ted as a shy child who would become unresponsive if pressured into a social situation at one point she was so worried about ted s social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by bruno bettelheim she decided against it after observing bettelheim s abrupt and cold manner in 1990 ted s father theodore suffering from terminal cancer committed suicide with a 22 caliber rifle theodore spent his last days with his family members showing them affection as an implicit farewell high school kaczynski attended evergreen park community high school where he excelled academically he played trombone in marching band and was a member of mathematics biology coin and german clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates in 1996 a former classmate said he was never really seen as a person as an individual personality he was always regarded as a walking brain so to speak during this period kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics spending hours studying and solving advanced problems he became associated with a group of boys interested in science and mathematics known as briefcase boys for their penchant for carrying briefcases one member of this group recalled kaczynski as smartest kid in class just quiet and shy until you got to know him once he knew you he could talk and talk throughout high school kaczynski was ahead of his classmates academically placed in a more advanced mathematics class he soon mastered material he skipped eleventh grade and by attending summer school he graduated at age 15 he was one of his school s five national merit finalists and was encouraged to apply to harvard college he entered harvard on a scholarship in 1958 at age of 16 a classmate later said that kaczynski was emotionally unprepared they packed him up and sent him to harvard before he was ready he didn t even have a driver s license harvard college during his first year at harvard kaczynski lived at 8 prescott street which was designed to accommodate youngest most precocious freshmen in a small intimate living space for next three years he lived at eliot house one of his there recalled that he avoided contact with others and would just rush through suite go into his room and slam door another said kaczynski was reserved but regarded him as a genius it s just an ted was brilliant other students stated kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply an eliot house resident who dined with kaczynski at times called him very quiet but personable he would enter into discussions maybe a little less so than most but he was certainly friendly kaczynski earned his bachelor of arts degree in mathematics from harvard in 1962 he finished with an above average 3 12 gpa psychological study as a sophomore kaczynski participated in a study described by author alston chase as a purposely brutalizing psychological experiment led by harvard psychologist henry murray subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney who in a later session would confront and belittle vehement sweeping and personally abusive content of essays as ammunition while electrodes monitored subject s physiological reactions these encounters were filmed and subjects expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly experiment lasted three years with someone verbally abusing and humiliating kaczynski each week kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of study kaczynski s lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to his participation in murray s study some sources have suggested that murray s experiments were part of project mkultra central intelligence agency s research into mind control chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated kaczynski s criminal activities mathematics career thumb kaczynski as an assistant professor at uc berkeley in 1967 alt a man in a suit faces camera while he stands in front of a building in 1962 kaczynski enrolled at university of michigan where he earned his master s and doctoral degrees in mathematics in 1964 and 1967 respectively michigan was not his first choice for postgraduate education he had also applied to university of california berkeley and university of chicago both of which accepted him but offered him no teaching position or financial aid michigan offered him an annual grant of 2 310 equivalent to 19 343 in 2018 and a teaching post at university of michigan kaczynski specialized in complex analysis specifically geometric function theory his intellect and drive impressed his professors he was an unusual person he was not like other graduate students he was much more focused about his work he had a drive to discover mathematical truth said professor peter duren it is not enough to say he was smart said george another of his michigan mathematics professors at michigan kaczynski earned 5 bs and 12 as in his 18 courses however in 2006 he said his memories of university of michigan are not pleasant fact that i not only passed my courses except one physics course but got quite a few as shows how low standards were at michigan in 1967 kaczynski s dissertation boundary functions won sumner b myers prize for michigan s best mathematics dissertation of year allen shields his doctoral advisor called it best i have ever directed and maxwell reade a member of his dissertation committee said i would guess that maybe 10 or 12 men in country understood or appreciated it kaczynski published two journal articles related to his dissertation and three more after leaving michigan in late 1967 25 year old kaczynski became youngest assistant professor of mathematics in history of university of california berkeley where he taught undergraduate courses in geometry and calculus his teaching evaluations suggest he was not well liked by his students he seemed uncomfortable teaching taught straight from textbook and refused to answer questions without any explanation kaczynski resigned on june 30 1969 at time chairman of mathematics department j w addison called this a sudden and unexpected resignation in 1996 vice chairman at berkeley calvin c moore said given kaczynski s impressive dissertation and publications he could have advanced up ranks and been a senior member of faculty today a 1996 los angeles times article stated field that kaczynski worked in doesn t really exist today according to mathematicians interviewed about his work most of its theories were proven in 1960s when kaczynski worked in it according to mathematician donald rung kaczynski probably would have gone on to some other area if he were to stay in mathematics life in montana thumb right kaczynski s cabin on display at newseum in washington d c alt interior of a wooden cabin after resigning from berkeley kaczynski moved to his parents home in lombard illinois then two years later in 1971 to a remote cabin he had built outside lincoln montana where he could live a simple life with little money and without electricity or running water working odd jobs and receiving some financial support from his family his original goal was to become self sufficient so that he could live autonomously he taught himself survival skills such as tracking game edible plant identification organic farming bow drilling and other primitive technologies he used an old bicycle to get to town and a volunteer at local library said he visited frequently to read classic works in their original languages other lincoln residents said later that such a lifestyle was not unusual in area kaczynski decided it was impossible to live peacefully in nature because of destruction of wildland around his cabin by real estate development and industrial projects in response he began performing acts of sabotage against nearby developments in 1975 and dedicated himself to reading about sociology and political philosophy such as works of jacques ellul in an interview after his arrest he recalled being shocked on a hike to one of his favorite wild spots in that 1999 interview he described his loss of faith in potential for reform he decided that human tendency to take path of least resistance meant that violent collapse was only way to bring down industrial technological system bombings thumb an fbi reproduction of one of kaczynski s bombs on display at newseum in washington d c alt a bomb with wires in a wooden box between 1978 and 1995 kaczynski mailed or hand delivered a series of increasingly sophisticated bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured 23 others in all 16 bombs were attributed to kaczynski while bombing devices varied widely through years all but first few contained initials fc which kaczynski later said stood for freedom club inscribed on parts inside he purposely left misleading clues in devices and took extreme care in preparing them to avoid leaving fingerprints latent fingerprints on some of devices did not match those found on letters attributed to kaczynski initial bombings kaczynski s first mail bomb was directed at buckley crist a professor of materials engineering at northwestern university on may 25 1978 a package bearing crist s return address was found in a parking lot at university of illinois at chicago package was returned to crist who was suspicious because he had not sent package so he contacted campus police officer terry marker opened package which exploded and injured his left hand kaczynski had returned to illinois for may 1978 bombing and stayed there for a time to work with his father and brother at a foam rubber factory however in august 1978 he was fired by his brother for writing insulting limericks about a female supervisor whom he had briefly courted female supervisor later recalled kaczynski as intelligent quiet but remembered little of their acquaintance and firmly denied they had had any romantic relationship fbi involvement initial 1978 bombing was followed by bombs sent to airline officials and in 1979 a bomb was placed in cargo hold of american airlines flight 444 a boeing 727 flying from chicago to washington d c a faulty timing mechanism prevented bomb from exploding but it released smoke which forced an emergency landing authorities said it had enough power to obliterate plane had it exploded as bombing an airliner is a federal crime federal bureau of investigation became involved designating case unabom for university and airline bomber kaczynski left false clues in every bomb which he made hard to find to make them believable first clue was a metal plate stamped with initials fc hidden somewhere usually in pipe end cap in every bomb another clue included a note left in a bomb that did not detonate it read wu it works i told you it would rv another clue was eugene o neill 1 stamps used to send his boxes he sent one bomb embedded in a copy of sloan wilson s novel ice brothers fbi theorized that kaczynski had a theme of nature trees and wood in his crimes he often included bits of tree branch and bark in his bombs and targets selected included percy wood and professor leroy wood crime writer robert graysmith noted that his obsession with wood was a large factor graysmith robert unabomber a desire to kill 1997 berkely publishing later bombings first serious injury occurred in 1985 when john hauser a graduate student and captain in united states air force lost four fingers and vision in one eye bomb like others of kaczynski s was handcrafted and made with wooden parts hugh scrutton a 38 year old sacramento california computer store owner was killed in 1985 by a nail and splinter loaded bomb placed in parking lot of his store a similar attack against a computer store occurred in salt lake city utah on february 20 1987 bomb which was disguised as a piece of lumber injured gary wright when he attempted to remove it from store s parking lot explosion severed nerves in wright s left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body in 1993 after a six year break kaczynski mailed a bomb to david gelernter a computer science professor at yale university though critically injured gelernter recovered in same weekend kaczynski mailed a bomb to home of charles epstein from university of california san francisco who lost several fingers upon opening it kaczynski then called gelernter s brother joel gelernter a behavioral geneticist and told him you are next geneticist phillip sharp at massachusetts institute of technology received a threatening letter two years later in 1994 burson marsteller executive thomas j mosser was killed by a mail bomb sent to his home in north caldwell new jersey in another letter to new york times kaczynski said he blew up thomas mosser because burston marsteller helped exxon clean up its public image after exxon valdez incident and more importantly because its business is development of techniques for manipulating people s attitudes this was followed by 1995 murder

education of unabomber and origins of modern terrorism w w norton company incorporated p 84 google book search retrieved may 19 2011 be printed verbatim by a major newspaper he stated that if this demand was met he would desist from terrorism there was controversy as to whether essay should be published but attorney general janet reno and fbi director louis freeh recommended its publication out of concern for public safety and in hope that a reader could identify author bob guccione of penthouse volunteered to publish it but kaczynski replied that penthouse was less respectable than other publications he said that he would reserve right to plant one and only one bomb intended to kill after our manuscript has been published new york times and washington post both published essay on september 19 1995 style kaczynski wrote document on a typewriter without italics he capitalizes entire words to show emphasis he always refers to himself as either we or fc freedom club though there is no evidence that he worked with others academic donald wayne foster analyzed writing at request of kaczynski s defense team and he noted that it contains irregular spelling and and other linguistic idiosyncrasies which led him to conclude that kaczynski was its author summary industrial society and its future begins with kaczynski s assertion industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for human race he writes that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society has made life unfulfilling and has caused widespread psychological suffering he argues that most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits because of technological advances he calls these surrogate activities wherein people strive toward artificial goals including scientific work consumption of entertainment and following sports teams he predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted to meet needs of social systems rather than vice versa he believes that technological progress can be stopped unlike people who understand technology s negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable he calls for a return to wild nature kaczynski argues that erosion of human freedom is a natural product of an industrial society because system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function and that reform of system is impossible because changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt system however he states that system has not yet fully achieved control over human behavior and is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival he predicts that if system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough it will probably survive otherwise it will break down and that issue will most likely be resolved within next several decades say 40 to 100 years he states that task of those who oppose industrial society is to promote social stress and instability and to propagate an ideology that opposes technology one that offers counter ideal of nature in order to gain enthusiastic support a revolution against technology may be possible when industrial society is sufficiently unstable throughout document kaczynski addresses left wing politics as a movement he defines leftists as mainly socialists collectivists politically correct types feminists gay and disability activists animal rights activists and like states that leftism is driven primarily by feelings of inferiority and oversocialization and derides leftism as one of most widespread manifestations of craziness of our world he additionally states that a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists as in his view leftism is in long run inconsistent with wild nature with human freedom and with elimination of modern technology he also criticizes conservatives describing them as fools who whine about decay of traditional values yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth reception alston chase reported in atlantic that text was greeted in 1995 by many thoughtful people as a work of genius or at least profundity and as quite sane chase argued however that it is work of neither a genius nor a maniac its pessimism over direction of civilization and its rejection of modern world are shared especially with country s most highly educated ucla political science professor james q wilson was mentioned in manifesto he wrote in new yorker that industrial society and its future was a carefully reasoned artfully written paper if it is work of a madman then writings of many political philosophers are scarcely more sane david skrbina a philosophy professor at university of michigan and a former green party candidate for governor of michigan has written several essays in support of kaczynski s ideas one which is titled a revolutionary for our times paul a former deputy editor of ecologist and a co founder of dark mountain project wrote an essay for orion magazine in which he described kaczynski s arguments as worryingly convincing and stated that they may change my life psychiatrist keith stated on fox news that kaczynski was reprehensible for murdering and maiming people but precisely correct in many of his ideas and he compared industrial society and its future to aldous huxley s brave new world and george orwell s nineteen eighty four anarcho primitivist authors such as john zerzan and john moore came to kaczynski s defense while also holding reservations about his actions and ideas influences manifesto echoed contemporary critics of technology and industrialization such as john zerzan jacques ellul rachel carson lewis mumford and e f schumacher its idea of disruption of power process similarly echoed social critics emphasizing lack of meaningful work as a primary cause of social problems including mumford paul goodman and eric hoffer its general theme was also addressed by aldous huxley s brave new world to which kaczynski refers in text kaczynski s ideas of oversocialization and surrogate activities recall sigmund freud s civilization and its discontents and its theories of rationalization and sublimation a term which kaczynski uses three times to describe surrogate activities bill joy co founder of sun microsystems wrote that kaczynski is clearly a luddite but simply saying this does not dismiss his argument anders behring breivik perpetrator of 2011 norway attacks published a manifesto and copied large portions from industrial society and its future with certain terms substituted e g replacing leftists with cultural marxists and over twenty years after kaczynski s imprisonment his views have inspired online communities of primitivists and neo luddites one explanation for renewal of interest in his views is television series manhunt unabomber which aired in 2017 kaczynski is also frequently referenced by online other works university of michigan dearborn philosophy professor david skrbina helped to compile kaczynski s work into 2010 anthology technological slavery including original manifesto letters between skrbina and kaczynski and other essays kaczynski updated his 1995 manifesto as anti tech revolution why and how to address advances in computers and internet he advocates practicing other types of protest and makes no mention of violence investigation thumb right famous composite sketch of unabomber created by jeanne boylan alt a pencil sketch of a man wearing a hood and sunglasses with a mustache because of material used to make mail bombs suspect was labeled junkyard bomber by u s postal inspectors who initially had responsibility for case fbi inspector terry d turchie was appointed to run unabom investigation in 1979 an fbi led task force that included 125 agents from fbi bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms atf and u s postal inspection service was formed task force grew to more than 150 full time personnel but minute analysis of recovered components of bombs and investigation into lives of victims proved of little use in identifying suspect who built his bombs primarily from scrap materials available almost anywhere victims investigators later learned were chosen irregularly from library research in 1980 chief agent john douglas working with agents in fbi s behavioral sciences unit issued a psychological profile of unidentified bomber it described offender as a man with above average intelligence and connections to academia this profile was later refined to characterize offender as a neo luddite holding an academic degree in hard sciences but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 an alternative theory was developed by fbi analysts that concentrated on physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments in this rival profile suspect was characterized as a blue collar airplane mechanic a 1 800 hotline was set up by unabom task force to take calls related to investigation with a 1 million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to unabomber s capture before publication of industrial society and its future ted s brother david kaczynski was encouraged by his wife to follow up on suspicions that ted was unabomber david was dismissive at first but he began to take likelihood more seriously after reading manifesto a week after it was published in september 1995 he searched through old family papers and found letters dating to 1970s that ted had sent to newspapers to protest abuses of technology using phrasing similar to manifesto before manifesto s publication fbi held many press conferences asking public to help identify unabomber they were convinced that bomber was from chicago area where he began his bombings had worked in or had some connection to salt lake city and by 1990s had some association with san francisco bay area this geographical information as well as wording in excerpts from manifesto that were released before entire text of manifesto was published persuaded david s wife to urge her husband to read manifesto after publication after manifesto was published fbi received over a thousand calls a day for months in response to its offer of a 1 million reward for information leading to identification of unabomber many letters claiming to be from unabomber were also sent to unabom task force and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed while fbi was occupied with new leads kaczynski s brother david hired private investigator susan swanson in chicago to investigate ted s activities discreetly david later hired washington d c attorney tony bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by swanson and make contact with fbi given presumed difficulty of attracting fbi s attention david wanted to protect his brother from danger of an fbi raid such as ruby ridge or waco siege since he feared a violent outcome from any attempt by fbi to contact his brother in early 1996 former fbi hostage negotiator and criminal profiler clinton r van zandt was contacted by an investigator working with bisceglie bisceglie asked van zandt to compare manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters david had received from his brother van zandt s initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that same person had written manifesto which had been in public circulation for half a year van zandt s second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood he recommended that bisceglie s client immediately contact fbi in february 1996 bisceglie gave a copy of 1971 essay written by ted kaczynski to molly flynn at fbi she forwarded essay to san francisco based task force fbi profiler james r fitzgerald recognized similarities in writings using linguistic analysis and determined that author of essays and manifesto were almost certainly same combined with facts gleaned from bombings and kaczynski s life analysis provided basis for a search warrant signed by terry turchie head of entire investigation david kaczynski had tried to remain anonymous but he was soon identified and within a few days an fbi agent team was dispatched to interview david and his wife with their attorney in washington d c at this and subsequent meetings david provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes allowing fbi task force to use postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of ted s activities david developed a respectful relationship with behavioral analysis special agent kathleen m puckett whom he met many times in washington d c texas chicago and schenectady new york over nearly two months before federal search warrant was served on kaczynski s cabin david had once admired and emulated his older brother but later decided to leave survivalist lifestyle behind he had received assurances from fbi that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in but his identity was leaked to cbs news in early april 1996 cbs anchorman dan rather called fbi director louis freeh who requested 24 hours before cbs broke story on evening news fbi scrambled to finish search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in montana afterwards an internal leak investigation was conducted by fbi but source of leak was never identified fbi officials were not unanimous in identifying ted as author of manifesto search warrant noted that numerous experts believed manifesto had been written by another individual arrest fbi agents arrested kaczynski on april 3 1996 at his cabin where he was found in an unkempt state a search of his cabin revealed a cache of bomb components 40 000 hand written journal pages that included bomb making experiments descriptions of unabomber crimes and one live bomb ready for mailing they also found what appeared to be original typed manuscript of industrial society and its future by this point unabomber had been target of most expensive investigation in fbi history after his capture theories emerged naming kaczynski as zodiac killer among links that raised suspicion was fact that kaczynski lived in san francisco bay area from 1967 to 1969 same period that most of zodiac s confirmed killings occurred in california that both individuals were highly intelligent with an interest in bombs and codes and that both wrote letters to newspapers demanding publication of their works with threat of continued violence if demand was not met however kaczynski s whereabouts could not be verified for all of killings and gun and knife murders committed by zodiac killer differ from kaczynski s bombings so he was not further pursued as a suspect robert graysmith author of 1986 book zodiac said similarities are fascinating but purely coincidental early hunt for unabomber portrayed a perpetrator far different from eventual suspect industrial society and its future consistently uses we and our throughout and at one point in 1993 investigators sought an individual whose first name was nathan because name was imprinted on envelope of a letter sent to media when case was presented to public authorities denied that there was ever anyone other than kaczynski involved in crimes guilty plea a federal grand jury indicted kaczynski in april 1996 on ten counts of illegally transporting mailing and using bombs and three counts of murder kaczynski s lawyers headed by montana federal public defenders michael and judy clarke attempted to enter an insanity defense to avoid death penalty but kaczynski rejected this strategy on january 8 1998 he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire tony serra as his counsel serra had agreed not to use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on kaczynski s anti technology views this request was unsuccessful and kaczynski subsequently tried to commit suicide by hanging on january 9 several though not all forensic psychiatrists and psychologists who examined kaczynski diagnosed him as having paranoid schizophrenia forensic psychiatrist park dietz said kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or personality disorder in his 2010 book technological slavery kaczynski said that two prison psychologists who visited him frequently for four years told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and diagnosis was ridiculous and a political diagnosis on january 21 1998 kaczynski was declared competent to stand trial despite psychiatric diagnoses as he was fit to stand trial prosecutors sought death penalty but kaczynski avoided that by pleading guilty to all charges on january 22 1998 and accepting life imprisonment without possibility of parole he later tried to withdraw this plea arguing it was involuntary judge garland ellis burrell jr denied his request and united states court of appeals for ninth circuit upheld that decision in 2006 burrell ordered that items from kaczynski s cabin be sold at a reasonably advertised internet auction items considered to be bomb making materials such as diagrams and recipes for bombs were excluded net proceeds went towards 15 million in restitution
