self harm also known as self injury is defined as intentional direct injuring of body tissue done without intent to commit suicide other terms such as cutting and self mutilation have been used for any self harming behavior regardless of suicidal intent most common form of self harm is using a sharp object to cut one s skin other forms include behaviour such as burning scratching or hitting body parts while older definitions included behaviour such as interfering with wound healing excessive skin picking hair pulling trichotillomania and ingestion of toxic substances or objects as self harm in current terminology those are differentiated from term self harm behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are not considered self harm because resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect although suicide is not intention of self harm relationship between self harm and suicide is complex as self harming behaviour may be potentially life threatening there is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self harm and self harm is found in 40 60 of suicides however generalising individuals who self harm to be suicidal is in majority of cases inaccurate desire to self harm is a common symptom of some personality disorders people with other mental disorders may also self harm including those with depression anxiety disorders substance abuse eating disorders post traumatic stress disorder schizophrenia and dissociative disorders studies also provide strong support for a self punishment function and modest evidence for anti dissociation interpersonal influence anti suicide sensation seeking and interpersonal boundaries functions self harm can also occur in high functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis motivations for self harm vary some use it as a coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety depression stress emotional numbness or a sense of failure see impression formation self harm is often associated with a history of trauma including emotional and sexual abuse there are a number of different methods that can be used to treat self harm and which concentrate on either treating underlying causes or on treating behaviour itself when self harm is associated with depression antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective other approaches involve avoidance techniques which focus on keeping individual occupied with other activities or replacing act of self harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage self harm is most common between ages of 12 and 24 self harm is more common in females than males with this risk being five times greater in 12 15 age group self harm in childhood is relatively rare but rate has been increasing since 1980s self harm can also occur in elderly population risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self harm captive animals such as birds and monkeys are also known to participate in self harming behaviour classification self harm sh also referred to as self injury si self inflicted violence siv nonsuicidal self injury nssi or self injurious behaviour are different terms to ascribe behaviours where demonstrable injury is self inflicted behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent most common form of self harm involves cutting of skin using a sharp object e g a knife or razor blade term self mutilation is also sometimes used although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome inaccurate or offensive self inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat this differs from common definition of self harm as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose a broader definition of self harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating older literature has used several different terms for this reason research in past decades has inconsistently focused on self harming behavior without and with suicidal intent including suicide attempts with varying definitions leading to inconsistent and unclear results nonsuicidal self injury nssi has been listed as a proposed disorder in dsm 5 under category conditions for further study it is noted that this proposal of diagnostic criteria for a future diagnosis is not an officially approved diagnosis and may not be used for clinical use but is meant for research purposes only disorder is defined as intentional self inflicted injury without intent of committing suicide criteria for nssi include five or more days of self inflicted harm over course of one year without suicidal intent and individual must have been motivated by seeking relief from a negative state resolving an interpersonal difficulty or achieving a positive state a common belief regarding self harm is that it is an attention seeking behaviour however in many cases this is inaccurate many self harmers are very self conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour leading them to go to great lengths to conceal their behaviour from others they may offer alternative explanations for their injuries or conceal their scars with clothing self harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para suicidal behaviour people who self harm are not usually seeking to end their own life it has been suggested instead that they are using self harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress alternatively interpretations based on supposed lethality of a self harm may not give clear indications as to its intent seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt whereas life threatening damage may have been done without intent to die studies of individuals with developmental disabilities such as intellectual disability have shown self harm being dependent on environmental factors such as obtaining attention or escape from demands some individuals may have dissociation harboring a desire to feel real or to fit into society s rules signs and symptoms eighty percent of self harm involves stabbing or cutting skin with a sharp object however number of self harm methods are only limited by an individual s inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves this includes burning self poisoning alcohol abuse self embedding of objects hair pulling bruising hitting one s self scratching to hurt one s self knowingly abusing over counter or prescription drugs and forms of self harm related to anorexia and bulimia locations of self harm are often areas of body that are easily hidden and concealed from detection of others as well as defining self harm in terms of act of damaging body it may be more accurate to define self harm in terms of intent and emotional distress that person is attempting to deal with neither dsm iv tr nor icd 10 provide diagnostic criteria for self harm it is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder though many people who self harm would like this to be addressed common signs that a person may be engaging in self harm include following they ensure that there are always harmful objects close by they are experiencing difficulties in their personal relationships their behaviour becomes unpredictable they question their worth and identity they make statements that display helplessness and hopelessness mayo clinic staff 2017 self injury cutting online available at https www org diseases conditions self injury symptoms causes accessed on 15 november 2017 cause mental disorder thumb according to legend of st adelphus a knight was struck with insanity and forced to devour his own hand after having tried to break saint s sarcophagus tapestry early 16th century eglise saint pierre et saint paul les saverne france although some people who self harm do not have any form of recognised mental disorder many people experiencing various forms of mental illnesses do have a higher risk of self harm key areas of disorder which exhibit an increased risk include autism spectrum disorders borderline personality disorder dissociative disorders bipolar disorder depression phobias and conduct disorders schizophrenia may also be a contributing factor for self harm those diagnosed with schizophrenia have a high risk of suicide which is particularly greater in younger patients as they may not have an insight into serious effects that disorder can have on their lives gelder m et al 2005 psychiatry new york oxford university press p 171 substance abuse is also considered a risk factor as are some personal characteristics such as poor problem solving skills and impulsivity there are parallels between self harm and munchausen syndrome a psychiatric disorder in which individuals feign illness or trauma there may be a common ground of inner distress culminating in self directed harm in a munchausen patient however a desire to deceive medical personnel in order to gain treatment and attention is more important in munchausen s than in self harm psychological factors abuse during childhood is accepted as a primary social factor increasing incidence of self harm as is bereavement and troubled parental or partner relationships factors such as war poverty and unemployment may also contribute other predictors of self harm and suicidal behavior include feelings of entrapment defeat lack of belonging and perceiving oneself as a burden along with less effective social problem solving skills self harm is frequently described as an experience of or a dissociative state d 2008 psychiatric nursing biological and behavioral concepts 2nd edition canada thompson delmar learning as many as 70 of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self harm an estimated 30 of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self harm at some point including eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging onset of puberty has also been shown to be onset of self harm including onset of sexual activity this is because pubertal period is a period of neurodevelopmental vulnerability and comes with an increased risk of emotional disorders and risk taking behaviors genetics most distinctive characteristic of rare genetic condition lesch syndrome is self harm and may include biting and head banging genetics may contribute to risk of developing other psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression which could in turn lead to self harming behaviour however link between genetics and self harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive drugs and alcohol substance misuse dependence and withdrawal are associated with self harm benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self harming behaviour in young people alcohol is a major risk factor for self harm a study which analysed self harm presentations to emergency rooms in northern ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63 8 of self harm presentations a recent study in relation between cannabis use and deliberate self harm dsh in norway and england found that in general cannabis use may not be a specific risk factor for dsh in young adolescents smoking has also been associated with self harm in adolescents one study found that suicide attempts were four times higher for adolescents that smoke than for those that do not pathophysiology right thumb a flow chart of two theories of self harm self harm is not typically suicidal behaviour although there is possibility that a self inflicted injury may result in life threatening damage although person may not recognise connection self harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way motivations for self harm vary as it may be used to fulfill a number of different functions these functions include self harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety depression stress emotional numbness and a sense of failure or self loathing there is also a positive statistical correlation between self harm and emotional abuse self harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain in contrast to pain experienced earlier in person s life of which they had no control over e g through abuse other motives for self harm do not fit into models of behaviour and may seem incomprehensible to others as demonstrated by this quotation my motivations for self harming were diverse but included examining interior of my arms for hydraulic lines this may sound strange assessment of motives in a medical setting is usually based on precursors to incident circumstances and information from patient however limited studies show that professional assessments tend to suggest more manipulative or punitive motives than personal assessments uk ons study reported only two motives to draw attention and because of anger for some people harming themselves can be a means of drawing attention to need for help and to ask for assistance in an indirect way it may also be an attempt to affect others and to manipulate them in some way emotionally however those with chronic repetitive self harm often do not want attention and hide their scars carefully many people who self harm state that it allows them to go away or dissociate separating mind from feelings that are causing anguish this may be achieved by tricking mind into believing that present suffering being felt is caused by self harm instead of issues they were facing previously physical pain therefore acts as a distraction from original emotional pain to complement this theory one can consider need to stop feeling emotional pain and mental agitation a person may be hyper sensitive and overwhelmed a great many thoughts may be revolving within their mind and they may either become triggered or could make a decision to stop overwhelming feelings alternatively self harm may be a means of feeling something even if sensation is unpleasant and painful those who self harm sometimes describe feelings of emptiness or numbness anhedonia and physical pain may be a relief from these feelings a person may be detached from themselves detached from life numb and unfeeling they may then recognise need to function more or have a desire to feel real again and a decision is made to create sensation and wake up those who engage in self harm face contradictory reality of harming themselves while at same time obtaining relief from this act it may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting but they often do because they know relief that will follow for some self harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from beta endorphins released in brain endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury acting as natural painkillers and inducing pleasant feelings and in response to self harm would act to reduce tension and emotional distress many self harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self harming and for some deliberate self harm may become a means of seeking pleasure as a coping mechanism self harm can become psychologically addictive because to self harmer it works it enables them to deal with intense stress in current moment patterns sometimes created by it such as specific time intervals between acts of self harm can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self harm autonomic nervous system emotional pain activates same regions of brain as physical pain so emotional stress can be a significantly intolerable state for some people some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding autonomic nervous system is composed of two components sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation e g fight or flight response and parasympathetic nervous system controls physical processes that are automatic e g saliva production sympathetic nervous system innervates e g is physically connected to and regulates many parts of body involved in stress responses studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self injure have greater physiological reactivity e g skin conductance to stress than adolescents who do not self injure this stress response persists over time staying constant or even increasing in self injuring adolescents but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self injure treatment there is considerable uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments of people who harm themselves are most effective psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self harm and as a result self harm may be an indicator of depression and or other psychological problems many people who self harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used there is tentative evidence for medication however greater study is required before it can be recommended therapy there is no well established treatment for self injurious behaviour in children or adolescents cognitive behavioural therapy may also be used to assist those with axis i diagnoses such as depression schizophrenia and bipolar disorder dialectical behaviour therapy dbt can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self harming behaviour diagnosis and treatment of causes of self harm is thought by many to be best approach to treating self harm but in some cases particularly in people with a personality disorder this is not very effective so more clinicians are starting to take a dbt approach in order to reduce behaviour itself people who rely on habitual self harm are sometimes hospitalised based on their stability their ability and especially their willingness to get help in adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise treatments such as cbt family intervention interpersonal therapy and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self injurious behaviour in children and adolescents has not been tested as a treatment for adolescents who self harmed a meta analysis found that psychological therapy is effective in reducing self harm proportion of adolescents who self harmed over follow up period was lower in intervention groups 28 than in controls 33 psychological therapies with largest effect sizes were dialectical behaviour therapy dbt cognitive behavioural therapy cbt and based therapy mbt in individuals with developmental disabilities occurrence of self harm is often demonstrated to be related to its effects on environment such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands as developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits self harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way such as by asking one approach for treating self harm thus is to teach an alternative appropriate response which obtains same result as self harm avoidance techniques generating alternative behaviours that person can engage in instead of self harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self harm techniques aimed at keeping busy may include taking a walk participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when person has urge to harm themselves removal of objects used for self harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self harming urges provision of a card that allows person to make emergency contact with counselling services should urge to self harm arise may also help prevent act of self harm alternative and safer methods of self harm that do not lead to permanent damage for example snapping of a rubber band on wrist may also help calm urge to self harm using biofeedback may help raise self awareness of certain pre occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self harming behaviour and help identify techniques to avoid those pre occupations before they lead to self harm any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to individual s motivation and reason for harming epidemiology thumb upright 1 3 deaths from self harm per million people in 2012 thumb upright 1 3 world map showing disability adjusted life year which is a measure of each country s disease burden for self inflicted injuries per 100 000 inhabitants in 2004 it is difficult to gain an accurate picture of incidence and prevalence of self harm this is due in a part to a lack of sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system however even with sufficient resources statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self harm are undisclosed to medical profession as acts of self harm are frequently carried out in secret and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by individual recorded figures can be based on three sources psychiatric samples hospital admissions and general population surveys world health organization estimates that as of 2010 880 000 deaths occur as a result of self harm about 10 of admissions to medical wards in uk are as a result of self harm majority of which are drug overdoses however studies based only on hospital admissions may hide larger group of self harmers who do not need or seek hospital treatment for their injuries instead treating themselves many adolescents who present to general hospitals with deliberate self harm report previous episodes for which they did not receive medical attention in united states up to 4 of adults self harm with approximately 1 of population engaging in chronic or severe self harm current research suggests that rates of self harm are much higher among young people with average age of onset between 14 and 24 earliest reported incidents of self harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old in uk in 2008 rates of self harm in young people could be as high as 33 in addition there appears to be an increased risk of self harm in college students than among general population in a study of undergraduate students in us 9 8 of students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in past when definition of self harm was expanded to include head banging scratching oneself and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning 32 of sample said they had done this in ireland a study found that instances of hospital treated self harm were much higher in city and urban districts than in rural settings case child adolescent self harm in europe study suggests that life time risk of self injury is 1 7 for women and 1 25 for men sex differences in general latest aggregated research has found no difference in prevalence of self harm between men and women this is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self harm however caution is needed in seeing self harm as a greater problem for females since males may engage in different forms of self harm e g hitting themselves which could be easier to hide or explained as result of different circumstances hence there remain widely opposing views as to whether gender paradox is a real phenomenon or merely artifact of bias in data collection who euro multicentre study of suicide established in 1989 demonstrated that for each age group female rate of self harm exceeded that of males with highest rate among females in 13 24 age group and highest rate among males in 12 34 age group however this discrepancy has been known to vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria consistent with wide ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self harm in general such problems have sometimes been focus of criticism in context of broader psychosocial interpretation for example feminist author barbara has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors directly blaming medical discourse for female this gender discrepancy is often distorted in specific populations where rates of self harm are inordinately high which may have implications on significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender a study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths aged 16 19 with 72 of males and 66 of females reporting a history of self harm however in 2008 a study of young people and self harm saw gender gap widen in opposite direction with 32 of young females and 22 of young males admitting to self harm studies also indicate that males who self harm may also be at a greater risk of completing suicide there does not appear to be a difference in motivation for self harm in adolescent males and females for example for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes drugs and alcohol triggering factors such as low self esteem and having friends and family members who self harm are also common between both males and females one limited study found that among those young individuals who do self harm both genders are just as equally likely to use method of skin cutting however females who self cut are more likely than males to explain their self harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves in new zealand more females are hospitalised for intentional self harm than males females more commonly choose methods such as self poisoning that generally are not fatal but still serious enough to require hospitalisation elderly in a study of a district general hospital in uk 5 4 of all hospital s self harm cases were aged over 65 male to female ratio was 2 3 although self harm rates for males and females over 65 in local population were identical over 90 had depressive conditions and 63 had significant physical illness under 10 of patients gave a history of earlier self harm while both repetition and suicide rates were very low which could be explained by absence of factors known to be associated with repetition such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse however nice guidance on self harm in uk suggests that older people who self harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide with 1 in 5 older people who self harm going on to end their life a study completed in ireland showed that older irish adults have high rates of deliberate self harm but comparatively low rates of suicide developing world only recently have attempts to improve health in developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health deliberate self harm is common in developing world research into self harm in developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of sri lanka which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of of health annual health bulletin sri lanka 1995 colombo sri lanka ministry of health 1997 and self poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons many people admitted for deliberate self poisoning during a study by eddleston et al were young and few expressed a desire to die but death was relatively common in young in these cases improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality some of causes of deliberate self poisoning in sri lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide one way of reducing self harm would be to limit access to poisons however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds and reduction of access to these agents would be difficult great potential for reduction of self harm lies in education and prevention but limited resources in developing world make these methods challenging prison inmates deliberate self harm is especially prevalent in prison populations a proposed explanation for this is that prisons are often violent places and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self harm as a ruse either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from prison authorities diego codes of underworld princeton self harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement history thumb results of self flagellation as part of an annual religious mourning ritual muharram right thumb one of consequences of black death was practiced self flogging thumb a ritual flagellation tool known as a used in muharram observances self harm was and in some cases continues to be a ritual practice in many cultures and religions maya priesthood performed auto sacrifice by

masturbation term reappeared in an article in 1935 and a book in 1938 when karl menninger refined his conceptual definitions of self mutilation his study on self destructiveness differentiated between suicidal behaviours and self mutilation for menninger self mutilation was a non fatal expression of an attenuated death wish and thus coined term partial suicide he began a classification system of

superficial cuts and generally had borderline personality disorder diagnosis coarse cutters were older and generally psychotic ross and mckay 1979 categorized self mutilators into 9 groups cutting biting severing inserting burning ingesting or inhaling hitting and constricting after 1970s focus of self harm shifted from freudian psycho sexual drives of patients walsh and rosen 1988 created four categories numbered by roman numerals i iv defining self mutilation as rows ii iii and iv classification examples of behaviour degree of physical damage psychological state social acceptability i ear

rosenthal 1993 reviewed hundreds of studies and divided self mutilation into two categories culturally sanctioned self mutilation and deviant self mutilation favazza also created two subcategories of sanctioned self mutilations rituals and practices rituals are mutilations repeated generationally and reflect traditions symbolism and beliefs of a society p 226 practices are historically transient and cosmetic such as piercing of earlobes nose eyebrows as well as male circumcision for non jews while deviant self mutilation is equivalent to self harm adolescents and digital self harm digital self harm which according to justin w patchin and sameer hinduja is anonymous online posting sending or otherwise sharing of hurtful content about oneself is an increasingly prevalent form of self harm in modern day and age for adolescents self hate is highly prevalent in adolescent stages through recent years social media has grown and most adolescents now confront their feelings whether about themselves or about others online society for adolescent health and medicine published a nationally representative survey of 5 593 middle and high school students 12 to 17 years old obtained in 2016 study was led by justin w patchin phd and sameer hinduja phd their study digital self harm among adolescents revealed that 6 percent of students say they have themselves study also found that males were significantly more likely to report digital self harm than females with 7 1 percent for males compared with 5 3 percent for females study found correlations between digital self harm and factors such as sexual orientation prior experience with bullying drug use and depressive symptoms awareness and opposition there are many movements among general self harm community to make self harm itself and treatment better known to mental health professionals as well as general public for example march 1 is designated as self injury awareness day siad around world on this day some people choose to be more open about their own self harm and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self harm other animals self harm in non human mammals is a well established but not widely known phenomenon its study under zoo or laboratory conditions could lead to a better understanding of self harm in human patients zoo or laboratory rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self harm in higher mammals e g macaque monkeys non primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs for example pemoline clonidine amphetamine and very high toxic doses of caffeine or theophylline are known to precipitate self harm in lab animals in dogs canine obsessive compulsive disorder can lead to self inflicted injuries for example canine lick captive birds are sometimes known to engage in feather plucking causing damage to feathers that can range from feather shredding to removal of most or all feathers within bird s reach or even mutilation of skin or muscle tissue breeders of show mice have noticed similar behaviours one known as barbering involves a mouse obsessively grooming whiskers and facial fur off of themselves and cage mates other behaviours include scratching ears so severely that large sections are lost references external links information about self
