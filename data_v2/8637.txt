orphans after adoption some of soeman s characters are not identified as indigenous indonesians including nona her name being common among ethnic chinese and sir joon a eurasian this was in part a bid to attract readers of different cultural backgrounds as well as those living in singapore it also served to soften soeman s criticism in an interview soeman recalled my stories always challenged stiff adat so to show this my characters were always outsiders who could be better accepted if they went against adat that was my strategy as an author so my stories could be accepted soeman s diction in his short stories was strongly influenced by his east sumatran background with extensive malay vocabulary and less javanese influence than many contemporary writers however as with his fellow writers of poedjangga baroe generation he avoided frequently using classical malay terms such as it is told and maka thus he was critical of extensive verbosity of earlier literature instead attempting to use

short story collection kawan bergeloet his most interesting contribution to literature owing to its well observed and realistically described sketches alisjahbana meanwhile praised soeman s innovative use of malay but considered author s plotlines to be at times inconsequential and illogical with narrative acting as a child who quick as lightning shows his toys then hides them again to pique his friends curiosity he considered soeman s work best read for its entertainment value in a film commemorating soeman made by lontar foundation budianta concluded selected bibliography kasih tak terlarai
