burning after japanese attack two competing theories have arisen about cause of explosion first is that bomb detonated in or near black powder magazine used for ship s saluting guns and catapult charges this would have detonated first and then ignited smokeless powder magazines which was used for ship s main armament a 1944 navy bureau of ships report suggests that a hatch leading to black powder magazine was left open possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby naval history and heritage command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside armored magazine alternative explanation is that bomb penetrated armored decks and detonated directly inside one of starboard magazines for main armament but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate thus 14 inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite powder time elapsed from bomb hit to magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode wright pp 287 288 60 61 it seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found as surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine cause of magazine explosion
