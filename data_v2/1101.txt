lifeboats to be taken aboard olympic explosion occurred under bottom of ship approximately forward of transverse bulkhead at rear of port engine room engine room and outer compartments adjacent to it flooded immediately with water spreading more slowly to central engine room and adjoining spaces ship rapidly took on a list to port of up to 15 degrees which was reduced by counter flooding compartments on starboard side so that by 09 45 list ranged up to only nine degrees as she rolled in heavy swell light cruiser stood by while jellicoe ordered every available destroyer and tug out to assist but did not send out any battleships to tow audacious because of supposed submarine threat having intercepted stricken dreadnought s distress calls white star ocean liner arrived on scene brown pp 160 161 goldrick p 157 jellicoe p 148 thumb destroyers evacuate crewmen ship could make and dampier believed that he had a chance of making to land and beaching ship so he turned audacious south and made for lough swilly ship had covered when rising water forced abandonment of centre and starboard engine rooms and she drifted to a stop at 10 50 dampier ordered all non essential crew to be taken off boats from liverpool and olympic assisting and only 250 men were left aboard by 14 00 at 13 30 captain herbert haddock captain of olympic suggested that his ship attempt to take audacious in tow dampier agreed and with assistance of destroyer a tow line was passed 30 minutes later ships began moving but line snapped as audacious repeatedly tried to turn into wind brown p 161 goldrick p

was coming up on group at 20 45 audacious heeled sharply paused and then capsized she floated upside down with bow raised until 21 00 when an explosion occurred that threw wreckage into air followed by two more explosion appeared to come from area of b magazine and was probably caused by one or more high explosive shells falling from their racks and exploding then igniting cordite in magazine a piece of armour plate flew and killed a petty officer on liverpool this was only casualty in connection with sinking brown p 161 goldrick pp 157 158 jellicoe p 149 aftermath jellicoe immediately proposed that sinking be kept a secret to which board of admiralty and british cabinet agreed an act open to ridicule later on for rest of war audacious name remained on all public lists of ship movements and activities many americans on board olympic were beyond british jurisdiction and discussed sinking many photos and even one moving film had been taken by 19 november loss of ship was accepted in germany goldrick pp 159 160 jellicoe s opposite number in germany reinhard scheer wrote after war in case of audacious we approve of english attitude of not revealing a weakness to enemy because accurate information about other side s strength has a decisive effect on decisions taken scheer p 62 on 14 november 1918 shortly after war ended a notice officially announcing loss appeared in times a royal navy review board judged that a contributory factor in loss was that audacious was not at action stations with water tight doors locked and damage control teams ready attempts were made to use engine circulating pumps as additional bilge pumps but rapid rise of water prevented this although hatches were open at time of explosion it was claimed that all were closed before rising water reached them apart from damage to bottom of ship water was found to have spread through bulkheads because of faulty seals around pipes and valves broken pipes and hatches which did not close properly brown p 161 wreck of audacious was filmed for television show deep wreck mysteries on history channel in 2008 programme featured an investigation of wreck and circumstances of its loss by
