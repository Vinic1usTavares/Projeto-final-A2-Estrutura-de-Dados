and three scottish cup finals in same period and has also been a concert venue history rangers played its first match in may 1872 on glasgow green club then played home matches on public pitches across glasgow first moving to a regular home ground at in 1875 a year later rangers played at clydesdale cricket ground in kinning park this ground was improved to give a capacity of 7 000 but it was not owned by rangers after hints by landlords that they wished to develop site rangers left in february 1887 club shared cathkin park with third lanark for remainder of 1886 87 season rangers first moved to ibrox area later in 1887 playing on a site immediately to east of current stadium first match at this stadium was an 8 1 defeat to english side preston north end on 20 august 1887 watched by a capacity crowd of over 15 000 this inaugural match had to be abandoned after 70 minutes due to a pitch invasion first ibrox park was a success in short term as three scotland international matches and 1890 scottish cup final were played at ground celtic park built in 1892 was more advanced however rangers opted to construct a new stadium raising funds by forming a limited company last match at old ground was played on 9 december 1899 new ibrox park was formally opened with a 3 1 victory over hearts on 30 december ibrox park thumb left 200px pavilion of second ibrox park built 1899 demolished 1928 ibrox park as it was known between 1899 and 1997 is almost completely different from ibrox stadium of today it followed model of most scottish stadiums of time comprising an oval track around pitch with a pavilion and one stand along one side ground had a capacity of 40 000 celtic park ibrox and hampden park all competed with each other to host scottish cup finals and scotland matches one of which could generate up to ps1 000 in revenue for host club to aid their chances of gaining that revenue rangers constructed a large terracing holding 36 000 people behind western goalmouth terracing designed by archibald leitch was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron a similar wooden terracing was constructed at eastern end giving a total capacity of 75 000 structure was passed by govan burgh surveyor in march 1902 but there were newspaper reports that it was unstable a crowd of 68 114 assembled for a scotland v england match on 5 april 1902 but shortly after kick off one section of terracing collapsed like a trap door a gap of 20 square yards appeared causing about 125 people to fall to ground 50 feet below terracing most survived due to fact they fell on top of other bodies but 25 people were killed 517 people were injured some due to being crushed in panic caused by collapse most people in stadium were unaware that first ibrox disaster had happened people even re occupied damaged area despite danger of further collapse a definite reason for disaster was not agreed upon partly because there was no public inquiry held some experts blamed quality of wood and supplier was tried for culpable homicide but was acquitted design was also cited as a possible cause generally wooden structures of that size were not trusted rangers removed wooden terraces reducing capacity to 25 000 criticism of design did not deter rangers from hiring leitch in future he designed an expansion of ibrox to a 63 000 capacity by 1910 using slopes made of earth by this point city of glasgow had three largest purpose built football grounds in world thumb right 300px rangers play motherwell at ibrox park in 1920 pavilion and grandstand that can be seen on right of pitch were replaced by bill struth stand in 1928 bovril stand north stand can be seen on left next major redevelopment occurred in 1928 after rangers had won their first double a new main stand to south side of ground was opened on 1 january 1929 main stand which has familiar leitch style criss cross balcony and a red brick facade seated 10 000 people and provided standing accommodation in an enclosure simon inglis a writer on football stadia commented in 2005 that main stand is leitch s greatest work and is still resplendent today in its red brick glory under a modern mantle of glass and steel architectural significance of main stand was reflected when it became a category b listed building in 1987 original seats in main stand were made of cast iron and oak one was auctioned in 2011 for ps1 080 banking of terracing continued to increase in 1930s on 2 january 1939 old firm game against celtic attracted a crowd of 118 567 record attendance for any league match played in britain at this point ibrox was second largest stadium in britain post war floodlights were first used at ibrox in december 1953 for a friendly match against arsenal first floodlit scottish league match was played at ibrox in march 1956 covers were built over north and east terracing during 1960s no structural changes were made to ibrox but capacity was cut to approximately 80 000 by safety legislation ibrox park had worst fan safety record in britain before its complete redesign and renaming in 1997 two fans died in september 1961 when a barrier collapsed on stairway 13 resulting in a crush stairway 13 was a popular often overcrowded and very steep exit from east terracing due to its proximity to copland road subway station and parking areas for rangers supporters coaches after this incident rangers installed safety measures but further injuries were sustained in crushes on stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969 on 23 october 1968 main stand at ibrox was hit by fire just seven months later there was another fire which destroyed more than 200 seats behind directors box worst disaster to date to affect football in britain happened after old firm game on 2 january 1971 when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on stairway 13 game itself ended in a 1 1 draw with colin stein scoring a late equalising goal for rangers this led to a widespread belief that crush had been caused by fans who had left game early but had turned back when they heard roar that greeted rangers goal a public inquiry discounted this initial story it established that crowd had been travelling in same direction when crush happened with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during goal celebrations downward force of crowd leaving stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush inquiry and subsequent compensation cases found that rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after incidents in 1960s disaster also highlighted however fact that there were no established safety standards that should be adhered to let alone any means of enforcing such standards this had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier after 1923 fa cup final guide to safety at sports grounds was published in 1973 and legislation was enacted with safety of sports grounds act 1975 this law cut capacity of ibrox to 65 000 in short term rangers took stopgap measure of installing benches in north stand which was renamed centenary

1974 world cup and believed that steep terracing and exits such as stairway 13 had to be replaced cut in capacity and boardroom changes led to radical plans by architects miller partnership which were published in november 1977 plans were modelled on westfalenstadion home ground of borussia dortmund they involved a radical reshaping of stadium with old bowl shaped terracing to be replaced by three new all seated structures only old main stand would remain with its enclosure providing only standing room in ground although later events such as hillsborough disaster and subsequent taylor report vindicated this plan rangers were taking a significant risk whole plan was estimated to cost ps6 million which no other club could have afforded in a short period of time development was funded by rangers football pools operation which was largest club based scheme in britain first phase of plan which began in 1978 was removal of east terracing and its replacement with copland road stand same process was repeated on west side of ground a year later with two identical stands each holding 7 500 seats redevelopment was completed in 1981 with replacement of centenary stand by 10 300 capacity govan stand new ibrox had a capacity of 44 000 and was opened with an old firm game played on 19 september 1981 by this time however development cost had risen to ps10 million which depleted club financially this resulted in a difficult period in history of rangers as average attendance fell to 17 500 in 1981 82 season including a crowd of only 4 500 for a game against st mirren rangers complete record breedon books 2005 states attendance for match against st mirren was 6 000 redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this as some fans felt that new ground lacked atmosphere due to spaces between stands this was during a period of low attendances in scottish football in general despite relatively low attendance at ibrox rangers had highest average home attendances in premier division in both 1983 84 and 1984 85 this all changed when a new regime chaired by david holmes took control of rangers in 1986 graeme souness was appointed player manager while several english stars including terry butcher and chris woods were signed season ticket sales rose from 7 000 in 1986 to over 30 000 in 1990s while commercial income increased from ps239 000 in 1986 to over ps2 million in 1989 introduction of computerised ticketing zonal public address systems and closed circuit television for monitoring turnstile areas meant that ibrox was at forefront of stadium management rangers also adopted american technique of analysing types of fans in each area of stadium and adjusted their food stalls accordingly greater success on pitch meant that ibrox demonstrated that seated stadiums would be welcomed by most fans if designed and fitted well club deck thumb right a view of main stand in 2005 club deck white was constructed above 1928 main stand in early 1990s brick and glass construction in front is an enclosed stairwell to upper deck david murray acquired control of rangers in november 1988 argyle house a ps4 million extension behind govan stand was opened in 1990 this added executive boxes office space and hospitality suites a further series of developments was started in early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50 000 murray commissioned architect gareth hutchison to find a way of adding a third tier to main stand this was a highly complex process as main stand facade had become a listed building and murray wanted existing structure to remain open during construction contractors removed original roof and added a temporary cover while work carried on above club deck which cost approximately ps20 million was opened with a league match against dundee united in december 1991 redevelopment of main stand was partially financed by a football trust grant of ps2 million and a debenture issue that raised ps8 5 million ordinary fans bought debentures for between ps1 000 and ps1 650 each which guaranteed right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years along with some other minor benefits thumb right 150px facade of bill struth main stand four columns were built through existing main stand to support club deck which resulted in approximately 1 000 seats having a restricted view after opening club deck ibrox had a capacity of 44 500 when a new playing surface was installed in 1992 rangers were able to add a further 1 300 seats to front of three stands by lowering pitch slightly only standing area of ground enclosure of main stand was seated in 1994 to comply with taylor report and uefa regulations multi coloured seats were replaced in 1995 with uniform blue seats a further 1 200 seats were added in this process by reconfiguring passageways giving a total capacity of 47 998 thumb gates to ibrox stadium at broomloan stand two spaces between govan copland and broomloan stands were filled in with seats and

inferior and had become pixelated on 16 july 2014 club paid a lasting tribute to sandy jardine by renaming govan stand in his honour in 2016 club added large banners to stadium exterior covering separate edmiston house office building then copland stand sandy jardine stand corner depicting images of past players entitled icons of ibrox following year some supporters were displeased when further banners were added over glass block walled staircase towers on either side of main stand leading up to club deck banners were removed within a few months with club stating it was a marketing

inglis compared ibrox to highbury in that it combined corporate power with a sense of tradition and solidity it was originally constructed as a 10 000 seat stand above a standing enclosure it was redeveloped in early 1990s with addition of club deck and seating in enclosure it is now a three tier all seated structure accommodating approximately 21 000 spectators front wall of middle tier is

additional areas of seating were added to corner areas all of stands are designed using goalpost structure in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured a rangers megastore is located in corner between copland road and govan stands away fans are normally accommodated in corner of ground between broomloan and govan stands ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters rangers banned celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at ibrox citing damage caused to broomloan stand by visitors in previous derbies ban was lifted after one game as scottish football league passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action before corners were filled in away fans were accommodated in lower tier of broomloan stand rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in upper deck from throwing items at visitors celtic fans were normally given whole of broomloan stand for old firm derbies until 2018 when rangers opted to restrict their allocation to much smaller corner section future developments since redevelopments to celtic park and hampden park were completed in late 1990s ibrox has had smallest capacity of three major stadiums in glasgow rangers have since explored options to increase capacity after opening bar 72 area in 2006 chief executive martin bain said that scheme could be replicated in copland stand a report in daily record in april 2007 claimed that rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57 000 principally by removing jumbotron screens and lowering pitch to accommodate more seating these plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by team in january 2008 rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop ibrox one of proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70 000 by replacing three of stands with a bowl type structure these plans were shelved by october 2008 however due to late 2000s financial crisis alongside changes to stadium itself rangers have also sought to develop land around ibrox in partnership with las vegas sands corporation club received outline planning permission from glasgow city council for development of land adjoining ibrox as home of a super casino casino was planned to be accompanied by a rangers themed leisure complex britain s casino advisory panel reviewed bids from eight short listed cities including glasgow and in 2007 awarded first licence to manchester there is no immediate prospect of ibrox proposal being resurrected as gordon brown dropped plans for super casinos soon after becoming prime minister rangers were given approval by glasgow city council in october 2008 to purchase land around ibrox and redevelop area with hotel and retail outlets this
