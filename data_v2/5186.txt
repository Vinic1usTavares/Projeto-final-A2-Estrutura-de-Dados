romantic theme airdate was pushed back to valentine s day on february 14 1991 it was however ready to be aired several months earlier characters hans moleman groundskeeper willie and squeaky voiced teen made their first appearances on show in principal charming willie s role in episode was to punish bart by making him re sod grass originally willie was just written as an angry janitor and fact that he was scottish was added during a recording session dan castellaneta was assigned to do voice but he did not know what voice to use sam simon who was directing at time told castellaneta to use an accent he first tried using a spanish voice which simon felt was too cliched he then tried a big dumb swede which was also rejected for his third try he used voice of an angry scotsman which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in episode originally thought by directors to be a one shot appearance willie has since become a common recurring character show s creator matt groening later revealed that character was based partially on angus crock a kilt wearing chef from sketch comedy show second city television who was portrayed by dave thomas and jimmy finlayson mustachioed scottish

simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood wrote good fun with both patty and selma gaining a degree of humanity bart makes very good use of his new found freedom as skinner s pseudo in law much to annoyance of groundskeeper willie making his first appearance dvd movie guide s colin jacobson wrote many shows might have trouble concentrating on secondary characters like skinner and patty but this episode worked nicely though romantic tone could have become sappy program managed to stay on right side of that equation and it expanded characters well doug pratt a dvd reviewer and rolling stone contributor wrote that episode is heavily character orientated but poignantly comical a member of ign staff wrote in a season two review there are some real winners to be found in second season and i was actually surprised at some of episodes in collection because i thought they were later in series like principal charming where skinner falls for patty bill goodykoontz of arizona republic said principal charming was episode that made it clear that simpsons wasn t just a smart little cartoon but something much much more episode s references to gone with wind and terminator were named sixth and fifth greatest film references in history of show by nathan ditum of total film dawn taylor of dvd journal thought best line of episode was moe s line to depressed homer homer lighten up you re
