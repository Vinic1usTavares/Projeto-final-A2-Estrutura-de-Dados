expressway between 18th street and ben franklin bridge road was to run through developed areas of philadelphia intersecting several streets and railroad lines in addition route was to run through franklin square a historically sensitive site to connect to ben franklin bridge as a result routing was modified in 1966 to avoid many of these obstacles route was to avoid running through franklin square leading to eastbound direction using surface streets to access ben franklin bridge and a planned connector to market street was removed in 1970s proposed freeway s environmental impact statement had to be evaluated again per new guidelines when new environmental impact statement was issued in 1977 it was found that more improvements were needed for mass transit in area of planned freeway to comply with this provisions were made concerning proposed underground center city commuter connection for septa regional rail in which railroad tracks would pass under i 676 and residences would be built over railroad tunnel in chinatown construction was approved in 1986 on vine street expressway from 18th street to ben franklin bridge with no provisions for elevated connections between
