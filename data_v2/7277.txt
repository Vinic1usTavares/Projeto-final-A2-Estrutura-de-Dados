typically stress his lyricism and warmth of his sound los angeles times obituary writers noted that his playing had a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing neither of which minimized his capacity to produce rhythmically swinging phrases equivalent comments in guardian were that farmer avoided bright penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and was influenced by more reserved articulation of miles davis and kenny and that although he could seem more restrained than davis or lee morgan farmer was in his way a true original his phrasing was always distinctive letting beat run ahead of him rather in manner of billie holiday s vocals farmer moved from trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn from early 1960s utilising latter instrument s more mellow sound and farmer s ability to get what he wanted from it without having to use a mute in 1989 he played a major part in creating a trumpet flugelhorn hybrid flumpet which was constructed for him by instrument maker david monette this instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings from small groups to big bands in 1997 monette presented him with a personalized flumpet with decorations

characteristically flowing lines were interrupted by sudden wide melodic leaps and disjunct rhythmic accents a few months before his death although faster numbers had become perhaps too challenging
