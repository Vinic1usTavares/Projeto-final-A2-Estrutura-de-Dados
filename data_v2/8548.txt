thumb 262px regular cannot be constructed using only a straightedge and compass construction this can be proven using field of constructible numbers in mathematics a field is a set on which addition subtraction multiplication and division are defined and behave as corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do a field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in algebra number theory and many other areas of mathematics best known fields are field of rational numbers field of real numbers and field of complex numbers many other fields such as fields of rational functions algebraic function fields algebraic number fields and p adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields i e fields with finitely many elements relation of two fields is expressed by notion of a field extension galois theory initiated by evariste galois in 1830s is devoted to understanding symmetries of field extensions among other results this theory shows that angle and squaring circle cannot be done with a compass and straightedge moreover it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable fields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains this includes different branches of mathematical analysis which are based on fields with additional structure basic theorems in analysis hinge on structural properties of field of real numbers most importantly for algebraic purposes any field may be used as scalars for a vector space which is standard general context for linear algebra number fields siblings of field of rational numbers are studied in depth in number theory function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects definition informally a field is a set along with two operations defined on that set an addition operation written as and a multiplication operation written as both of which behave similarly as they behave for rational numbers and real numbers including existence of an additive inverse for all elements and of a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element this allows one to also consider so called inverse operations of subtraction and division by defining classic definition formally a field is a set together with two operations on called addition and multiplication an operation on is a function in other words a mapping that associates an element of to every pair of its elements result of addition of and is called sum of and and is denoted similarly result of multiplication of and is called product of and and is denoted or these operations are required to satisfy following properties referred to as field axioms in these axioms and are arbitrary elements of field associativity of addition and multiplication and commutativity of addition and multiplication and additive and multiplicative identity there exist two different elements and in such that and additive inverses for every in there exists an element in denoted called additive inverse of a such that multiplicative inverses for every in there exists an element in denoted by or called multiplicative inverse of a such that distributivity of multiplication over addition this may be summarized by saying a field has two operations called addition and multiplication it is an abelian group under addition with 0 as additive identity nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as multiplicative identity and multiplication distributes over addition alternative definition fields can also be defined in different but equivalent ways one can alternatively define a field by four binary operations addition subtraction multiplication and division and their required properties division by zero is by definition excluded in order to avoid existential quantifiers fields can be defined by two binary operations addition and multiplication two unary operations yielding additive and multiplicative inverses respectively and two operations constants and these operations are then subject to conditions above avoiding existential quantifiers is important in constructive mathematics and computing see also field one may equivalently define a field by same two binary operations one unary operation multiplicative inverse and two constants and since and a priori twofold use of symbol for denoting one part of a constant and for additive inverses is justified by this latter condition examples rational numbers rational numbers have been widely used a long time before elaboration of concept of field they are numbers that can be written as fractions where and are integers and additive inverse of such a fraction is and multiplicative inverse provided that is which can be seen as follows abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers for example law of distributivity can be proven as follows real and complex numbers thumb 255px multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and real numbers with usual operations of addition and multiplication also form a field complex numbers consist of expressions with real where is imaginary unit i e a non real number satisfying addition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for for example distributive law enforces it is immediate that this is again an expression of above type and so complex numbers form a field complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in plane with cartesian coordinates given by real numbers of their describing expression or as arrows from origin to these points specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction addition then corresponds to combining arrows to intuitive parallelogram adding cartesian coordinates and multiplication is less intuitively combining rotating and scaling of arrows adding angles and multiplying lengths fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics physics engineering statistics and many other scientific disciplines constructible numbers thumb 255px geometric mean theorem asserts that choosing allows construction of square root of a given constructible number in antiquity several geometric problems concerned in feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge for example it was unknown to greeks that it is in general impossible to a given angle in this way these problems can be settled using field of constructible numbers real constructible numbers are by definition lengths of line segments that can be constructed from points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge these numbers endowed with field operations of real numbers restricted to constructible numbers form a field which properly includes field of rational numbers illustration shows construction of square roots of constructible numbers not necessarily contained within using labeling in illustration construct segments and a semicircle over center at midpoint which intersects perpendicular line through b in a point at a distance of exactly from when has length one not all real numbers are constructible it can be shown that is not a constructible number which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge length of side of a cube with volume 2 another problem posed by ancient greeks a field with four elements addition multiplication in addition to familiar number systems such as rationals there are other less immediate examples of fields following example is a field consisting of four elements called and notation is chosen such that plays role of additive identity element denoted 0 in axioms above and i is multiplicative identity denoted 1 in axioms above field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory or by direct computation for example which equals as required by distributivity this field is called a finite field with four elements and is denoted or subset consisting of and highlighted in red in tables at right is also a field known as binary field or in context of computer science and boolean algebra and are often denoted respectively by false and true addition is then denoted xor exclusive or and multiplication is denoted and in other words structure of binary field is basic structure that allows computing with bits elementary notions in this section denotes an arbitrary field and and are arbitrary elements of consequences of definition one has and in particular one may deduce additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows if then or must be 0 indeed if a 0 then this means that every field is an integral domain additive and multiplicative group of a field axioms of a field imply that it is an abelian group under addition this group is called additive group of field and is sometimes denoted by when denoting it simply as could be confusing similarly nonzero elements of form an abelian group under multiplication called multiplicative group and denoted by or just or a field may thus be defined as set equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that is an abelian group under addition is an abelian group under multiplication where 0 is identity element of addition and multiplication is distributive over addition equivalently a field is an algebraic structure of type such that is not defined and are abelian groups and is distributive over some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of groups for example additive and multiplicative inverses and are uniquely determined by requirement follows because 1 is identity element of a group that does not contain 0 thus trivial ring consisting of a single element is not a field every finite subgroup of multiplicative group of a field is cyclic see characteristic in addition to multiplication of two elements of f it is possible to define product of an arbitrary element of by a positive integer to be fold sum which is an element of if there is no positive integer such that then is said to have characteristic 0 for example field of rational numbers has characteristic 0 since no positive integer is zero otherwise if there is a positive integer satisfying this equation smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a prime number it is usually denoted by and field is said to have characteristic then for example field has characteristic 2 since in notation of above addition table if has characteristic then for all in this implies that since all other binomial coefficients appearing in binomial formula are divisible by here factors is th power i e fold product of element therefore map is compatible with addition in and also with multiplication and is therefore a field homomorphism existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic quite different from fields of characteristic 0 subfields and prime fields a subfield of a field is a subset of that is a field with respect to field operations of equivalently is a subset of that contains and is closed under addition multiplication additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element this means that that for all both and are in and that for all in both and are in field homomorphisms are maps between two fields such that and where and are arbitrary elements of all field homomorphisms are injective if is also surjective it is called an isomorphism or fields and are called isomorphic a field is called a prime field if it has no proper i e strictly smaller subfields any field contains a prime field if characteristic of is a prime number prime field is isomorphic to finite field introduced below otherwise prime field is isomorphic to finite fields finite fields also called galois fields are fields with finitely many elements whose number is also referred to as order of field above introductory example is a field with four elements its subfield is smallest field because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 0 thumb in modular arithmetic modulo 12 9 4 1 since 9 4 13 in which divided by 12 leaves remainder 1 however is not a field because 12 is not a prime number simplest finite fields with prime order are most directly accessible using modular arithmetic for a fixed positive integer arithmetic modulo means to work with numbers addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing operation in question in set of integers dividing by and taking remainder as result this construction yields a field precisely if is a prime number for example taking prime results in above mentioned field for and more generally for any composite number i e any number which can be expressed as a product of two strictly smaller natural numbers is not a field product of two non zero elements is zero since in which as was explained above prevents from being a field field with elements being prime constructed in this way is usually denoted by every finite field has elements where is prime and this statement holds since may be viewed as a vector space over its prime field dimension of this vector space is necessarily finite say which implies asserted statement a field with elements can be constructed as splitting field of polynomial such a splitting field is an extension of in which polynomial has zeros this means has as many zeros as possible since degree of is for it can be checked case by case using above multiplication table that all four elements of satisfy equation so they are zeros of by contrast in has only two zeros namely 0 and 1 so does not split into linear factors in this smaller field elaborating further on basic field theoretic notions it can be shown that two finite fields with same order are isomorphic it is thus customary to speak of finite field with elements denoted by or history historically three algebraic disciplines led to concept of a field question of solving polynomial equations algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry a first step towards notion of a field was made in 1770 by joseph louis lagrange who observed that zeros of a cubic polynomial in expression with being a third root of unity only yields two values this way lagrange conceptually explained classical solution method of scipione del ferro and francois which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown to an quadratic equation for together with a similar observation for equations of degree 4 lagrange thus linked what eventually became concept of fields and concept of groups also in 1770 and to a fuller extent carl friedrich gauss in his 1801 studied equation for a prime and again using modern language resulting cyclic galois group gauss deduced that a regular gon can be constructed if building on lagrange s work paolo ruffini claimed 1799 that quintic equations polynomial equations of degree 5 cannot be solved algebraically however his arguments were flawed these gaps were filled by niels henrik abel in 1824 evariste galois in 1832 devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable thus establishing in effect what is known as galois theory today both abel and galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field nor of a group in 1871 richard dedekind introduced for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under four arithmetic operations german word korper which means body or corpus to suggest an organically closed entity english term field was introduced by earliest known uses of some of words of mathematics f in 1881 leopold kronecker defined what he called a domain of rationality which is a field of rational fractions in modern terms kronecker s notion did not cover field of all algebraic numbers which is a field in dedekind s sense but on other hand was more abstract than dedekind s in that it made no specific assumption on nature of elements of a field kronecker interpreted a field such as abstractly as rational function field prior to this examples of transcendental numbers were known since joseph liouville s work in 1844 until charles hermite 1873 and ferdinand von lindemann 1882 proved transcendence of and respectively first clear definition of an abstract field is due to see also in particular heinrich martin weber s notion included field fp giuseppe veronese 1891 studied field of formal power series which led to introduce field of p adic numbers synthesized knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far he studied properties of fields and defined many important field theoretic concepts majority of theorems mentioned in sections galois theory constructing fields and elementary notions can be found in steinitz s work linked notion of in a field and thus area of analysis to purely algebraic properties emil artin redeveloped galois theory from 1928 through 1942 eliminating dependency on primitive element theorem constructing fields constructing fields from rings a commutative ring is a set equipped with an addition and multiplication operation satisfying all axioms of a field except for existence of multiplicative inverses for example integers form a commutative ring but not a field reciprocal of an integer is not itself an integer unless in hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as commutative rings in which every nonzero element is a unit which means every element is invertible similarly fields are commutative rings with precisely two distinct ideals and fields are also precisely commutative rings in which is only prime ideal given a commutative ring there are two ways to construct a field related to i e two ways of modifying such that all nonzero elements become invertible forming field of fractions and forming residue fields field of fractions of is rationals while residue fields of are finite fields field of fractions given an integral domain its field of fractions is built with fractions of two elements of exactly as q is constructed from integers more precisely elements of are fractions where and are in and two fractions and are equal if and only if operation on fractions work exactly as for rational numbers for example it is straightforward to show that if ring is an integral domain set of fractions form a field field of rational fractions over a field or an integral domain is field of fractions of polynomial ring field of laurent series over a field is field of fractions of ring of formal power series in which since any laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of as opposed to an arbitrary power series representation of fractions is less important in this situation though residue fields in addition to field of fractions which embeds into a field a field can be obtained from a commutative ring by means of a surjective map onto a field any field obtained in this way is a quotient where is a maximal ideal of if has only one maximal ideal this field is called residue field of ideal generated by a single polynomial in polynomial ring over a field e is maximal if and only if is irreducible in i e if cannot be expressed as product of two polynomials in of smaller degree this yields a field this field contains an element namely residue class of which satisfies equation for example is obtained from by adjoining imaginary unit symbol i which satisfies where moreover is irreducible over which implies that map that sends a polynomial to yields an isomorphism constructing fields within a bigger field fields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field suppose given a field and a field containing as a subfield for any element of there is a smallest subfield of containing and called subfield of f generated by and denoted passage from to is referred to by adjoining an element to e more generally for a subset there is a minimal subfield of containing and denoted by compositum of two subfields and of some field is smallest subfield of containing both and compositum can be used to construct biggest subfield of satisfying a certain property for example biggest subfield of which is in language introduced below algebraic over further examples include maximal extension or maximal abelian extension within field extensions notion of a subfield can also be regarded from opposite point of view by referring to being a field extension or just extension of denoted by and read over a basic datum of a field extension is its degree i e dimension of as an vector space it satisfies formula extensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions extensions and are of degree 2 whereas is an infinite extension algebraic extensions a pivotal notion in study of field extensions are algebraic elements an element is algebraic over if it is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in that is if it satisfies a polynomial equation with in and for example imaginary unit in is algebraic over and even over since it satisfies equation a field extension in which every element of is algebraic over is called an algebraic extension any finite extension is necessarily algebraic as can be deduced from above formula subfield generated by an element as above is an algebraic extension of if and only if is an algebraic element that is to say if is algebraic all other elements of are necessarily algebraic as well moreover degree of extension i e dimension of as an vector space equals minimal degree such that there is a polynomial equation involving as above if this degree is then elements of have form for example field of gaussian rationals is subfield of consisting of all numbers of form where both and are rational numbers summands of form and similarly for higher exponents don t have to be considered here since can be simplified to transcendence bases above mentioned field of rational fractions where is an indeterminate is not an algebraic extension of since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in whose zero is elements such as which are not algebraic are called transcendental informally speaking indeterminate and its powers do not interact with elements of a similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates instead of just one once again field extension discussed above is a key example if is not algebraic i e is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients in then is isomorphic to this isomorphism is obtained by substituting to in rational fractions a subset of a field is a transcendence basis if it is algebraically independent don t satisfy any polynomial relations over and if is an algebraic extension of any field extension has a transcendence basis thus field extensions can be split into ones of form purely transcendental extensions and algebraic extensions closure operations a field is algebraically closed if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or equivalently if any polynomial equation with coefficients has a solution by fundamental theorem of algebra is algebraically closed i e any polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution rational and real numbers are not algebraically closed since equation does not have any rational or real solution a field containing is called an algebraic closure of if it is algebraic over roughly speaking not too big compared to and is algebraically closed big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations by above is an algebraic closure of situation that algebraic closure is a finite extension of field is quite special by artin schreier theorem degree of this extension is necessarily 2 and is elementarily equivalent to such fields are also known as real closed fields any field has an algebraic closure which is moreover unique up to non unique isomorphism it is commonly referred to as algebraic closure and denoted for example algebraic closure of is called field of algebraic numbers field is usually rather implicit since its construction requires ultrafilter lemma a set theoretic axiom that is weaker than axiom of choice post in this regard algebraic closure of is exceptionally simple it is union of finite fields containing ones of order for any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 algebraic closure of field of laurent series is field of series obtained by adjoining roots of fields with additional structure since fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond several refinements of concept have been adapted to needs of particular mathematical areas ordered fields a field f is called an ordered field if any two elements can be compared so that and whenever and for example reals form an ordered field with usual ordering artin schreier theorem states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a formally real field which means that any quadratic equation only has solution set of all possible orders on a fixed field f is isomorphic to set of ring homomorphisms from witt ring w f of quadratic forms over f to z an archimedean field is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression whose value is greater than that element that is there are no infinite elements equivalently field contains no infinitesimals elements smaller than all rational numbers or yet equivalent field is isomorphic to a subfield of thumb 300px each bounded real set has a least upper bound an ordered field is dedekind complete if all upper bounds lower bounds see dedekind cut and limits which should exist do exist more formally each bounded subset of is required to have a least upper bound any complete field is necessarily archimedean since in any non archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational whence sequence every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal has no limit since every proper subfield of reals also contains such gaps is unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism several foundational results in calculus follow directly from this characterization of reals hyperreals form an ordered field that is not archimedean it is an extension of reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers these are larger respectively smaller than any real number hyperreals form foundational basis of non standard analysis topological fields another refinement of notion of a field is a topological field in which set f is a topological space such that all operations of field addition multiplication maps and are continuous maps with respect to topology of space topology of all fields discussed below is induced from a metric i e a function that measures a distance between any two elements of completion of is another field in which informally speaking gaps in original field are filled if there are any for example any irrational number such as is a gap in rationals in sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers in sense that distance of and given by absolute value is as small as desired following table lists some examples of this construction fourth column shows an example of a zero sequence i e a sequence whose limit for is zero field metric completion zero sequence usual absolute value r obtained using p adic valuation for a prime number adic numbers any field obtained using adic valuation field is used in number theory and adic analysis algebraic closure carries a unique norm extending one on but is not complete completion of this algebraic closure however is algebraically closed because of its rough analogy to complex numbers it is called field of complex p adic numbers and is denoted by local fields following topological fields are called local fields some authors also consider fields and to be local fields on other hand these two fields also called archimedean local fields share little similarity with local fields considered here to a point that calls them completely anomalous finite extensions of local fields of characteristic zero finite extensions of field of laurent series over local fields of characteristic these two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities in this relation elements and referred to as uniformizer correspond to each other first manifestation of this is at an elementary level elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in uniformizer with coefficients in however since addition in is done using carrying which is not case in these fields are not isomorphic following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper any first order statement that is true for almost all is also true for almost all an application of this is ax kochen theorem describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in tamely ramified extensions of both fields are in bijection to one another adjoining arbitrary power roots of in respectively of in yields infinite extensions of these fields known as fields strikingly galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic which is first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields differential fields differential fields are fields equipped with a derivation i e allow to take derivatives of elements in field for example field r x together with standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field these fields are central to differential galois theory a variant of galois theory dealing with linear differential equations galois theory galois theory studies algebraic extensions of a field by studying symmetry in arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication an important notion in this area are finite galois extensions which are by definition those that are separable and normal primitive element theorem shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily simple i e of form where is an irreducible polynomial as above for such an extension being normal and separable means that all zeros of are contained in and that has only simple zeros latter condition is always satisfied if has characteristic 0 for a finite galois extension galois group is group of field automorphisms of that are trivial on i e that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of to themselves importance of this group stems from fundamental theorem of galois theory which constructs an explicit one to one correspondence between set of subgroups of and set of intermediate extensions of extension by means of this correspondence group theoretic properties translate into facts about fields for example if galois group of a galois extension as above is not solvable cannot be built from abelian groups then zeros of cannot be expressed in terms of addition multiplication and radicals i e expressions involving for example symmetric groups is not solvable for consequently as can be shown zeros of following polynomials are not expressible by sums products and radicals for latter polynomial this fact is known as abel ruffini theorem and where is regarded as a polynomial in for some indeterminates is any field and tensor product of fields is not usually a field for example a finite extension of degree is a galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of algebras this fact is beginning of grothendieck s galois theory a far reaching extension of galois theory applicable to algebro geometric objects see also fundamental group invariants of fields basic invariants of a field include characteristic and transcendence degree of over its prime field latter is defined as maximal number of elements in that are algebraically independent over prime field two algebraically closed fields and are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree this implies that any two uncountable algebraically closed fields of same cardinality and same characteristic are isomorphic for example and are isomorphic but not isomorphic as topological fields model theory of fields in model theory a branch of mathematical logic two fields and are called elementarily equivalent if every mathematical statement that is true for is also true for and conversely mathematical statements in question are required to be first order sentences involving 0 1 addition and multiplication a typical example is for any any polynomial of degree in has a zero in which amounts to saying that is algebraically closed principle states that is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero moreover any fixed statement holds in if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic if is an ultrafilter on a set and is a field for every in ultraproduct of with respect to is a field it is denoted by since it behaves in several ways as a limit of fields los s theorem states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many also holds for ultraproduct applied to above sentence this shows that there is an and are algebraically closed by los s theorem for same reason they both have characteristic zero finally they are both uncountable so that they are isomorphic ax kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of in both cases over all primes in addition model theory also studies logical properties of various other types of fields such as real closed fields or exponential fields which are equipped with an exponential function absolute galois group for fields that are not algebraically closed or not closed absolute galois group is fundamentally important extending case of finite galois extensions outlined above this group governs all finite separable extensions of by elementary means group can be shown to be prufer group completion of this statement subsumes fact that only algebraic extensions of are fields for and that galois groups of these finite extensions are given by a description in terms of generators and relations is also known for galois groups of adic number fields finite extensions of representations of galois groups and of related groups such as weil group are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic such as langlands program study of such representations is done using galois cohomology for example brauer group which is classically defined as group of central simple algebras can be reinterpreted as a galois cohomology group namely k theory milnor k theory is defined as norm residue isomorphism theorem proved around 2000 by vladimir relates this to galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism algebraic k theory is related to group of invertible matrices with coefficients given field for example process of taking determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism k1 f fx matsumoto s theorem shows that k2 f agrees with f in higher degrees k theory diverges from milnor k theory and remains hard to compute in general applications linear algebra and commutative algebra thumb euler angles express relation of different coordinate systems i e bases of they are used in computer graphics if then equation has a unique solution in namely this observation which is an immediate consequence of definition of a field is essential ingredient used to show that any vector space has a basis roughly speaking this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space which is of central importance in linear algebra both from a theoretical point of view and also for practical applications modules analogue of vector spaces over most rings including ring of integers have a more complicated structure a particular situation arises when a ring is a vector space over a field in its own right such rings are called algebras and are studied in depth in area of commutative algebra for example noether normalization asserts that any finitely generated algebra is closely related to more precisely finitely generated as a module over a polynomial ring finite fields cryptography and coding theory thumb sum of three points p q and r on an elliptic curve e red is zero if there is a line blue passing through these points a widely applied cryptographic routine uses fact that discrete exponentiation i e computing factors for an integer in a large finite field can be performed much more efficiently than discrete logarithm which is inverse operation i e determining solution to an equation in elliptic curve cryptography multiplication in a finite field is replaced by operation of adding points on an elliptic curve i e solutions of an equation of form finite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics geometry field of functions thumb a compact riemann surface of genus two two handles genus can be read off field of meromorphic functions on surface functions on a suitable topological space into a field can be added and multiplied pointwise e g product of two functions is defined by product of their values within domain this makes these functions a commutative algebra for having a field of functions one must consider algebras of functions that are integral domains in this case ratios of two functions i e expressions of form form a field called field of functions this occurs in two main cases when is a complex manifold in this case one considers algebra of holomorphic functions i e complex differentiable functions their ratios form field of meromorphic functions on function field of an algebraic variety a geometric object defined as common zeros of polynomial equations consists of ratios of regular functions i e ratios of polynomial functions on variety function field of dimensional space over a field is i e field consisting of ratios of polynomials in indeterminates function field of is same as one of any open dense subvariety in other words function field is insensitive to replacing by a slightly smaller subvariety function field is invariant under isomorphism and birational equivalence of varieties it is therefore an important tool for study of abstract algebraic varieties and for classification of algebraic varieties for example dimension which equals transcendence degree of is invariant under birational equivalence for curves i e dimension is one function field is very close to if is smooth and proper analogue of being compact can be reconstructed up to isomorphism from its field of functions more precisely there is an equivalence of categories between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field and finite field extensions of in higher dimension function field remembers less but still decisive information about study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as birational geometry minimal model program attempts to identify simplest in a certain precise sense algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field number theory global fields global fields are in limelight in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry they are by definition number fields finite extensions of or function fields over finite extensions of as for local fields these two types of fields share several similar features even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic respectively this function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations often first by understanding questions about function fields and later treating number field case latter is often more difficult for example riemann hypothesis concerning zeros of riemann zeta function open as of 2017 can be regarded as being parallel to weil conjectures proven in 1974 by pierre deligne thumb fifth roots of unity form a regular pentagon cyclotomic fields are among most intensely studied number fields they are of form where is a primitive th root of unity i e a complex number satisfying and for all for being a regular prime kummer used cyclotomic fields to prove fermat s last theorem which asserts non existence of rational nonzero solutions to equation local fields are completions of global fields s theorem asserts that only completions of a global field are local fields and studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at corresponding questions locally this technique is called local global principle for example hasse minkowski theorem reduces problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in and whose solutions can easily be described unlike for local fields galois groups of global fields are not known inverse galois theory studies unsolved problem whether any finite group is galois group for some number field class field theory describes abelian extensions i e ones with abelian galois group or equivalently galois groups of global fields a classical statement kronecker weber theorem describes maximal abelian extension of it is field obtained by adjoining all primitive th roots of unity kronecker s asks for a similarly explicit description of of general number fields for imaginary quadratic fields theory of complex multiplication describes using elliptic curves for general number fields no such explicit description is known related notions in addition to additional structure that fields may enjoy fields admit various other related notions since in any field 0 1 any field has at least two elements nonetheless there is a concept of field with one element which is suggested to be a limit of finite fields as tends to 1 in addition to division rings there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as near fields and there are also proper classes with field structure which are sometimes called fields with a capital f surreal numbers form a field containing reals and would be a field except for fact that they are a proper class not a set a concept from game theory form such a field as well division rings thumb hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed more formally there is no continuous tangent vector field on sphere which is everywhere non zero dropping one or several axioms in definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures as was mentioned above commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields except for multiplicative inverses dropping instead condition that multiplication is commutative leads to concept of a division ring or skew field historically division rings were sometimes referred to as fields while fields were called commutative fields only division rings that are finite dimensional vector spaces are itself which is a field quaternions in which multiplication is non commutative and in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative this fact was proved using methods of algebraic topology in 1958 by michel raoul bott and john milnor non existence of an odd dimensional division algebra is more classical it can be deduced from hairy ball theorem illustrated at right notes
