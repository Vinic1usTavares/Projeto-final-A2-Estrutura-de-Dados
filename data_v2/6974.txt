thumb cover of a dvd collection of treehouse of horror episodes treehouse of horror also known as simpsons halloween specials are a series of halloween themed episodes of animated series simpsons each consisting of three separate self contained segments these segments usually involve simpson family in some horror science fiction or supernatural setting they take place outside show s normal continuity and completely abandon any pretense of being realistic being known for their far more violent and much darker nature than an average simpsons episode first entitled treehouse of horror aired on october 25 1990 as part of second season and was inspired by ec comics horror tales since then there have been 28 other treehouse of horror episodes with one airing every year episodes contain parodies of horror science fiction and fantasy films as well as alien characters kang and kodos a special version of opening sequence and scary names in credits show s staff regard treehouse of horror as being particularly difficult to produce as scripts often go through many rewrites and animators typically have to design new characters and backgrounds many of episodes are popular among fans and critics of show and have inspired a whole offshoot of simpsons merchandise including action figures playsets video games books dvds comic books and a special version of monopoly several of episodes have won awards for animation and sound editing in 1996 2013 and 2015 treehouse of horror vi treehouse of horror xxiii and treehouse of horror xxv were respectively nominated for primetime emmy award in outstanding animated program for programming less than one hour category of horror episodes typically consist of four parts an opening and halloween themed version of credits followed by three segments these segments usually have a horror science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films novels plays television shows twilight zone episodes or old issues of ec comics although they are sometimes connected by wraparounds three segments rarely have any kind of continuing connection within episode two exceptions are treehouse of horror v in which groundskeeper willie is killed by an axe in a similar fashion in all three segments as well as in treehouse of horror xxviii in which maggie is possessed by demon in first segment and is still recovering in next segment episodes are considered to be non canon and always take place outside normal continuity of show since each character appears to be fine afterwards from treehouse of horror to treehouse of horror xiii all three segments were written by different writers in some cases there was a fourth writer who wrote opening and wraparound segments for original treehouse of horror there were three different directors for episode starting with season 15 s treehouse of horror xiv however only one writer has been credited with writing each treehouse of horror episode on occasion episodes will be used to showcase special animation such as treehouse of horror vi segment homer3 in which a computer animated homer is shown in a non animated setting at time 1995 it was groundbreaking as it was unusual for a television show to use such animation segment was executive producer bill oakley s idea and included live action directed by david mirkin treehouse of horror xx included segment there s no business like moe business which was first to be musically themed traditions opening sequence right thumb three of tombstones from opening segment of treehouse of horror every treehouse of horror episode opens with a special introductory segment first second and fifth treehouse of horror episodes open with marge standing on a stage and warning parents about content of episode advising them to put their children to bed warning in first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers as producers felt it was somewhat scary entire segment was a parody of opening of 1931 film frankenstein marge s warnings quickly became a burden to write after treehouse of horror v they were permanently dropped and writers did not make any attempts at reviving them other treehouse of horror episodes have opened with parodies for example treehouse of horror iii had homer introduce episode in a manner similar to alfred hitchcock in alfred hitchcock presents treehouse of horror iv had bart introduce episode and segments in a manner similar to night gallery and treehouse of horror v featured a parody of outer limits sixth and seventh episodes featured short clips with no lines because episodes had run long and longer segments were cut following treehouse of horror vii opening has been upwards of a minute long and sometimes featured an introduction by a character such as mr burns in treehouse of horror xvii or included over top violence such as treehouse of horror viii which showed a fox network censor being brutally murdered and treehouse of horror xiv which showed simpson family killing each other in opening segment of first five episodes camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen these messages include names of canceled shows from previous season deceased celebrities such as walt disney and jim morrison and a tombstone with an inscription that read tv violence that was riddled with bullets as camera panned on it they were last used in treehouse of horror v which included a solitary tombstone with words amusing tombstones to signal this tombstone gags were easy for writers in first episode but like marge s warnings they eventually got more difficult to write so they were abandoned another reason they were dropped was that tombstones would list television shows that had been canceled previous season after a few years several of shows that were canceled were produced by former simpsons writers however after two decades this gag made a brief comeback in treehouse of horror xxix at very beginning this time appearing before main opening sequence and title while early treehouse of horror episodes featured a halloween themed opening sequence later ones only included title and created by and developed by credits every episode between treehouse of horror ii and treehouse of horror x featured a couch gag with a halloween theme including simpson family dressed as skeletons zombies and characters from previous halloween episodes wraparounds first four treehouse of horror episodes had brief wraparounds that occurred before each segment and loosely tied together all three stories treehouse of horror was only one that actually included a treehouse as a setting in that episode bart and lisa sat in it telling stories to each other treehouse of horror ii presented all of segments as being nightmares of lisa bart and homer treehouse of horror iii had lisa bart and grampa telling stories at a halloween party and treehouse of horror iv is presented by bart in a parody of rod serling s night gallery after a few years amount of broadcast time for an episode was shortened allowing less time to tell a proper story there were no wraparounds for treehouse of horror v because they had been cut to make more time for segments following that writers permanently dropped them kang and kodos two characters that are virtually exclusive to treehouse of horror series are kang and kodos a pair of large green space aliens who were introduced in hungry are damned segment of treehouse of horror kang and kodos have since appeared in every treehouse of horror episode sometimes as important parts of a story but often just for brief cameos in some episodes they only appear in opening segment but often they will make a cameo appearance in middle of a different story for example a story about zombies attacking town briefly cuts to them in their space ship watching events and laughing maniacally at earthlings suffering action then switches back to actual story unofficial rule is that they must be in every episode although quite often they will be forgotten and are added at last moment resulting in only a brief appearance their scene in treehouse of horror viii nearly did not make final cut of episode but david x cohen managed to persuade producers to leave scene in kang and kodos were prominent characters in 2015 episode man who came to be dinner which was not halloween themed scary names left thumb scary names for writers in treehouse of horror iv beginning with treehouse of horror ii producers decided to give cast and crew of show scary names in opening and closing credits although names quickly became more silly than scary there have been a wide variety of special credits from simple names like bat groening to complex ones like s 2 sam simon who left show during fourth season but still receives developed by and executive producer credits and until treehouse of horror xxvi he had been listed in treehouse of horror episodes as sam sayonara simon since his death in 2015 he has been credited simply by his real name idea for scary names came from executive producer al jean who was inspired by ec comics because some of issues also used scary alternate names scary names became such a burden to write that they were cut for treehouse of horror xii and treehouse of horror xiii but after hearing complaints from fans jean decided to bring them back matt groening s rule for scary names is that they cannot be longer than a person s real name but this is rarely followed by anyone else cultural references references to films novels plays television shows and other media are commonly featured and many segments have been parodies of a specific work in horror science fiction or fantasy genre many segments are spoofs of episodes of twilight zone and entire segments will be based on a single episode some of twilight zone episodes parodied include a kind of a stopwatch to serve man a small talent for war living doll nightmare at 20 000 feet little girl lost and little people bart s nightmare segment of treehouse of horror ii parodies episode it s a good life and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of twilight zone halloween episodes also regularly parody horror and thriller films such as exorcist amityville horror king kong night of living dead shining a nightmare on elm street fly psycho paranormal activity and dead calm robert englund who portrays freddy krueger in nightmare on elm street franchise had a cameo appearance in treehouse of horror ix as character science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments and in later episodes many of segments were based more on science fiction than horror science fiction works parodied include omega man novel nineteen eighty four e t extra terrestrial and orson welles s war of worlds radio broadcast in treehouse of horror edgar allan poe s poem raven is read by james earl jones while parts are acted by various characters recent parodies have included films and television specials in more varied genres including mr mrs smith it s great pumpkin charlie brown transformers sweeney todd twilight film series and jumanji gracie films logo a modified version of production logo for gracie films is displayed after closing credits shushing sound is replaced by a scream and jingle is played in a minor key on a pipe organ production right thumb david mirkin believes episodes should be both scary and funny and has been responsible for some of more gruesome moments alt a seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into distance his hands are crossed first treehouse of horror episode aired in 1990 as part of second season and its on screen title was simpsons halloween special it was inspired by ec comics horror tales although every episode is entitled treehouse of horror first one was only episode that actually used treehouse motif during production of first episode matt groening was nervous about raven segment and felt it would be worst most pretentious thing they had ever done treehouse of horror episodes are difficult for both writers and animators episodes were originally written at beginning of production run but in later seasons they were written at end and aired at beginning of next season as holdovers giving animators more time to work part of difficulty for animators is that episodes always involve many complex backgrounds new characters and new designs they are difficult for writers because they must produce three stories an opening and in early episodes a wraparound they would have to try to fit all of this into a 20 22 minute episode episodes often go through many last minute changes with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded treehouse of horror iii in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in six week period between arrival of animation from korea and airing of episode by fourth season executive producers al jean and mike reiss were less enamored of treehouse of horror episodes and considered dropping them but other writers insisted that they be kept left thumb upright bill oakley along with josh weinstein executive produced two episodes and wrote one segment alt a portrait of a man with black hair looking at viewer part of attraction for writers is that they are able to break rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode in some cases writers will have an idea that is too violent and far fetched or too short for a normal episode but can be used as a segment in seasonal special several of writers former executive producer david mirkin among them believe that episodes should be scary and not just funny treehouse of horror v has been described by mirkin as being one of most intense disturbing halloween show ever as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules earlier treehouse of horror episodes began with marge issuing a disclaimer that if you have sensitive children maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow however these episodes seem mild compared to carnage that followed in later episodes according to jean who calls it a societal thing he points out that his 10 year old daughter loves films like coraline and that in age of scary stories appropriateness has gotten lower although gruesome for most part some segments such as citizen kang in treehouse of horror vii satirize political issues opening segment of treehouse of horror xix featured homer attempting to vote for barack obama but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for john mccain rather than taking sides in election al jean says it is mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be irregularities in our voting system sic in treehouse of horror xvii a segment called day earth looked stupid ends with kang and kodos taking over springfield as part of a mission called operation enduring occupation script originally called for kodos and kang to look over smoking ruins of springfield and say this sure is a lot like iraq will be fox network did not have any objection to line but it was rejected by some of writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast while cut from aired version line does appear in review version sent to newspapers and magazines right thumb al jean has been executive producer for more treehouse of horror episodes than any other ep alt a man with glasses and a red shirt is sitting in front of a microphone first treehouse of horror episode was first time that an alternate version of theme that airs over end credits was used originally it was supposed to use a theremin but one could not be found that could hit all necessary notes usually when producers submit an episode for primetime emmy award for outstanding individual achievement in music composition for a series dramatic underscore they submit a treehouse of horror episode and to date seven episodes have been nominated closing of treehouse of horror iv features a version of theme that is a combination of instruments used in munsters theme song and and clicking from addams family theme song is so far only human character introduced in a treehouse of
