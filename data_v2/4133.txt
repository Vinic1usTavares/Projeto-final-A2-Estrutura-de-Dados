pachycephalosaurus meaning thick headed lizard from greek thick kephale kephale head and sauros sauros lizard is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaurs type species p wyomingensis is only known species it lived during late cretaceous period maastrichtian stage of what is now north america remains have been excavated in montana south dakota and wyoming it was a herbivorous creature which is primarily known from a single skull and a few extremely thick skull roofs though more complete fossils have been found in recent years pachycephalosaurus was one of last non avian dinosaurs before cretaceous paleogene extinction event another dinosaur tylosteus of western north america has been synonymized with pachycephalosaurus as have genera stygimoloch and dracorex in some recent studies like other pachycephalosaurids pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal herbivore with an extremely thick skull roof it possessed long hindlimbs and small forelimbs pachycephalosaurus is largest known pachycephalosaur thick skull domes of pachycephalosaurus and related genera gave rise to hypothesis that pachycephalosaurs used their skulls in intra species combat this hypothesis has been disputed in recent years description thumb left size comparison of an adult p wyomingensis green potential growth stages and a human anatomy of pachycephalosaurus is poorly known as only skull remains have been described pachycephalosaurus is famous for having a large bony dome atop its skull up to 25 cm 10 in thick which safely cushioned its tiny brain dome s rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes projected upwards from snout spikes were probably blunt not sharp skull was short and possessed large rounded eye sockets that faced forward suggesting that animal had good eyesight and was capable of binocular vision pachycephalosaurus had a small muzzle which ended in a pointed beak teeth were tiny with leaf shaped crowns head was supported by an s or u shaped neck younger individuals of pachycephalosaurus maybe have had flatter skulls with larger horns projecting from back of skull as animal grew horns shrunk and rounded out as dome grew thumb restoration pachycephalosaurus was probably bipedal and was largest of pachycephalosaurid bone headed dinosaurs it has been estimated that pachycephalosaurus was about long and weighed about based on other pachycephalosaurids it probably had a fairly short thick neck short fore limbs a bulky body long hind legs and a heavy tail which was likely held rigid by ossified tendons history of discovery thumb left skull amnh 1696 remains attributable to pachycephalosaurus may have been found as early as 1850s as determined by donald baird in 1859 or 1860 ferdinand hayden an early fossil collector in north american west collected a bone fragment in vicinity of head of missouri river from what is now known to be lance formation in southeastern montana this specimen now ansp 8568 was described by joseph leidy in 1872 as belonging to dermal armor of a reptile or an armadillo like animal it became known as tylosteus its actual nature was not found until baird restudied it over a century later and identified it as a squamosal bone from back of skull of pachycephalosaurus including a set of bony knobs corresponding to those found on other specimens of pachycephalosaurus because name tylosteus predates pachycephalosaurus according to international code of zoological nomenclature tylosteus would normally be preferred in 1985 baird successfully petitioned to have pachycephalosaurus used instead of tylosteus because latter name had not been used for over fifty years was based on undiagnostic materials and had poor geographic and stratigraphic information iczn opinion 1371 pachycephalosaurus brown schlaikjer 1943 and troodon wyomingensis gilmore 1931 reptilia dinosauria conserved bulletin of zoological nomenclature 43 1 april 1986 this may not be end of story robert sullivan suggested in 2006 that ansp 8568 is more like corresponding bone of dracorex than that of pachycephalosaurus issue is of uncertain importance though if dracorex actually represents a juvenile pachycephalosaurus as has been recently proposed p wyomingensis type and currently only valid species of pachycephalosaurus was named by charles w gilmore in 1931 he coined it for partial skull usnm from lance formation of niobrara county wyoming gilmore assigned his new species to troodon as t wyomingensis at time paleontologists thought that troodon then known only from teeth was same as stegoceras which had similar teeth accordingly what are now known as pachycephalosaurids were assigned to family troodontidae a misconception not corrected until 1945 by charles m sternberg thumb holotype adult skull of p reinheimeri dmns 469 in 1943 barnum brown and erich maren schlaikjer with newer more complete material established genus pachycephalosaurus they named two species pachycephalosaurus grangeri type species of genus pachycephalosaurus and pachycephalosaurus reinheimeri p grangeri was based on amnh 1696 a nearly complete skull from hell creek formation of carter county montana p reinheimeri was based on what is now dmnh 469 a dome and a few associated elements from lance formation of corson county south dakota they also referred older species troodon wyomingensis to their new genus their two newer species have been considered synonymous with p wyomingensis since 1983 classification pachycephalosaurus gives its name to pachycephalosauria a clade of herbivorous ornithischian bird hipped dinosaurs which lived during late cretaceous period in north america and asia despite their bipedal stance they were likely more closely related to ceratopsians than ornithopods pachycephalosaurus is most famous member of pachycephalosauria though not best preserved member clade also includes wannanosaurus goyocephale stegoceras homalocephale sphaerotholus and prenocephale within tribe pachycephalosaurus is most closely related to dracorex and stygimoloch although these may be juvenile forms of pachycephalosaurus thumb casts of three skulls representing possible growth stages museum of rockies below is a cladogram modified from evans et al 2013 paleobiology growth thumb upright growth series showing reduction of spikes and growth of dome with age according to horner and goodwin pachycephalosaurs dracorex and stygimoloch may be specimens of pachycephalosaurus in which dome and horns are not well developed either because animal was a juvenile or a female this consideration was supported at 2007 annual meeting of society of vertebrate paleontology erik stokstad society of vertebrate paleontology meeting did horny young dinosaurs cause illusion of separate species science vol 18 23 nov 2007 p 1236 http www org cgi content full 318 1236 jack horner of montana state university presented evidence from analysis of skull of single existing dracorex specimen that this dinosaur may well be a juvenile form of stygimoloch in addition he presented data that indicates that both stygimoloch and dracorex may be juvenile forms of pachycephalosaurus horner and m b goodwin published their findings in 2009 showing that spike node and skull dome bones of all three species exhibit extreme plasticity and that both dracorex and stygimoloch are known only from juvenile specimens while pachycephalosaurus is known only from adult specimens these observations in addition to fact that all three forms lived in same time and place lead them to conclude that dracorex and stygimoloch were simply juvenile pachycephalosaurus which lost spikes and grew domes as they aged horner j r and goodwin m b 2009 extreme cranial ontogeny in upper cretaceous dinosaur pachycephalosaurus plos one 4 10 e7626 online full text discovery of baby skulls assigned to pachycephalosaurus that were described in 2016 from two different bone beds in hell creek formation have been presented as further evidence for this hypothesis fossils as described by david evans and mark goodwin et al are identical to all three supposed genera in placement of rugose knobs on their skulls and thus unique features of stygimoloch and dracorex are instead morphologically consistent features on a pachycephalosaurus growth curve this and further studies of different more mature skulls suggested that knobs present in skull developed very early in dinosaur s life while iconic domed head developed later a 2010 study by nick longrich and colleagues also supported hypothesis that all flat skulled pachycephalosaurs were juveniles suggesting that flat skulled forms like goyocephale and homalocephale represent juveniles of dome skulled adults longrich n

left thumb restoration of head butting subadults it has been commonly hypothesized that pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen where male individuals would ram each other headlong and that they would horizontally straighten their head neck and body in order to transmit stress during ramming however there have also been alternative suggestions that pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way primary argument that has been raised against head butting is that skull roof may not have adequately sustained impact associated with ramming as well as a lack of definitive evidence of scars or other damage on fossilized pachycephalosaurus skulls however more recent analyses have uncovered such damage see below furthermore cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae show that neck was carried in an s or u shaped curve rather than a straight orientation and thus unfit for transmitting stress from direct head butting lastly rounded shape of skull would lessen contacted surface area during head butting resulting in glancing blows thumb depressions on skull of specimen 2001 4 1 alternatively pachycephalosaurus and other pachycephalosaurid genera may have engaged in flank butting during intraspecific combat in this scenario an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly using intimidation displays to cow its rival if intimidation failed pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to side striking rival pachycephalosaur on its flank this hypothesis is supported by relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs which would have protected vital organs from trauma flank butting theory was first proposed by sues in 1978 and expanded upon by ken carpenter in 1997 thumb left restoration of a specimen with a cranial lesion in 2012 a study showed that cranial pathologies in a p wyomingensis specimen were likely due to agonistic behavior it was also proposed that similar damage in other pachycephalosaur specimens previously explained as taphonomic artifacts and bone absorptions may instead have been due to such behavior peterson et al 2013 studied cranial pathologies among pachycephalosauridae and found that 22 of all domes examined had lesions that are consistent with osteomyelitis an infection of bone resulting from penetrating trauma or trauma to tissue overlying skull leading to an infection of bone tissue this high rate of pathology lends more support to hypothesis that pachycephalosaurid domes were employed in intra specific combat peterson je c longrich nr 2013 distributions of cranial pathologies provide evidence for head butting in dome headed dinosaurs pachycephalosauridae plos one 8 7 doi 10 1371 journal pone pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis specimen bmr 4 5 was observed to have 23 lesions in its frontal bone and p wyomingensis specimen dmns 469 was observed to have 5 lesions frequency of trauma was comparable across different genera in pachycephalosaurid family despite fact that these genera vary with respect to size and architecture of their domes and fact that they existed during varying geologic periods these findings were in stark contrast with results from analysis of relatively flat headed pachycephalosaurids where there was an absence of pathology this would support hypothesis that these individuals represent either females or juveniles longrich nr sankey j tanke d 2010 texacephale langstoni a new genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosauria ornithischia from upper campanian

not have chewed tough fibrous plants as effectively as other dinosaurs of same period it is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves seeds and fruits sharp serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants it is also suspected that dinosaur may have included meat its diet most complete fossil jaw shows that it had serrated blade like front teeth reminiscent to those of carnivorous theropods paleoecology thumb pachycephalosaurus and other animals of hell creek formation nearly all pachycephalosaurus fossils have been recovered from lance formation and hell creek formation of western united states pachycephalosaurus possibly co existed alongside additional pachycephalosaur species of genera sphaerotholus as well as dracorex and stygimoloch though these last two genera may represent juveniles of pachycephalosaurus itself other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include thescelosaurus hadrosaurid edmontosaurus and a possible species of
