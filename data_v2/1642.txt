5 point favorite to win game and was predicted winner among most sportswriters ball state jumped out to an early lead via a wenning to snead touchdown and led at end of first quarter 7 0 after first

pregame buildup entering game ball state was a 9 5 point favorite and thus not surprisingly they were favored to win by college football analysts including all six of cbs sports analysts one sports blog ranked game as game providing worst entertainment value of 2013 14 bowl season however game was predicted to be a shootout ball state offense vs arkansas state defense matchup passing attack was predicted to have easy pickings particularly with keith wenning to willie snead connection that had eclipsed 100 yards in all but three games against arkansas state s secondary which struggled against pass compounding potential offensive success of ball state was their strong offensive line play against which arkansas state would need to sack quarterback a category in which they ranked 63rd best in country ball state offense coordinated by rick who was in his third year ball state s offense ranked ninth in country by averaging 333 passing yards per game 78th in country with 153 3 rushing yards
