hunger was a prevailing condition especially during winter months shankly p 13 he admitted that he and his friends used to steal vegetables from nearby farms bread biscuits and fruit from suppliers wagons and bags of coal from pits shankly pp 13 14 shankly admitted act was wrong but insisted it was done out of devilment only because root cause was their constant hunger he said that he and his friends learned from their mistakes and became better people in later years shankly p 14 he was at school from age five until 14 discipline at both home and school was strict but shankly said it was character building shankly p 15 his favourite subject was geography and he played football as often as possible especially in school playground but there was no organised school team shankly pp 15 16 after shankly left school in 1928 he worked at a local mine alongside his brother bob he did this for two years until pit closed and he faced unemployment kelly pp 17 18 in his autobiography he described life of a miner at some length and mentioned many of problems such as sheer hard work rats difficulties of eating and drinking at coal face worst problem was filth because miners never felt really clean even though they would go home to wash in a tub after each shift shankly p 18 while shankly was employed as a miner he played football as often as possible and sometimes went to glasgow to watch either celtic or rangers sharing his allegiance between two and ignoring sectarianism that divides glasgow kelly p 17 shankly developed his skills to point that he was unemployed for only a few months before carlisle united signed him he wrote that he had his football future worked out in his mind and that even when working in pit he was only killing time he always believed that it was only a matter of time before he became a professional player he explained that in football terms he had always been an optimist with a belief in his destiny and that was basis of his undying enthusiasm for sport shankly p 19 shankly s village team was called glenbuck a name probably derived from 11th hussars cherry pickers but he said club was near extinction when he had a trial and he never actually played for them shankly p 27 shankly aged 18 then played part of 1931 32 season for cronberry eglinton about 12 miles from glenbuck he used to cycle to and from ground cronberry were in cumnock district league although shankly had less than one full season at cronberry he acknowledged his debt to scottish junior football as he learned a lot mainly by listening to older players and especially his brothers playing career carlisle united shankly had a single season 1932 33 at carlisle united then relatively new to football league and playing in third division north their reserve side playing in north eastern league shankly was recommended by a scout called peter carruthers who had seen him playing for cronberry shankly p 34 he was invited for a month s trial and said it was first time he had left scotland he was signed after just one trial match for carlisle s reserves against middlesbrough reserves even though carlisle reserves lost match 6 0 shankly pp 34 35 a local newspaper report said that he had worked hard and might develop into a useful left back in fact he developed into a top class right half kelly p 19 shankly made his senior debut on 31 december 1932 in a 2 2 draw against rochdale and made 16 appearances for first team at end of season reserves won north eastern league cup defeating newcastle united reserves 1 0 in final in his 1976 autobiography shankly stated that he still had medal shankly p 35 at this stage of his career shankly was assessed as a hard running gritty right half position of wing half is now obsolete in football terminology but it was an important role at time of shankly s career when teams routinely played in a 2 3 5 formation wing halves right and left played outside centre half in middle three although some wing halves were more creative than defensive shankly s job was to win ball hence his emphasis on his tackling skills and move it forward so he was equivalent of what is called a holding midfielder in 21st century football whose displays brought him much praise and credit he was considered a promising key young player who was capable of taking carlisle to greater things he was paid four pounds ten shillings a week at carlisle which he considered a good wage as top rate at that time was eight pounds kelly p 21 shankly was happy at carlisle which was close to his home at glenbuck and he had settled in well with almost a guarantee of first team football when opportunity came for him to move on he was not convinced he wanted to leave preston north end soon after 1932 33 season ended shankly received a telegram from carlisle united asking him to return as soon as possible because another club wanted to sign him shankly p 37 arriving at carlisle he discovered that interested club was preston north end who had offered a transfer fee of ps500 terms for shankly personally were a fee of ps50 plus a ps10 signing on fee and wages of five pounds a week kelly p 23 shankly s initial reaction was that it was not enough and deal nearly fell through his brother alec pointed out to him that preston were in second division and a bigger club than carlisle with potential to regain first division status kelly p 24 alec persuaded him that opportunity was more important than what he would be paid immediately stressing that it was what he would get later that counted shankly took his brother s advice and signed preston contract in a railway carriage kelly p 25 shankly began his preston career in reserves who played in central league which was a higher standard than north eastern league shankly p 39 he made his first team debut on 9 december 1933 three months after his 20th birthday against hull city shankly created an early goal to help preston win 5 0 earning him praise in a national newspaper for his clever passing kelly p 29 with his wholehearted attitude and commitment to team he quickly established himself as a first team regular and became a crowd favourite preston fulfilled their potential and gained promotion to first division as runners up to grimsby town it was therefore a successful debut season for shankly who stayed with preston until he retired in 1949 his wage was increased to eight pounds a week with six pounds in summer shankly p 40 in a summary of 1933 34 season a preston correspondent walter pilkington wrote one of this season s discoveries bill shankly played with rare tenacity and uncommonly good ideas for a lad of 20 he is full of good football and possessed with unlimited energy he should go far in his autobiography shankly wrote that preston had more than held their own in 1934 35 season and club was not relegated again until end of 1948 49 season in which he left them shankly developed into a tough half back as good as any in football league kelly p 32 outstanding northern ireland international peter doherty recalled how shankly dogged his footsteps in one match and kept muttering great wee team north end great wee team subduing doherty completely as preston defeated manchester city 3 1 kelly p 31 in 1936 37 preston reached fa cup final but were well beaten 3 1 by sunderland at wembley stadium shankly p 41 preston recovered to reach 1938 fa cup final in which they defeated huddersfield town 1 0 with a penalty scored by george mutch in final minute of extra time as well as winning fa cup preston finished third in league that season marked pinnacle of shankly s playing career shankly had just reached his 26th birthday when second world war began and war claimed peak years of his playing career he joined royal air force raf and managed to play in numerous wartime league cup and exhibition matches for norwich city arsenal luton town and partick thistle depending on where he was stationed winning summer cup with glasgow club in 1945 thistle get cup but not all honour evening times 30 june 1945 via partick thistle history archive on 30 may 1942 he played a single game for liverpool in a 4 1 win over everton at anfield shankly was keen on boxing and fought as a middleweight in raf winning a trophy when he was stationed in manchester shankly p 52 he confirmed in his autobiography that his weight as an raf boxer was 159 pounds 72 kg and he was only six pounds 2 7 kg heavier than that in 1976 shankly met his wife nessie in raf she was in waaf and stationed at same camp and they married in 1944 kelly pp 50 51 with resumption of full league football again in 1946 47 season shankly returned to preston who held his registration but he was now 33 and coming to end of his playing days by 1949 he was preston s club captain but had lost his place in first team which was struggling against relegation despite having tom finney in side kelly p 57 shankly was a qualified masseur and had decided he wanted to become a coach so when carlisle united asked him to become their manager in march of that year he retired as a player and accepted job shankly pp 59 60 shankly s departure from preston was resented by some at club and he was refused a benefit match to which he felt entitled he described preston s attitude as biggest let down of his life in football shankly p 60 shankly had enormous admiration for tom finney and devotes more than three pages of his autobiography to finney s prowess as a footballer shankly pp 44 47 in 1970s shankly was asked how a current star compared to finney and shankly replied aye he s as good as tommy but then tommy s nearly 60 now when saturday comes half decent football book p 143 another preston player admired by shankly was his scottish international teammate andy beattie with whom he would later work in management shankly p 47 shankly was succeeded in preston team by tommy docherty and shankly told docherty that he should just put number four shirt on and let it run round by itself because it knows where to go scotland shankly played for scotland 12 times from 1938 to 1943 in five full and seven wartime internationals shankly p 6 he spoke of his unbelievable pride when playing for scotland against england and how when confronted by auld enemy scottish players would become william wallace or robert bruce for 90 minutes after pulling on blue jersey shankly p 20 shankly himself certainly had that spirit when playing for scotland as confirmed by alex james who said of shankly he is a real scotland player who will fight until he drops shankly made his international debut on 9 april 1938 against england at wembley scotland winning match 1 0 with a late goal by tommy walker nine of his scotland appearances were against england and others were against northern ireland wales and hungary he was scotland s captain in wartime match against england at hampden park attended by 78 000 people on 3 may 1941 but scotland lost that game 1 3 perhaps his most memorable international was wartime game at wembley on 18 april 1942 when scotland won 5 4 and shankly scored his only scotland goal a post match report said that scotland s success was inspired by busby shankly victory service when shankly and his future management rival matt busby combined to help scotland s cause according to liverpool website shankly s goal was probably strangest national goal ever he took a speculative shot towards goal from 50 yards and ball bounced over england goalkeeper s head and into net in january 1973 when shankly was subject of this is your life goal was shown and shankly commented that they all count and we won kelly p 48 style and technique shankly declared in his autobiography that he specialised in what he called art of tackling emphasising that it is an art shankly p 31 he wrote that he was never sent off or booked by a referee in his view art of tackling is in timing and sole object is to win ball he wrote that even if opponent is injured in tackle it is not a foul if you have timed everything right and you ve won ball his philosophy therefore was to play hard but fair with no cheating during his playing career shankly said he would not argue with referees he realised after taking advice of his brothers that it is a waste of time referee he wrote always wins in end shankly pp 29 30 shankly was always noted for his dedication to football and in his playing days would do his own training during summer months during summer of 1933 when he returned to glenbuck after completing his first season as a professional he decided to develop his throw in skills he was an early exponent of long throw in he practised by throwing balls over a row of houses and small boys of village helped by fetching them back for him management career shankly wrote in his autobiography that he had long prepared himself for a career as a football manager he had absorbed all coaching systems with any useful qualifications and had full confidence in his ability and in himself to be a leader for him he had done hard work and it was simply a question of waiting for an opportunity to present itself shankly summed up essential criteria for success in football management when he claimed he could speak common sense about game and could spot a good player shankly p 61 in spotting a player he always applied a basic formula which was that first and foremost player must have both ability and courage other attributes were physical fitness and willingness to work especially to struggle against odds carlisle united shankly began his managerial career at club where his professional playing career had started carlisle in 1948 49 season were struggling in bottom half of third division north and finding it difficult to attract southern based players because of town s geographic remoteness in far north of england shankly s work ethic transformed team who finished 15th in 1948 49 after he had been in charge for only last few matches they improved to ninth in 1949 50 and then to third in 1950 51 almost gaining promotion one of shankly s players at carlisle was geoff twentyman then a promising young centre half who was later transferred to liverpool after he retired from playing twentyman became chief scout at liverpool working with shankly and finding several outstandingly talented players kelly p 62 shankly used psychology to motivate his players for example telling them that opposition had had a very tiring journey and were not fit to play match he urged local population to support team and would use public address system at matches to tell crowd about his team changes and how his strategy was improving team shankly recalled that brunton park was dilapidated writing that main stand was falling to pieces and terraces derelict shankly p 62 he even burned all kit when team was travelling to lincoln city he saw a sportswear shop in doncaster and stopped coach to buy a full set of kit in which team played at lincoln kelly p 65 season ticket sales in 1950 51 reached an all time high and carlisle challenged strongly for promotion as well as achieving a draw with arsenal at highbury in fa cup it ended badly however because shankly accused club s board of reneging on a bonus promise for players should team finish in top three of league he resigned and accepted an offer from grimsby town shankly s overall record in league football at carlisle was 42 wins and 22 defeats from 95 matches grimsby town after an unsuccessful interview at liverpool kelly pp 73 74 shankly moved to manage grimsby town in june 1951 he said in his autobiography that there was greater potential at grimsby than at carlisle shankly p 66 his main problems were that grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons dropping from first to third division and some good players had been transferred before he arrived kelly p 76 even so shankly believed he still had good players to work with and was able to buy some additional players on transfer market for low fees grimsby made a strong challenge for promotion in 1951 52 but finished second three points behind lincoln city only one team was promoted from division three north with one from division three south shankly p 67 shankly insisted in his autobiography that his grimsby team was pound for pound and class for class best football team i have seen in england since war in league they were in they played football nobody else could play everything was measured planned and perfected and you could not wish to see more entertaining football shankly s biographer stephen kelly quotes pound for pound analysis but qualifies it as another of shankly s slight though well meant exaggerations kelly p 77 kelly added that this kind of talk by shankly could only boost morale at club shankly made great use of five a side football in training at grimsby playing these games as if they were competitive cup or league matches shankly p 68 games would last an hour each time shankly worked on set pieces such as throw ins and tried to devise a method of counter attacking from corners conceded grimsby s ageing team made a bright start in 1952 53 with five straight wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place kelly p 78 in 1953 54 shankly became disillusioned when board could not give him money to buy new players he was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to older players a fault that was to resurface at liverpool years later and he finally resigned in january 1954 citing board s lack of ambition as his main reason in his autobiography he said that he and his wife were feeling homesick in grimsby and when an opportunity came to manage workington he was attracted to challenge partly because they would be closer to scotland shankly s record in league football at grimsby was 62 wins and 35 defeats from 118 matches workington although workington team was close to bottom of third division north shankly saw it as a challenge and attacked job with all of his usual enthusiasm and relish workington rose to 18th by end of 1953 54 season and so did not have to apply for re election in 1954 55 team finished a creditable eighth and saw a rise in attendances from 6 000 to 8 000 workington operated on a shoestring and shankly had to do much of administration work himself including answering telephone and dealing with mail by using an old typewriter to answer letters in addition he had risky job of going to bank each week to collect payroll one of his main problems was sharing ground with local rugby league club and shankly was very concerned about damage done to playing surface by rugby players shankly pp 69 71 situation led to numerous arguments with club s board which as kelly records included a majority of rugby league men whose interest in football took second place to rugby kelly p 81 shankly resigned on 15 november 1955 to take up post of assistant manager at huddersfield town working with his old friend andy beattie kelly pp 90 91 his record in league football at workington was 35 wins and 27 defeats from 85 matches huddersfield town shankly s initial role at huddersfield was as reserve team coach he found himself in charge of several promising youngsters who soon graduated to first team after town were relegated to second division at end of 1955 56 season beattie resigned in next season and on 5 november 1956 shankly succeeded him as manager on christmas eve he gave a first team debut to 16 year old prospect denis law another prospect in his team was left back ray wilson who went on to become huddersfield s most capped player before joining everton kelly p 98 shankly did not gain promotion at huddersfield team finishing 12th in 1956 57 ninth in 1957 58 and 14th in 1958 59 other players in shankly s huddersfield team were ken taylor who was an england test cricketer striker les massie and captain bill mcgarry shankly p 75 on 21 december 1957 huddersfield lost 7 6 to charlton athletic who played most of match with ten men after huddersfield were leading 5 1 with just 27 minutes remaining shankly described it as one of most amazing games he had ever seen shankly p 82 on another occasion huddersfield beat liverpool 5 0 with ten men and shankly recalled liverpool directors leaving ground in single file as if they were in a funeral procession kelly p 111 disillusioned by a board that wanted to sell his best players without offering money to buy replacements shankly felt stifled by huddersfield s lack of ambition and was delighted in november 1959 to receive an approach for his services by liverpool he recalled how liverpool chairman tom t v williams asked him if he would like to manage best club in country to which shankly replied why is matt busby packing up shankly p 84 shankly decided to think about offer as he realised great potential at liverpool who like huddersfield were in second division at that time rumours began and were fuelled by liverpool s visit to leeds road on 28 november although huddersfield won game 1 0 shankly accepted liverpool offer and resigned his position as huddersfield manager at a board meeting on 1 december 1959 kelly p 120 his league record at huddersfield was 49 wins and 47 defeats in 129 matches liverpool early years 1959 1964 when shankly arrived at anfield on monday 14 december 1959 liverpool had been in second division for five years and had been defeated by non league worcester city in 1958 59 fa cup kelly p 136 anfield itself was in disrepair with no means of watering pitch and shankly insisted club spend ps3 000 to rectify that shankly p 85 shankly described training ground at melwood as a shambles liverpool squad he inherited consisted largely of average players and some promising reserves in spite of difficulties shankly felt immediately at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with supporters who he saw as his kind of people he quickly established working relationships with coaching staff of bob paisley joe fagan and reuben bennett who shared his views about loyalty to each other and to club kelly p 141 paisley s influence at liverpool was crucial for as kelly puts it shankly was great motivating force behind liverpool but it was paisley who was tactician kelly p 138 one aspect of quartet s legacy to football was conversion of an old storage room into what became known as boot room which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots although shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff playing staff were not so impressive indeed shankly said of latter shankly pp 87 88 after only one match i knew that team as a whole was not good enough i made up my mind that we needed strengthening through middle a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals and somebody up front to create goals and score them to deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad he placed 24 players on transfer list all of them had left club within one year shankly resolutely pursued his strength through middle goal and always knew which three players he needed to achieve it kelly p 146 melwood was overgrown and had only an old wooden cricket pavilion kelly p 142 shankly commented that one of pitches looked as if bombs had been dropped on it and he asked if germans had been over in war shankly p 87 he instituted a development programme to cultivate site and modernise facilities in meantime he arranged for players to meet and change at anfield before going to and from melwood by bus according to kelly liverpool s eventual success was based on hard work done in training system that shankly paisley fagan and bennett introduced at melwood shankly deplored long distance running on roads and insisted that apart from warm up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries players trained on grass using a ball everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups with purpose of achieving set targets five a side games as at all shankly s earlier clubs were at heart of system and he again insisted on these being as competitive as league matches kelly p 145 one particular routine designed to develop stamina reflexes and ball skills was sweat box which shankly described as using boards like walls of a house with players playing ball off one wall and on to next ball was played against boards you controlled it turned around and took it again shankly p 96 shankly got idea from a routine he had seen tom finney use at preston to hone his skills after experimenting with routine he set players a limit of two minutes per session system was geared to shankly s simple philosophy of pass and move which formed basis of liverpool s strategy shankly pp 96 97 shankly insisted on suitable cooling off periods after training now called warming down before players took a bath and had a meal team changed studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions shankly summarised entire strategy in terms of attention to detail with nothing left to chance shankly p 100 liverpool s recovery depended on new players being acquired and in his autobiography shankly recalled struggles he had with board to make them realise club s potential and need to spend money on good players he said there were times when he felt like walking out he found a valuable ally in eric sawyer of littlewoods pools organisation who joined board not long after shankly s appointment and shared shankly s vision of liverpool as best club in england at one board meeting in 1961 when shankly insisted club make offers for two players in scotland board s initial response was that they couldn t afford them but sawyer stepped in and said we can t afford not to buy them shankly pp 87 90 two scottish players were centre half ron yeats and centre forward ian st john from dundee united and motherwell respectively kelly pp 160 165 with sawyer s help shankly signed them both in spring of 1961 and challenged liverpool board to sack him if they couldn t play shankly pp 90 91 at a press conference when yeats came to liverpool shankly emphasised yeats height by inviting journalists to go and walk round him he s a colossus kelly p 165 goalkeeper tommy lawrence came through club s junior teams so shankly now had his strength through middle and team building continued with acquisition of wing half gordon milne from preston other players developed at anfield were jimmy melia ronnie moran alan a court and future england internationals gerry byrne and roger hunt shankly said of goalscorer hunt first time he saw him christ this one can play shankly p 91 liverpool had finished third in both 1959 60 and 1960 61 only top two clubs were promoted but new team gained promotion in 1961 62 season by winning second division championship hunt scoring 41 goals liverpool consolidated in 1962 63 finishing eighth in their first top flight season under shankly s management significant signings were wing half willie stevenson from rangers in 1962 and left winger peter thompson from preston in 1963 kelly pp 175 177 shankly described thompson deal as daylight robbery kelly p 177 liverpool s youth system produced more future england internationals in ian callaghan tommy smith and chris lawler shankly pp 97 99 hard work paid off in 1963 64 when liverpool won their sixth league championship title ending season with a 5 0 defeat of arsenal at anfield shankly p 94 according to roger hunt secret of liverpool s success was that under shankly they were fittest team in country kelly p 180 in 1964 jimmy melia was transferred to wolverhampton wanderers kelly p 184 with shankly buying arsenal s utility player geoff strong for ps40 000 and this was liverpool s last significant transfer activity until 1967 kelly p 188 1964 to 1970 one of shankly s greatest ambitions when he joined liverpool was to win fa cup and after he signed yeats and st john he told club directors that they would win it with these two players in team it was st john who scored winning goal in may 1965 when liverpool did win fa cup for first time in club s history with a 2 1 extra time victory over leeds united at wembley in his autobiography shankly recounted that among his many achievements winning 1965 fa cup final was his greatest day in football shankly p 102 liverpool made their european debut in 1964 65 competing in european cup and reaching semi finals in second round club was drawn against formidable anderlecht immediately before match shankly decided to experiment with liverpool kit liverpool played in red shirts with white shorts and white socks with red tops but shankly and ian st john had idea of an all red kit that would give impression players were taller liverpool played in all red only for european matches but quickly adopted colour permanently kelly p 199 three days after winning fa cup liverpool defeated european champions internazionale 3 1 at anfield in semi final first leg with a performance that was saluted by inter s coach helenio herrera kelly p 208 second leg at san siro remains controversial because according to shankly match was a war which liverpool lost 3 0 and so were knocked out of competition 4 3 on aggregate shankly p 105 eleven years later shankly maintained that two of inter s goals were illegal shankly p 106 even today liverpool website describes match by saying that liverpool were denied at semi final stage by a dishonest referee in milan according to kelly however video evidence shows that two disputed goals were actually legitimate kelly p 210 shankly said after defeat in milan that inter fans were going mad because they were so pleased to have beaten liverpool and he insisted it proved high standard to which liverpool team had raised itself in 1964 65 football league championship liverpool dropped from first to seventh with 13 fewer points than previous season perhaps due to exertion of lengthy participation in fa and european cups in 1965 66 liverpool regained league championship title and reached final of european cup winners cup at hampden park where they lost 2 1 in extra time to borussia dortmund shankly s summary of that final played on a wet night was that team didn t play well and gave away two silly goals shankly and paisley had learned a great deal about european football which liverpool would eventually turn into trophies their strategy in two legged ties would be containment away and attack at home kelly p 217 shankly had applied principle in a preliminary round tie against juventus when liverpool were away in first leg despite juventus taking lead after 81 minutes shankly ordered his players to ensure deficit was only one goal liverpool then switched to all out attack in second leg at anfield and won 2 0 2 1 aggregate liverpool began 1966 67 season by beating neighbours everton in fa charity shield match but team were never really in contention for major honours that season finishing fifth in league shankly recognised potential of blackpool teenager emlyn hughes a future england captain and signed him for ps65 000 in february 1967 liverpool s performance in 1966 67 european cup was poor and after struggling to overcome fc ploiesti in first round they were well beaten in last 16 by ajax amsterdam inspired by 19 year old johan cruyff shankly p 107 ajax won 7 3 on aggregate after defeating liverpool 5 1 in amsterdam several years later in his autobiography shankly still complained that match in amsterdam should never have started because of fog and although liverpool lost 5 1 he still thought liverpool would win tie at anfield although shankly claimed to have been about ajax defeat he acknowledged that he was examining team and planning ahead shankly p 108 liverpool site argues that shankly was mistaken in his decision at this time to postpone team rebuilding liverpool improved their league performances over next two years finishing third in 1967 68 and then second in 1968 69 although to shankly himself it was a mediocre time in late 1960s as we prepared for 1970s shankly p 109 shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped in 1967 he signed striker tony hateley from chelsea for a club record ps96 000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to coventry city only a year later he wrote that bad luck and injuries disrupted progress of two other prospects alf arrowsmith and gordon wallace shankly had compared latter to tom finney shankly p 110 in september 1968 he paid ps100 000 to wolverhampton wanderers for their teenage striker alun evans who thus became football s first ps100 000 teenager evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at club but shankly eventually had to sell him to aston villa he later recalled that evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which in shankly s opinion had a detrimental impact on his career shankly pp 110 111 only long term success that shankly had in transfer market in late 1960s was his signing of emlyn hughes who went on to captain liverpool to victory in european cup otherwise he did not significantly change team until 1969 70 season when liverpool finished fifth in league championship a long way behind winners their local rivals everton shankly was characteristically defiant whenever everton got better of liverpool and although he liked and respected everyone connected with everton would always talk up liverpool at everton s expense typical of this was his joke about city having two great football teams liverpool and liverpool reserves in 1969 70 fa cup quarter final liverpool played against struggling second division side watford at vicarage road and lost 1 0 after a very poor performance liverpool site records that defeat signalled end for st john hunt byrne yeats and lawrence incomers included ray clemence alec lindsay larry lloyd john toshack brian hall and steve heighway apart from hall who graduated through reserves they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even in case of heighway from non league football shankly pp 115 117 adding new players to tommy smith ian callaghan chris lawler and emlyn hughes shankly formed nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate english and european football in 1970s many of new players came to liverpool because of a new scouting system created by shankly in 1967 and placed under control of new chief scout geoff twentyman who had played for shankly at carlisle and had then spent several seasons at liverpool retiring shortly before shankly s appointment according to stephen kelly hiring twentyman as chief scout was perhaps shankly s finest signing ever kelly p 244 it was through twentyman that liverpool found new players and after shankly retired twentyman gave sterling service to bob paisley and joe fagan by finding players including phil neal alan hansen and ian rush kelly pp 245 246 as always shankly kept things simple and twentyman was told to look for a prospect s basic qualities which were abilities to pass ball and move into position to receive a pass hughes p 17 shankly also wanted twentyman to check player s personality and ensure he had right attitude for a professional footballer above all said twentyman he wanted to know if lad had heart to play for liverpool although shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and twentyman s brief was to find young players so he shankly could mould them into what he wanted hughes p 44 1970 to 1974 new team began promisingly in 1970 71 by retaining fifth place in league and reaching semi finals of inter cities fairs cup where they lost 0 1 to a very experienced leeds united side kelly pp 254 255 highlight of liverpool s european campaign that season was a 4 1 aggregate victory in quarter final over bayern munich kelly p 255 for first time since winning competition in 1965 liverpool reached fa cup final but as in fairs cup experience was major factor and shankly s young team were beaten 2 1 by league champions arsenal despite having taken lead in extra time through a steve heighway goal kelly p 258 watching from sidelines was another new player whom shankly had recently signed from scunthorpe united for ps35 000 on twentyman s recommendation kelly p 259 this was kevin keegan and he was such an important addition to new liverpool team that shankly devoted an entire chapter of his autobiography to him entitled a boy called keegan shankly pp 118 123 shankly summarised keegan as inspiration of new team shankly p 123 in keegan s first season 1971 72 liverpool missed out on winning league championship by a single point title going to brian clough s derby county shankly maintained that liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against derby and then had a good goal disallowed towards end of their final match against arsenal kelly p 262 both decisions cost team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place shankly took encouragement from team s overall form especially as they made a strong finish to season and he was confident of success in 1972 73 shankly p 125 shankly had always been noted for his use of psychology both to encourage his own players and to raise doubt in minds of opponents kelly pp 263 264 one of his lasting innovations is this is anfield plaque secured to wall above players tunnel kelly p 126 coupled with roar of crowd it was designed to intimidate in first match after it was erected liverpool defeated newcastle united 5 0 despite an attempt by malcolm macdonald to joke about sign shankly p 126 shankly would try to boost confidence of his own players by announcing that a key opponent was unfit when keegan was about to play against bobby moore for first time shankly told him that moore had been out at a night club and was hung over afterwards keegan having produced an outstanding performance against equally outstanding moore shankly told him that moore had been brilliant that day and keegan would never play against anyone better kelly p 264 in 1972 73 liverpool won club s eighth league title and their third under shankly kelly p 268 a massive bonus for club was winning uefa cup club s first european success kelly pp 272 280 in two legged final they faced borussia monchengladbach whom shankly rated best team in europe shankly p 131 first leg at anfield had to be played twice after an abandonment due to heavy rain which flooded pitch kelly p 278 shankly had left john toshack out of team but then having studied borussia defence recalled him for rematch following night toshack used his height and heading ability to great effect and created two goals for keegan as liverpool won 3 0 kelly pp 278 280 second leg in monchengladbach was a different story as borussia took an early 2 0 lead and shankly admitted he thought final was lost but liverpool held on to win final by an aggregate score of 3 2 kelly p 280 it was first time an english club had won both league title and a european trophy in same season shankly pp 131 132 liverpool were well beaten by red star belgrade in second round of 1973 74 european cup and lost out to leeds in league championship finishing second kelly pp 286 287 in third round of fa cup liverpool had to score a late equaliser to draw 2 2 at home against lowly doncaster rovers but recovered to win replay and then go all way to final kelly pp 287 288 in what proved to be shankly s last competitive game in charge liverpool produced a superb second half performance to defeat newcastle 3 0 at wembley kelly p 288 relationship with fans thumb right bill shankly during a lap of honour at anfield in april 1973 wearing scarf thrown to him by a liverpool fan in his autobiography shankly wrote right from start as a manager i e when he was at carlisle i tried to show that fans are people that matter you ve got to know how to treat them and have them on your side shankly p 63 this was particularly true at liverpool and shankly said he was made for liverpool where people that matter most are ones who come through turnstiles shankly p 175 he added that a manager has got to identify himself with people because their team is something that really matters to them in return he said support of liverpool fans for their team had been incredible in april 1973 when shankly and team were showing off league championship trophy to fans on kop he saw a policeman fling aside a liverpool scarf which had been thrown in shankly s direction shankly retrieved scarf and wore it he said to policeman don t you do that that s precious shankly p 138 shankly saw offer of scarf as a mark of respect which deserved his respect in return shankly emphasised importance of communication with supporters at carlisle he used to speak to them over public address system before matches rather than just putting a few lines in match programme he preferred to speak and explain his team changes and his views about previous match shankly pp 63 64 at workington he would answer supporters letters in person using an old typewriter shankly p 170 he said he preferred to phone business people as he would put as little as possible in writing when dealing with them he would readily obtain match tickets for fans whom he considered to be deserving cases and wrote in his autobiography that he would give people anything within reason shankly p 181 shankly formed a special bond with liverpool supporters and at end of 1961 62 season when liverpool won second division championship he told liverpool echo in all sincerity i can say that they are greatest crowd of supporters in game kelly p 171 in tommy smith s view shankly was completely in tune with city of liverpool he loved supporters and they loved him mainly because they knew he understood them smith p 285 retirement from liverpool shankly was 60 when liverpool won 1974 fa cup final and said in his autobiography that on returning to dressing room at end of match he felt tired from all years shankly p 141 his mind was made up and he knew he was going to retire his wife nessie had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not right time tommy smith said that shankly s feelings for nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision smith p 286 in 1974 he decided that he could leave liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret which was that he did not win european cup shankly p 142 shankly had considered retirement in previous years liverpool secretary peter robinson was initially blase in 1974 but when he realised shankly was serious this time tried to make him change his mind shankly s granddaughter karen gill said to observer in 2009 i think that perhaps it was tiredness that football had taken its toll on him in her 2006 book about her grandfather karen gill said shankly never professed anything privately about retirement that he did not declare publicly she did not agree that there was any hidden motive behind his decision and she thought brian clough s view about tiredness was probably correct gill p 218 shankly s retirement was officially and surprisingly announced at a press conference called by liverpool on 12 july 1974 chairman john smith said in his opening address it is with great regret that i as chairman of liverpool football club have to inform you that mr shankly has intimated that he wishes to retire from active participation in league football and board has with extreme reluctance accepted his decision i would like to at this stage place on record board s great appreciation of mr shankly s magnificent achievements over period of his managership shankly soon regretted his decision and tried to continue his involvement with club mainly by turning up for team training at melwood he said he still wanted involvement as club had become his life shankly p 143 he soon stopped going to melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking what he was doing there shankly p 144 he still attended matches but sat in stand away from directors and staff he was especially annoyed that liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as club s guest when finally he was invited to travel with them to away leg of 1976 uefa cup final in bruges he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting shankly contrasted liverpool s attitude with what he encountered at other clubs including liverpool s great rivals everton and manchester united where he was received warmly he recalled manchester united manager tommy docherty s comment to a liverpool director that he shankly was welcome at old trafford shankly p 145 about everton once his greatest rivals he wrote that he had been received more warmly by everton than by liverpool he said it was a scandal that he needed to say that about club he had helped to build from liverpool s point of view situation was that shankly had retired and club had to move on shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at melwood he was effectively undermining bob paisley s status as manager on one visit to melwood a player opined to shankly that paisley had make a good start in job shankly retorted i could have left a monkey in charge shankly s visits even went as far as actually taking over training tommy smith recalled that shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to paisley fagan and bennett about what needed to be done as a visitor at melwood he began to intervene and paisley s initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment eventually paisley had to point out to shankly that he did not work there any more that it was now paisley s team and that he had things which he wanted to do with team it is believed that shankly wanted a seat on liverpool board as matt busby had been given by manchester united after he retired as their manager in 1969 again what shankly did not understand was that his relations with board had often been acrimonious with several resignation threats and a statement made by shankly that at a football club there s a holy trinity players manager and supporters directors don t come into it they are only there to sign cheques although some club officials like secretary peter robinson wanted bygones to be bygones tommy smith summarised board s view as one of satisfaction that shankly had gone at last there was a perception that shankly was an overbearing figure who could use a position on board to be a back seat driver and board were well aware that matt busby s time as a manchester united director had been disastrous busby s successors had complained about being undermined by his continued presence at united who had been relegated in 1974 whilst liverpool s treatment of shankly may have seemed disrespectful they were acting in best interests of club and its new manager by pursuing same relentless winning ethic that shankly himself had instilled in any event their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by unprecedented haul of league championship titles and european cups won over next decade under bob paisley and joe fagan soon after shankly s retirement brian clough who himself had recently been sacked by leeds united was asked during a david frost interview whom in football management he respected to which clough replied well guy who had my total respect finished a few months ago at liverpool he s a one off there ll never been another one like shank never at all he absolutely lives game he was totally honest he believed implicitly in what he was doing and there was never ever a doubt when you either talked to him met him or anything he was above board he was above board he was one off later years thumb upright statue of shankly erected in 1997 outside kop at anfield shankly was awarded obe in november 1974 four months after he retired as liverpool manager he and nessie went to buckingham palace and according to kelly that was a rare day out for them kelly p 309 they continued to live in semi detached house at west derby near everton training ground at bellefield which they bought when they moved to liverpool in 1959 kelly p 306 after shankly s death in 1981 nessie lived there alone until she died in august 2002 shankly tried to keep busy in retirement and stay in touch with football he worked for radio city 96 7 a liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show once interviewing prime minister harold wilson and was a pundit on its football coverage he briefly took up advisory roles at wrexham and then at tranmere rovers helping former liverpool captain ron yeats at latter in november 1976 press speculated that shankly would make a return to management as successor to dave mackay at derby county but position went to colin murphy instead following year shankly privately expressed an interest in taking everton job a move which would have caused a sensation in football shankly stated they ve had enough of billy bingham

reaction tributes poured in from world of football especially from former players of all shankly s clubs liverpool chairman john smith summed them up with a simple but fitting in my opinion he was most outstanding and dynamic manager of century kelly p 313 liverpool erected 15 foot high cast iron shankly gates in front of anfield road stand inscribed you ll never walk alone they were opened by nessie shankly at a low key ceremony in august 1982 in 1997 a seven foot tall bronze statue of shankly was unveiled outside stadium it bears legend he made people happy from mid 1990s preston north

obsessive shankly was fanatical about liverpool and about football in general from coaching his players and arguing with journalists to fans in pubs all shankly ever wanted to do was talk about football and to be involved in football kelly p 3 as a result he had few interests outside game other than his family his wife nessie told kelly that shankly would spend time in garden mowing and weeding kelly p 293 she could rely on him to clean cooker when liverpool lost family holidays were limited to a week in blackpool where they always stayed at hotel one non football activity that shankly did enjoy was playing cards and ian st john said he loved it always taking part on long coach trips to away matches st john p 119 shankly was noted for his personality and his wit as a result he is oft quoted his most famous quotation is probably one that is often misquoted some people believe football is a matter of life and death i am very disappointed with that attitude i can assure you it is much much more important than that kelly wrote that although it was said half jokingly so far as shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said shankly had fully realised importance of football to its die hard fans himself included it had become too important kelly p 290 ian st john agreed that much of shankly s behaviour was bizarre but everything was done with a purpose because shankly always knew what he was doing and what he was saying st john p 92 in his autobiography shankly gave insights into his character such as his world view as a socialist explaining that socialism he believed in was not about politics but about collectivism with everyone working for each other and enjoying a share of rewards that was basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares rewards shankly p 32 he admitted to idolising robert burns whose birthplace was only 26 miles from glenbuck and he was inspired by many of burns philosophical quotations such as a man s a man for a that shankly p 33 shankly had no time for bigotry or prejudice especially arising from differences of religion he compared cities of glasgow and liverpool by saying that there is nothing like rangers celtic situation in liverpool because supporters of liverpool and everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football shankly s public persona

his sheep but could never hurt them kelly p 240 liverpool s perceived failings in late 1960s have been attributed to shankly s reluctance to drop his long serving players even though they were past
