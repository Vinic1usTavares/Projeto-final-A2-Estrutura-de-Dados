exact direction of forward movement was somewhat uncertain although a northwestward track was predicted on morning of october 15 visible satellite imagery suggested that center of circulation was located northeast of previous estimates thunderstorm activity organized close to center by 1400 utc and by 1800 utc depression was upgraded to tropical storm lester shortly thereafter storm took a

mid to upper level low pressure system developed and began to affect storm s circulation on october 19 thus weakening it slightly however early on october 20 hurricane regained organization and once again intensified lester strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115 mph 185 km h on october 22 about 355 miles 570 km southwest of manzanillo colima coinciding with its peak intensity a shortwave trough caused lester to stall before turning to southwest and weakening at 0200 utc on october 23 lester rapidly lost deep convection and weakened to category 1 status later that morning storm was downgraded to a tropical storm while tracking southwest by october 24 low level center of circulation became exposed from cloud structure and at 0000 utc on october 26 lester had degenerated into a tropical depression about 500 miles 805 km southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula shortly before dissipating preparations and impact right 210px thumb rainfall totals provided by
