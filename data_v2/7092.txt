although bayern had been waiting 23 years for a european cup title manchester united had had to wait even longer their only victory having come in 1968 their manager then was matt busby who had been seriously injured in munich air disaster which killed eight of his players on way back from a european cup tie in belgrade 10 years earlier before rebuilding team to become european cup winners busby died in 1994 day of 1999 champions league final would have been his 90th birthday although it was second champions league season to feature clubs that had not won their national leagues year before manchester united and bayern munich were first such clubs to reach final of competition ferris 2004 p 354 nevertheless both went into match as champions having won their domestic leagues in 1998 99

cole in first leg at old trafford giving them victory bayern munich had an easier time against yugoslavian champions winning 4 0 in first leg at olympiastadion with goals from stefan effenberg giovane elber alexander zickler and thorsten fink all scored in space of 17 second half minutes in second leg played at partizan s ground in belgrade an 88th minute goal from lothar matthaus rescued a 1 1 draw to give bayern a 5 1 win on aggregate group stage in group stage manchester united and bayern munich were drawn together in group d along with spanish champions barcelona and danish champions brondby in what was soon known as group of death united and bayern found themselves bottom of group after first round of matches in which bayern lost 2 1 away to brondby after surrendering a 1 0 lead in last three minutes united meanwhile played out a 3 3 draw at home to barcelona after twice giving up lead first group stage meeting between united and bayern took place at olympiastadion on matchday 2 and finished in a 2 2 draw elber opened scoring for bayern before goals from dwight yorke and paul scholes gave united lead only for a teddy sheringham own goal brought about by an error by

onto 10 points and took top spot in group going into final round of matches one point ahead of united qualification for quarter finals was only guaranteed for group winners meaning that both united and bayern had to play for victory in their final match against each other at old trafford united took lead just before half time through a roy keane strike from just outside penalty area however hasan salihamidzic equalised for bayern in 55th minute and game finished in a 1 1 draw result meant that bayern finished as group winners but united s points total was enough to see them go through as one of two group runners up with best record knockout stage in quarter finals bayern munich were drawn against group f winners and fellow german side kaiserslautern while manchester united were paired with group c winners internazionale two dwight yorke goals gave united a 2 0 win in their first leg at old trafford while bayern beat kaiserslautern by same scoreline at olympiastadion through goals from elber and effenberg in second leg nicola pulled a goal back for inter but paul scholes secured united s passage to semi finals with a late away goal meanwhile bayern won convincingly at kaiserslautern as goals from effenberg carsten jancker mario basler and an own goal from uwe rosler gave them a 4 0 win 6 0 on aggregate united again came up against italian opposition in semi finals facing juventus who had beaten greek side olympiacos in quarters and bayern were drawn against ukrainian side dynamo kyiv who beat reigning champions real madrid to reach semis both first legs finished as draws ryan giggs scored in injury time to secure a 1 1 home draw for manchester united after antonio conte had put juventus ahead midway through first half while bayern also had to come from behind to draw 3 3 in kiev a single goal from basler proved difference between bayern and dynamo in second leg giving germans a 4 3 aggregate win manchester united fell behind early in turin as filippo inzaghi scored twice in first 11 minutes goals from keane and yorke before half time levelled tie but gave united advantage on away goals before andy cole secured victory with winning goal seven minutes from time pre match venue and ticketing thumb capacity of camp nou stadium was reduced from over 100 000 to 92 000 for final camp nou stadium in barcelona spain was selected as venue for final at a meeting of uefa executive committee in lisbon portugal on 6 october 1998 selection process had begun more than four months earlier in may 1998 when fc barcelona submitted camp nou as a contender to host match in recognition of club s centenary year other venues in contention to host match were london s wembley stadium and marseille s stade velodrome but camp nou was considered by uefa s stadiums commission to be favourite for its superior security comfort and capacity camp nou had hosted one previous european cup final italian club milan s 4 0 victory over steaua bucuresti of romania in 1989 it had also hosted two cup winners cup finals in 1972 and 1982 latter was won on home turf by barcelona camp nou was constructed over three years from 1954 to 1957 as a replacement for barcelona s previous home nearby camp de les corts which had reached its limit for expansion original capacity of camp nou was just over 93 000 but its first major final 1972 cup winners cup final was attended by fewer than 25 000 spectators 1982 was stadium s busiest year to date hosting not only 1982 cup winners cup final but also five matches at fifa world cup including all three matches in group a of second group stage and semi final between poland and italy by then stadium s capacity had been increased to over 120 000 three years after hosting its first european cup final in 1989 camp nou was selected as principal stadium for football tournament at 1992 summer olympics in barcelona it was used as venue for one group match two quarter finals one semi final and both medal matches as host nation spain claimed gold following year stadium underwent a remodelling that reduced capacity to around 115 000 due to uefa regulations regarding standing at football matches camp nou s terraced sections were closed for 1999 champions league final reducing capacity to approximately 92 000 of these around two thirds were reserved for two finalist clubs approximately 30 000 tickets each remaining third was divided between fans of fc barcelona around 7 500 tickets uefa and competition sponsors ferris 2004 p 339 after an initial announcement that clubs would only receive 25 000 tickets each independent manchester united supporters association imusa called that figure ridiculous claiming it would push black market prices to astronomical levels group s spokesman lee suggested a figure closer to 50 000 would be more appropriate given stadium s usual capacity of around 115 000 despite club receiving only 30 000 tickets it was estimated that up to 100 000 manchester united fans travelled to barcelona for final paying around ps300 for flights and around ps1 000 for match tickets ferris 2004 p 346 many were able to buy tickets from touts who had paid up to ps400 to buy from barcelona fans who had bought through their club for equivalent of ps28 ferris 2004 pp 339 40 as well as reducing capacity of stadium uefa also mandated that camp nou pitch be narrowed by from to to match uefa s standard pitch size ferris 2004 p 327 match ball thumb left one of nike nk 800 geo balls used for final match ball for final was nike nk 800 geo a white ball with a standard 32 panel design it featured a large across two adjacent hexagonal panels with champions league logo on a pentagonal panel above and a pattern of five pointed stars similar to those used in uefa champions league logo over entire surface of ball match officials thumb upright pierluigi collina was referee for match match referee was pierluigi collina of italian football federation collina was promoted to fifa international referees list in 1995 and took charge of his first uefa cup matches in 1995 96 season he had only refereed eight champions league matches before 1999 final three of which came in group stage earlier in season including match between barcelona and bayern munich at camp nou on 4 november 1998 however he had also taken charge of four matches at 1996 summer olympics including final between nigeria and argentina and two group stage matches at 1998 fifa world cup collina was supported by fellow italian officials gennaro mazzei and claudio puglisi as assistant referees and fourth official fiorenzo treossi kits as both manchester united and bayern munich s primary kits featured significant amounts of red uefa regulations about kit clashes would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits however two clubs felt it would have been a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice manchester united won toss and therefore wore their usual european colours of red shirts white shorts and white socks while bayern wore silver shirts shorts and socks all with maroon trim ferris 2004 p 360 opening ceremony thumb left opening ceremony featured inflatable versions of recognisable barcelona landmarks prior to kick off opera singer montserrat caballe moving around field on back of a golf cart performed a live version of barcelona a song she recorded with late queen lead singer freddie mercury in 1987 accompanied by a recording of mercury on stadium s electronic screen opening ceremony featured inflatable versions of some of barcelona s most recognisable landmarks leith 1999 p 132 as well as flag bearers waving flags of crests of participating teams bayern munich s fans meanwhile created a tifo of name of their team with thousands of coloured cards match team selection manchester united left england two days before final first flying from manchester ringway airport to heathrow ferris 2004 p 328 where they boarded a concorde aircraft for flight to barcelona they stayed in melia gran hotel in town of sitges about down coast from barcelona ferris 2004 p 332 captain roy keane and midfielder paul scholes both missed out on final due to suspension manager alex ferguson had originally considered selecting ryan giggs to join nicky butt in central midfield but ultimately picked david beckham as a player who could help team control possession in middle of pitch with giggs on right wing and jesper blomqvist starting on left ferris 2004 p 338 keane had suffered an ankle injury in fa cup final that would keep him out until start of following season but his suspension rendered injury irrelevant to his selection norwegian defender henning berg also missed out through injury meaning that his compatriot ronny johnsen who had been an early contender to play alongside butt in midfield played in central defence alongside jaap stam who overcame an achilles injury with keane out goalkeeper peter schmeichel who in november 1998 had announced his intention to leave manchester united at end of season was named as captain for his final manchester united appearance this meant that both sides were captained by their goalkeepers as oliver kahn wore armband for bayern as manchester united s top two goalscorers throughout season andy cole and dwight yorke started up front leaving teddy sheringham who had played a part in both goals in fa cup final a few days earlier on bench also on bench were fellow striker ole gunnar solskjaer back up goalkeeper raimond van der gouw defenders david may phil neville and wes brown and midfielder jonathan greening bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld announced his team s line up for final two full days ahead of match injuries also impacted on his selections with french left back lizarazu and brazilian forward elber having suffered season ending knee injuries elber s absence resulted in bayern playing a three man attack of basler jancker and zickler while lizarazu was replaced on left flank by michael tarnat playing in a wing back role opposite markus babbel on right babbel was originally intended to play a man marking role on ryan giggs with his defensive abilities earning him selection ahead of more attack minded thomas strunz however this was nullified by giggs selection on right wing where he would play against tarnat bayern defence was anchored around sweeper matthaus who played behind thomas linke and ghana international samuel kuffour only non german in bayern side by comparison manchester united had four englishmen in their team linke and kuffour s partnership at centre back meant club captain thomas helmer had to settle for a place on bench stefan effenberg and jens jeremies played in central midfield for bayern with jeremies man marking david beckham summary first half thumb teams line up ahead of kick off six minutes into match ronny johnsen fouled bayern striker jancker just outside area and basler placed a low free kick around united wall to score first goal contrary to popular belief free kick was not a deflection but rather swerved into far bottom corner of peter schmeichel s goal despite bad start united began to dominate possession but failed to create any clear cut chances despite david beckham s tireless running they seemed to be badly missing influential midfielders paul scholes and roy keane bayern defence remained strong and well organised as andy cole found out when his close range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders as bayern began to look increasingly more dangerous on counter attack than their opponents did in possession jancker repeatedly tested united back four with a number of clever runs some of which were flagged offside cole once again found himself with a chance in bayern box but keeper oliver kahn hurried out of his goal to punch ball to safety at other end basler came close with another free kick before zickler sent a shot just wide from edge of box as half time approached united winger ryan giggs playing out of position on right sent a weak header towards kahn from a cole cross but that was as close as they were to come to a goal in first half second half german team started second half in a more positive mood with jancker forcing a save from schmeichel in first minute of restart basler was proving to be bayern s most dangerous player first firing a 30 yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for markus babbel who missed ball entirely united put together an attack when after a healthy period of possession giggs sent in a cross towards jesper blomqvist who could only knock ball over bar after a desperate stretch another chance for basler prompted alex ferguson to bring on striker teddy sheringham ottmar hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own bringing on mehmet scholl who immediately set up stefan effenberg for a long range shot which went narrowly wide schmeichel kept his side in game when tipping another effenberg shot over bar after 75 minutes scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20 yard chip after a run from basler but ball bounced back off post and into schmeichel s arms with game seemingly drifting away from english side ferguson introduced striker ole gunnar solskjaer with 10 minutes remaining substitute immediately forced kahn into a diving save with a header it was closest united had come to scoring all game a minute later bayern missed a chance to secure trophy when an overhead kick from jancker came off crossbar as game crept into last five minutes united s two substitutes forced kahn into more saves firstly through a sheringham volley and then from another solskjaer header injury time united won a corner just as fourth official indicated three minutes of injury time and with so little time left for an equaliser peter schmeichel ventured up to bayern s penalty area beckham flighted corner in just over schmeichel s head dwight yorke put ball back towards crowded area and after fink failed to clear sufficiently ball arrived at feet of ryan giggs on edge of area his right footed snap shot was weak and poorly struck but it went straight to sheringham who swiped at shot with his right foot and nestled ball in bottom corner of net goal was timed at 90 0 36 it looked as if having been behind for most of match united had forced extra time less than 30 seconds after subsequent kick off united forced another corner but schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from ferguson beckham again swung corner in finding head of sheringham who nodded ball down across face of goal solskjaer reacted fastest shot out a foot and poked ball into roof of bayern goal for united to take lead goal was timed at 90 2 17 solskjaer celebrated by sliding on his knees mimicking basler s earlier celebration before quickly being mobbed by united players substitutes and coaching staff schmeichel in his own penalty area cartwheeled with glee game restarted but many bayern players were overwhelmed with despair virtually unable to continue and needed assistance of referee pierluigi collina to drag themselves off ground collina 2004 p 108 they were stunned to have lost a game they had thought won just minutes before several celebratory flares had already been ignited by munich fans moments before united equalised and bayern munich ribbons had already been secured to trophy itself in preparation for presentation ceremony united held onto their lead to record their second european cup title kuffour broke down in tears after game beating floor in despair and jancker had collapsed in anguish matthaus had captained bayern in 1987 european cup final and

down to pitch to present european cup trophy already decorated with bayern ribbons harris 2013 p 261 when emerging from tunnel at final whistle he was stunned i can t believe it he later said winners are crying and losers are dancing harris 2013 p 272 when two teams went to collect their medals matthaus received his runners up medal but removed it from his neck almost immediately he would never win competition as a player having moved to play in united states for metrostars a year before bayern next won european cup in 2001 matthaus later commented that it was not best team that won but luckiest as captain of manchester united peter schmeichel should have received his medal last but instead he went up first before having to return to back of queue with alex ferguson pair then lifted trophy together surrounded by rest of manchester united s players including david may who climbed presentation podium to a position of prominence in celebration photographs ferris 2004 p 401 staying true to his word from earlier in season match was schmeichel s last in a manchester united shirt and a month later he signed for lisbon club sporting clube de portugal he spent two seasons in portugal before returning to england for spells with aston villa and manchester city it was also jesper blomqvist s last competitive appearance for club after playing in all four matches of club s pre season tour of australia and china in july 1999 he suffered a succession of knee injuries that ruled him out of competitive action for next two seasons he made two more appearances for first team during 2000 01 pre season campaign as well as three matches for reserves in september and october 2001 before a free transfer to everton in november that year for bayern munich substitutes thomas helmer and ali daei left club in summer of 1999 with helmer moving to england to play for sunderland and daei remaining in germany with hertha bsc bayern president franz beckenbauer recognised that it was a loss of concentration in last few minutes that led to his side s defeat that was cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close we already had victory in bag and there were only a few seconds to go but those few seconds were enough for manchester to get back into game we were playing well in last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory but in end manchester deservedly won manager ottmar hitzfeld seemed more stunned by result in his reaction i feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost it s really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about normally when opposition equalise you are expecting extra time and it was a shock to our team when they scored winner two minutes later it could take days or even weeks to recover from this but i must say that manchester are great champions thumb a winner s medal from 1999 champions league final on display in manchester

football fans as to whether 1999 manchester united team was greatest club side ever alongside past european cup winning teams it was such a significant achievement for an english football club that prime minister tony blair took time to watch part of match and congratulate manchester united from opening of new national assembly for wales in cardiff manchester united became first team to win european cup or champions league without being champions of europe or champions of their country preceding season they had finished second in 1997 98 season to arsenal but had qualified through uefa s expanded format which had been introduced a season earlier had bayern won cup they would have become first team to achieve this feat having also finished second in bundesliga to kaiserslautern season

silverware manchester united received ps2 million in prize money from uefa for winning competition on top of ps10 million they had already won just for reaching final by comparison bayern munich received ps1 6 million for finishing as runners up manchester united also received another financial boost in form of an increase in share price of their parent company on london stock exchange
