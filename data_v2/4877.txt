london class was a group of five predreadnought battleships built for british royal navy in late 1890s and early 1900s class comprised and ships of london class were very similar to preceding with main differences being their armour layout they were armed with a battery of four guns and they had top speed of they are sometimes referred to as being part of formidable class due to their similarity or as being a class of three ships with last two forming their own queen class five ships were built between 1898 and 1904 at portsmouth devonport and chatham dockyards all five ships of class served with mediterranean fleet at start of their careers their peacetime years were uneventful apart from accidental collisions with other ships starting in 1907 royal navy began transferring ships back to home waters where they served at various times with home fleet channel fleet and atlantic fleet in 1912 1913 london was used to test use of ramp launched airplanes from ships by 1912 all five members of class had been transferred to 5th battle squadron home fleet where they remained through outbreak of first world war in july 1914 after britain s entry into war in august ships escorted british expeditionary force to france venerable shelled german troops in october and bulwark was destroyed in an accidental magazine explosion in november beginning in march 1915 london class ships began to be transferred to mediterranean sea to participate in dardanelles campaign london queen and prince of wales supported landing at anzac cove in april but they were withdrawn in may to reinforce italian fleet blockading main fleet of austro hungarian navy in adriatic sea at same time venerable was transferred to dardanelles where she supported allied troops ashore in august before also being sent to adriatic at end of year queen was converted into a depot ship in late 1916 and london and venerable were withdrawn to britain where they were decommissioned and later converted into a minelayer and depot ship respectively prince of wales became a barracks ship in 1917 all four ships were ultimately sold for scrap in 1920 and broken up between 1920 and 1922 design thumb left line drawing of formidable class londons were identical in appearance for 1898 construction programme royal navy decided to build three additional battleships to counter russian naval building these became first members of london class these three ships were built to a design closely based on preceding out of a need to begin construction as quickly as possible in response to new russian ships a new design that was then under development which would become could be delayed to allow design staff to continue their work their similarity to formidables has led some historians such as tony gibbons to refer to them as a simple sub class of formidable design though they are generally referred to as being a distinct class main difference between londons and formidables was thinner deck armour a revised side protection arrangement in their bows and some other detail changes to armour scheme and consequent lower displacement two further london class ships were built and which were identical to other londons except that they had open 12 pounder gun batteries mounted in open on upper deck amidships and had a lower displacement these two ships were ordered to complete a full group of eight comparable ships between formidable and london classes queen and prince of wales were laid down after duncan class battleships that succeeded formidables and londons and were completed after duncans as well they are generally considered part of london class but difference in mounting of their 12 pounder guns their lower displacement and their later construction than duncans lead some authors to view them as constituting a queen class separate from formidable and london classes last of ships to commission prince of wales was last battleship for which director of naval construction sir william henry white had sole design responsibility she also was last of twenty nine battleships of formidable london and duncan classes commissioned between 1895 and 1904 which had all been based on single standard majestic design and reached their final development in queen and prince of wales general characteristics and machinery thumb left painting of london in 1899 ships of london class were long between perpendiculars and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of first three ships displaced normally and up to fully loaded while queen and prince of wales displaced and normally and fully loaded respectively they had two pole masts fitted with fighting tops each top carried a searchlight and four additional searchlights were mounted on forward and aft bridges ships hulls were divided with longitudinal bulkheads that should have allowed for counter flooding to offset underwater damage but equipment necessary to quickly flood a compartment was insufficient as was typical to many british pre dreadnought designs their standard crew numbered 714 officers and ratings though this varied over course of their careers during their prewar careers their total complement ranged from 724 to 768 though while serving as flagship of mediterranean fleet in 1908 queens crew numbered 803 including command staff after having been reduced to a depot ship in 1918 crew numbered just 361 ships were fitted with type 1 wireless telegraphy sets which were replaced with type 2 sets in 1909 1910 ships carried a number of small boats that varied over course of their careers including a variety of steam and sail pinnaces steam launches cutters galleys whalers three gigs dinghies and rafts london class ships were powered by a pair of 3 cylinder triple expansion engines that drove two inward turning screws steam for engines was provided by twenty belleville boilers except for queen which received thirteen babcock wilcox boilers each ship s boilers were divided into three boiler rooms and they were trunked into two funnels located amidships negative experiences with belleville boilers aboard formidable class ships led to decision to abandon type in favour of babcock wilcox type while queen and prince of wales were still under construction new boilers required alteration to boiler rooms prince of wales was to have received new boilers but construction of ship had proceeded too far by time decision was made to replace belleville boilers london class ships had a top speed of from on speed trials all five of ships slightly exceeded their design horsepower and speed reaching speeds of from they carried of coal for boilers though their maximum capacity was this provided them a cruising radius of at a speed of though prince of boilers were less efficient than those of her sisters and her cruising range was correspondingly slightly lower at armament and armour thumb illustration of london firing a broadside ships of london class had four 40 calibre mark ix guns mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft these guns were placed in bvi mountings in circular barbettes that allowed all around loading or elevation with exception of venerable which had bvii mountings instead each gun was supplied with 80 shells both types of mountings had a range of elevation from 5 degrees to 13 5 degrees bvi mounts required guns to return to 4 5 degrees to be loaded while bvii mounts allowed for loading at any angle guns had a muzzle velocity of and they were capable of penetrating 12 inches of krupp armour at a range of at their maximum elevation guns had a range of ships also carried twelve 45 calibre mark vii guns mounted in casemates which received 200 shells per gun guns had a muzzle velocity of these guns could penetrate 6 inches of krupp armour at maximum elevation was 14 degrees which allowed guns to engage targets out to for close range defence against torpedo boats first three ships carried sixteen 12 pounder guns in pivot mounts with 300 rounds per gun queen and prince of wales had fourteen of guns all five also had six 3 pounder guns two 12 pounder field guns and two machine guns as was customary for battleships of period they were also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in hull these were placed on broadside two abreast of each barbette london and her sister ships were protected with a mix of krupp armour harvey armour nickel steel and mild steel their armour arrangement was an incremental improvement over preceding formidables incorporating developments that had been made for duncans though with thicker armour than had been intended for duncan class ships they had an armoured belt that was thick in main portion of belt transverse bulkhead on aft end of belt was thick unlike previous british battleships forward part of central citadel was not capped with a transverse bulkhead instead this was omitted to save weight that was used to extend belt armour all way along side of ship albeit at reduced thicknesses forward of barbette belt was reduced to then tapered to then to and finally to at extreme end of bow their main battery turrets sides were thick and unlike earlier battleship classes that had curved turrets londons had flat faced turrets turret roofs were thick this change was a result of adoption of krupp armour which was easier to manufacture that way than harvey steel was turrets sat atop barbettes and casemate battery was protected with 6 in of krupp steel casemates had 2 inches of steel on their sides and backs their ammunition hoists were also protected with 2 inches of armour ships forward conning tower had thick sides as well while aft tower had 3 inch thick sides ships were fitted with two armoured decks thick respectively construction namebuilderlaid downlaunchedcompleted portsmouth dockyard 8

peacetime careers london and queen were involved in collisions with merchant ships in 1912 and 1909 respectively and prince of wales was accidentally rammed by submarine but none of battleships were significantly damaged throughout their peacetime careers ships were repeatedly overhauled and had minor modifications carried out including alterations to their light armament addition of searchlights and installation of improved fire control and wireless systems london was used in shipboard aviation experiments in 1912 1913 from their commissioning all five ships of london class served with mediterranean fleet with london bulwark and venerable being stationed there in 1902 queen and prince of wales joined them in 1904 though ships remained there for only a few years before being recalled to britain between 1907 and 1909 london and bulwark served with home fleet from 1907 to 1908 at which point they were transferred to channel fleet where they joined venerable which had been recalled from mediterranean that year queen and prince of wales were reassigned to atlantic fleet in 1908 and 1909 respectively venerable joined them there in 1909 followed by london in 1910 bulwark instead transferred back to 5th battle squadron of home fleet in 1909 where she remained until outbreak of first world war in 1914 other members of class joined her there in 1912 london transferred to 5th battle squadron and was used in experiments with flying off aircraft from may 1912 until 1913 employing a ramp built over her forecastle which had been transferred from battleship hibernia first world war thumb left venerable in malta in 1915 all five ships were mobilized as part of 5th battle squadron at britain s entry into first world war in august 1914 they were initially based in english channel and they helped to escort british expeditionary force across channel in august venerable was sent to bombard german positions along coast of flanders in october while queen was temporarily detached to guard against a rumoured german cruiser attack on 26 november bulwark was accidentally destroyed by an internal explosion probably result of improper ammunition handling procedures four surviving members of class remained in channel not seeing further action until early 1915 when in early march venerable was recalled to coast of flanders to shell german positions which she did through may that year at same time london queen and prince of wales were ordered to dardanelles where they were to join gallipoli campaign against ottoman empire three battleships joined british and french fleet for landings at cape helles and at anzac cove conducted on 25 april three ships supported landing of 3rd australian brigade at anzac cove over course of landing london queen and prince of wales provided covering fire as anzac troops advanced inland and helped to suppress ottoman artillery in may three ships were reassigned to 2nd detached squadron which was tasked with supporting italian regia marina royal navy in adriatic sea where it contained austro hungarian navy admiral paolo thaon di revel italian naval chief of staff believed that threat from austro hungarian submarines and naval mines in narrow waters of adriatic was too serious for him to use fleet in an active way he therefore kept his most modern battleships plus british ones at taranto to blockade austro hungarians also in may venerable was transferred from channel to dardanelles she supported allied forces ashore in august before being refit in october and transferred to 2nd detached squadron in december in late 1916 queen was converted into a depot ship to support otranto barrage she was gradually disarmed over following year with guns being sent ashore to strengthen italian artillery fighting in northern italy also in late 1916 london and venerable returned to britain where they were decommissioned in february 1917 prince of wales was also recalled to britain where she was reduced to a barracks ship from february to april 1918 london was converted into a minelayer and she operated in that role for rest of war at same time venerable became a depot ship supporting minelayers in north sea post war fates none of surviving ships remained in service long after end of war venerable was first to be decommissioned in december 1918 immediately after war london was reduced to a depot ship in january 1919 and was assigned to 3rd fleet queen returned to britain in april 1919 where she was placed for sale in may along with venerable queen and prince of wales were sold in 1920 and were broken up following year in britain london remained in service until january 1920 and in march was also placed for sale she and venerable were sold in june that year ultimately being scrapped in germany in 1922 notes references further reading external links dreadnought project category london class battleships
