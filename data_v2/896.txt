united states numbered highway system often called u s routes or u s highways is an integrated network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in contiguous united states as designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among states they are sometimes called federal highways but roadways were built and have always been maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926 route numbers and locations are coordinated by american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto only federal involvement in aashto is a seat for united states department of transportation generally north to south highways are odd numbered with lowest numbers in east and highest in west similarly east to west highways are typically even numbered with lowest numbers in north and highest in south major north south routes have numbers ending in 1 or 5 while major east west routes have numbers ending in 0 three digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways thus u s route 264 us 264 is a spur off us 64 some divided routes such as us and us exist to provide two alignments for one route special routes which can be labeled as alternate bypass or business depending on intended use provide a parallel routing to mainline u s highway before u s routes were designated auto trails designated by auto trail associations were main means of marking roads through united states in 1925 joint board on interstate highways recommended by american association of state highway officials aasho worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize roads after several meetings a final report was approved by u s department of agriculture in november 1925 they received complaints from across country about assignment of routes so board made several modifications u s highway system was approved on november 11 1926 as a result of compromises made to get u s highway system approved many routes were divided with alignments to serve different towns in subsequent years aashto called for such splits to be eliminated expansion of u s highway system continued until 1956 when interstate highway system was laid out and began construction under administration of president dwight d eisenhower after construction was completed many u s routes were replaced by interstate highways for through traffic despite interstate system u s highways still form many important regional connections and new routes are still being added system details in general u s routes do not have a minimum design standard unlike later interstate highways and are not usually built to freeway standards some stretches of u s routes do meet those standards many are designated using main streets of cities and towns through which they run new additions to system however must substantially meet current aashto design standards as of 1989 united states numbered highways system had a total length of except for toll bridges and tunnels very few u s routes are toll roads aashto policy says that a toll road may only be included as a special route and that a toll free routing between same termini shall continue to be retained and marked as a part of u s numbered system u s route 3 us 3 meets this obligation in new hampshire it does not follow tolled portions of everett turnpike but us routes in system do use parts of five toll roads us 51 uses part of jane addams memorial tollway in illinois old road is illinois route 251 us 278 uses tolled cross island parkway in south carolina old road is us 278 business us 301 is a toll road through delaware former routing is a free road and uses several delaware state routes us 412 uses cimarron turnpike in oklahoma old road is us 64 us 412 also uses cherokee turnpike in oklahoma old road is alternate us 412 numbering u s routes in contiguous united states follow a grid pattern in which odd numbered routes run generally north to south and even numbered routes run generally east to west usually one and two digit routes are major routes and three digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route odd numbers generally increase from east to west u s route 1 us 1 follows atlantic coast and us 101 follows pacific coast us 101 is one of many exceptions to standard numbering grid its first digit is 10 and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of us 1 even numbers tend to increase from north to south us 2 closely follows canadian border and us 98 hugs gulf coast longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0 however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless these guidelines are very rough and exceptions to all of basic numbering rules exist all over u s and are too numerous to list in 1950s numbering grid for new interstate highway system was established as intentionally opposite from us grid insofar as direction route numbers increase interstate highway numbers increase from west to east and south to north to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with us 50 and us 60 exceptions to this rule do occur in us highway system three digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two digit routes us 201 for example splits from us 1 at brunswick maine and runs north to canada not all spurs travel in same direction as their parents some are connected to their parents only by other spurs or not at all instead only traveling near their parents as originally assigned first digit of spurs increased from north to south and east to west along parent for example us 60 had spurs running from east to west designated as us 160 in missouri us 260 in oklahoma us 360 in texas and us 460 and us 560 in new mexico as with two digit routes three digit routes have been added removed extended and shortened parent child relationship is not always present aashto guidelines specifically prohibit interstate highways and u s routes from sharing a number within same state as with other guidelines exceptions exist across u s some two digit numbers have never been applied to any u s route including 39 47 86 and 88 signage route numbers are displayed on a distinctively shaped white shield with large black numerals in center often shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background each state manufactures their own signage and as such subtle variations exist all across united states individual states may use cut out or rectangular designs some have black outlines and california prints letters us above numerals one and two digit shields generally feature same large bold numerals on a square dimension shield while 3 digit routes may either use same shield with a narrower font or a wider rectangular dimension shield special routes may be indicated with a banner above route number or with a letter suffixed to route number signs are generally displayed in several different locations first they are shown along side of route at regular intervals or after major intersections called reassurance markers which shows route and nominal direction of travel second they are displayed at intersections with other major roads so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course third they can be displayed on large green guide signs that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways divided and special routes since 1926 some divided routes were designated to serve related areas and designate roughly equivalent splits of routes for instance us 11 splits into us 11e east and us 11w west in bristol virginia and routes rejoin in knoxville tennessee occasionally only one of two routes is suffixed us 6n in pennsylvania does not rejoin us 6 at its west end aashto has been trying to eliminate these since 1934 its current policy is to deny approval of new split routes and to eliminate existing ones as rapidly as state highway department and standing committee on highways can reach agreement with reference thereto special routes those with a banner such as alternate or bypass are also managed by aashto these are sometimes designated with lettered suffixes like a for alternate or b for business for example compare following for an alternate route in ohio naming official route log last published by aashto in 1989 has been named united states numbered highways since its initial publication in 1926 within route log u s route is used in table of contents while united states highway appears as heading for each route all reports of special committee on route numbering since 1989 use u s route and federal laws relating to highways use united states route or u s route more often than highway variants google searches on thomas loc gov for united states route u s route united states highway and u s highway use of u s route or u s highway on a local level depends on state with some states such as delaware using route and others such as colorado using highway history early auto trails in 1903 horatio nelson jackson became first documented person to drive an automobile from san francisco to new york using only a connection of dirt roads cow paths and railroad beds his journey covered by press became a national sensation and called for a system of long distance roads in early 1910s auto trail organizations most prominently lincoln highway began to spring up marking and promoting routes for new recreation of long distance automobile travel while many of these organizations worked with towns and states along route to improve roadways others simply chose a route based on towns that were willing to pay dues put up signs and did little else planning wisconsin was first state in u s to number its highways erecting signs in may 1918 other states soon followed in 1922 new england states got together to establish six state new england interstate routes behind scenes federal aid program had begun with passage of federal aid road act of 1916 providing 50 monetary support from federal government for improvement of major roads federal aid highway act of 1921 limited routes to 7 of each state s roads while 3 in every 7 roads had to be interstate in character identification of these main roads was completed in 1923 american association of state highway officials aasho formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards began to plan a system of marked and numbered interstate highways at its 1924 meeting aasho recommended that secretary of agriculture work with states to designate these routes secretary howard m gore appointed joint board on interstate highways as recommended by aasho on march 2 1925 board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal bureau of public roads officials at first meeting on april 20 and 21 group chose name u s highway as designation for routes they decided that system would not be limited to federal aid network if best route did not receive federal funds it would still be included tentative design for u s highway shield was also chosen based on shield found on great seal of united states auto trail associations rejected elimination of highway names six regional meetings were held to hammer out details may 15 for west may 27 for mississippi valley june 3 for great lakes june 8 for south june 15 for north atlantic and june 15 for new england representatives of auto trail associations were not able to formally address meetings however as a compromise they talked with joint board members associations finally settled on a general agreement with numbering plans as named trails would still be included tentative system added up to 81 000 miles 130 000 km 2 8 of public road mileage at time second full meeting was held august 3 and 4 1925 at that meeting discussion was held over appropriate density of routes william f williams of massachusetts and frederick s greene of new york favored a system of only major transcontinental highways while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance greene in particular intended new york s system to have four major through routes as an example to other states many states agreed in general with scope of system but believed midwest to have added too many routes to system group adopted shield with few modifications from original sketch at that meeting as well as decision to number rather than name routes a preliminary numbering system with eight major east west and ten major north south routes was deferred to a numbering committee without instructions after working with states to get their approval committee expanded highway system to 75 800 miles 122 000 km or 2 6 of total mileage over 50 more than plan approved august 4 skeleton of numbering plan was suggested on august 27 by edwin warley james of bpr who matched parity to direction and laid out a rough grid major routes from earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0 1 or 5 5 was soon relegated to less major status and short connections received three digit numbers based on main highway from which they spurred five man committee met september 25 and submitted final report to joint board secretary on october 26 board sent report to secretary of agriculture of october 30 and he approved it november 18 1925 disagreement and refinement 1925 26 thumb final u s highway plan as approved november 11 1926 new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route while lincoln highway association understood and supported plan partly because they were assured of getting us 30 designation as much as possible most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence at their january 14 15 1926 meeting aasho was flooded with complaints in northeast new york held out for fewer routes designated as us highways pennsylvania representative who had not attended local meetings convinced aasho to add a dense network of routes which had effect of giving six routes termini along state line only us 220 still ends near state line and now it ends at an intersection with future i 86 because us 20 seemed indirect passing through yellowstone national park idaho and oregon requested that us 30 be swapped with us 20 to pacific coast many local disputes arose related to committee s choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes which were often competing auto trails at their january meeting aasho approved first two of many split routes specifically us 40 between manhattan kansas and limon colorado and us 50 between baldwin city kansas and garden city kansas in effect each of two routes received same number with a directional suffix indicating its relation to other these splits were initially shown in log as for instance us 40 north and us 40 south but were always posted as simply us 40n and us 40s most heated argument however was issue of us 60 joint board had assigned that number to chicago los angeles route which ran more north south than west east in illinois and then angled sharply to southwest to oklahoma city from where it ran west to los angeles kentucky strongly objected to this designated route as it had been left off any of major east west routes instead receiving us 62 designation in january 1926 committee designated this along with part of us 52 east of ashland kentucky as us 60 they assigned us 62 to chicago los angeles route contingent on approval of states along former us 60 but missouri and oklahoma did object missouri had already printed maps and oklahoma had prepared signs a compromise was proposed in which us 60 would split at springfield missouri into us and us but both sides objected final solution resulted in assignment of us 66 to chicago los angeles portion of us highway which did not end in zero but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture being featured in song and films with 32 states already marking their routes plan was approved by aasho on november 11 1926 this plan included a number of directionally split routes several discontinuous routes including us 6 us 19 and us 50 and some termini at state lines by time first route log was published in april 1927 major numbering changes had been made in pennsylvania in order to align routes to existing auto trails in addition u s route 15 had been extended across virginia much of early criticism of u s highway system focused on choice of numbers to designate highways rather than names some thought a numbered highway system to be cold compared to more colorful names and historic value of auto trail systems new york times wrote traveler may shed tears as he drives lincoln highway or dream dreams as he speeds over jefferson highway but how can he get a kick out of 46 55 or 33 or 21 a popular song later promised get your kicks on route 66 writer ernest was quoted as saying logarithms will take place of legends and hokum for history expansion and adjustment 1926 56 thumb this sign photographed in 1941 on us 99 between seattle washington and portland oregon illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system national defense when u s numbered system was started in 1925 a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after number indicating north south east or west while a few roads in system are still numbered in this manner aasho believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible by absorption of one of optional routes into another route in 1934 aasho tried to eliminate many of split routes by removing them from log and designating one of each pair as a three digit or alternate route or in one case us 37 aasho described its renumbering concept in october 1934 issue of american highways wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two digit designation standard procedure assigns unqualified number to older or shorter route while other route uses same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying word alternate most states adhere to this approach however some maintain legacy routes that violate rules in various ways examples can be found in california mississippi nebraska oregon and tennessee in 1952 aasho permanently recognized splits in us 11 us 19 us 25 us 31 us 45 us 49 us 73 and us 99 for most part u s routes were primary means of inter city vehicle travel main exceptions were toll roads such as pennsylvania turnpike and parkway routes such as merritt parkway many of first high speed roads were u s highways gulf freeway carried us 75 pasadena freeway carried us 66 correspondence between division of highways and american association of state highway officials transcribed at and pulaski skyway carried us 1 and us 9 interstate era 1956 present thumb 100px 1961 version of u s route shield federal aid highway act of 1956 appropriated funding for interstate highway system to construct a vast network of freeways across country by 1957 aasho had decided to assign a new grid to new routes to be numbered in opposite directions as u s highway grid though interstate numbers were to supplement rather than replace u s route numbers in many cases especially in west us highways were rerouted along new interstates major decommissioning of former routes began with california s highway renumbering in 1964 1985 removal of us 66 is often seen as end of an era of us highways a few major connections not served by interstate highways include us 6 from hartford connecticut to providence rhode island and us 93 from phoenix arizona to las vegas nevada though latter is planned to be upgraded to interstate 11 three state capitals in contiguous u s are served only by u s routes dover delaware jefferson city missouri and pierre south dakota in 1995 national highway system was defined to include both interstate highway system and other roads designated as important to nation s economy defense and mobility aashto is in process of eliminating all intrastate u s highways less than in length as rapidly as state highway department and standing committee on highways of american association of state highway and transportation officials can reach agreement with reference thereto new additions to system must serve more than one state and substantially meet current aashto design standards a version of this policy has been in place since 1937 1925 routes original major transcontinental routes in 1925 along with auto trails which they roughly replaced were as follows us 1 fort kent maine to miami florida atlantic highway us 11 rouses point new york to new orleans louisiana us 21 cleveland ohio to jacksonville florida where it met us 1 us 31 mackinaw city michigan to mobile alabama us 41 copper harbor michigan to naples florida dixie highway us 51 hurley wisconsin to new orleans louisiana us 61 canadian border north of grand portage minnesota to new orleans louisiana us 71 international falls minnesota to baton rouge louisiana where it met us 61 jefferson highway us 81 canadian border north of pembina north dakota to laredo texas meridian highway us 91 great falls montana to south of las vegas nevada us 101 port angeles washington to san diego california pacific highway us 2 houlton maine to bonners ferry idaho us 10 detroit michigan to seattle washington national parks highway us 20 boston massachusetts to newport oregon us 30 atlantic city new jersey to salt lake city utah lincoln highway us 40 atlantic city new jersey to san francisco california victory highway us 50 annapolis maryland to wadsworth nevada where it met us 40 us 60 chicago illinois to los angeles california us 70 morehead city north carolina to holbrook arizona where it met us 60 us 80 savannah georgia to san diego california dixie overland highway us 90 jacksonville florida to van horn texas where it met us 80 old spanish trail us 10 us 60 and us 90 only ran about two thirds of way across country while us 11 and us 60 ran significantly diagonally us 60 s violation of two of conventions would prove to be one of major sticking points us 60 eventually was designated as us 66 in 1926 and later it became popular in culture us 101 continues east and
