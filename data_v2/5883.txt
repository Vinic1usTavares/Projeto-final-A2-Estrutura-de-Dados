sunday school lecture series since airing episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics kirk baird of las vegas sun named it fifth best episode of simpsons and central michigan life called it an instant classic pete oliva of north texas daily said episode proves that it is possible to laugh and cry at same time without being able to control either response bill gibron of dvd verdict said when flanders failed shows that even if simpsons is not dealing with famous celebrities or high profile places writers can still wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars flanders is a special creation in canon of humor a regular guy who is funny because of how hyper normal he is compared to his neanderthal neighbors focus on people who are left handed and whole idea of being a lefty is an unusual basis for a television show but then again nothing about simpsons is ever common hock guan teh of dvd town also praised writers saying they are able to craft a downtrodden tale for perpetually clueless flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by homer s guilt a memorable episode niel harvey of roanoke times called when flanders failed a classic bit of episode s reference to it s a wonderful life was named 26th greatest film reference in history of show by total film s nathan ditum nate meyers of digitally obsessed rated episode a of 5 and commented that perhaps it is not profound in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally but it handles topic in a serious manner while not compromising show s humor side story with bart stems from era of series when bart was big star but it still has some funny bits dvd movie guide s colin jacobson wrote mean homer equals funny homer so when flanders failed presents an above average show he seems unusually crude here which makes him amusing subplot with bart and his karate class also adds good material especially when he threatens to turn touch of death on lisa another sappy finish slightly mars this one but it remains generally solid kimberly potts of aol named it tenth best episode of show and commented schadenfreude is theme of this tight episode about homer s joy at failure of flanders leftorium store there are few times homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating flanders and using ned s yard sale grill and we haven t even mentioned bart s touch of death subplot winston salem journal s tim called it an outstanding episode references external links when flanders failed at
