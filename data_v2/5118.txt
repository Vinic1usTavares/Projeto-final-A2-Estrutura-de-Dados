around avonmouth railways first came to avonmouth in 1865 when services began on bristol port railway and pier bprp a self contained railway which ran along north bank of river avon to a deep water pier on severn estuary bprp line ran through site of current station and beyond to a terminus at first avonmouth station bprp ran into trouble by 1871 when terminal pier at avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build up of silt with no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to national rail network clifton extension railway cer was approved this was a joint venture by bprp great western railway gwr and midland railway mr which ran from sneyd park junction south of via to join up with national network at narroways hill junction link opened in 1877 but initially only for goods trains route from sneyd park junction to clifton down was subsequently cleared for passenger use on 3 august 1878 but midland and great western railways did not think bprp track was in a suitable condition and so refused to run any passenger trains beyond clifton down station originally known as avonmouth dock was opened in 1877 shortly after opening of avonmouth docks in february that year it was built on or very near to site of a halt built in 1868 for docks construction workers local area was still mostly rural there were a few buildings around station area as well as docks with closest extent of bristol conurbation away at shirehampton station cost ps275 to build and was merely a platform on south side of single track served by eight trains per day between and bprp s avonmouth terminus increasing to ten per day from 1887 great western and midland railways considered station inadequate for passenger numbers expected and so purchased additional land to enhance station with extra tracks new station comprised a wide island platform northern face on original through line southern face being for a new terminal line station now known as avonmouth dock joint was constructed using mainly wood and corrugated iron it was opened on 1 september 1885 coinciding with beginning of passenger services beyond clifton down great western initially offered six trains per day each direction between avonmouth dock and fearing competition bprp did not allow passengers to use gwr services between its stations midland railway did not run any passenger services beyond clifton down apart from a one month trial service in september 1885 despite increased traffic bprp suffered financially and was taken over by cer in 1890 bprp s avonmouth terminus closed to public in 1902 after which all trains terminated at avonmouth dock early twentieth century station went through numerous enhancements in first part of twentieth century a new platform canopy and urinal were provided in 1900 at a cost of ps250 further improvements followed in 1902 at a cost of ps80 and in august 1904 significant enhancements to station buildings and an extension of platform cost a total of ps1 570 a turntable was constructed in december 1903 with a signal box known as avonmouth dock passenger installed at end of platform dedicated goods staff were employed from start of 1904 with that year also seeing installation of a run around loop for terminal platform a small engine shed was added in january 1905 in 1910 some passenger trains once again began to run beyond avonmouth dock continuing towards on newly opened henbury loop line which allowed goods trains to docks to avoid steep clifton down tunnel other trains arrived from london via loop connecting with steamer services to canada and jamaica at this point there were 17 trains from bristol to avonmouth dock and 15 back each day increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920 station was well staffed with 25 station staff and 47 goods staff in 1913 positions included stationmaster booking clerks posters and outdoor porters who took goods to ships in docks during first world war an army remount service depot was located near shirehampton over course of war avonmouth dock joint handled 35 000 animals mainly horses and mules en route to depot july 1917 saw introduction of platform tickets to capitalise on people using station to bid farewell to friends heading overseas or to welcome those returning platform was lengthened to in december 1917 a second through track was added in 1918 and so a new cinder covered platform was built on north side of line two platforms were linked by a footbridge and a level crossing cost of new platform and lengthening works was ps7 420 after war construction of bristol portway along avon gorge necessitated closure of line from sneyd park junction to hotwells with trains along it ceasing on 3 july 1922 by this point there were nine trains per day from hotwells and eight return to compensate for loss of service great western provided an additional four trains daily from avonmouth dock to bristol and six return in 1923 grouping resulted in midland railway being absorbed into london midland and scottish railway lms and line continued in a joint arrangement between great western and lms engine shed was closed in 1924 by mid 1920s station was proving inadequate for passenger numbers and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926 new buildings were made of brick with a large four building containing most of facilities as well as a separate parcels office northern platform had a wooden awning built which is still in place today from 1928 many services to avonmouth dock were extended to by 1947 just before railways were nationalised there were 33 services each direction between avonmouth dock and temple meads with 18 on sundays some trains made circular trips to and from temple meads via clifton down and henbury or british rail and privatisation thumb station in 1992 looking along lines towards bristol when railways were nationalised in 1948 services at avonmouth dock came under aegis of western region of british railways by 1955 service levels had decreased slightly to 28 trains per day from bristol and 29 return but services were at regular intervals passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as result of a fare increase and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted which lost more passengers a year later in 1963 beeching report suggested complete withdrawal of services along line but ultimately only those beyond severn beach or via henbury were withdrawn goods services from station ended on 20 june 1966 same day that station was renamed avonmouth bay platform was taken out of use and land later taken for industrial buildings from 17 july 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along line including avonmouth with tickets issued by train guard station buildings on island platform survived into 1970s as did footbridge but with exception of parcels office all were later demolished parcels office was in use in 2006 as a hairdressing salon signal box was closed in january 1969 and in september 1973 wooden level crossing gates were replaced by automatic lifting barriers by 1974 service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction with no sunday services to severn beach british rail was split into business led sectors in 1980s at which time operations at avonmouth passed to regional railways at this time all trains ran to severn beach but service pattern was irregular this changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was introduced for peak times but northbound services were terminated at avonmouth when railway was privatised in 1997 local services were franchised to wales west which was succeeded by wessex trains an arm of national express in 2001 following action by friends of severn beach railway and a string of protests services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005 with bristol city council providing a subsidy to wessex trains wessex franchise was amalgamated with great western franchise into greater western franchise from 2006 and responsibility passed to first great western a subsidiary company of firstgroup subsequently rebranded as great western railway in 2015 a minimum service requirement was written into franchise agreement ensuring an hourly service along line and this has since been increased to three trains every two hours 25 trains per day sunday services to severn beach were restored in 2010 thumb old parcel facility last surviving station building was demolished in 2015 final remaining station building old parcels office was demolished in 2015 local rail campaigners including friends of suburban bristol railways and mp charlotte leslie petitioned to prevent demolition however network rail stated that cost of restoration was too high and that it had become a safety risk future first great western declined a contractual option to continue greater western passenger franchise of which services at avonmouth are a part beyond 2013 citing a desire for a longer term contract due to impending upgrade to great western main line franchise was put out to tender but process was halted and later scrapped due to fallout from collapse of intercity west coast franchise competition a two year franchise extension until september 2015 was agreed in october 2013 and subsequently extended until march 2019 with coming upgrade to great western main line main line from london to bristol is due to be electrified by 2016 however electrification will not extend beyond main lines so avonmouth will continue to be served by diesel trains stephen williams mp for bristol west and group friends of suburban bristol railways support electrification being extended to severn beach line improved services at avonmouth are called for as part of greater bristol metro scheme a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in bristol area there is an aspiration for half hourly services with trains towards bristol terminating alternately at and however due to large sections of severn beach line which are single track and to congested main line from temple meads such frequency is not currently feasible enhancement scheme was given go ahead in july 2012 as part of city deal whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by government there are also calls for reopening of henbury loop line which could allow a direct service from avonmouth to plans for a loop were rejected by west of england joint transport board however bristol city councillors voted to send decision back to board for further discussion see also public transport in bristol notes
