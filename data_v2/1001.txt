helicobacter pylori previously known as campylobacter pylori is a gram negative microaerophilic bacterium usually found in stomach it was identified in 1982 by australian doctors barry marshall and robin warren who found that it was present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause it is also linked to development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer however over 80 of individuals infected with bacterium are asymptomatic and it may play an important role in natural stomach ecology more than 50 of world s population has h pylori in their upper gastrointestinal tracts infection is more common in developing countries h pylori s helical shape from which genus name derives is thought to have evolved to penetrate lining of stomach signs and symptoms up to 90 of people infected with h pylori never experience symptoms or complications acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain stomach ache or nausea where this develops into chronic gastritis symptoms if present are often those of dyspepsia stomach pains nausea bloating belching and sometimes vomiting or black stool individuals infected with h pylori have a 10 to 20 lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2 risk of acquiring stomach cancer inflammation of pyloric antrum is more likely to lead to duodenal ulcers while inflammation of corpus body of stomach is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma however h pylori possibly plays a role only in first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis a meta analysis conducted in 2009 concluded eradication of h pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals suggesting continued presence of h pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65 for gastric cancers in terms of absolute risk increase was from 1 1 to 1 7 helicobacter pylori has been associated with colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer it may also be associated with eye disease pain typically occurs when stomach is empty between meals and in early morning hours but it can also occur at other times less common ulcer symptoms include nausea vomiting and loss of appetite bleeding can also occur prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue if bleeding is heavy or melena may occur microbiology morphology helicobacter pylori is a helix shaped classified as a curved rod not gram negative bacterium about 3 mm long with a diameter of about 0 5mm h pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by gram stain stain eosin stain warthin starry silver stain orange stain and phase contrast microscopy it is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but form helicobacter pylori has four to six flagella at same location all gastric and enterohepatic helicobacter species are highly motile owing to flagella characteristic sheathed filaments of helicobacter are composed of two and flab physiology helicobacter pylori is microaerophilic that is it requires oxygen but at lower concentration than in atmosphere it contains a that can produce energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen h2 made by intestinal bacteria it produces oxidase catalase and urease h pylori possesses five major outer membrane protein families largest family includes known and putative adhesins other four families are iron transporters flagellum associated proteins and proteins of unknown function like other typical gram negative bacteria outer membrane of h pylori consists of and lps o antigen of lps may be and mimic lewis blood group antigens found on gastric epithelium outer membrane also contains cholesterol glucosides which are present in few other bacteria genome helicobacter pylori consists of a large diversity of strains and hundreds of genomes have been completely sequenced genome of strain 26695 consists of about 1 7 million base pairs with some 1 576 genes pan genome that is a combined set of 30 sequenced strains encodes 2 239 protein families orthologous groups ogs among them 1248 ogs are conserved in all 30 strains and represent universal core remaining 991 ogs correspond to accessory genome in which 277 ogs are unique i e ogs present in only one strain transcriptome in 2010 sharma et al presented a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single nucleotide resolution by differential rna seq that confirmed known acid induction of major virulence loci such as urease ure or cag pathogenicity island see below more importantly this study identified a total of 1 907 transcriptional start sites 337 primary and 126 additional and 66 until 2010 only about 55 transcriptional start sites tsss were known in this species notably 27 of primary tsss are also antisense tsss indicating that similar to e coli antisense transcription occurs across entire h pylori genome at least one antisense tss is associated with about 46 of all open reading frames including many housekeeping genes most about 50 of 5 are 20 40 nucleotides nt in length and support motif located about 6 nt median distance upstream of start codons as consensus shine sequence in h pylori genes involved in virulence and pathogenesis study of h pylori genome is centered on attempts to understand pathogenesis ability of this organism to cause disease about 29 of loci have a colonization defect when mutated two of sequenced strains have an around 40 kb long cag pathogenicity island a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis that contains over 40 genes this pathogenicity island is usually absent from h pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of h pylori but remain asymptomatic caga gene codes for one of major h pylori virulence proteins bacterial strains with caga gene are associated with an ability to cause ulcers caga gene codes for a relatively long 1186 amino acid protein cag pathogenicity island pai has about 30 genes part of which code for a complex type iv secretion system low gc content of cag pai relative to rest of helicobacter genome suggests island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species pathophysiology adaptation to stomach thumbnail diagram showing how h pylori reaches epithelium of stomach to avoid acidic environment of interior of stomach lumen h pylori uses its flagella to burrow into mucus lining of stomach to reach epithelial cells underneath where it is less acidic h pylori is able to sense ph gradient in mucus and move towards less acidic region chemotaxis this also keeps bacteria from being swept away into lumen with bacteria s mucus environment which is constantly moving from its site of creation at epithelium to its dissolution at lumen interface thumb h pylori urease enzyme diagram h pylori is found in mucus on inner surface of epithelium and occasionally inside epithelial cells themselves it adheres to epithelial cells by producing adhesins which bind to lipids and carbohydrates in epithelial cell membrane one such adhesin baba binds to lewis b antigen displayed on surface of stomach epithelial cells h pylori adherence via baba is acid sensitive and can be fully reversed by increased ph it has been proposed that baba s acid responsiveness enables adherence while also allowing an effective escape from unfavorable environment at ph that is harmful to organism another such adhesin saba binds to increased levels of lewis x antigen expressed on gastric mucosa in addition to using chemotaxis to avoid areas of low ph h pylori also neutralizes acid in its environment by producing large amounts of urease which breaks down urea present in stomach to carbon dioxide and ammonia these react with strong acids in environment to produce a neutralized area around h pylori urease knockout mutants are incapable of colonization in fact urease expression is not only required for establishing initial colonization but also for maintaining chronic infection inflammation gastritis and ulcer helicobacter pylori harms stomach and duodenal linings by several mechanisms ammonia produced to regulate ph is toxic to epithelial cells as are biochemicals produced by h pylori such as proteases vacuolating cytotoxin a vaca this damages epithelial cells disrupts tight junctions and causes apoptosis and certain cytotoxin associated gene caga can also cause inflammation and is potentially a carcinogen colonization of stomach by h pylori can result in chronic gastritis an inflammation of stomach lining at site of infection helicobacter cysteine rich proteins hcp particularly are known to trigger an immune response causing inflammation h pylori has been shown to increase levels of in h pylori positive gastritis chronic gastritis is likely to underlie h pylori related diseases ulcers in stomach and duodenum result when consequences of inflammation allow stomach acid and digestive enzyme pepsin to overwhelm mechanisms that protect stomach and duodenal mucous membranes location of colonization of h pylori which affects location of ulcer depends on acidity of stomach in people producing large amounts of acid h pylori colonizes near pyloric antrum exit to duodenum to avoid acid secreting parietal cells at fundus near entrance to stomach in people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid h pylori can also colonize rest of stomach inflammatory response caused by bacteria colonizing near pyloric antrum induces g cells in antrum to secrete hormone gastrin which travels through bloodstream to parietal cells in fundus gastrin stimulates parietal cells to secrete more acid into stomach lumen and over time increases number of parietal cells as well increased acid load damages duodenum which may eventually result in ulcers forming in duodenum when h pylori colonizes other areas of stomach inflammatory response can result in atrophy of stomach lining and eventually ulcers in stomach this also may increase risk of stomach cancer cag pathogenicity island pathogenicity of h pylori may be increased by genes of cag pathogenicity island about 50 70 of h pylori strains in western countries carry it western people infected with strains carrying cag pai have a stronger inflammatory response in stomach and are at a greater risk of developing peptic ulcers or stomach cancer than those infected with strains lacking island following attachment of h pylori to stomach epithelial cells type iv secretion system expressed by cag pai injects inflammation inducing agent peptidoglycan from their own cell walls into epithelial cells injected peptidoglycan is recognized by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor immune sensor which then stimulates expression of cytokines that promote inflammation type iv secretion apparatus also injects cag pai encoded protein caga into stomach s epithelial cells where it disrupts cytoskeleton adherence to adjacent cells intracellular signaling cell polarity and other cellular activities once inside cell caga protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a host cell membrane associated tyrosine kinase tk caga then activates protein tyrosine phosphatase pathogenic strains of h pylori have been shown to activate epidermal growth factor receptor egfr a membrane protein with a tk domain activation of egfr by h pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis a c terminal region of caga protein amino acids 873 1002 has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation a great deal of diversity exists between strains of h pylori and strain that infects a person can predict outcome cancer two related mechanisms by which h pylori could promote cancer are under investigation one mechanism involves enhanced production of free radicals near h pylori and an increased rate of host cell mutation other proposed mechanism has been called a perigenetic pathway and involves enhancement of transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell proteins such as adhesion proteins h pylori has been proposed to induce inflammation and locally high levels of tnf a and or interleukin 6 il 6 according to proposed perigenetic mechanism inflammation associated signaling molecules such as tnf a can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without need for additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins strain of h pylori a person is exposed to may influence risk of developing gastric cancer strains of h pylori that produce high levels of two proteins vacuolating toxin a vaca and cytotoxin associated gene a caga appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely these proteins are directly toxic to cells lining stomach and signal strongly to immune system that an invasion is under way as a result of bacterial presence neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in tissue to fight bacteria assault survival of helicobacter pylori pathogenesis of h pylori depends on its ability to survive in harsh gastric environment characterized by acidity peristalsis and attack by phagocytes accompanied by release of reactive oxygen species in particular h pylori elicits an oxidative stress response during host colonization this oxidative stress response induces potentially lethal and mutagenic oxidative dna adducts in h pylori genome vulnerability to oxidative stress and oxidative dna damage occurs commonly in many studied bacterial pathogens including streptococcus pneumoniae s and h pylori for each of these pathogens surviving dna damage induced by oxidative stress appears supported by transformation mediated recombinational repair thus transformation and recombinational repair appear to contribute to successful infection transformation transfer of dna from one bacterial cell to another through intervening medium appears to be part of an adaptation for dna repair h pylori is naturally competent for transformation while many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions such as starvation h pylori is competent throughout logarithmic growth all organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause dna damage in h pylori homologous recombination is required for repairing dna double strand breaks dsbs addab helicase nuclease complex dsbs and loads reca onto single strand dna ssdna which then mediates strand exchange leading to homologous recombination and repair requirement of reca plus addab for efficient gastric colonization suggests in stomach h pylori is either exposed to double strand dna damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination mediated event in particular natural transformation is increased by dna damage in h pylori and a connection exists between dna damage response and dna uptake in h pylori suggesting natural competence contributes to persistence of h pylori in its human host and explains retention of competence in most clinical isolates ruvc protein is essential to process of recombinational repair since it resolves intermediates in this process termed holliday junctions h pylori mutants that are defective in ruvc have increased sensitivity to dna damaging agents and to oxidative stress exhibit reduced survival within macrophages and are unable to establish successful infection in a mouse model similarly recn protein plays an important role in dsb repair in h pylori an h pylori recn mutant displays an attenuated ability to colonize mouse stomachs highlighting importance of recombinational dna repair in survival of h pylori within its host diagnosis thumb right h pylori colonized on surface of regenerative epithelium warthin starry silver stain colonization with h pylori is not a disease in and of itself but a condition associated with a number of disorders of upper gastrointestinal tract testing for h pylori is not routinely recommended testing is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low grade gastric malt lymphoma is present after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer for first degree relatives with gastric cancer and in certain cases of dyspepsia several methods of testing exist including invasive and noninvasive testing methods noninvasive tests for h pylori infection may be suitable and include blood antibody tests stool antigen tests or carbon urea breath test in which patient drinks 14c or 13c labelled urea which bacterium producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in breath it is not known which non invasive test is more accurate for diagnosing a h pylori infection and clinical significance of levels obtained with these tests are not clear some drugs can affect h pylori urease activity and give false negatives with urea based tests an endoscopic biopsy is an invasive means to test for h pylori infection low level infections can be missed by biopsy so multiple samples are recommended most accurate method for detecting h pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture transmission helicobacter pylori is contagious although exact route of transmission is not known person to person transmission by either oral oral or fecal oral route is most likely consistent with these transmission routes bacteria have been isolated from feces saliva and dental plaque of some infected people findings suggest h pylori is more easily transmitted by gastric mucus than saliva transmission occurs mainly within families in developed nations yet can also be acquired from community in developing countries h pylori may also be transmitted orally by means of fecal matter through ingestion of waste tainted water so a hygienic environment could help decrease risk of h pylori infection prevention helicobacter pylori is a major cause of certain diseases of upper gastrointestinal tract rising antibiotic resistance increases need to search for new therapeutic strategies this might include prevention in form of vaccination much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control h pylori infection and related diseases including stomach cancer researchers are studying different antigens and routes of immunization to ascertain most appropriate system of immune protection however most of research only recently moved from animal to human trials an economic evaluation of use of a potential h pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could at least in netherlands prove cost effective for prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer a similar approach has also been studied for united states presence of bacteria in stomach may be beneficial reducing prevalence of asthma rhinitis atopic dermatitis inflammatory bowel disease gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses c gut reaction nature 479 s5 s7 2011 recent evidence suggests that strains of h pylori may be beneficial e g by normalizing stomach acid secretion and may play a role in regulating appetite since its presence in stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction in level of ghrelin treatment once h pylori is detected in a person with a peptic ulcer normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow ulcer to heal standard first line therapy is a one week triple therapy consisting of proton pump inhibitors such as and antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin variations of triple therapy have been developed over years such as using a different proton pump inhibitor as with or or replacing amoxicillin with metronidazole for people who are allergic to penicillin in areas with higher rates of clarithromycin resistance other options are recommended such a therapy has revolutionized treatment of peptic ulcers and has made a cure to disease possible previously only option was symptom control using h2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors alone an increasing number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic resistant bacteria this results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies such as a quadruple therapy which adds a bismuth colloid such as bismuth subsalicylate for treatment of clarithromycin resistant strains of h pylori use of as part of therapy has been suggested ingesting lactic acid bacteria exerts a suppressive effect on h pylori infection in both animals and humans and supplementing with lactobacillus and containing yogurt improved rates of eradication of h pylori in humans symbiotic butyrate producing bacteria which are normally present in intestine are sometimes used as probiotics to help suppress h pylori infections as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy butyrate itself is an antimicrobial which destroys cell envelope of h pylori by inducing regulatory t cell expression specifically and synthesis of an antimicrobial peptide called ll 37 which arises through its action as a histone deacetylase inhibitor table 3 select human antimicrobial peptides and their proposed 4 some known factors that induce antimicrobial peptide expression substance sulforaphane which occurs in broccoli and cauliflower has been proposed as a treatment periodontal therapy or scaling and root planing has also been suggested as an additional treatment prognosis helicobacter pylori colonizes stomach and induces chronic gastritis a long lasting inflammation of stomach bacterium persists in stomach for decades in most people most individuals infected by h pylori never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis about 10 20 of those colonized by h pylori ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers h pylori infection is also associated with a 1 2 lifetime risk of stomach cancer and a less than 1 risk of gastric malt lymphoma in absence of treatment h pylori infection once established in its gastric niche is widely believed to persist for life in elderly however infection likely can disappear as stomach s mucosa becomes increasingly atrophic and inhospitable to colonization proportion of acute infections that persist is not known but several studies that followed natural history in populations have reported apparent spontaneous elimination mounting evidence suggests h pylori has an important role in protection from some diseases incidence of acid reflux disease barrett s esophagus and esophageal cancer have been rising dramatically at same time as h presence decreases in 1996 martin j blaser advanced hypothesis that h pylori has a beneficial effect by regulating acidity of stomach contents hypothesis is not universally accepted as several randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate worsening of acid reflux disease symptoms following eradication of h pylori nevertheless blaser has reasserted his view that h pylori is a member of normal flora of stomach he postulates that changes in gastric physiology caused by loss of h pylori account for recent increase in incidence of several diseases including type 2 diabetes obesity and asthma his group has recently shown that h pylori colonization is associated with a lower incidence of childhood asthma epidemiology at least half world s population is infected by bacterium making it most widespread infection in world actual infection rates vary from nation to nation developing world has much higher infection rates than west western europe north america australasia where rates are estimated to be around 25 age when someone acquires this bacterium seems to influence pathologic outcome of infection people infected at an early age are likely to develop more intense inflammation that may be followed by atrophic gastritis with a higher subsequent risk of gastric ulcer gastric cancer or both acquisition at an older age brings different gastric changes more likely to lead to duodenal ulcer infections are usually acquired in early childhood in all countries however infection rate of children in developing nations is higher than in industrialized nations probably due to poor sanitary conditions perhaps combined with lower antibiotics usage for unrelated pathologies in developed nations it is currently uncommon to find infected children but percentage of infected people increases with age with about 50 infected for those over age of 60 compared with around 10 between 18 and 30 years higher prevalence among elderly reflects higher infection rates in past when individuals were children rather than more recent infection at a later age of individual in united states prevalence appears higher in african american and hispanic populations most likely due to socioeconomic factors lower rate of infection in west is largely attributed to higher hygiene standards and widespread use of antibiotics despite high rates of infection in certain areas of world overall frequency of h pylori infection is declining however antibiotic resistance is appearing in h pylori many metronidazole and clarithromycin resistant strains are found in most parts of world history helicobacter pylori migrated out of africa along with its human host circa 60 000 years ago recent research states that genetic diversity in h pylori like that of its host decreases with geographic distance from east africa using genetic diversity data researchers have created simulations that indicate bacteria seem to have spread from east africa around 58 000 years ago their results indicate modern humans were already infected by h pylori before their migrations out of africa and it has remained associated with human hosts since that time h pylori was first discovered in stomachs of patients with gastritis and ulcers in 1982 by drs barry marshall and robin warren of perth western australia at time conventional thinking was that no bacterium could live in acid environment of human stomach in recognition of their discovery marshall and warren were awarded 2005 nobel prize in physiology or medicine before research of marshall and warren german scientists found spiral shaped bacteria in lining of human stomach in 1875 but they were unable to culture them and results were eventually forgotten italian researcher giulio described similarly shaped bacteria living in acidic environment of stomach of dogs in 1893 professor jaworski of jagiellonian university in krakow investigated sediments of gastric obtained by lavage from humans in 1899 among some rod like bacteria he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape which he called vibrio he was first to suggest a possible role of this organism in pathogenesis of gastric diseases his work was included in handbook of gastric diseases but it had little impact as it was written in polish several small studies conducted in early 20th century demonstrated presence of curved rods in stomachs of many people with peptic ulcers and stomach cancers interest in bacteria waned however when an american study published in 1954 failed to observe bacteria in 1180 stomach biopsies interest in understanding role of bacteria in stomach diseases was rekindled in 1970s with visualization of bacteria in stomachs of people with gastric ulcers bacteria had also been observed in 1979 by robin warren who researched it further with barry marshall from 1981 after unsuccessful attempts at culturing bacteria from stomach they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982 when they unintentionally left their petri dishes incubating for five days over easter weekend in their original paper warren and marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by bacterial infection and not by stress or spicy food as had been assumed before some skepticism was expressed initially but within a few years multiple research groups had verified association of h pylori with gastritis and to a lesser extent ulcers to demonstrate h pylori caused gastritis and was not merely a bystander marshall drank a beaker of h pylori culture he became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later an endoscopy 10 days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and presence of h pylori these results suggested h pylori was causative agent marshall and warren went on to demonstrate antibiotics are effective in treatment of many cases of gastritis in 1987 sydney thomas invented first triple therapy for treatment of duodenal ulcers in 1994 national institutes of health stated most recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers were caused by h pylori and recommended antibiotics be included in treatment regimen bacterium was initially named campylobacter then renamed c pylori in 1987 pylori being genitive of circular opening leading from stomach into duodenum from ancient greek word which means gatekeeper when 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing and other research showed in 1989 that bacterium did not belong in genus campylobacter it was placed in its own genus helicobacter from ancient greek helix elix spiral or coil in october 1987 a group of experts met in copenhagen to found european helicobacter study group ehsg an international multidisciplinary research group and only
