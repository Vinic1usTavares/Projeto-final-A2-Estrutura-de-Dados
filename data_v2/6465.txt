typhoon joe known in philippines as typhoon nitang affected philippines china and vietnam during july 1980 an area of disturbed weather formed near caroline islands on july 14 shower activity gradually became better organized and two days later system was upgraded into a tropical depression on july 18 depression was classified as tropical storm joe initially joe moved northwest but began to turn to west northwest anchored by a subtropical ridge to its north joe started to deepen at a faster clip and attained typhoon intensity on july 19 eye began to clear out and next day joe reached its highest intensity shortly thereafter joe moved ashore philippines there 31 people were killed and 300 000 others were directly affected around 5 000 homes were destroyed resulting in an additional 29 000 homeless damage in nation was estimated at 14 5 million 1980 usd storm weakened rapidly over land but re intensified over open waters of south china sea joe crossed leizhou peninsula on july 22 where it became strongest system to hit peninsula in 26 years a total of 188 people were killed in area further north in hong kong two people were killed and 59 were injured after weakening slightly joe made its final landfall in vietnam while still at typhoon intensity in vietnam 130 people were killed 300 000 were directly affected 165 000 lost their homes 50 000 acres 20 000 ha of rice paddies were flooded in addition 15 800 buildings were destroyed while 16 300 homes were flooded inland over vietnam joe dissipated on july 24 meteorological history an area of disturbed weather developed over caroline islands on july 14 tracking westward convective activity gradually increased in both convection and coverage at 18 00 utc on july 22 japan meteorological agency jma started tracking system less than four hours later joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on july 16 a hurricane hunter aircraft found a weak surface circulation and minimum sea level pressure of initially low and mid level circulations were not vertically stacked with low level center exposed from deep convection by 00 00 utc on july 17 surface center and deep convection moved closer together prompting jtwc to classify system as tropical depression 09 post season analysis indicated that depression had actually developed about 24 hours earlier than initially indicated meanwhile philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa also monitored storm and assigned it with local name nitang moving northwest in response to a shortwave trough an elongated area of lower air pressure aloft that was passing to its east newly developed depression passed approximately west southwest of guam depression began to develop at a quicker pace and early on july 18 jtwc upgraded it to a tropical storm six hours later jma declared joe a tropical storm at this time tropical system was located roughly west of guam joe then began to move on a constant and brisk westward course that it would maintain for rest of its life in response to an unusually strong subtropical ridge that was east of its climatological position and to north of cyclone after joe developed a central dense overcast a large mass of deep convection jma upgraded joe into a severe tropical storm at midday hints of an eye became apparent on satellite imagery which led to jtwc and jma upgrading joe into a typhoon this intensity estimate was confirmed by a hurricane hunter plane later on july 19 which measured a pressure of an eye began to clear out on july 20 that same day a hurricane hunter aircraft recorded a pressure of at midday jtwc estimated that joe peaked in intensity with winds of equal to a category 3 hurricane on united states based saffir simpson hurricane wind scale sshws meanwhile jma estimated maximum intensity of six hours after its peak joe made landfall in central luzon at time of landfall jma indicated winds of over land joe weakened rapidly falling to tropical storm strength according to jtwc after entering south china sea on july 21 jtwc expected joe to turn northwest and threaten china however this did not occur due to strong ridge to its north joe began to re intensify data from jtwc suggested that joe regained typhoon intensity almost immediately thereafter around this time jma estimated that joe reached its secondary peak of at 00 00 utc on july 22 jtwc estimated that joe attained a secondary peak of based on a dvorak classification of t5 0 despite maintaining its structure as it tracked over leizhou peninsula storm weakened as it entered gulf of tonkin and approached coast of vietnam both jtwc and jma agree that joe had winds of when it moved ashore near haiphong in vietnam later on july 22 a combination of land interaction and vertical wind shear resulted in rapid weakening at 00 00 utc on july 23 jtwc issued its last warning on joe remnants of joe later moved into laos jma stopped watching joe on july 24 preparations and impact prior to its first landfall storm warnings were posted for most of philippines across philippines 31 citizens were killed including eight fisherman there 300 000 people were directly affected around 5 000 homes were destroyed resulting in an additional 29 000 homeless damage totaled 14 5 million less than a week later same areas were affected by typhoon kim typhoon also tracked over leizhou peninsula becoming strongest system to affect region in 26 years two large ships a liner and a tanker were washed ashore in throughout area 188 people were killed and at least 100 others were left homeless further north in hong kong a no 1 hurricane signal was issued early on july 21 later that day signal was increased to a no 3 hurricane signal and then elevated to a no 8 hurricane signal all signals were dropped late on july 22 after joe made its closest approach to hong kong a minimum pressure of was recorded at hong kong royal observatory hko early on july 22 tate s cairn recorded a peak wind speed of and a peak wind gust of occurred in stanley hko observed of rain over a 72 hour period within vicinity of hong kong two people were killed at a construction site in kwai chung a total of 59 people were injured including seven that were hospitalized most from fallen debris three boats were also lost at sea after their anchors to harbor broke air and sea traffic came to a halt overall damage in hong kong area was slight in vietnam 130 people were killed 300 000 others were directly affected and 165 000 others lost their homes an additional 15 800 buildings were destroyed 16 300 homes were flooded and many boats sunk storm inundated of rice paddies uprooted trees and blew off roofs from houses it also brought additional flooding to provinces of ha nam ninh ha bac hai hung and ha son binh these areas were already inundated by prior flooding see also similar early season philippine typhoons typhoon koryn 1993 typhoon peggy 1986 typhoon vera
