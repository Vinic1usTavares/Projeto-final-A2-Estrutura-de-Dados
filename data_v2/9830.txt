took place in town itself while jean pierre protzen and john hemmings conquest of incas chapter 10 argue that nearby plain of mascabamba better matches descriptions of encounter in any case inca army managed to hold spanish forces from a set of high terraces and flood their position to hinder their cavalry severely pressed and unable to advance spaniards withdrew by night to cusco despite this victory arrival of spanish reinforcements to cusco forced manco inca to abandon ollantaytambo and seek refuge in heavily forested region of vilcabamba where he established small independent neo inca

months later to replace atahualpa pizarro installed his brother tupac as a puppet ruler but he died shortly afterwards another brother manco inca was crowned in his place during this stage atahualpa s generals were only opposition to spanish advance as a sizable part of empire s population had fought on huascar s side during civil war and joined pizarro against their enemies d altroy incas pp 311 319 for a while manco inca and conquistadors maintained cordial relations together they defeated atahualpa s generals and reestablished inca rule over most of empire hemming conquest pp 164 167

their attempt to take recently founded spanish capital of lima hemming conquest pp 199 206 as a result of these events neither side was able to break deadlock at cusco for several months so spaniard garrison decided to make a direct attack on manco s headquarters at town of ollantaytambo northwest of city hemming conquest p 206 sources primary sources about battle of ollantaytambo were written mainly by spaniards pedro pizarro a cousin of francisco pizarro was part of expedition against manco inca s headquarters years later he wrote down his recollections of these and other events in a

amazon rainforest vega incas contra espanoles p 79 manco inca s forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training hemming conquest p 207 this was regular fare in inca empire where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old d altroy incas p 217 in combat these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders called d altroy incas p 233 they used melee weapons such as maces clubs and spears as well as ranged weapons such as arrows javelins and slings protective gear included helmets shields and quilted cloth armor d altroy incas p 227 against conquistadors wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate spanish armor hemming conquest p 114 slings and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and large size of their projectiles hemming conquest pp 114 115 187 even so inca soldiers were no match for spanish cavalry in open terrain so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain and digging pits in open fields to hinder mobility of horses attack was led by hernando pizarro senior spanish commander in cusco with a force of 100 spaniards 30 infantry 70 cavalry and an estimated 30 000 native allies hemming conquest p 207 vega incas contra espanoles p 78 one of his main assets against inca armies was spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power maneuverability speed and stamina over inca warriors hemming conquest pp 109 111 all spaniards wore some kind of armor most commonly used types were chain mail shirts and padded cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields hemming conquest pp 112 113 main spanish offensive weapon was steel sword which horsemen supplemented with lance both weapons could easily penetrate padded armor worn by inca troops hemming conquest p 113 firearms such as arquebuses were rarely used during spanish conquest of peru because they were scarce hard to use and despised by horsemen as an weapon hemming conquest pp 113 114 spaniards relied heavily on indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies d altroy incas p 319 these native troops had same sorts of arms and armor as their inca counterparts during ollantaytambo campaign pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries mainly canaris and as well as several members of inca nobility opposed to manco inca vega incas contra espanoles p 78 battle main access route to ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley formed in mountains by urubamba river which connects site with machu picchu to west and with and cusco to east after his uprising manco inca fortified eastern approaches to fend off attacks from former inca capital now under spanish occupation first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at near confluence of anta and urubamba rivers behind it incas channeled urubamba to make it cross valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by fortifications of on left bank and on right bank past them at plain of mascabamba eleven high terraces closed valley between mountains and a deep canyon formed by urubamba only way to continue was through gate of t iyupunku a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways in event of these fortifications being overrun temple hill a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking ollantaytambo provided a last line of defense protzen inca architecture pp 22 26 faced with these constraints spanish expedition had to cross river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition bulk of inca army confronted spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by urubamba river several spanish assaults against terraces failed against a shower of arrows slingshots and boulders coming down from terraces as well as from both flanks to hinder efforts of spanish cavalry incas flooded plain using previously prepared channels water eventually reached horses defenders then counterattacked some of them used spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords bucklers armor and even a horse ridden by manco inca himself in a severely compromised situation hernando pizarro ordered a retreat under cover of darkness spanish force fled through urubamba valley with incas in pursuit and reached cusco next day hemming conquest pp 208 209 battle site thumb alt refer to caption inca terraces at ollantaytambo actual location of battle is subject of some controversy according to canadian explorer john hemming spanish forces occupied a plain between ollantaytambo and urubamba river while main inca army was located on a citadel temple hill overlooking town protected by seventeen terraces hemming conquest pp 207 208 however swiss architect jean pierre protzen argues that topography of town and its surrounding area does not match contemporary descriptions of battle an anonymous account attributed to diego de silva claims that inca army occupied a set of eleven terraces not seventeen while chronicle of pedro pizarro describes a gate flanked by walls as only way through terraces protzen thinks that these descriptions allude to a set of eleven terraces that close plain of mascabamba near ollantaytambo which include heavily fortified gate of t iyupunku at this location when spaniards faced terraces they would have had urubamba river to their left and steep hill of cerro to their right matching three sides from which they were attacked during battle if protzen s hypothesis is correct river diverted to flood battlefield was urubamba and not its smaller affluent which runs alongside town of ollantaytambo protzen inca architecture pp 22 23 aftermath success at ollantaytambo encouraged manco inca to make a renewed attempt against cusco however spaniards discovered inca army concentrating near city and mounted a night attack which inflicted heavy casualties hemming conquest pp 210 212 on april 18 1537 a spanish army led by diego de almagro returned from a long expedition to chile and occupied cusco almagro imprisoned hernando pizarro and his brother gonzalo because he wanted city for himself most

near cusco hemming conquest pp 218 219 with spaniards position consolidated by almagro s reinforcements manco inca decided that ollantaytambo was too close to cusco to be tenable so he withdrew further west to town of vitcos hemming conquest p 222 almagro sent his lieutenant rodrigo orgonez in pursuit with 300 spaniards and numerous indian auxiliaries in july 1537 orgonez occupied and sacked vitcos taking many prisoners but manco managed to escape hemming conquest pp 223 225 he took refuge at vilcabamba a remote location where neo inca state was established and lasted until capture and
