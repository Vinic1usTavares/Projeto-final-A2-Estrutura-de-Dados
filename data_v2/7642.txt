history of roman constitution is a study of ancient rome that traces progression of roman political development from founding of city of rome in 753 bc to collapse of western roman empire in 476 ad constitution of roman kingdom vested sovereign power in king of rome king did have two rudimentary checks on his authority which took form of a board of elders roman senate and a popular assembly curiate assembly arrangement was similar to constitutional arrangements found in contemporary greek city states such as athens or sparta these greek constitutional principles probably came to rome through greek colonies of magna graecia in southern italy roman kingdom was overthrown in 510 bc according to legend and in its place roman republic was founded constitutional history of roman republic can be divided into five phases first phase began with revolution which overthrew roman kingdom in 510 bc and final phase ended with revolution which overthrew roman republic and thus created roman empire in 27 bc throughout history of republic constitutional evolution was driven by struggle between aristocracy patricians and ordinary citizens plebeians approximately two centuries after founding of republic plebeians attained in theory at least equality with patricians in practice however plight of average plebeian remained unchanged this set stage for civil wars of 1st century bc and rome s transformation into a formal empire general who won last civil war of roman republic gaius octavian became master of state in years after 30 bc octavian set out to reform roman constitution and to found principate ultimate consequence of these reforms was abolition of republic and founding of roman empire octavian was given honorific augustus venerable by roman senate and became known to history by this name and as first roman emperor octavian s reforms did not at time seem drastic since they did nothing more than reorganize constitution reorganization was revolutionary however because ultimate result was that octavian ended up with control over entire constitution which itself set stage for outright monarchy when diocletian became roman emperor in 284 principate was abolished and a new system dominate was established this system survived until ultimate fall of eastern roman byzantine empire in 1453 abbott 340 under kingdom period of kingdom can be divided into two epochs based on legends handed down to us principally in first book of livy s ab urbe condita from city having been founded or simply history of rome abbott 6 while specific legends were probably not true they were likely based on historical fact it is likely that before founding of republic rome actually had been ruled by a succession of kings first legendary epoch saw reigns of first four legendary kings during this time political foundations of city were laid abbott 3 city grew increasingly organized religious institutions were established and senate and assemblies evolved into formal institutions early romans were divided into three ethnic groups abbott 5 families that belonged to one of these ethnic groups were original patrician families in an attempt to add a level of organization to city these patrician families were divided into units called curia vehicle through which early romans expressed their democratic impulses was known as a committee comitia or assembly two principle assemblies that formed were known as curiate assembly and calculate assembly two assemblies were designed to mirror ethnic divisions of city and as such assemblies were organized by curia vehicle through which early romans expressed their aristocratic impulses was a council of town elders which became roman senate elders of this council were known as patres fathers and thus are known to history as first roman senators demos people and elders eventually recognized need for a single political leader and thus elected such a leader rex roman king demos elected rex and elders advised rex thumb left 450px aeneas whom romans believed romulus and remus descended from fleeing from burning city of troy second epoch saw reigns of last three legendary kings second epoch was more consequential than was first which was in part due to significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period regardless of how true these legends were it is likely that as legends suggest a series of conquests did occur during late monarchy as a result of these conquests it became necessary to determine what was to be done with conquered people often individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns abbott 7 while other such individuals came to rome to acquire legal and economic standing these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a patrician family or toward king eventually individuals who were dependents of king were released from their state of dependency and became first plebeians as rome grew it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests when plebeians were released from their dependency they were released from their curia when this occurred while they were no longer required to serve in army they also lost their political and economic standing abbott 7 8 to bring these new plebeians back into army patricians were forced to make concessions abbott 8 while it is not known exactly what concessions were made fact that they were not granted any political power set stage for what history knows as conflict of orders reign of first four kings was distinct from that of last three kings first kings were elected between reigns of final three kings however monarchy became hereditary abbott 10 and as such senate became subordinated to king this breach in senate s sovereignty rather than an intolerable tyranny was probably what led patricians in senate to overthrow last king king may have sought support of plebeians however plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service and from their forced labor in construction of public works they were probably also embittered by their lack of political power and therefore did not come to aide of either king or senate under republic after monarchy had been overthrown and roman republic had been founded people of rome began electing two consuls each year holland 2 in year 494 bc plebeians commoners seceded to aventine hill and demanded of patricians aristocrats right to elect their own officials abbott 22 patricians duly capitulated and plebeians ended their secession plebeians called these new officials plebeian tribunes and gave these tribunes two assistants called plebeian aediles holland 5 in 449 bc senate promulgated twelve tables as centerpiece of roman constitution in 443 bc office of censor was created abbott 37 and in 367 bc plebeians were allowed to stand for consulship opening of consulship to plebeian class implicitly opened both censorship as well as dictatorship to plebeians abbott 42 in 366 bc in an effort by patricians to reassert their influence over magisterial offices two new offices were created while these two offices praetorship and curule aedileship were at first open only to patricians within a generation they were open to plebeians as well beginning around year 350 bc senators and plebeian tribunes began to grow closer abbott 44 senate began giving tribunes more power and unsurprisingly tribunes began to feel indebted to senate as tribunes and senators grew closer plebeian senators began to routinely secure office of tribune for members of their own families abbott 45 also around year 350 bc plebeian council popular assembly enacted a significant law ovinian law abbott 46 which transferred from consuls to censors power to appoint new senators this law also required censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to senate which probably resulted in a significant increase in number of plebeian senators abbott 47 this along with closeness between plebeian tribunes and senate helped to facilitate creation of a new plebeian aristocracy this new plebeian aristocracy soon merged with old patrician aristocracy creating a combined patricio plebeian aristocracy holland 27 old aristocracy existed through force of law because only patricians had been allowed to stand for high office now however new aristocracy existed due to organization of society and as such this order could only be overthrown through a revolution abbott 48 in 287 bc plebeians seceded to hill to end secession a law hortensian law was passed which ended requirement that patrician senators consent before a bill could be brought before plebeian council for a vote abbott 52 ultimate significance of this law was in fact that it robbed patricians of their final weapon over plebeians result was that ultimate control over state fell not onto shoulders of democracy but onto shoulders of new patricio plebeian aristocracy abbott 53 by middle of second century bc economic situation for average plebeian had declined significantly abbott 77 farmers became bankrupted and soon masses of unemployed plebeians began flooding into rome and thus into ranks of legislative assemblies where their economic status usually led them to vote for candidate who offered them most a new culture of dependency was emerging which would look to any populist leader for relief abbott 80 right 500px thumb cornelia mother of future gracchi tribunes pointing to her children as her treasures in 88 bc an aristocratic senator named lucius cornelius sulla was elected consul holland 64 and soon left for a war in east when a tribune revoked sulla s command of war sulla brought his army back to italy marched on rome secured city and left for east again holland 69 in 83 bc he returned to rome and captured city a second time holland 90 in 82 bc he made himself dictator and then used his status as dictator to pass a series of constitutional reforms that were intended to strengthen senate holland 99 in 80 bc he resigned his dictatorship and by 78 bc he was dead while he thought that he had firmly established aristocratic rule his own career had illustrated fatal weakness in constitution that it was army and not senate which dictated fortunes of state holland 106 in 70 bc generals pompey magnus and marcus licinius crassus were both elected consul and quickly dismantled sulla s constitution abbott 109 in 62 bc pompey returned to rome from battle in east and soon entered into an agreement with julius caesar abbott 112 caesar and pompey along with crassus established a private agreement known as first triumvirate under agreement pompey s arrangements were to be ratified crassus was to be promised a future consulship and caesar was to be promised consulship in 59 bc and then governorship of gaul modern france immediately afterwards in 54 bc violence began sweeping city abbott 114 and in 53 bc crassus was killed in january 49 bc senate passed a resolution which declared that if caesar did not lay down his arms by july of that year he would be considered an enemy of republic abbott 115 in response caesar quickly crossed rubicon with his veteran army and marched towards rome caesar s rapid advance forced pompey consuls and senate to abandon rome for greece and allowed caesar to enter city unopposed goldsworthy 237 by 48 bc after having defeated last of his major enemies julius caesar wanted to ensure that his control over government was undisputed abbott 134 he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority and by decreasing authority of rome s other political institutions caesar held office of roman dictator and alternated between consulship chief magistracy and proconsulship in effect a military governorship in 48 bc caesar was given powers of a plebeian tribune abbott 135 which made his person sacrosanct gave him power to veto senate and allowed him to dominate legislative process after caesar was assassinated in 44 bc mark antony formed an alliance with caesar s adopted son and great nephew gaius octavian along with marcus aemilius lepidus they formed an alliance known as second triumvirate and held powers that were nearly identical to powers that caesar had held under his constitution while conspirators who had assassinated caesar were defeated at battle of philippi in 42 bc peace that resulted was only temporary antony and octavian fought against each other in one last battle in 31 bc antony was defeated and in 30 bc he committed suicide in 29 bc octavian returned to rome as unchallenged master of state reign of octavian whom history remembers as augustus first roman emperor marked dividing line between roman republic and roman empire by time this process was complete rome had completed its transition from a city state with a network of dependencies to capital of an empire abbott 129 under empire when octavian returned to rome two years after defeating mark antony no one remained to oppose him abbott 266 decades of war had taken a terrible toll on people of rome political situation was unstable and there was a constant threat of renewed warfare octavian s arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout italy as soon as he arrived he began addressing problems that were plaguing rome octavian s popularity soon reached new heights which ultimately gave him support he needed to implement his reforms when octavian deposed mark antony in 32 bc he resigned his position as triumvir but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up abbott 267 octavian wanted to solidify his status as master of state but avoid fate of his adopted father on january 13 of 27 bc octavian transferred control of state back to senate and people of rome but neither senate nor people of rome were willing to accept what was in effect octavian s resignation octavian was allowed to remain roman consul chief executive under old republic and was also allowed to retain his tribunician powers similar to those of plebeian tribunes or chief representatives of people abbott 269 this arrangement in effect functioned as a popular ratification of his position within state senate then granted octavian a unique grade of proconsular command power imperium which gave him authority over all of rome s military governors and thus over entire roman army octavian was also granted title of augustus venerable and of princeps first citizen in 23 bc augustus as octavian now called himself gave up his consulship and expanded both his proconsular imperium and his tribunician powers abbott 270 after these final reforms had been instituted augustus never again altered his constitution abbott 271 augustus final goal was to ensure an orderly succession in 6 bc augustus granted tribunician powers to his stepson tiberius abbott 272 and quickly recognized tiberius as his heir in 13 ad a law was passed which made tiberius legal powers equivalent to and independent from those of augustus within a year augustus was dead abbott 273 thumb left 300px augustus first roman emperor when augustus died in 14 ad principate legally ended abbott 289 tiberius knew that if he secured support of army rest of government would soon follow therefore tiberius assumed command of praetorian guard and used his proconsular imperium to force armies to swear allegiance to him as soon as this occurred senate and magistrates acquiesced under tiberius power to elect magistrates was transferred from assemblies to senate abbott 292 when tiberius died caligula was proclaimed emperor by senate in 41 caligula was assassinated and for two days following his assassination senate debated merits of restoring republic abbott 293 due to demands of army however claudius was declared emperor but he was ultimately killed and nero was declared emperor abbott 297 in decades after death of augustus roman empire was in a sense a union of inchoate principalities which could have disintegrated at any time abbott 296 in 68 ad ser sulpicius galba governor of hispania tarraconensis was proclaimed emperor by his troops in rome emperor nero quickly lost his supporters and committed suicide governor of lower germany a vitellius was soon proclaimed emperor by his troops and in rome praetorian guard proclaimed m salvius otho emperor in 69 galba was assassinated and otho took an army to germany to defeat vitellius but instead was himself defeated he committed suicide and vitellius was proclaimed emperor but was quickly defeated and executed by vespasian who was then declared emperor abbott 305 under emperor vespasian roman constitution began a slide toward outright monarchy abbott 309 vespasian died in 79 and was succeeded by his son titus who presided over a further weakening of senate abbott 310 he was succeeded by his brother domitian in 81 domitian s reign marked a significant turning point on road to monarchy as he made himself censor for life and unlike his father used these powers to further subjugate senate domitian ultimately was a tyrant with character which always makes tyranny repulsive abbott 312 and this derived in part from his own paranoia which itself was a consequence of fact that he had no son and thus no obvious heir in september 96 domitian was assassinated abbott 313 during period that began with accession of emperor nerva and ended with death of emperor commodus empire continued to weaken it was becoming difficult to recruit enough soldiers for army inflation was becoming an issue and on at least one occasion empire almost went bankrupt most significant constitutional development during this era was steady drift towards monarchy m nerva succeeded domitian and although his reign was too short for any major constitutional reforms he did reverse some of his predecessor s abuses abbott 317 he was succeeded by trajan in 98 who then went further than even nerva had in restoring image of a free republic by for example allowing senate to regain some independent legislative abilities hadrian succeeded trajan as emperor by far his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus abbott 318 which included a fixed gradation of clearly defined offices and a corresponding order of promotion hadrian was succeeded by antonius pius who made no real changes to constitution abbott 319 antonius pius was succeeded by marcus aurelius in 161 most significant constitutional development that occurred during reign of marcus aurelius was revival of republican principle of collegiality as he made his brother l aelius his co emperor in 169 aelius died and in 176 marcus aurelius made his son l aurelius commodus his new co emperor in 180 marcus aurelius died and commodus became emperor commodus tyranny revived worst memories of later julian emperors abbott 320 as he was more explicit than any of his predecessors in taking powers that he did not legally have and in disregarding constitution he was killed in 192 abbott 321 no further constitutional reforms were enacted during principate abbott 329 only development of any significance was continuing slide towards monarchy as constitutional distinctions that had been set up by augustus lost whatever meaning that they still had starting in 235 with reign of barbarian emperor maximinus thrax empire was put through a period of severe military civil and economic stress crisis arguably reached its height during reign of gallienus from 260 to 268 abbott 333 crisis ended with accession of diocletian in 284 and abolishment of principate abbott 334 decline and fall when diocletian became roman emperor in 284 military situation had recently stabilized which allowed him to enact badly needed constitutional reforms diocletian resurrected collegial system that marcus aurelius had first used and divided empire into east and west abbott 339 each half was to be ruled by one of two co emperors called augusti he then resurrected precedent set by hadrian and ensured that each emperor named his successor early in his reign diocletian called that successor a caesar diocletian then created a bureaucratic apparatus that was similar to system that hadrian had created wherein each office had a defined set of responsibilities a set rank and a set path of promotion in this administrative system diocletian followed example that had been set by domitian and divided empire into small administrative units he also assigned to four tetrarchs two augusti and two caesares honorary titles and insignia that had been used by domitian one important consequence of these reforms was fact that image of a free republic had finally given way and centuries old reality of monarchy now became obvious when diocletian resigned chaos ensued but after chaos had subsided most of his reforms remained in effect williams 196 98 while emperor constantine great did enact some revisions to this constitution most significant change over centuries was in abolition of caesares ultimately this constitution survived in one form or another until western roman empire fell in 476 williams 205 6 diocletian s division of empire into west and east set stage for ages to come and was a significant factor behind ultimate division of christian church into western roman catholic and eastern greek orthodox while his division of empire into prefectures and dioceses is used by catholic church to this day see also notes references further reading cambridge ancient history volumes 9
