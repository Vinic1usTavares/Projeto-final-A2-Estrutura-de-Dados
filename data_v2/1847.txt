john northrup shive february 22 1913 june 1 1984 was an american physicist and inventor he made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid state physics during early days of transistor development at bell laboratories in particular he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along surface as previously thought this paved way from bardeen and brattain s point contact transistor to shockley s more robust junction transistor shive is best known for inventing phototransistor in 1948 a device that combines sensitivity to light of a photodiode and current gain of a transistor and for shive wave machine in 1959 an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion early life and education john n shive was born in baltimore maryland on february 22 1913 and grew up in new jersey shive graduated from rutgers university with a bs in physics and chemistry in 1934 he also earned a phd from johns hopkins university submitting a dissertation practice and theory of modulation of geiger counters in 1939 shive became a fellow of american physical society a member of american association for advancement of science and was a member of phi beta kappa and sigma xi fraternities contributors to proceedings of i r e 1952 scientific career john n shive joined bell telephone laboratories in 1939 shive worked initially on physical research and device development and later on education and training after retirement from industry he worked as an adjunct professor of physics at georgian court university special lecturer

shive discovered that gold plated tungsten point contacts on a p type layer of germanium grown on an n type substrate gave a terrific triode effect on february 13 he also discovered that a transistor consisting of bronze contacts on surface of an n type substrate without a p layer gave gains up to in power he leveraged this discovery to build a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along surface as previously thought this confirmed william shockley s idea that it should be possible to build a junction transistor an idea that hitherto he had kept secret from rest of team shockley later admitted that workings of team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of own work secret until his hand was forced by shive s 1948 advance phototransistor in 1948 shive invented phototransistor that used a beam of light instead of a wire as emitter of a point contact transistor generating holes that flow to collector bell labs announced invention in 1950 phototransistor was eventually used in nationwide direct distance dialing system shive wave machine thumb this wave machine model simulates wave machine produced by john shive at bell laboratories and made famous by simple waves film machine consists of 64 horizontal rods welded to an axle torsion bar that is perpendicular to rods notice that wave inverts as it reflects from each non fixed end shive was a gifted lecturer and became director of education and training at bell telephone laboratories he was responsible for curriculum and administration of educational programs provided to employees of bell laboratories in this new role he invented shive wave machine also known as shive wave generator wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to next high moment of inertia of each rod ensures wave takes several seconds to traverse entire series of rods making dynamics easily visible motion is analogous to high frequency waves that are invisible to human eye such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line wave generator could illustrate wave reflection standing waves resonance partial reflection and impedance matching shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated machine simple waves and similarities in wave behavior and wrote a book with same name as latter today exploratorium exhibit services manufactures a large scale version of machine for use in science museums and schools patents shive held several patents including selenium rectifier and method of making it directly heated thermocouple translating device selenium rectifier including tellurium and method of making it apparatus for and method of treating selenium rectifiers semiconductor photoelectric device conditioning of semiconductor translators semiconductor amplifier and alternating gate current books shive authored three books during his career beginning with properties physics and design of semiconductor devices 1959 a book about semiconductor devices this was followed by similarities of wave behavior 1961 a book designed to help college professors teach students about waves using machine he invented his last book similarities in physics 1982 was coauthored with robert l weber he was also one of editors of transistor technology volume 1 honors john n shive was a fellow of american physical society and a senior member of institute of electrical and electronics engineers he was also a chairman of advisory committee on pre college physics project of american institute of physics personal life shive was married to helen
