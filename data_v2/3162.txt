as a proponent of nationalism and a protector of baluba sendwe also enjoyed a substantial amount of popularity around elisabethville posing a significant political threat to tshombe however many politicians in central government saw him as having been too close with deposed prime minister on 19 october three days after tshombe concluded a deal with colonel joseph desire mobutu to neutralise

emergency was proclaimed by central government in katanga and sendwe was appointed commissioner general extraordinaire for province nominally giving him absolute authority over area he devoted much of his time to attending to needs of baluba in refugee camps in elisabethville and albertville between march and july 1962 attempted to negotiate a deal between central government and katangese secessionists generally taking a moderate stance and even suggesting a reconciliation between balubakat and conakat in july he also came into conflict in pursuance of his responsibilities with fellow balubakat member antoine omari who had been tasked by government with reestablishing local administration as omari attempted to grant power to local balubakat members who wanted to split katanga province over time central government hardened its attitude against katanga while belgium gradually withdrew its support for it with secession s prospects weakening sendwe hoped to obtain control over province though he had support of most of katanga baluba his and fellow balubakat deputies in parliament adoula government sought to divide katanga to weaken it while balubakat officials in northern katanga wanted an exclusive polity in region under domination of their own party adoula government also wanted to use sendwe vis a vis his regional popularity as a counterweight to tshombe without granting him control of entirety of katanga demise by end of 1962 sendwe was at peak of his political aspirations being able to exert great power and influence over new province of north katanga formerly lualaba however at 22 00 on 23 december his son became involved in a youth gang street brawl sendwe arrived on scene and ordered some accompanying soldiers to intervene in process they beat senator pierre medie who had come to support his own son on 28 december in senate sendwe attempted to defend his actions during street altercation being frequently interrupted by angry cries from

that allowed for baluba in elisabethville refugee camp pictured to return to their homes in early 1963 katanga was reintegrated into congo as multiple provinces and tshombe agreed to cooperate with government officials sendwe vied for control of region leading to ethnic clashes in jadotville in april in which approximately 74 people were killed nevertheless he negotiated a deal with tshombe s minister of interior godefroid munongo to allow for return of baluba in elisabethville refugee camp to their homes after tshombe fled country sendwe sought to extend his constituency beyond baluba to establish control over whole of katanga he questioned legality of existence of north katanga as a separate political entity and continued to push for reunification of katanga province however his removal from central government and rejection of his unity proposal by north katanga provincial assembly forced him to relax his goals on 18 may etat d exception was retracted in katanga and he was discharged from his post as commissioner general extraordinaire in july sendwe moved to albertville to rebuild his political base he blocked repatriation of baluba refugees in local camp probably so he could use them to boost his support adoula government was pleased by sendwe s relocation wanting to be rid of him in leopoldville soon after he arrived rumours emerged that north katanga provincial president mwamba ilunga had arrested him this triggered disorder as rural baluba and customary chiefs began to protest triggering mwamba ilunga s resignation balubakat deputies in parliament lobbied for sendwe to replace him and in august a balubakat party congress with mwamba ilunga s acceptance ruled that sendwe should be given provincial presidency on 21 september provincial assembly elected sendwe president of north katanga province and invested him with public health portfolio situation in north katanga under sendwe quickly turned disastrous driven by his alcoholism poor management of public funds nepotism lack of a government programme and numerous attempts to use his position to deprecate his rivals problems were exacerbated by withdrawal of united nations peacekeeping forces and occurrence of destructive floods by end of year corruption was rampant civil servants were receiving compensation on an irregular basis and much of population was impoverished during this time balubakat also became an increasingly tribal exclusively baluba organisation sendwe s management of north katanga perturbed other government officials and adoula began seeking a way to remove him from office fortunat kabange an ally of adoula and a balubakat deputy in parliament considered a solution with albertville businessmen that involved granting sendwe an executive position at a company in exchange for his resignation this proposal was vetoed by mwamba ilunga and others who decided to revise balubakat s organisation instead they decided to change party s name to parti congolais ppco to distance it from its ethnic connotation and called a congress in january 1964 to vote in new leadership sendwe attended first meeting but then denounced event and banned it which was reversed by intervention of deputy prime minister sendwe lost his seat as party president in a vote 28 3 he failed to secure any significant party office and was instead relegated to position of adviser to ppco on 15 march provincial assembly in a special session sponsored by president kasa vubu dismissed sendwe from his post as provincial president and replaced him with kabange sendwe argued on legal technicality that his removal was unlawful denounced ppco and declared that only his government had popular support on 27 april provincial assembly reached a compromise re electing sendwe president of north katanga but revising his government stripping him of public health portfolio and making kabange provincial vice president he was re inaugurated following day he pledged to strengthen north katanga s institutions and territorial integrity protect political parties that sought to further superior interests of congo and encourage friendly relations between balubakat and conakat he also announced his intention to increase economic cooperation with other provinces and establish cooperatives for merchants and consumers meanwhile a radical leftist balubakat activist laurent desire kabila began making plans to launch a rebellion in north katanga and overthrow sendwe and kabange death on 27 may simba rebels led by kabila launched a coup in albertville overthrowing sendwe s government they accused him of embezzling public funds sendwe was immediately detained by rebels while rebel leaders debated what to do with him some pressing for him to be shot sendwe escaped he then spent next few days trying to reestablish his authority while rebel control crumbled on 30 may a small government force under command of colonel louis bobozo recaptured town and recovered sendwe who claimed to have been nearly buried alive by rebels sendwe was under false impression that mwamba ilunga had stoked rebellion and had him arrested unrest persisted in albertville sendwe failed to calm situation and attacked his rivals and non baluba ethnicities on 19 june population revolted and government evacuated sendwe attempted to flee but was hampered by government troops and was killed by rebels questions about his death were raised in several newspapers and central government released an official report about it two weeks later there are various theories about how and why sendwe was killed according to journalist ian goodhope colvin sendwe drove towards with an american missionary but his car was stopped by simba rebels his police escort fled and he and his companion were murdered according to jean he was arrested by anc soldiers at muswaki while escaping by train and forced to return to albertville driving with several relatives he went into city to try and calm simbas assuring them of his lumumbist credentials by shouting in a reportedly drunken manner lumumba is my brother mulele is my brother all of you you are my brothers rebels did not heed his words and shot him and some of his companions on hill erik kennes examined various testimonies one witness held saidi saleh a local politician responsible for death kabuya sando concluded that anc defectors shot sendwe kennes questioned validity of latter claim noting that most anc elements had retreated from area and that no other witnesses reported dissident soldiers forming part of simbas ranks simba leader gaston accused mobutu of organising murder other observers believed that anc soldiers actions in muswaki indicated that central government was involved kabuya noting newer clothing worn by soldiers posited that anc men were really operatives of central government he reasoned that mobutu head of anc at time wanted sendwe dead so as to make rapprochement with tshombe easier there is a rumor that execution was carried out by several under orders from kabila kennes discounted theory reasoning that it was unlikely because kabila did not have sendwe killed first time albertville was seized and was not present when city fell on 19 june legacy throughout his career sendwe was undisputed national figure of baluba of katanga according to british journalist ian goodhope colvin sendwe s death deprived adoula of a figure who could guarantee him katangese support forcing him to welcome tshombe back into country his murder also disillusioned many baluba in north katanga with simbas cause and as a result many abstained from joining their rebellion balubakat collapsed in his wake in november 1966 mobutu having become president posthumously awarded sendwe for dying in defence of country s honour an avenue and a hospital in were named after him after his death sendwe s legacy drifted into obscurity and by 21st century there was little political memory of him in northern katanga union des et des uferi recalled his legacy in its rhetoric due to party s militant reputation public associated uferi with violent actions of balubakat thus limiting its ability to proliferate
