battle of kolubara was a campaign fought between austria hungary and serbia in november and december 1914 during serbian campaign of world war i it commenced on 16 november when austro hungarians under command of oskar potiorek reached kolubara river during their third invasion of serbia that year having captured strategic town of valjevo and forced serbian army to undertake a series of retreats serbs withdrew from belgrade on 29 30 november and city soon fell under austro hungarian control on 2 december serbian army launched a surprise counter attack all along front valjevo and uzice were retaken by serbs on 8 december and austro hungarians retreated to belgrade which 5th army commander liborius ritter von frank deemed to be untenable austro hungarians abandoned city between 14 and 15 december and retreated back into austria hungary allowing serbs to retake their capital following day both austro hungarians and serbs suffered heavy casualties with more than 20 000 dead on each side defeat humiliated austria hungary which had hoped to occupy serbia by end of 1914 on 22 december potiorek and von frank were relieved of their respective commands and 5th and 6th armies were merged into a single 5th army of 95 000 men background on 28 june 1914 bosnian serb student gavrilo princip assassinated archduke franz ferdinand of austria in sarajevo assassination precipitated july crisis which led austria hungary to issue an ultimatum to serbia on 23 july on suspicion that assassination had been planned in belgrade austro hungarian government made ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to serbia and it was indeed rejected austro hungarians declared war on serbia on 28 july and that same day serbs destroyed all bridges on sava and danube rivers in order to prevent austro hungarians from using them during any future invasion belgrade was shelled following day marking beginning of world war i fighting in eastern europe began with first austro hungarian invasion of serbia in early august 1914 under command of oskar potiorek number of austro hungarian troops assigned to invasion was far smaller than 308 000 strong force intended when war was declared this was because a large portion of austro hungarian 2nd army had moved to russian front reducing number of troops involved in initial stages of invasion to approximately 200 000 on other hand serbs could muster some 450 000 men to oppose austro hungarians upon full mobilization main elements to face austro hungarians were 1st 2nd 3rd and uzice armies with a combined strength of approximately 180 000 men serbian army was commanded by crown prince alexander with chief of serbian general staff radomir putnik as his deputy and de facto military leader petar bojovic stepa stepanovic pavle jurisic sturm and milos commanded 1st 2nd 3rd and uzice armies respectively thumb right 250px serbian soldiers marching through countryside balkan wars had only just concluded and serbia was still recovering over 36 000 serbian soldiers had been killed and 55 000 seriously wounded few recruits had been gained from newly acquired territories and serbian army had been stretched by need to garrison them against albanian insurgents and threat of bulgarian attack to compound matters serbs were dangerously short of artillery and had only just begun to replenish their ammunition stocks their supply problems also extended to more basic items many soldiers lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional serbian cap known as a sajkaca rifles were also in critically short supply it was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50 000 serbian soldiers with no equipment at all austro hungarians on other hand possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as serbs they also had better stocks of munitions as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them serbs had a slight advantage over austro hungarians as many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of balkan wars and better trained than their austro hungarian counterparts serb soldiers were also highly motivated which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry serbs beat back an austro hungarian invasion in august at battle of cer it marked first allied victory over central powers in world war i potiorek was humiliated by defeat and was determined to resume assault against serbs he was given permission in september to launch another invasion of serbia provided that he did not risk anything that might lead to a further fiasco under pressure from russians to launch their own offensive and keep as many austro hungarian troops as possible away from eastern front serbs invaded bosnia in september with help of chetnik irregulars but were repulsed after a month of fighting in what came to be known as battle of drina bojovic was wounded during battle and was replaced by zivojin misic as commander of serbian 1st army prelude austro hungarian plans thumb left 250px aftermath of austro hungarian bombardment of sabac october 1914 aok acknowledged that an undefeated serbia severed austria hungary s connection to ottoman empire and prevented completion of berlin baghdad railway aok also realized that austro hungarian army s inability to defeat serbia would discourage neutral countries such as bulgaria romania and greece from joining central powers and would tempt italy to open up a third front against austria hungary nevertheless aok was hesitant to authorize a third invasion of serbia this changed in september 1914 when austro hungarian troops discovered a map in an abandoned semlin bookshop titled new division of europe originally printed in a russian newspaper map was widely sold in serbia and depicted borders of europe as they would appear following war germany was to be divided into northern and southern confederations and austria hungary was to be abolished its eastern provinces given to russia romania czechs and hungarians and its southern provinces divided between serbia and italy alarmed by prospect of austria hungary s disintegration emperor franz joseph personally authorized a third invasion of serbia in early october 1914 having just repelled serbian incursion into bosnia austro hungarian army regrouped and positioned itself for one final invasion before winter set in potiorek was again placed in charge of austro hungarian forces and was given command of austro hungarian 6th army austro hungarian 5th army was commanded by liborius ritter von frank in total austro hungarians had 450 000 troops at their disposal serbian army had 400 000 soldiers ready to face austro hungarian advance potiorek appeared confident soldiers of 5th and 6th armies he said goal of this war is nearly attained complete destruction of enemy three month campaign is almost over we must only break enemy s last resistance before onset of winter serbs were exhausted and demoralized in a telegram to putnik dated 27 october 1914 stepanovic complained that 2nd army did not have enough shells to resist austro hungarians effectively and requested that he be removed from his command putnik denied request but ordered all units to resist austro hungarian advance for as long as possible before retreating this strategy had worked in putnik s favour during summer months but heavy rainfall in september and early october had reduced all of serbia s roads to muddy quagmires that made movement of troops guns and wagons extremely difficult potiorek recognized that serbian army was in a difficult situation he was certain that a third invasion would bring him decisive victory that he so desperately wanted in vienna and sarajevo austro hungarian officials began planning for occupation and dismantling of serbia country was to be plundered and its territory used to bribe neutral balkan states into joining central powers with romanians getting region of timocka krajina and bulgarians getting macedonia and southeastern serbia austro hungarians intended to annex everything west of morava river as well as cities of scutari shkoder and durazzo durres in northern albania serbs living west of morava or compact masses of serbian element as austro hungarians called them were to be expelled and replaced with austrian settlers who would change psychology of region making serbia more habsburg and less serbian in outlook ludwig section chief of austro hungarian finance ministry wrote potiorek in october recommending west europeanization of serbs with a strong hand as soon as serbia was occupied potiorek planned to launch a converging attack across northern and western serbia 5th army was to capture valjevo and envelope kolubara river from north and 6th army was to secure jagodnja plateau and outflank serbian units on kolubara from south capture of southeastern serbian city of nis was potiorek s main objective nis had been serbia s capital since july and was a crucial transportation hub for its military it also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at arsenal in nearby kragujevac city s capture would effectively cut serbia in two and scatter serbian army third austro hungarian invasion of serbia all of valleys of northwestern serbia were swamped by constant rainfall mountains had been covered in snow since early october acknowledging opportunity that such conditions presented putnik told his closest advisors all my strategy consists in placing serbian national mud between enemy s fighting line and his supplies on 31 october von frank s 5th army pushed down into region between sava and drina rivers while potiorek s 6th army drove west across drina and into jagodnja plateau austria hungary s third invasion of serbia commenced on 6 november 1914 with intense artillery fire strafing a series of serbian border towns on 7 november austro hungarian 5th and 6th armies attacked across drina outnumbered and in desperate need of ammunition serbian army offered fierce resistance but was forced to retreat 3rd army fell back against a road by jadar river in an effort to block austro hungarian advance towards valjevo while 1st army retreated southward into serbian interior and uzice army managed to prevent austro hungarians from crossing drina on 8 november austro hungarians attacked serbian 2nd army near cer mountain and came within of serbian frontline entrenching themselves at foot of mountain 2nd army was given orders to hold austro hungarians down for as long as possible and if its position became untenable retreat towards right bank of dobrava river and position itself so as to block approach to valjevo elsewhere austro hungarians drove a wedge between 1st and 3rd army and forced another serbian retreat later that day serbian government held a joint session with serbian supreme command with regard to serbia s worsening military position putnik stressed that it was critical for serbia to hold kolubara and towns within its vicinity and suggested that serbs make a separate peace with austria hungary if this proved impossible this notion was rejected by prime minister of serbia nikola pasic who urged further resistance to austro hungarians and threatened resignation of his government if peace discussions began session ended with serbian government and supreme command agreeing to fight on serbian retreat thumb right 250px austro hungarian soldiers stand beside captured serbian artillery putnik reasoned that austro hungarian supply lines would become overstretched as their forces pressed deeper into serbia while serbs would continue to hold railheads in serbian interior on 10 november he ordered a general retreat from jadar and withdrew serbian 2nd army to ub and positioned 1st and 3rd armies north and west of valjevo meanwhile uzice army took up positions to defend town from which it took its name austro hungarians pressed after serbs hoping to capture obrenovac valjevo railroad clashes ensued and serbian army managed to prevent austro hungarians from taking railroad for a time it quickly became clear to putnik that he had underestimated austro hungarians who managed to bring their heavy artillery through muddy serbian country roads they established firing positions on serbian side of drina and began targeting serbian army which suffered heavy casualties morale plummeted amongst serbs who were already significantly demoralized due a lack of cold weather clothing and ammunition and exhausted by long retreat towards serbian interior putnik realized that his forces would need to regroup if they were to provide effective resistance he ordered that valjevo be abandoned and had serbian army take up positions on kolubara retreat towards river was long and excruciating with serbs being forced to destroy all bridges and telephone lines so that they would not fall into austro hungarian hands serbian army also abandoned most of its heavy equipment to speed up withdrawal seeing that situation was critical and that serbian forces were lacking artillery ammunition and supplies pasic sought help of triple entente he sent a telegram to his envoys abroad which read urgent help is required beg and plead france provided serbs with munitions and supplies representatives of russia and united kingdom expressed understanding but those countries failed to deliver weapons and munitions austro hungarians entered valjevo on 15 november prompting wild public celebrations in vienna franz joseph praised potiorek for seizing town cities across empire made potiorek an honorary citizen and sarajevo even named a street after him valjevo s capture led austro hungarians to believe that they were on verge of defeating serbia and that serbian army was no longer a coherent fighting force but scorched earth tactics employed by serbs during their withdrawal complicated austro hungarian advance although austro hungarians were right in assuming that serbian army was exhausted its defensive positions along kolubara had been prepared months in advance putnik s carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that losses of serbian army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with austro hungarians moreover geography of northwestern serbia favoured defensive operations since approaches to kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from direction of austria hungary and river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain in october serbs had fortified and maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an austro hungarian attack this gave them an advantage over austro hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to kragujevac serbs also established a series of field fortifications blocking approach to nis extensive series of fortifications and difficulty of terrain which they faced left austro hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in gruelling serbian countryside with almost no lines of communication battle 16 26 november thumb right 250px kolubara river in valjevo austro hungarians reached kolubara on 16 november and launched an assault against serbian defensive positions there following day serbs managed to force austro hungarians back and over course of next five days two armies fought a series of battles under heavy rain and snowfall both sides suffered heavy casualties with a large number of soldiers succumbing to frostbite and hypothermia austro hungarian assault began at lazarevac a strategically located town just south of belgrade whose capture would have given them access to mladenovac railway line and ability to outflank serbian forces holding road to belgrade further south austro hungarians attacked serbian 1st army during this assault they made mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground military historian david jordan notes that had austro hungarians attacked junction splitting 1st and uzice armies they might have been able to split serbs down centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to morava river serbian 1st army was quick to reinforce its left flank realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel during night of 18 november austro hungarians moved into position to carry out a further assault which began following morning austro hungarians main goal was to break through defenses of serbian 2nd army concentrated primarily around lazarevac and to drive serbian 1st army back towards town of gornji while simultaneously assaulting serbian positions around villages of covka and vrace brdo which threatened austro hungarian flank austro hungarians gained a foothold at vrace brdo by evening of 19 november and seized higher ground from serbs further to south serbian 1st army was forced to retreat following day giving austro hungarians ability to advance down main routes leading to kragujevac potiorek believed it was possible that putnik was trying to lure austro hungarians deeper into serbia for purpose of encircling them and then attacking their flanks but correctly assessed that serbian army was in no position to carry out such an attack austro hungarians made a renewed attack against 1st army on 21 november forcing serbs back after a series of brutal engagements austro hungarians then advanced towards mount maljen aiming to drive 1st serbian army from its positions there serbs withdrew from mountain after three days of heavy fighting potiorek decided not to pursue allowing them to make an orderly withdrawal austro hungarians had suffered heavy casualties and intensity of fighting caused them to lose cohesion as they advanced deeper into serbia terrain became increasingly difficult and exhausted already tired austro hungarian soldiers while serbian 1st army withdrew 2nd and 3rd armies fiercely resisted austro hungarian advance this led potiorek to reinforce his positions around lazarevac which he aimed to capture and use as a pivot from which to attack kragujevac while his right flank pushed down west morava valley austro hungarian advances convinced potiorek that his army had upper hand he envisaged that his forces would pursue surviving soldiers from serbian 2nd and 3rd armies and predicted that serbian 1st and uzice armies would be forced to manoeuvre towards belgrade and lazarevac where they would be encircled and destroyed combat on outskirts of lazarevac intensified once again as a result and serbian army managed to repulse every austro hungarian assault despite a lack of ammunition serbs began to run out of shells and stepanovic asked serbian supreme command that artillery of 2nd army be redirected to its rear as he felt that its failure to contribute to defense of lazarevac frustrated his troops and was bad for morale putnik instructed stepanovic to keep artillery of 2nd army on front and told him that russians had sent artillery shells for its guns stepanovic was skeptical but kept artillery on front line as instructed by 24 november potiorek was predicting that serbia would be defeated within a matter of days and appointed stjepan to be country s governor once it was occupied austro hungarians made further gains on 25 november forcing serbian army from covka and vrace brdo with an intense artillery bombardment on 26 november they attempted to cross kolubara at its junction with sava river and managed to do so in their initial attack serbs soon counterattacked and forced invaders back inflicting 50 percent casualties on austro hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt on 27 november serbian army attacked covka and vrace brdo and succeeded in forcing austro hungarians out fall of belgrade thumb right 250px serbian soldiers on island of ada ciganlija in belgrade although serbian army had put up fierce resistance and inflicted heavy casualties on austro hungarians putnik became concerned that his lines were over extended he began contemplating another strategic withdrawal one in which belgrade would have to be evacuated on night of 26 27 november austro hungarian 6th army attacked all along front and pushed deeper into serbian interior defending along an over extended front serbian supreme command decided to abandon belgrade city was evacuated on 29 30 november austro hungarians entered city on 1 december prompting yet more celebrations in vienna serbian people withdrew alongside their army and many retreated to nis where news of belgrade s fall was greeted impassively as it had been expected since beginning of war albin a german agent in nis reported more refugees are arriving by day and despite many people being sent on south there are certainly still 60 000 people here germany responded to capture of belgrade with delight and sent a congratulatory telegram to austro hungarian leadership austro hungarians ascertained that their war with serbia would soon be over and began preparing for country s occupation on 2 december anniversary of franz joseph s 66th year on throne potiorek wrote that he was laying town and fortress belgrade at his majesty s feet serbian counterattack it became increasingly clear to both potiorek and putnik that austro hungarian supply lines were over extended and so on 1 december potiorek ordered austro hungarian 6th army to stop and wait for 5th army to secure its supply lines east of valjevo railway resulting in a short pause to all austro hungarian military operations misic exploited this brief respite by withdrawing serbian 1st army a full from front line and ensured that his soldiers had an opportunity to rest serbian army then converged around mount rudnik where it received long promised supplies from its allies via nis salonika railroad putnik s confidence in ability of his army to launch a counterattack was restored on 2 december he ordered his forces to attack austro hungarians all along front and informed his officers that offensive was to have specific purpose of improving serbian morale determined to play his part aging serbian king peter i took a rifle and accompanied his troops to front serbian offensive caught austro hungarians by surprise and at time that attack was launched they were holding a large military parade through streets of belgrade austro hungarians now found themselves defending along an over extended front as potiorek had just begun strengthening his left flank leaving front line very lightly held potiorek knew that he could avoid a serious reversal on battlefield by preventing serbian 1st army from reaching watershed of kolubara and morava rivers but serbs were confident they discovered that austro hungarians had failed to adequately prepare for a serbian counterattack as their artillery was positioned well behind front line this meant that austro hungarian defenders would be unable to use their heavy guns to break up any serbian advance rested and resupplied serbs pushed forward towards belgrade by night of 2 december serbian 1st army pushed several kilometres past austro hungarian lines taking a large number of prisoners and inflicting heavy casualties on austro hungarians 2nd and 3rd armies captured a number of important positions on high ground while uzice army met fierce resistance but was ultimately able to push austro hungarians back offensive s initial success served to greatly enhance morale of serbian troops just as putnik had wanted significantly weakened austro hungarians did not have time to recover before offensive resumed following morning and they were forced into retreat by end of day on 6 december british ambassador to serbia informed british government that serb offensive was progressing brilliantly that day serbian army had broken austro hungarians at their centre and on their right flank outmanoeuvred austro hungarians were forced into a full retreat abandoning their weapons and equipment as they went meanwhile austro hungarians attempted to consolidate control around belgrade on 7 december they attacked right flank of serbian army in city s outskirts on 8 december austro hungarians fell back against uzice and valjevo serbs anticipated that their opponents would entrench themselves and attempt to block serbian army s advance but austro hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and as such were in no position to block serbian offensive austro hungarians had ensured that valjevo s defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for town s defense but their lack of prior preparation meant that hills surrounding town were devoid of any significant defensive positions serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around hills and encircling austro hungarians suffering minimal casualties serbian 3rd army then broke through defenses of 6th army at mount suvobor and stormed valjevo in nis bulgarian ambassador to serbia reported most improbable news from battleground sweet to serb ear has been going around since this morning he wrote that in last three to four days serbian army had captured one austro hungarian general 49 officers and more than 20 000 troops as well as 40 cannon and huge quantities of war materiel by 9 december austro hungarian counter offensive around belgrade lost its momentum and austro hungarians began to retreat back towards city centre one austro hungarian soldier wrote we could not have imagined that serbs were on our heels after all we had recently been victorious on 10 december serbian army captured lower reaches of drina forcing majority of surviving austro hungarian troops to flee across river they did not stop until they had crossed sava and danube and entered banat very few austro hungarian soldiers made it back into bosnia on 13 december von frank informed potiorek that he considered it impossible for austro hungarian forces to remain in belgrade for much longer as a result potiorek ordered austro hungarian forces in city to withdraw austro hungarians left belgrade on 14 and 15 december and retreated back into austria hungary under cover of their river monitors on sava and danube serbian army re entered belgrade on 15 december and was in full control of city by end of following day aftermath battle ended in a decisive serbian victory a directive issued by serbian supreme command on 16 december reported recapture of belgrade marks successful end of a great and magnificent period in our operations enemy is beaten dispersed defeated and expelled from our territory once and for all franz conrad von hotzendorf austro hungarian chief of general staff attributed defeat to a serbian thunder bolt from south battle did not achieve any of austria hungary s objectives it failed to knock serbia out of war it failed to induce bulgaria to join central powers and it failed to convince romania to stay neutral austro hungarian historians concluded after battle that defeat by serbia constituted a serious diminution in dual monarchy s prestige and self confidence battle like battle of cer before it drew considerable attention to serbia and many foreigners came to country in late 1914 to offer political and humanitarian aid or to fight alongside serbian army german publicist maximilian harden wrote serbia has risen from its grave on field of kosovo from source of kolubara river it will draw courage for greatest battles of whole century austro hungarians suffered about 225 000 casualties including 30 000 killed 173 000 wounded and 70 000 taken prisoner they reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner during battle and more than 130 cannon 70 heavy machine guns and a large quantity of materiel were captured serbs also suffered heavy casualties with 22 000 killed 91 000 wounded and 19 000 missing or captured western press was appalled with scale of atrocities committed by austro hungarian troops against serbian civilians including women and children william shepard of united press confirmed as an eyewitness that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned and whole of northwestern serbia was nearly depopulated misic was promoted to rank of vojvoda for his command during battle potiorek on other hand was relieved of command on 22 december for this most ignominious rankling and derisory defeat decision reportedly made him suicidal he was replaced by archduke eugen of austria who austro hungarians hoped would restore habsburg forces to glory days of prince eugene von frank was dismissed as commander of 5th army and replaced by karl von nadas who had commanded 4th corps at battle of cer 5th and 6th armies were then merged into a single 5th army consisting of 95 000 men dobrica cosic s novel a time of death
