theatre royal drury lane commonly known as drury lane is a west end theatre and grade i listed building in covent garden london england building faces catherine street earlier named bridges or brydges street and backs onto drury lane building is most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at same location earliest of which dated back to 1663 making it oldest theatre site in london still in use according to author peter thomson for its first two centuries drury lane could reasonably have claimed to be london s leading theatre for most of that time it was one of a handful of patent theatres granted monopoly rights to production of legitimate drama in london meaning spoken plays rather than opera dance concerts or plays with music first theatre on site was built at behest of thomas killigrew in early 1660s when theatres were allowed to reopen during english restoration initially known as theatre royal in bridges street theatre s proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at theatre on a regular basis including nell gwyn and charles hart in 1672 theatre caught fire and killigrew built a larger theatre on same plot renamed theatre royal in drury lane it opened in 1674 this building lasted nearly 120 years under leaderships of colley cibber david garrick and richard brinsley sheridan last of whom employed joseph grimaldi as theatre s resident clown in 1791 under sheridan s management building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 this new drury lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809 building that stands

companies one of these went to thomas killigrew whose company became known as king s company and who built a new theatre in drury lane letters patent also granted two companies a shared monopoly on public performance of legitimate drama in london this monopoly was challenged in 18th century by new venues and by a certain in definition of legitimate drama but remained legally in place until 1843

changeable scenery and visually gorgeous productions at former lisle s tennis court at lincoln s inn fields langhans p 16 imitating innovations at lincoln s inn fields theatre royal also featured moveable scenery with wings or shutters that could be smoothly changed between or even within acts when not in use shutters rested out of sight behind sides of proscenium arch which also served as a

offerings at theatre royal nevertheless continued to be dominated by actor driven talk drama contrasting with william davenant s baroque spectacles and operas at lincoln s inn fields internal power structures were main reason for this difference while davenant skilfully commanded a docile young troupe killigrew s authority over his veteran actors was far from absolute apparently king s company had no strong centralized management of course killigrew would have had trouble getting mohun s troupe to accept kind of absolute control davenant was able to impose upon his fledglings but squabbles over management and shares were to characterize king s company throughout its stormy career and ultimately they led to its downfall experienced actors michael mohun who pepys called best actor in world and charles hart held out for shares and good contracts in king s company such a division of power between patentee killigrew and his chief actors led to frequent conflicts that hampered theatre royal as a business venture nevertheless it was mostly at struggling theatre royal rather than at efficiently run lincoln s inn fields that plays were acted that are classics today this applies especially to new form restoration comedy dominated in 1660s by william wycherley and theatre royal s house dramatist john dryden actors such as hart and charles ii s mistress nell gwyn developed and

duke s company contributed to its decline eventually in 1682 king s company merged with duke s 1674 theatre royal building contained a warren of rooms including storage space and dressing rooms used by management and performers nearly seventy people in total as well as some fifty technical staff members additionally three rooms were provided for scripts including a library for their storage a

description of theatre in 1698 his use of word amphitheatre supports view that drury lane had a circular line of boxes surrounding its pit as misson points out seating was divided by class and tickets were priced accordingly box seats used by nobility and wealthy gentry cost 5 shillings benches in pit where some gentry sat but also critics and scholars cost 3 shillings tradesmen and professionals occupied first gallery with seats costing 2 shillings while servants and other ordinary people as misson refers to them occupied 1 shilling seats of upper gallery seats were not numbered and were offered on a first come first served basis leading many members of gentry to send servants to reserve seats well ahead of performances stage was wide and deep with a raked floor from footlights to

small spikes traced edge of stage apron to prevent audiences from climbing onto stage at very back of stage a wide door opened to reveal drury lane an added difficulty for killigrew and his sons thomas and charles was political unrest of 1678 1684 with popish plot and exclusion bill crisis distracting potential audiences from things theatrical this affected both king s and duke s companies but most of all king s which had no profit margin to carry them through lean years in 1682 companies merged or rather king s was absorbed by duke s led at time by thomas betterton united company as it was now called chose drury lane as their production house leaving duke s company s theatre in dorset garden closed for a time in 1688 betterton was removed from managerial control by alexander davenant son of william davenant original patent holder for duke s company davenant s management with charles killigrew proved brief and disastrous and by 1693 he was fleeing to canary islands in wake of embezzlement charges theatre royal found itself in hands of lawyer christopher rich for next 16 years spiers companies neither davenant s nor killigrew s sons were much better than crooks and rich attempted to recoup their depredations of company s resources by cost cutting tyranny pitting actor against actor and slashing salaries by 1695 actors including day to day manager and acting legend thomas betterton were alienated and humiliated enough to walk out and set up a cooperative company of their own nine men and six women departed all of them established professional performers including such draws as tragedian elizabeth barry and comedian anne bracegirdle leaving united company henceforth known as patent company in a very despicable condition according to an anonymous contemporary pamphlet thumb david garrick theatre manager 1747 1776 is portrayed in title role of richard iii in this painting by william hogarth a private letter from 19 november 1696 reported that drury lane has no company at all and unless a new play comes out on saturday revives their reputation they must break new play is assumed to have been john vanbrugh s relapse and it turned out success company needed christopher rich continued as its head until 1709 when patent in question was actually revoked amid a complex tangle of political machinations a lawyer named william collier was briefly given right to mount productions in drury lane but by 1710 troupe was in hands of actors colley cibber robert wilks and thomas doggett a triumvirate that eventually found themselves sharply satirised in alexander pope s dunciad in 1713 barton booth replaced doggett on 2 march 1717 was premiere of ballet loves of mars and venus choreographed by john weaver and was first ballet to be performed in england cibber was de facto leader of triumvirate and he led theatre through a controversial but generally successful period until 1733 when he sold his controlling interest to john highmore it is likely that sale was at a vastly inflated price and that colley s goal was simply to get out of debts and make a profit see robert lowe in his edition of cibber s apology members of troupe at time were most displeased an actor s revolt was organised and executed charles fleetwood came to control theatre fleetwood s tenure was tumultuous his abolition of practice of allowing footmen free access to upper gallery led to riots in 1737 and fleetwood s gambling problems entangled theatre in his own financial difficulties it was during this period that actor charles macklin a native of inishowen in county donegal in ulster rose to fame propelled by a singular performance as shylock in an early 1741 production of merchant of venice in which he introduced a realistic naturalistic style of acting abandoning artificial bombast typical to dramatic roles prior left thumb facade on bridges street added in 1775 this gave theatre its first on street entrance in 1747 fleetwood s playhouse patent expired theatre and a patent renewal were purchased by actor david garrick who had trained under macklin earlier and partner james lacy garrick served as manager and lead actor of theatre until roughly 1766 and continued on in management role for another ten years after that he is remembered as one of great stage actors and is especially associated with advancing shakespearean tradition in english theatre during his time at drury lane company mounted at least 24 of shakespeare s plays encyclopaedia britannica eleventh edition some of shakespeare s surge in popularity during this period can be traced to licensing act of 1737 which mandated governmental approval of any play before it could be performed and thereby created something of a vacuum of new material to perform garrick shared stage with company including peg susannah cibber hannah pritchard kitty clive spranger barry richard yates and ned shuter it was under garrick s management that spectators were for first time barred from stage itself garrick commissioned robert adam and his brother james to renovate theatre s interior which they did in 1775 their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing bridges street this facade was first time any structure that might be considered part of theatre proper actually abutted street building like 1663 original had been built in centre of block hemmed in by other structures narrow passage from bridges street to theatre now became an interior hallway some theatre office space also went up behind new facade thumb interior of third and largest theatre to

children as extras at drury lane including joseph grimaldi who made his stage debut at theatre in 1780 grimaldi became best known for his development of modern day white face clown and popularised role of clown in many pantomimes and towards end of 1790s grimaldi starred in robinson crusoe which confirmed him as a key christmas pantomime performer many pantomimes followed but his career at

hearing a player s voice quite difficult to compensate productions mounted in new theatre tended more toward spectacle than spoken word an example of such a spectacle is a 1794 production that
