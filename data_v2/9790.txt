squadrons of frederick great s army and is credited with development of prussian cavalry to its efficient level of performance in seven years war his cavalryman father retired and then died while seydlitz was still young subsequently he was mentored by margrave of brandenburg schwedt seydlitz s superb horsemanship and his recklessness combined to make him a stand out subaltern and he emerged as a redoubtable rittmeister cavalry captain in war of austrian succession 1740 1748 during first and second silesian wars seydlitz became legendary throughout prussian army both for his leadership and for his reckless courage during seven years war he came into his own as a cavalry general known for his coup d oeil his ability to assess at a glance entire battlefield situation and to understand intuitively what needed to be done he excelled at converting king s directives into flexible tactics at battle of rossbach his cavalry was instrumental in routing french and imperial armies his cavalry subsequently played an important role in crushing habsburg and imperial left flank at battle of leuthen seydlitz was wounded in battle several times after battle of kunersdorf in august 1759 he semi retired to recover from his wounds charged with protection of city of berlin he was not healthy enough to campaign again until 1761 frederick rewarded him with order of black eagle on field after battle of rossbach he had already received pour le merite for his action at battle of kolin although estranged from frederick for several years two were reconciled during seydlitz s final illness seydlitz died in 1773 and frederick s heirs included his name on equestrian statue of frederick great in berlin in a place of honor early life seydlitz was born on 3 february 1721 in in duchy of cleves where his father daniel florian seydlitz was a major of prussian cavalry with cuirassier regiment markgraf friedrich wilhelm of brandenburg schwedt no 5 in 1726 his father left military service and moved family to schwedt where he became a forestry master in east prussia senior seydlitz died in 1728 leaving a widow and children in restricted financial circumstances sources differ on number of siblings seydlitz had reports two sisters and a brother simply says three children total limited schooling was available to young seydlitz sources differ whether he knew how to speak and write in french lingua franca of frederick great s court one biographer bernhard von poten maintained that his german was good and if he knew french he preferred german and wrote it with a fine firm hand unusually correct in well formed sentences and with apt expression and he knew enough latin to express himself well his future sovereign frederick always addressed him in german by seydlitz s seventh year he could ride a horse well raced with older boys and he was by most accounts a wild and high spirited child at age of fourteen he went as a page to court of margrave frederick wilhelm of brandenburg schwedt who had been his father s colonel margrave was a grandson of great elector and a nephew to both frederick i of prussia and leopold of anhalt dessau himself a reckless man mad margrave inspired in young seydlitz a passion for feats of daredevil horsemanship seydlitz did not limit this passion to horses margrave once dared him to ride a wild stag which he did seydlitz became a skilled horseman and many stories tell of his feats best known of which involved riding between sails of a windmill in full swing seydlitz remained in his position as a page to margrave until king frederick william appointed him as cornet in margrave s cuirassier regiment no 5 his father s old regiment on 13 february 1740 military career promotions cornet 13 february 1740 rittmeister captain of cavalry 1743 major 28 july 1745 lieutenant colonel 21 september 1752 colonel 1755 major general 20 june 1757 lieutenant general 5 november 1757 inspector general of cavalry in silesia 1763 seydlitz s first months as a cornet were made difficult by regimental colonel who considered him a spy for margrave and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally making it clear that cornet was no match for colonel within a year of seydlitz s commission old king frederick william died and his son frederick ii of prussia ascended to throne frederick claimed silesia from habsburg s maria theresa and made a broad appeal to arms margrave s regiment played an important role in ensuing war during which seydlitz came to notice of king several times once when frederick asked caliber of artillery shelling prussian line opinions were divided and vague seydlitz rode in front of battery halting in their line of fire when he saw a ball hit ground he picked it up wrapped it in his handkerchief and presented it to king in may 1742 while stationed with his regiment in during first silesian war regimental colonel ordered him to take 30 men and hold a village post until infantry came to his assistance despite heavy fire grudging colonel did not send reinforcements realizing what had happened brigade s general took three squadrons of heavy cavalry to relieve seydlitz but these were turned back by fire from austrian line subsequently seydlitz was forced to surrender his small unit he entered into austrian captivity with several of his closest comrades including charles de warnery frederick exchanged an austrian captain for cornet seydlitz upon his return from captivity seydlitz had a choice to wait for first lieutenancy that became available in a cuirassier regiment or take immediate command of a troop of hussars as a captain hussars were newest form of service in prussian army and not as prestigious an assignment as cuirassiers but seydlitz chose immediate promotion to a lesser unit in 1743 king made him a rittmeister captain in 4th hussars he entirely skipped rank of lieutenant with 4th hussars he was stationed in city of trebnitz and he brought his squadron to a state of conspicuous efficiency in august 1744 king entered bohemia took prague and then moved south lieutenant general count nassau led vanguard and seydlitz participated with hussars commanded by major hans heinrich adam schutz a violent man of whose conduct of warfare seydlitz disapproved schutz reportedly peasants to serve as his guides and then executed them when he was finished with them he burned villages including churches and generally waged war on silesian peasants seydlitz served through second silesian war on 22 may hans karl von winterfeldt trusted by king as a good judge of character reported to frederick certainly at hohenfriedberg on 4 june seydlitz captured saxon general georg sigismund von personally after he had cut reins from him based largely on his conduct at hohenfriedberg and winterfeldt s recommendation frederick promoted seydlitz to major on 28 july at unusually young age of twenty four seydlitz led his squadron at battle of soor on 30 september scouting enemy s position before battle and then participating in action he was also present in engagement at on 23 november which proved convincingly to frederick benefit of close support during a cavalry charge at successful action on 27 november seydlitz led 15 squadrons in an attack on austrian rear guard austrians were dispersed and nearly destroyed development of cavalry tactics thumb right seydlitz smoked a pipe and when he tossed it away it was sign for his troopers to proceed depicted here at battle of rossbach in a section of a history painting by richard knotel 1857 1914 after frederick concluded peace on 25 december 1748 seydlitz returned with his squadron to trebnitz in subsequent years of peace seydlitz developed flexible cavalry tactics he assembled a plan on tactical form and training for prussian cavalry and presented it to king frederick approved procedures and seydlitz established a rigorous training program he would leave his own estate by jumping gate he required similar horsemanship from all his men regardless of whether they were cuirassiers hussars or dragoons they had to be capable of galloping across broken fields wheeling in formation and riding in close action furthermore they had to be prepared to support any movement of infantry or to react to any action from enemy under seydlitz s direction prussian cavalry learned to use only their swords not pistols or carbines that could not be fired with accuracy or then had to be reloaded frederick set up straw dummies for his troopers to shoot their shots were woefully inaccurate but seydlitz s tactics demonstrated that troopers could hit their target with a sword every time generally cavalry horses were sturdy warm blood from frederick s stud farm in east prussia on 21 september 1752 after a successful review in which different cavalry forms demonstrated their competencies king promoted seydlitz to lieutenant colonel and commander in chief of cavalry and on 13 october of same year to commander of dragoon regiment wurttemberg no 12 whose staff was at treptow frederick was not satisfied with regiment s performance and instructed seydlitz to put it back into order in 1753 frederick appointed seydlitz to command of 8th cuirassiers in seydlitz s hands this regiment soon became a model for rest of prussian army s mounted force in 1755 frederick promoted him to colonel by start of seven years war seydlitz s transformed cavalry had become frederick s pride and joy it had unrivaled training and an esprit de corps bolstered by frederick s confidence in its members and by their confidence in seydlitz king had issued orders that no prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response under penalty of being cashiered consequently prussian cavalrymen were active impetuous and aggressive for king seydlitz s cavalry became dynamic factor in army of state and would be tool by which frederick could challenge empires in 1756 seydlitz s cavalry became frederick s weapon of choice seven years war in may 1757 in defiance of custom of holding heavy cavalry in reserve seydlitz brought his regiment forward to join advance guard at battle of prague here he nearly lost his life attempting to ride through a marshy pool his horse became stuck in quicksand and his troopers pulled him away at prussian loss at kolin in june 1757 he and a cavalry brigade checked austrian pursuit by a brilliant charge two days later king promoted him to major general and awarded him pour le merite seydlitz felt he had deserved promotion for a long time for he responded to hans joachim von zieten s congratulations by saying it was high time excellency if they wanted more work out of me i am already thirty six another example of his leadership and his coup d oeil ability to see at a glance what needed to be done occurred after battle of kolin loss at kolin forced king to lift siege at prague king s brother augustus william took command of army and ordered retreat from prague seydlitz was attached to advanced corps of karl christoph von in a brigade of ten squadrons as seydlitz s wing entered lusatia near town of austrians were present in force and seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in town tricking austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party his cavalry burst on austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape in close column and was quickly out of sight battle of rossbach on morning of battle of rossbach frederick passed over two senior generals and placed seydlitz in command of whole of cavalry much to those men s annoyance and to seydlitz s satisfaction at rossbach seydlitz s coup d oeil and his understanding of king s objectives led to battlefield success after positioning cavalry in two ranked lines he watched french army move for several minutes while puffing on his pipe his troopers never took their eyes off him when he threw his pipe away this was signal they had waited for first line of massed squadrons surged forward smashing unprepared french in flank typically cavalry action in mid eighteenth century meant a single cavalry charge cavalry would spend rest of action pursuing fleeing troops at rossbach though not content with this single attack seydlitz called his second formation of squadrons in another charge he then withdrew all 38 squadrons into a copse where they regrouped under cover of trees a county roadway passing through reichertswerben is named von seydlitz strasse google maps seydlitz strasse in reichertswerben

headlong into french columns a massive wall of horses galloping flank to flank their riders flashing swords and maneuvering at full speed by end of battle only seven infantry battalions of frederick s army had fired a shot rest of victory had been work of seydlitz s 38 squadrons and karl friedrich von moller s artillery that day prussians took as trophies 72 cannons 62 percent of french imperial artillery seven flags and 21 standards with some 3 500 horsemen and 20 cannons plus a portion of prince henry s regiment of infantry prussian army had defeated combined armies of two european powers france and holy roman empire tactics at rossbach became a landmark in history of military art same night on field king awarded seydlitz order of black eagle and promoted him to lieutenant general seydlitz had been wounded during melee and he remained out of action for four months nursed by a lady in leipzig campaign 1758 59 seydlitz rejoined king in 1758 and on 25 august at battle of zorndorf seydlitz s cavalry again secured victory he led thirty six squadrons into a mass of russian cavalry mingled with infantry this charge broke russian right wing and sent them running for woods at prussian debacle at on 14 october 1758 he covered prussian retreat with 108 squadrons and in disaster of kunersdorf on 12 august 1759 he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by russians his 8th cuirassiers was one of few intact regiments at end of battle while recuperating in berlin he helped organize a defense of city during austro russian raid october 1760 although he was unable to prevent russians from briefly occupying city frederick later praised seydlitz for his conduct seydlitz s health frequently kept him off battlefield and he did not reappear at front until 1761 then he received command of a wing of prince henry s army composed of troops of all arms and many of his fellow officers expressed doubts as to his fitness for this command as his service had been with cavalry exclusively subsequently though at freiberg on 29 october 1762 his direction of both his infantry and his cavalry in turn decided outcome of battle later life thumb statue of seydlitz at wilhelm platz in berlin after seven years war concluded with treaty of hubertusburg 1763 seydlitz became inspector general of cavalry in silesia where eleven regiments were permanently stationed and where frederick sent all his most promising officers to be trained in 1767 frederick promoted seydlitz to general of cavalry seydlitz s later years were marred by domestic unhappiness during his convalescence in berlin on 18 april 1761 he had married susannah johanna albertine hacke daughter of hans christoph friedrich graf von hacke and she was eventually unfaithful to him reportedly due to syphilis from which he had suffered for decades he had at least one daughter according to an early biographer anton konig and two according to another biographer robert lawley oldest daughter married first to an official from breslau and was divorced she married second to a polish count and divorced soon after she eventually converted to catholicism but died in a madhouse in brieg youngest lived to old age and died in poverty near lausitz by end of decade some misunderstanding brought an end to his formerly close friendship with king seydlitz s health had been declining for years and he suffered from recurrent bouts of syphilis in 1772 after an attack of apoplexy he completed a couple of stays at spa at carlsbad to take mineral waters while these helped somewhat his other activities continued without moderation and to his detriment a subordinate brought him two healthy circassian beauties whose company he enjoyed but who undoubtedly stressed his tenuous health in august 1773 in his last illness frederick and seydlitz met again at seydlitz s home at near ohlau now poland king sat beside his sickbed horrified at seydlitz s condition and even persuaded him to take some of his medications but seydlitz would not look at him illness had already deformed his face eventually paralyzed whether from another stroke or underlying tertiary syphilis seydlitz died at ohlau in silesia in november 1773 character seydlitz was generally admired for superb coup d oeil that allowed him to utilize cavalry to its full potential his 19th century biographer k a varnhagen von ense related that seydlitz lived above all for service and promoted training of his hussars before all else according to anton balthasar konig who wrote in 1780 1790 seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes one would gather that seydlitz was a drunkard a rake and a savage but another of his biographers bernhard von poten cited conflicting descriptions offered by seydlitz s contemporaries particularly warnery as more accurate nevertheless there is some evidence to support konig s assertion at least of seydlitz s excesses seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff as many officers did he was indeed reckless as his career testified he enjoyed company of women and seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness memorials in 1851 frederick william iv frederick s great great nephew included seydlitz s name on equestrian statue of frederick great in berlin honoring those who had helped to build prussian state seydlitz holds a position of honor as one of four full sized mounted figures sharing first tier of plinth with king s brother his
