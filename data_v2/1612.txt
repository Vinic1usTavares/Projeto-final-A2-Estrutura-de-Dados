americium is a synthetic radioactive chemical element with symbol am and atomic number 95 it is a transuranic member of actinide series in periodic table located under lanthanide element europium and thus by analogy was named after americas americium was first produced in 1944 by group of glenn t seaborg from berkeley california at metallurgical laboratory of university of chicago a part of manhattan project although it is third element in transuranic series it was discovered fourth after heavier curium discovery was kept secret and only released to public in november 1945 most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100 grams of americium it is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges several unusual applications such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion have been proposed for isotope 242mam but they are as yet hindered by scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer americium is a relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance its common isotopes are 241am and 243am in chemical compounds americium usually assumes oxidation state 3 especially in solutions several other oxidation states are known ranging from 2 to 7 and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contain small intrinsic radiogenic defects due to induced by self irradiation with alpha particles which accumulates with time this can cause a drift of some material properties over time more noticeable in older samples history thumb left 60 inch cyclotron at lawrence radiation laboratory university of

with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties americium is a highly radioactive element when freshly prepared it has a silvery white metallic lustre but then slowly tarnishes in air with a density of 12 g cm3 americium is less dense than both curium 13 52 g cm3 and plutonium 19 8 g cm3 but has a higher density than europium 5 264 g cm3 mostly because of its higher atomic mass americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than actinides before it th pa u np and pu its melting point of 1173 degc is significantly higher than that of plutonium 639 degc and europium 826 degc but lower than for curium 1340 degc at ambient conditions americium is present in its most stable a form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry and a space group p63 mmc with cell parameters a 346 8 pm and c 1124 pm and four atoms per unit cell crystal consists of a double hexagonal close packing with layer sequence abac and so is isotypic with a lanthanum and several actinides such as a curium crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature when compressed at room temperature to 5 gpa a am transforms to b modification which has a face centered cubic fcc symmetry space group fmm and lattice constant a 489 pm this fcc structure is equivalent to closest packing with sequence abc upon further compression to 23 gpa americium transforms to an orthorhombic g am structure similar to that of a uranium there are no further transitions observed up to 52 gpa except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 gpa there is no consistency on status of this phase in literature which also sometimes lists a b and g phases as i ii and iii b g transition is accompanied by a 6 decrease in crystal volume although theory also predicts a significant volume change for a b transition it is not observed experimentally pressure of a b transition decreases with increasing temperature and when a americium is heated at ambient pressure at 770 degc it changes into an fcc phase which is different from b am and at 1075 degc it converts to a body centered cubic structure pressure temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum praseodymium and neodymium as with many other actinides self damage of crystal structure due to alpha particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium it is especially noticeable at low temperatures where mobility of produced structure defects is relatively low by broadening of x ray diffraction peaks this effect makes somewhat uncertain temperature of americium and some of its properties such as electrical resistivity so for americium 241 resistivity at 4 2 k increases with time from about 2 uohm cm to 10 uohm cm after 40 hours and saturates at about 16 uohm cm after 140 hours this effect is less pronounced at room temperature due to annihilation of radiation defects also heating to room temperature sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity in fresh samples resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 uohm cm at liquid helium to 69 uohm cm at room temperature this behavior is similar to that of neptunium uranium thorium and protactinium but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60 k followed by saturation room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium plutonium and curium but higher than for uranium thorium and protactinium americium is paramagnetic in a wide
