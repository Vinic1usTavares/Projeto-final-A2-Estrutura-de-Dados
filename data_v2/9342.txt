tropical storm barry was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on florida panhandle during august 2001 third tropical cyclone and second named storm of 2001 atlantic hurricane season barry developed from a tropical wave that moved off coast of africa on july 24 wave entered caribbean on july 29 and spawned a low pressure area which organized into tropical storm barry on august 3 after fluctuations in intensity and track storm attained peak winds of over gulf of mexico barry headed northward and moved ashore along gulf coast before dissipating on august 7 unlike devastating tropical storm allison earlier in season barry s effects were moderate nine deaths occurred six in cuba and three in florida as a tropical cyclone barry produced heavy rainfall that peaked at at tallahassee gusts in area reached which was highest wind speed recording for storm precursor tropical wave to barry dropped large amounts of rain on southern florida leading to significant flooding and structural damage moderate flooding and wind damage occurred throughout florida panhandle as storm s remnants tracked inland parts of mississippi valley received light precipitation barry caused an estimated 30 million 2001 usd in damage meteorological history on july 24 2001 a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa and tracked westward across atlantic ocean little cyclonic development occurred until july 28 when convection began to increase along wave wave moved into eastern caribbean on july 29 and its convection continued to increase while it tracked west northwest over subsequent few days disturbance emerged into gulf of mexico on august 1 with rainfall noted over southern florida and western tip of cuba that same day a broad low pressure system developed along wave near dry tortugas at end of florida keys which began to intensify as it moved northwestward at around 1800 utc on august 2 an air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft investigating system discovered that low had organized into a tropical storm which received name barry post hurricane season reanalysis however revealed that low had become a tropical depression six hours earlier there is uncertainty as to whether barry actually held tropical characteristics at time of designation because of an upper level low that was situated over cyclone s surface center when barry became a tropical cyclone its convection wrapped around roughly half of center outflow in eastern semicircle was good although due to upper level wind shear it was restricted to southeast of circulation cyclone became embedded within a mid to upper level trough between ridge over central u s and ridge over northwestern caribbean a strong upper level cyclonic shear axis extended from just south of cape hatteras to near brownsville texas which prevented barry from accelerating in forward speed ridge over united states weakened thus collapsing steering pattern this resulted in a west southwestward drifting motion of tropical storm by around august 3 early on august 3 strong westerly winds prevailed and separated center of circulation from what limited convection remained storm quickly regained some convection although maximum sustained winds remained weak at about 40 mph 60 km h despite a slight drop in barometric pressure post season analysis revealed barry weakened into a tropical depression early on august 4 due to persistent wind shear and falling external pressure at 1800 utc on august 4 cyclone re intensified slightly and was upgraded to a tropical storm as shear decreased early on august 5 a strengthening period began as deep convection ignited over and near low level center prior to landfall banding features developed on eastern half of circulation despite some residual westerly shear within seven hours barometric pressure dropped from 1004 mb to 990 mb and overall satellite presentation had begun to improve barry reached its peak intensity at 1800 utc on august 5 with winds of just shy of hurricane status an eye formed at around same time at 0500 utc on august 6 barry increased in forward speed and made landfall at santa rosa beach florida with winds of moving inland system weakened rapidly to a tropical depression national hurricane center issued its last advisory on storm early on august 6 by evening hours maximum sustained winds near center were around to as system slowed significantly and drifted northwest at about depression turned northwestward and steadily weakened to a remnant low near memphis tennessee on august 7 and low dissipated on august 8 over southeastern missouri preparations right thumb radar image of storm making landfall on florida panhandle alt radar image of storm making landfall on florida panhandle storm s eye is visible near center in advance of storm national hurricane center issued tropical storm watches and warnings for much of u s gulf coast they were upgraded to a hurricane warning when storm was predicted to reach hurricane intensity because that strengthening failed to occur hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning shortly before landfall westward warnings for louisiana and mississippi were discontinued after tropical storm barry made landfall all tropical storm warnings for florida panhandle were discontinued flood warnings were issued for parts of leon and wakulla counties while a flash flood watch was in effect for parts of southern georgia a tornado watch was issued for eastern florida panhandle southern georgia as well as portions of central and eastern alabama as barry approached florida panhandle voluntary evacuations took place in eight counties shelters opened in six counties though most were placed on standby in parts of franklin county mandatory evacuations were ordered and in okaloosa county tolls on mid bay bridge were suspended forty c 130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from hurlburt field were moved to little rock air force base in arkansas to flee storm s projected path in tallahassee county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding at grand isle state park park rangers moved picnic tables out of tidal range and closed camping grounds for a period of time additionally storm forced nasa to delay a shuttle launch in southern florida elsewhere thousands of personnel were evacuated from several offshore oil platforms city of new orleans closed 60 of its 72 floodgates to avoid possible flooding throughout southeastern louisiana including new orleans roughly 500 red cross volunteers and staff members were on standby threat of storm forced cancellation of an n sync concert at pro player stadium impact cuba and florida left thumb rainfall totals across united states alt map of rainfall totals from tropical storm map is mainly focused on southeast united states precursor tropical wave to barry dropped widespread rainfall in western cuba but no damage was reported offshore high seas sank a cuban refugee boat drowning 6 of its 28 passengers three people in florida were killed by storm and total damage is estimated at around 30 million 2001 usd in southern florida precursor to barry produced 3 in 75 mm to with rainfall peaking at rain helped relieve persistent drought conditions however it caused significant flooding in martin county on august 2 where a total of 300 homes received water damage about 63 structures and 6 mobile homes in county sustained major damage in treasure coast catfish reportedly swam through flooded streets winds downed a radio tower striking a house due to initial slow movement of storm outer rainbands began affecting florida panhandle on august 4 with heaviest rainfall observed on august 5 6 storm dropped 5 in 125 mm to 9 in 225 mm highest official report was at tallahassee though unofficial reports ranged as high as 11 in 175 mm rainfall inundated several structures in bay county due to roof damage flooding occurred in leon county and parts of apalachicola national forest where torrential rains flowed into cascade lakes lake bradford and munson slough munson slough rose to its highest level since 1994 numerous county and secondary roads were closed by floodwater in walton washington and bay counties as well as in tallahassee area in and around tallahassee 100 vehicles were stalled by flood waters and towed while four residents of an apartment complex on allen road were forced to evacuate due to rising waters sporadic flooding also occurred in franklin county and wakulla county an indirect death occurred from a traffic accident due to heavy rain in jackson county wind gusts peaked at at eglin air force base range station c 72 light to moderate winds were widespread causing damage throughout walton washington bay calhoun gulf and okaloosa counties trees were downed or damaged and several structures suffered light wind damage window damage was reported at a high rise condominium building in destin while nearby mid bay bridge was closed due to high winds freeport elementary school in walton county sustained minor roof damage storm surge was generally light ranging from to with only minor beach erosion as a result as a tropical system barry spawned a few weak tornadoes that caused minor damage in an outer rain band a lightning strike in jacksonville killed one person another death is blamed on a rip current off of sanibel island in total storm left 34 000 customers in state without power elsewhere tropical storm barry dropped light to moderate rainfall across alabama peaking at near town of evergreen about 2 in 50 mm fell over state s peanut growing region helping to alleviate drought conditions heavy showers were also reported in birmingham area despite moderate rainfall totals inland coastal locations received very little precipitation minor street flooding occurred in geneva enterprise and new brockton wind gusts peaked at at montgomery although damage was light mostly from downed trees damage to awnings and small structures was reported in barry s remnants produced light rainfall across mississippi and georgia though no damage was reported as storm continued to track inland it dropped up to 3 in 75 mm of rain
