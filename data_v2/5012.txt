fir clump stone circle was a stone circle located in burderop wood near wroughton in south western english county of wiltshire ring was part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of britain ireland and brittany during late neolithic and early bronze age over a period between 3300 and 900 bce purpose of such monuments is unknown although archaeologists speculate that stones represented supernatural entities for circle s builders fir clump stone circle was a concentric circle consisting of sarsen megaliths and measured by 86 5m in diameter it was one of at least seven stone circles that are known to have been erected in area south of swindon in northern wiltshire during 19th century megaliths in fir clump stone circle were levelled and circle destroyed buried megaliths were rediscovered in 1965 by archaeologist richard reiss who measured size of monument and recorded its existence in 1969 these stones were removed during construction of m4 motorway context while transition from early neolithic to late neolithic in fourth and third millennia bce saw much economic and technological continuity there was a considerable change in style of monuments erected particularly in what is now southern and eastern england by 3000 bce long barrows causewayed enclosures and cursuses which had predominated in early neolithic were no longer built and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds these include earthen henges timber circles and stone circles stone circles are found in most areas of britain where stone is available with exception of island s south eastern corner they are most densely concentrated in south western britain and on north eastern horn of scotland near aberdeen tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2 400 years from 3300 to 900 bce with major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1 300 bce these stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during period immediately following their creation this suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence but may have been deliberately left as silent and empty monuments archaeologist mike parker pearson suggests that in neolithic britain stone was associated with dead and wood with living other archaeologists have suggested that stone might not represent ancestors but rather other supernatural entities such as deities in area of modern wiltshire various stone circles were erected best known of which are avebury and stonehenge all of other examples are ruined and in some cases have been destroyed as noted by archaeologist aubrey burl these examples have left behind only frustrating descriptions and vague positions most of known wiltshire examples were erected on low lying positions in landscape in area south of swindon in northern part of wiltshire at least seven stone circles are known to have existed often only a few miles distant from one another these have all been destroyed although vestiges of one survives stones at day house lane stone circle in coate survive in a fallen state fir clump stone circle was located a mile south of broome stone circle description fir clump stone circle consisted of coarse sarsen megaliths a concentric circle it measured by in total width inner ring measured by and was flattened at northern end outer ring was found to be fragmentary around to west of circle was a stone row measuring in length that was aligned on a north north west to south south east axis discovery and destruction thumb right m4 motorway with burderop wood on right hand side it was close to here that stone circle once stood in late nineteenth century antiquarian a d passmore produced two notebooks in which he discussed various archaeological sites in wiltshire here he recorded a local tradition that there had been a large stone circle near railway bridge outside swindon old town and old marlborough road to ladder hill he also recorded that circle had been broken up about thirty years prior and that as such he did not know how many stones had been part of circle he added that at location of circle many small pieces of sarsen could be found contents of passmore s notebooks and their references to fir clump stone circle were only published in 2004 after they had been purchased by wiltshire archaeological and natural history society stone circle was rediscovered in 1965 by richard reiss who noted that at time sarsen stones were fallen he produced a plan of site as it then existed in 1969 these stones were removed during construction of m4 motorway burl called this destruction a megalithic tragedy references notes footnotes bibliography external links fir clump burderop wood at
