mythological creatures and origins and significance of ancient greeks own cult and ritual practices modern scholars study myths in an attempt to shed light on religious and political institutions of ancient greece and its civilization and to gain understanding of nature of myth making itself greek myths were initially propagated in an oral poetic tradition most likely by minoan and mycenaean singers starting in 18th century bc eventually myths of heroes of trojan war and its aftermath became part of oral tradition of homer s epic poems iliad and odyssey two poems by homer s near

identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves e g apollo is apollo as leader of muses alternatively epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of god

this mythological overlap in addition to combination of two mythological traditions association of romans with eastern religions led to further north beard price religions of rome 259 for instance cult of sun was introduced in rome after aurelian s successful campaigns in syria asiatic divinities mithras that is to say sun and ba al were combined with apollo and helios into one sol invictus
