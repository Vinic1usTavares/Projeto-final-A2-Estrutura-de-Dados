fantasy vii advent children in north order final fantasy vii was produced and scripted by madhouse and directed by morio asaka decision to create last order arose from positive reaction towards a popular promotional clip created by madhouse for game before crisis madhouse was chosen to produce ova partly because of their success with clip and because president of madhouse was very enthusiastic about project however main reason for choosing madhouse was that company understood significance of making a final fantasy vii animation as it was considered a large responsibility to animate most popular game in ff final fantasy series tetsuya nomura character designer for final fantasy vii series and co director of advent children acted as supervising director he had right to reject or accept concept drawings for last order as a result nomura had a large quantity of images redrawn to extent that entire production was in jeopardy production lasted six months production crew considered most challenging part of creating ova to be making nomura s drawings move on screen because last order was hand drawn crew faced difficulties creating uniform lines another issue was overall feel of each scene original drawings were done by several artists resulting in various scenes having different styles producer akio ofuji explained that they wanted to make sure final product was of very high quality so they worked with production company day and night straight through to deadline nomura and ofuji agreed that many scenes showing important events and feelings in final fantasy vii had been fragmented and disjointed and so they had decided that those scenes would be subject of last order giving audience of advent children film last order was released with a more enjoyable understanding they used film as an opportunity to portray zack properly as a handsome light hearted man who was in everyone s memory last order also details tseng s growth and his feelings towards his both job and events depicted wherein he attempts to get his own ideas of justice heard but later abandons his moral values in order to carry out a cruel mission ofuji commented that those are kind of scenes we
