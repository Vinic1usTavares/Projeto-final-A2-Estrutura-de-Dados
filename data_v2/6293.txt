japanese war of 1894 1895 both russia and japan had ambitions to control manchuria and korea resulting in tensions between two nations japan had begun negotiations to reduce tensions in 1901 but russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve problems japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete russian armament programs situation was worsened by russia s failure to withdraw its troops from manchuria in october 1903 as promised final straws were news of russian timber concessions in northern korea and russian refusal to acknowledge japanese interests in manchuria while continuing to place conditions on japanese activities in korea these actions caused japanese government to decide in december 1903 that war was inevitable as tensions with japan increased pacific squadron began mooring in outer harbor at night in order to react more quickly to any japanese attempt to land troops in korea on night of 8 9 february 1904 imperial japanese navy launched a surprise attack on russian fleet at port arthur petropavlovsk was not hit and sortied following morning when japanese combined fleet commanded by vice admiral togo heihachiro attacked togo had expected night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was and anticipated that russians would be badly disorganized and weakened but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack japanese ships were spotted by protected cruiser which was patrolling offshore and alerted russian defenses togo chose to attack russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage ships with his secondary guns splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as japanese 8 and 6 inch guns inflicted little damage on russian ships which concentrated all their fire on japanese ships with some effect petropavlovsk was lightly damaged in engagement by one 6 inch and two 12 inch shells killing two and wounding five in return she fired twenty 12 inch and sixty eight 6 inch shells at japanese battleships but none hit displeased by poor performance of first pacific squadron naval
