indiana class was a class of three coastal defense battleships launched in 1893 they were first battleships built by united states navy comparable to contemporary european ships such as british authorized in 1890 and commissioned between november 1895 and april 1896 they were relatively small battleships with heavy armor and ordnance that pioneered use of an intermediate battery specifically intended for coastal defense their freeboard was insufficient to deal well with waves of open ocean their turrets lacked counterweights and main belt armor was placed too low to be effective under most conditions ships were named and and were designated battleship number 1 through 3 all three served in spanish american war although oregon which was stationed on west coast had to cruise around south america to east coast first after war oregon returned to pacific and participated in philippine american war and boxer rebellion while her sister ships were restricted to training missions in atlantic ocean after 1903 obsolete battleships were de and recommissioned several times last time during world war i when indiana and massachusetts served as training ships while oregon was a transport escort for siberian intervention in 1919 all three ships were decommissioned for final time indiana was sunk in shallow water as an explosives test target a year later and sold for scrap in 1924 massachusetts was scuttled off coast of pensacola in 1920 and used as an artillery target wreck was never scrapped and is now a florida underwater archaeological preserve oregon was initially preserved as a museum but was sold for scrap during world war ii scrapping was later halted and stripped hulk was used as an ammunition barge during battle of guam hulk was finally sold for scrap in 1956 background indiana class was very controversial at time of its approval by united states congress a policy board convened by secretary of navy benjamin f tracy came up with an ambitious 15 year naval construction program on 16 july 1889 three years after and were authorized battleships in their plan would include ten first rate long range battleships with a top speed and a steaming radius of at maximum these ocean going ships were envisioned as a possible fleet in being a fleet capable of raiding an enemy s home ports and intended to deter powerful warships from ranging too far from home twenty five short range second rate battleships would provide home defense in both atlantic and pacific and support faster and larger long range vessels with a range of roughly at 10 knots and a draft of they would roam from st lawrence river in north to windward islands and panama in south and would be able to enter all ports in southern united states it was proposed probably for cost reasons that short range battleships should have a hierarchy of three subclasses first would mount four guns each on eight ships second would mount four guns each on ten ships and third would mount two 12 inch and two guns each on five ships two battleships already under construction texas and maine were to be grouped under last class in addition 167 smaller ships including rams cruisers and torpedo boats would be built coming to a total cost of 281 55 million approximately equal to sum of entire us navy budget during previous 15 years adjusted for inflation 6 6 billion in 2009 dollars congress balked at plan seeing in it an end to united states policy of isolationism and beginning of imperialism even some supporters of naval expansion were wary senator eugene hale feared that because proposal was so large entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships however in april 1890 united states house of representatives approved funding for three 8 000 long ton battleships tracy trying to soothe tensions within congress remarked that these ships were so powerful only twelve would be necessary instead of 35 called for in original plan he also slashed operating costs of navy by giving remaining civil war era monitors which were utterly obsolete by this time to navy militias operated by states appropriation was also approved by senate and in total three coast defense battleships indiana class a cruiser and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 june 1890 first class of short range ships as envisioned by policy board were to mount 13 inch 35 caliber and new guns with of belt armor of deck armor and of armor over casemates indiana class as actually built exceeded design in displacement by 25 percent but most other aspects were relatively similar to original plan an belt and a secondary battery of and guns were adopted latter because bureau of ordnance did not have capability to construct rapid firing 5 inch weaponry larger weapons were much slower firing and much heavier but without bigger guns ships would not be able to penetrate armor of foreign battleships design thumb outboard profile of oregon with position and arc of fire of armament alt drawing schematic showing two large turrets before and aft and four smaller turrets on wing positions midships general characteristics indiana class ships were designed specifically for coastal defense and were not intended for offensive actions this design view was reflected in their moderate coal endurance relatively small displacement and low freeboard which limited seagoing capability however they were heavily armed and armored so much in fact that conway s all world s fighting ships describes them as attempting too much on a very limited displacement they resembled british battleship but were shorter and featured an intermediate battery consisting of eight 8 inch guns not found in european ships giving them a very respectable amount of firepower for their time original design of indiana class included bilge keels but with keels they would not fit in any of american drydocks at time so they were omitted during construction this meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for indiana when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned because turrets were not centrally balanced they swung from side to side with motion of ship until they were secured with heavy ropes when ship encountered more bad weather four months later she promptly steamed back to port for fear clamps would break again this convinced navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships armament given their limited displacement indiana class had formidable armament for time four 13 inch guns an intermediate battery of eight 8 inch guns and a secondary battery of four 6 inch guns twenty hotchkiss 6 pounders and six maxim nordenfelt 1 pounders as well as six 18 inch 450 mm tubes thumb left alt several men stand on deck next to a large turret with a smaller one visible in background forecastle of indiana showing its fore 13 inch turret and one of 8 inch turrets 13 inch gun was 35 calibers long and used black powder giving a range of about at 15 degrees of elevation at a shell was expected to penetrate of side armor four guns were mounted in two centerline turrets located fore and aft turrets were originally designed to feature sloping side armor but space requirements made this impossible without using significantly larger gun turrets or redesigning gun mounts which was later done for s ships low freeboard greatly hindered use of main battery in rough weather conditions because deck would become awash also because ship lacked a counterweight to offset weight of gun barrels ship would list in direction guns were aimed this reduced maximum arc of elevation and thus range to about five degrees brought main armor belt under water on that side and exposed unarmored bottom on other it was considered in 1901 to replace turrets with new balanced models used in later ships but that was decided to be too costly as ships were already obsolete instead counterweights were added which partially solved problem hydraulic and turning mechanisms of 8 inch turrets were also replaced by faster and more efficient electric equivalents new sights were fitted on indiana and massachusetts and new turret hoists were installed to improve reloading speed but gun mountings never performed in an entirely satisfactory manner eight 8 inch guns were mounted in pairs in four wing turrets placed on superstructure their arc of fire although big on paper was in reality limited adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if gun was trained alongside it a defect also suffered by 13 inch guns smaller 6 inch guns were mounted in twin wing casemates midships on main deck level with a 6 pounder in between other hotchkiss 6 pounders lined superstructure and bridge decks four of 1 pounders were placed in hull casemates at bow and stern of ship and two more in fighting tops of masts in 1908 all 6 inch and most of lighter guns were removed to compensate for counterweights added to main battery and because ammunition supply for guns was considered problematic a year later twelve 50 caliber single purpose guns were added midships and in fighting tops sources conflict on number of torpedo tubes originally included in ships but it is clear they were located on berth deck and had above water ports located on extreme front and aft and midships located too close to waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number and removed entirely before 1908 protection with exception of deck armor 8 inch turrets and conning tower which consisted of conventional nickel steel indiana class was protected with new harvey armor its main protection was a belt thick placed along two thirds of length of hull from above to under waterline beyond this point belt gradually grew thinner until it ended under waterline where belt was only thick below belt ship had no armor only a double bottom on both ends belt was connected to barbettes of main guns with armored bulkheads in waterline sections outside this central citadel compartments were filled with compressed cellulose intended to self seal when damaged between deck and main belt 5 inch hull armor was used deck armor was thick inside citadel and outside it hollow conning tower was a single forging 10 inches thick 13 inch gun battery had of vertical turret plating and barbettes while 8 inch cannons had only of vertical turret plating and barbettes casemates protecting 6 inch guns were thick and other casemates lighter guns shell hoists and turret crowns were all lightly armored thumb alt two dirty men feeding coal into an oven in a rather gloomy looking room fire room boiler room of massachusetts placement of belt armor was based on draft from design which was with a normal load of of coal on board her total coal storage capacity was and fully loaded her draft would increase to entirely submerging armor belt during actual service especially at war ships were kept fully loaded whenever possible rendering her belt armor almost useless that this was not considered in design outraged walker policy board convened in 1896 to evaluate existing american battleships and propose a design for new s and they set a standard that load of coal and ammunition that future ships were designed for had to be at least two thirds of maximum so similar problems would be prevented in new ships propulsion two vertical inverted triple expansion reciprocating steam engines powered by four double ended scotch boilers drove twin propellers while two single ended scotch boilers supplied steam for auxiliary machinery engines were designed to provide giving ships a

and rest of squadron bombarded it for two hours before realizing their mistake three weeks later news arrived that commodore schley s flying squadron had found cervera and was now blockading him in port of santiago de cuba sampson reinforced schley two days later and assumed overall command cervera saw that his situation was desperate and attempted to run blockade on 3july 1898 indiana did not join in chase of fast spanish cruisers because of her extreme eastern position on blockade and low speed caused by engine problems but was near harbor entrance when spanish destroyers pluton and furor emerged together with battleship and armed yacht she opened fire destroying lightly armored enemy ships after war indiana returned to training exercises before being decommissioned in 1903 battleship was recommissioned in january 1906 to function as a training vessel until she was decommissioned again in 1914 her third commission was in 1917 when indiana served as a training ship for gun crews during world war i she was decommissioned for final time on 31 january 1919 shortly after being reclassified coast battleship number 1 so that name indiana could be assigned to newly authorized but never completed battleship she was sunk in shallow water as a target in underwater explosion and aerial bombing tests in november 1920 her hulk was sold for scrap on 19 march 1924 massachusetts bb 2

spanish squadron and found it in port of santiago battleship was part of blockade fleet until 3july but missed battle of santiago de cuba because she had steamed to guantanamo bay night before to resupply coal next day battleship came back to santiago where she and texas fired at spanish cruiser reina mercedes which was being scuttled by spanish in a failed attempt to block harbor entrance channel during next seven years massachusetts cruised atlantic coast and eastern caribbean as a member of north atlantic squadron and then served for a year as a training ship for naval academy midshipmen until she was decommissioned in january 1906 in may 1910 she was placed in reduced commission as a training ship again before entering atlantic reserve fleet in september 1912 where she stayed until being decommissioned in may 1914 massachusetts was recommissioned in june 1917 to serve as a training ship for gun crews during world war i she was decommissioned for final time on 31 march 1919 after being redesignated coast battleship number 2 two days earlier so her name could be reused for on 6january 1921 she was scuttled off coast of pensacola and used as an artillery target for fort pickens navy attempted to sell her for scrap but no buyer could be found and in 1956 ship was declared property of state of florida wreck is currently one of florida underwater archaeological preserves and serves as an artificial reef oregon bb 3 oregon served for a short time with pacific station before being ordered on a voyage around south america to east coast in march 1898 in preparation for war with spain she departed from san francisco on 19 march and reached jupiter inlet on 24 may stopping several times for additional coal on way a journey of over 14 000 nautical miles was completed in 66 days which was considered a remarkable achievement at time dictionary of american naval fighting ships describes effect of journey on american public and government as follows on one hand feat had demonstrated many capabilities of a heavy battleship in all conditions of wind and sea on other it swept away all opposition for construction of panama canal for it was then made clear that country could not afford to take two months to send warships from one coast to other each time an emergency arose after completing her journey oregon was ordered to join blockade at santiago as part of north atlantic squadron under rear admiral sampson she took part in battle of santiago de cuba where she and cruiser were only ships fast enough to chase down spanish cruiser cristobal colon forcing its surrender around this time she received nickname bulldog of navy most likely because of her high bow wave known as having a bone in her teeth in nautical slang and perseverance during cruise around south america and battle of santiago thumb alt oregon seen from behind in drydock in drydock in 1898 showing her starboard bilge keel and pudgy underwater shape after war oregon was refitted in new york city before she was sent back to pacific where she served as a guard ship for two years she served for a year in philippines during philippine american war and then spent a year in china at wusong during boxer rebellion until may 1901 when she was ordered back to united states for an overhaul in march 1903 oregon returned to asiatic waters and ship remained in far east returning only shortly before decommissioning in april 1906 oregon was recommissioned in august 1911 but saw little activity and was officially placed on reserve status in 1914 on 2 january 1915 ship was returned to full commission and sailed to san francisco for panama pacific international exposition a year later she was back to reserve status only to be returned to full commission in april 1917 when united states joined world war i oregon acted as one of escorts for transport ships during siberian intervention in june 1919 she was decommissioned but a month later she was temporarily recommissioned as reviewing ship for president woodrow wilson during arrival of pacific fleet at seattle in october 1919 she was decommissioned for final time as a result of washington naval treaty oregon was declared incapable of further warlike service in january 1924 in june 1925 she was loaned to state of oregon who used her as a floating monument and museum in portland in february 1941 oregon was redesignated due to outbreak of world war ii it was decided that scrap value of ship was more important than her historical value so she was sold her stripped hulk was later returned to navy and used as an ammunition barge during battle of guam where she remained for several years during a typhoon in november 1948 she broke loose and drifted out to sea she was located southeast of guam and towed back she was sold on 15 march 1956 and scrapped in japan see also battleship illinois replica footnotes notes citations bibliography print references cited in dictionary of
