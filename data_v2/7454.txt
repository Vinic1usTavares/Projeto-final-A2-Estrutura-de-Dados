player character from cursed mask development soon after release of darkness over daggerford ossian studios previous game discussion began over possibility of company creating another expansion for neverwinter nights 2 ossian officially proposed game to atari and wizards of coast owners of dungeons dragons license in fall of 2006 with production beginning in january 2007 when asked about why dungeons dragons setting appealed to company ossian studios ceo alan miranda said all of our team members are dungeons and dragons fans so developing a neverwinter nights 2 game seemed like a great opportunity during game s early development stages it was set in forgotten realms nation of rashemen location was changed because obsidian studios neverwinter nights 2 mask of betrayer was to take place in same area at lead designer luke scull s suggestion westgate became new setting for game ossian wanted game s setting to differentiate itself from both neverwinter nights and baldur s gate series of games they found westgate situated in another area of forgotten realms setting to be ideal miranda compared westgate to a city sized version of star wars s mos eisley cantina a melting pot of creatures from everywhere in setting ossian said they decided to make mysteries of westgate exclusively single player in order to improve game experience david john who had also worked on expansion packs for original neverwinter nights composed score for mysteries of westgate which took several months in an interview soon after game s release scull said some of game s tracks are so good i actually listen to them alongside my usual eclectic mix mysteries of westgate s voice acting was recorded in edmonton alberta canada with over 12 000 words of new voice over material cast included some of same people who previously acted in neverwinter nights hordes of underdark and other bioware games brian dunn and brian watson both of whom had also worked on darkness over daggerford created game s artwork and graphics development of mysteries of westgate ended in september 2007 but atari delayed pack s release because digital rights management they wanted to use was not ready delay was also caused by coordination problems between ossian obsidian and atari game was officially announced on october 22 2007 with an estimated release date of fall 2007 in may 2008 ign reported that game was scheduled for release that june but it was further delayed finally being released on april 29 2009 development of mysteries of westgate continued during delays to ensure game s compatibility with expansions and patches for neverwinter nights 2 that were released after game s completion scull said kevin smith our lead technical designer had to bug fix and create new builds of game with each patch and expansion when ign s steve butts asked miranda why game was made available only through download he replied from a financial perspective digital distribution makes a lot of sense it allows us to sell adventure pack at a lower price point while still providing players with same high quality gameplay and content that they ve come to expect from nwn2 products some of game s voice overs monsters music and objects were released to neverwinter nights 2 community for free for use in building custom adventures without needing to purchase game itself reception reviews of mysteries of westgate were mixed 1up com s jason wilson said that game s plot is an intriguing tale and even after finishing game a number of encounters and plot points ring in my head but story s poor stitching distracts from its arc i felt like a great hand was pushing me through plot and tale felt a bit muddled toward end brett todd of gamespot called plot rough around edges while gamezone reviewer michael lafferty said game may have a disjointed storyline but there are moments where humor shines through and game does take a few interesting plot twists and exploration of city zones underground areas where trolls abound hold that sense of joyful discovery that make an rpg worth playing numerous reviewers mentioned that impact of mask which drives story is minimal having little effect on actual gameplay lafferty said side quests were not necessarily optional as they were often a source of additional gold and a certain point in game s plot required a substantial sum of it to proceed gamesradar s rich mccormick praised game s storyline and main quest as some of its best points in a review for gamestar christian schmidt thought that game s appearance and humor were poor but recommended it because of its strong storyline todd found pack s difficulty to be wildly careening and stated some battles are amazingly easy you can soar through many scraps in moments with your party carving up opposition before you can tell if you re fighting a mummy or a zombie however others are absolutely brutal there are more than a couple of moments in game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response he praised game s music as blending in seamlessly with that of original game but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text steve butts commented on this saying dialogue here really needs some work you ll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences wait till you see how deep into backside of evil i insert my boot in name of justice is probably my favorite it s too bad there s not more voice acting in game because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given developers an opportunity to edit some of worst offenders as a result of mysteries of westgate s 2007 completion and 2009 release it did not feature improvements present in two previous neverwinter nights 2 expansion packs and received criticism because of this todd stated that game lacks artistic improvements of mask of betrayer and storm of zehir a sentiment echoed by lafferty s review however butts stated that westgate delivers enough engaging content that absence of all latest improvements isn t too agonizing
