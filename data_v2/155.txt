damaged his front wing in process and returned to track in fourth hill returned to pits to let his pit crew replace damaged wing he rejoined fifth but was then given a ten second stop and go penalty for speeding in pitlane coulthard made same mistake as his teammate by running through gravel trap at spoon curve but looked like he was going to escape with only minor damage however as he braked for 130r next corner gravel which had entered his sidepods flew out causing him to lose control and get his car stuck in gravel trap hill was told by his team on radio to speed up as he had not yet taken

formula one s governing body federation internationale de l automobile fia in an interview with motor sport magazine in 2008 hill said that 1995 season as a whole went down mentally and it all just got to me he also said he believed that it was in 1995 that frank williams and patrick head decided to replace him for 1997 season 1980 formula one world champion alan jones praised alesi s performance saying that it will go down as one of great drives in grand prix racing alesi stated that if his driveshaft had not failed he would have fought for it all way to end alesi added that he believed he did not jump start but admitted that car crept forwards by a few centimetres because of downhill slope of grid in an interview with autosport magazine in 2009 alesi said that he went to see race director before race to see how he could avoid a penalty at downhill start and that he was totally fed up with penalty decision given berger also questioned his penalty claiming that his car
