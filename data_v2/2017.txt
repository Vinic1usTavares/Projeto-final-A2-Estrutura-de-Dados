first shown as a technical and thematic demonstration video at nintendo s shoshinkai trade show in december 1995 ocarina of time was developed concurrently with super mario 64 by nintendo s entertainment analysis development ead division nintendo planned to release super mario 64 as a launch game for nintendo 64 n64 and later release ocarina of time for 64dd a disk drive peripheral for system which was still in development nintendo eventually migrated development of ocarina of time from disk to cartridge media due to high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion captured character animations throughout gameplay they planned to follow its release with a 64dd expansion disk 32 megabyte game was largest game nintendo had created at time early in development team had concerns about data storage constraints of n64 cartridge in worst case scenario ocarina of time would follow a similar structure to super mario 64 with link restricted to ganondorf s castle as a central hub using a portal system similar to paintings that mario uses to traverse realm an idea that arose from this stage of development a battle with a doppelganger of ganondorf that rides through paintings was used as boss of forest temple dungeon while shigeru miyamoto had been principal director of super mario 64 he was now in charge of several directors as a producer and supervisor of ocarina of time different parts were handled by different directors a new strategy for nintendo ead four or five initial teams grew over time each working on different basic experiments including scenario and planning link s actions transforming classic 2d items into improved 3d form camera experiments motion capture sound special effects and flow of time thumb developers were inspired by chanbara sword technique as seen in this photo although development team was new to 3d games assistant director makoto miyanaga recalled a passion for creating something new and unprecedented miyamoto intended game a medieval tale of sword and sorcery to be in chanbara genre of japanese sword fighting development involved more than 120 people including stunt performers used to capture effects of sword fighting and link s movement miyamoto initially intended ocarina of time to be played in a first person perspective to enable players to take in vast terrain of hyrule field better and let team focus more on developing enemies and environments concept was abandoned once idea of a child link was introduced and miyamoto believed it necessary for link to be visible on screen originally z targeting involved a generic marker however koizumi changed design to that of a fairy to make it less robotic fairy gained name of fairy navigation system amongst staff and ultimately this turned into nickname navi which in turn resulted in birth of navi s character birth of navi was a pivotal point in story s development some of miyamoto s ideas were instead used in super mario 64 since it was to be released first other ideas were not used due to time constraints ocarina of time originally ran on same engine as super mario 64 but was so heavily modified that miyamoto considers final products different engines one major difference between two is camera control player has a lot of control over camera in super mario 64 but camera in ocarina of time is largely controlled by game ai miyamoto said camera controls for ocarina of time are intended to reflect a focus on game s world whereas those of super mario 64 are centered on character of mario miyamoto wanted to make a game that was cinematic yet distinguished from films takumi kawagoe who creates cutscenes for nintendo said that his priority was to have player feel in control of action to promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay cutscenes in ocarina of time are completely generated with real time computing on nintendo 64 and do not use prerendered full motion video miyamoto s vision required this real time architecture for total of more than 90 minutes of cutscenes regardless of whether console had a vast medium like cd rom on which to store prerendered versions toru created scenario for game based on a story idea by miyamoto and yoshiaki koizumi he was supported by a link to past and link s awakening script writer kensuke tanabe miyamoto said real time rendering engine allowed his small team of 3 to 7 cinematic developers to rapidly adjust storyline and to focus on developing additional gameplay elements even up to final few months of development instead of waiting on a repeated process dungeons were designed by eiji aonuma throughout late 1990s nintendo 64 was said to lack hit first party games next generation wrote that nintendo absolutely can t afford another holiday season without a real marquee title and that zelda was one of most anticipated games of decade upon which nintendo 64 s fate depended in march 1998 ocarina of time was most anticipated nintendo 64 game in japan chairman howard lincoln insisted at e3 1998 that zelda ship on time and become nintendo s reinvigorating blockbuster akin to a hit hollywood movie customers in north america who pre ordered ocarina of time received a limited edition box with a golden plastic card reading collector s edition this edition contained a gold colored cartridge a tradition that began with original legend of zelda 1986 for nintendo entertainment system demand was so great that electronics boutique stopped pre selling game on november 3 1998 several versions of ocarina of time were produced with later revisions featuring minor changes such as glitch repairs recoloring of ganondorf s blood from crimson to green and alteration of music heard in fire temple dungeon to remove a sample of an islamic prayer chant sample was taken from a commercially available sound library but developers did not realize it contained islamic references although popularly believed to have been changed due to public outcry chanting was removed after nintendo discovered it violated policy of avoiding religious material and altered versions of ocarina of time were made prior to original release music ocarina of times music was written by koji kondo composer in charge of music for most of games in legend of zelda series in addition to characters having musical themes areas of hyrule are also associated with pieces of music this has been called leitmotif in reverse instead of music announcing an entering character it now introduces a stationary environment as player approaches in some locations music is a variation of an ocarina tune player learns related to that area beyond providing a backdrop for setting music plays an integral role in gameplay button layout of nintendo 64 controller resembles holes of in game and players must learn to play several songs to complete game all songs are played using five notes available on an ocarina although by bending pitches via analog stick players can play additional tones kondo said that creating distinct themes on limited scale was a major challenge but feels that end result is very natural popularity of ocarina of time led to an increase in ocarina sales official soundtrack of ocarina of time was published by pony canyon and released in japan on december 18 1998 it comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks a u s version was also released although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork many critics praised music in ocarina of time although ign was disappointed that traditional zelda overworld theme was not included in 2001 three years after initial release of ocarina of time gamespot labeled it as one of top ten video game soundtracks soundtrack at time was not released in europe or australia in 2011 however a 51 track limited edition soundtrack for 3ds version was available in a free mail out through a club nintendo offer to owners of 3ds edition as an incentive to register product original musical theme for fire temple area was altered before release of game due to nintendo s policy of not including real religious references in their products with altered theme simply removing chanting samples hero of time an orchestral recording of ocarina of times score performed by slovak national symphony orchestra was released by video game label materia collective in 2017 a vinyl version was published by iam8bit it was nominated for best game music cover remix at 16th annual game audio network guild awards rereleases nintendo ported ocarina of time to its next console gamecube as part of

working title ura zelda commonly translated as another zelda described as a second version of ocarina with rearranged dungeons it contains new content some that had been cut from ocarina due to time and storage constraints in 1998 ura zelda was delayed indefinitely following problems with development of 64dd and was canceled due to 64dd s commercial failure in august 2000 miyamoto stated that ura zelda had been finished and that no online functions had ever been planned ura zelda was ported to gamecube in 2002 in japan as and in 2003 in north america and europe as legend of zelda ocarina of time master quest according to miyamoto ura zelda was simple to port as it used few of 64dd features master quest uses same engine and plot of ocarina of time but with increased difficulty and altered dungeons and puzzles ign s peer schneider gave master quest a mostly positive review likening concept to second quest of original legend of zelda he felt that some redesigned areas were poorer than original ocarina of time and speculated that they may have been constructed from second choice designs created during development he described port as graphically improved but contained no substantial improvement to frame rate he also expressed controls translated to gamecube controller felt clumsy nonetheless he summarized master quest as a sweet surprise for any zelda fan and wrote that he would have recommended it even at full price zachary lewis of rpg gamer praised revised puzzles which require precise timing and find new uses for ocarina items but wrote that players would be enthralled or frustrated by increased difficulty reception ocarina of time was released to universal acclaim and strong commercial success worldwide in united states over 500 000 preorders were placed more than

64 as two games that blazed trails into 3d era context sensitive control system was seen as one of strongest elements of gameplay reviewers noted that it allowed for simpler control using fewer buttons but that it occasionally caused player to perform unintended actions camera control was quoted as making combat second nature although new system took time for player to get used to game s
