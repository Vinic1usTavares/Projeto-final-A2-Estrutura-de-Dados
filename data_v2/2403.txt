typhoon bess known in philippines as typhoon susang was responsible for disappearance of a united states air force weather reconnaissance aircraft developing out of a poorly organized system on october 8 to east of philippines bess featured two centers of circulation initially southern low was monitored however a low to north soon became dominant center tracking generally west northwestward storm gradually intensified before striking northern luzon as a minimal typhoon on october 11 temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land after moving back over water following morning bess regained typhoon intensity this was short lived though as conditions surrounding cyclone soon caused it to weaken now moving due west weakening storm eventually struck hainan island as a tropical storm on october 12 before diminishing to a tropical depression depression briefly moved back over water before dissipating in northern vietnam on october 14 bess produced heavy rains throughout philippines especially in luzon where was measured in baguio these rains triggered extensive flooding and landslides that killed 26 people and left 3 others missing many homes were destroyed and damage amounted to 9 2 million 1974 usd on october 12 a reconnaissance plane with a crew of six investigating periphery of storm went missing it is presumed that entire crew was lost when aircraft crashed off coast of luzon though center remained offshore strong winds and high tides also impacted hong kong causing minor flooding meteorological history on october 6 1974 joint typhoon warning center jtwc began monitoring a tropical disturbance several hundred miles southeast of guam tracking quickly westward to west northwestward in response to a strong subtropical ridge to north system gradually organized passing near ulithi atoll on october 7 accompanied by a broad monsoonal flow disturbance featured multiple centers of circulation on october 8 it developed into a tropical depression and soon into a tropical storm at which time it was assigned name bess early on october 9 an aircraft reconnaissance mission into bess revealed that a new dominant center of circulation had developed to north of original low southern low soon dissipated as northern one became a tropical storm northern system retained name bess and is considered same storm by jtwc after northern circulation became dominant center on october 9 a deepening trough in westerlies caused a decrease in synoptic pressures resulting in bess forward motion greatly decreasing maintaining a west northwesterly track strong outflow developed especially to southwest of circulation storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on october 10 as it approached northern philippines due to cyclone s proximity to country philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration also monitored storm and assigned it with local name susang later that day bess made landfall in northern luzon roughly 95 km 60 mi south of point with winds estimated at 120 km h 75 mph though classified a minimal typhoon by jtwc hong kong royal observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140 km h 85 mph before system moved ashore inland a barometric pressure of 976 9 mbar hpa 28 85 inhg was recorded in tuguegarao as typhoon passed 55 km 35 mi to north due to interaction with high terrain of northern luzon bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over south china sea during afternoon of october 11 as storm emerged back over water satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485 km 300 mi in diameter upon reintensifying bess turned due west in response to a dominating high pressure area over southern china with a large difference in pressures between two systems a strong northeasterly flow developed between them this resulted in gale force winds occurring up to 400 km 250 mi from bess s center during evening of october 12 combined effects of a winter monsoon and entrainment of cool dry air from mainland china began to weaken system by following morning bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305 km 190 mi south of hong kong system later struck hainan island with winds of 85 km h 50 mph before lessening to a tropical depression dissipating system emerged over gulf of tonkin on october 14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern vietnam later that day impact thumb right a wc 130h hercules similar to one that crashed over south china sea striking northern luzon as a typhoon bess produced damaging winds and torrential rainfall across region gusts peaked at 178 km h 111 mph in cagayan while baguio city experienced gusts of 150 km h 90 mph communication across region was greatly disrupted as numerous power lines and trees were downed while much of peninsula received of rain a 24 hour maxima of was reported in baguio rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides resulting in 26 fatalities and extensive damage one death took place in baguio after a girl was buried in a landslide at least three other people were reported missing in a town roughly 805 km 500 mi south of manila a landslide destroyed eight homes and a school flood waters inundated four villages in central philippines storm affected a total of 35 562 people of which about 4 000 became homeless total losses amounted to 9 2 million 1974 usd on october 11 a level one warning signal was raised for hong kong indicating that a tropical cyclone was approaching region this was soon raised to level three as strong winds were expected to affect area although center of bess passed roughly 305 km 190 mi south of hong kong pressure gradient between tropical storm and high pressure to north resulted in strong winds across region on pratas islands ten minute sustained winds of 95 km h 60 mph were reported in hong kong itself winds reached 45 km h 30 mph and gusted to 85 km h 50 mph gusts up to 113 km h 71 mph occurred on tate s cairn in contrast to unusually strong winds bess produced virtually no rainfall as it passed by with only a trace of precipitation measured between october 11 and 14 in hong kong along coast abnormally high tides combined with storm surge flooded low lying areas of city tides at tai po kau reached with a surge of sea water leaked into city s underground sewage system and caused minor flooding in area s western district some property damage was reported while over south china sea on october 12 a united states air force wc 130h hercules reconnaissance aircraft call sign swan 38 with a crew of six went missing while collecting data on cyclone plane took off from clark air base during night on october 12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95 km 60 mi north of manila a rescue team of five air force aircraft and uss white plains was dispatched to look for survivors search and rescue missions for crew only found pieces of debris such as an aircraft survival radio soundproofing material and orange cushion like material all six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead following incident 53d weather reconnaissance squadron established swan 38 memorial scholarship for outstanding students in wing because of damage and loss of life caused by storm name bess was retired and replaced with bonnie however when list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979 name was re introduced to roster coincidentally it was again retired in 1982 when a powerful storm named bess caused extensive damage and loss of life in japan this marked only occasion where a single name was removed twice in same basin see also 1974 pacific typhoon season typhoons
