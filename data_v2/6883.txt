zecca di durante il dominio dei genovesi torino 1865 p 19 or zaccaria he may accordingly have been either a grandson or a nephew to benedetto i zaccaria lord of chios and of phocaea on anatolian coast benedetto i had captured chios from byzantine empire in 1304 citing island s vulnerability to turkish raids his occupation was acknowledged by impotent byzantine emperor andronikos ii palaiologos

island passed to martino and his brother benedetto ii chios was a small but wealthy domain with an annual income of 120 000 gold hyperpyra over next few years martino made it core of a small realm encompassing several islands off shore of asia minor including samos and kos as lord of chios martino and benedetto fought with distinction against turkish pirates who made their appearance in aegean in early years of 14th century in 1304 capture of ephesus by emirate of had sparked genoese occupation of chios and raids against aegean islands intensified over next years emirate of aydin soon emerged as chief turkish maritime emirate especially under leadership of umur bey while zaccaria along with knights hospitaller of rhodes became two main latin antagonists of turkish pirates zaccaria are reported to have maintained a thousand infantry a hundred horsemen and a couple of galleys on constant alert in 1317 they lost citadel of smyrna on anatolian coast to but continued to hold on to lower city until 1329 when umur bey captured it in 1319 however martino zaccaria participated with seven ships in a hospitaller fleet that scored a crushing victory over an aydinid fleet from ephesus by end of his rule on chios martino is said to have taken captive or slain more than 10 000 turks and received an annual tribute in order not to attack them his constant efforts against turkish pirates earned him great praise by contemporary latin writers who wrote that if not for his vigilance neither man nor woman nor dog nor cat nor any live animal could have remained in any of neighbouring islands martino also intervened to stop slave trade carried out by genoese of alexandria for which he was praised by pope john xxii in exchange pope granted him right to export to egypt an exemption to papal ban on trade with mamluks of egypt and proposed that zaccaria be given command of latin fleets in aegean martino s prestige rose further when he also became one of most important feudatories in principality of achaea shortly after 1316 he bought rights to barony of chalandritsa from of rans although in a document of 1324 it appears that he possessed only half of it other being held by peter dalle martino added to his domains when he married jacqueline de la roche related to de la roche dukes of athens and heiress of barony of veligosti damala martino s elevated standing was now recognized by philip ii titular latin emperor of constantinople who in 1325 named him king and despot of asia minor and gave him as fiefs islands of chios samos kos and lesbos which formed part of latin emperors personal domain by treaty of viterbo as well as tenedos and marmara island this award was mostly symbolic as except for first three which zaccaria already controlled others were in hands of byzantines or turks in exchange martino promised to aid with 500 horsemen in philip s hoped for but never to be realized expedition to recover constantinople from byzantines byzantine recovery of chios thumb right 200px map of aegean sea if these ties to latin emperor provoked displeasure at byzantine court for time being relations remained good lease of chios was renewed in 1324 and in 1327 martino took part in alliance negotiations between byzantines and republic of venice at same time however martino s behaviour became increasingly assertive he ousted his brother as co ruler of chios and began minting coins in his own name in 1328 rise of a new and energetic emperor andronikos iii palaiologos to byzantine throne marked a turning point in relations one of leading chian nobles leo kalothetos went to meet new emperor and his chief minister john kantakouzenos to propose a reconquest of island andronikos iii readily agreed on pretext of martino s unauthorized building of a new fortress on island emperor sent him a letter in which he ordered him to cease construction and to present himself in constantinople in next year in order to renew island s lease martino haughtily rejected demands and accelerated construction but now his deposed brother benedetto lodged a complaint with emperor claiming one half share of island s revenues that was his due with these events as an excuse in autumn 1329 andronikos iii assembled a fleet of 105 vessels including forces of latin duke of naxos nicholas i sanudo and sailed to chios even after imperial fleet reached island andronikos iii offered to let martino keep his possessions in exchange for installation of a byzantine garrison and payment of an annual tribute but martino refused he sank his three galleys in harbour forbade greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel where he raised his own banner instead of emperor s his will to resist was broken however when benedetto surrendered his own fort to byzantines and when he saw locals welcoming them he was soon forced to surrender emperor spared his life even though chians demanded his execution and took him prisoner to constantinople martino s wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth while most of zaccaria adherents chose to stay on island as imperial officials benedetto was offered island s governorship but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession in same way as his brother had held it a concession emperor was unwilling to grant benedetto retired to genoese colony of galata from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim chios he died soon after andronikos iii appointed kalothetos as new governor of chios and followed up his success by sailing to phocaea forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty later life and smyrniote crusade martino was released in 1337 at intercession of pope and philip vi of france and was offered a military command and some castles by emperor as compensation he then returned to his hometown genoa and was named city s ambassador to holy see in september 1343 he was appointed to command four papal galleys in crusade against umur bey under overall command of titular latin patriarch of constantinople henry of asti in view of zaccaria s character pope expressly warned henry of asti not to allow him to divert crusade in a bid to recover chios and authorized henry to replace zaccaria if he deemed it necessary crusade scored a swift and unexpected success umur bey was caught off guard and crusaders recaptured lower town of smyrna on 28 october 1344 citadel remained in turkish hands however and crusaders position remained precarious with venetian aid they fortified lower town to enable them to resist umur s counterattack emir bombarded lower town with mangonels but crusaders managed to sortie and destroy them effectively breaking siege to celebrate this feat henry of asti decided against advice of other crusader leaders to hold mass in city s former cathedral which lay in no man s land between citadel and crusader held lower town turks attacked during service on 17 january
