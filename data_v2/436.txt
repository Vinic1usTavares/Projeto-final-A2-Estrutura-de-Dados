thumb right august 1956 issue of science fiction quarterly cover art by ed emshwiller science fiction quarterly was an american pulp science fiction magazine that was published from 1940 to 1943 and again from 1951 to 1958 charles hornig served as editor for first two issues robert a w lowndes edited remainder science fiction quarterly was launched by publisher louis silberkleit during a boom in science fiction magazines at end of 1930s silberkleit launched two other science fiction titles science fiction and future fiction at about same time all three ceased publication before end of world war ii falling prey to slow sales and paper shortages in 1950 and 1951 as market improved silberkleit relaunched future fiction and science fiction quarterly by time science fiction quarterly ceased publication in 1958 it was last surviving science fiction pulp magazine all other survivors having changed to different formats science fiction policy was to reprint a novel in each issue as lead story and silberkleit was able to obtain reprint rights to two early science fiction novels and several of ray cummings books both hornig and lowndes were given minuscule budgets and hornig in particular had trouble finding good material to print lowndes did somewhat better as he was able to call on his friends in futurians a group of aspiring writers that included isaac asimov james blish and donald wollheim second incarnation of magazine also had a policy of running a lead novel though in practice lead stories were often well short of novel length among better known stories published by magazine were second dawn by arthur c clarke last question by isaac asimov and common time by james blish publishing history left thumb first issue dated summer 1940 cover art by jack binder although science fiction sf had been published before 1920s it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until appearance in 1926 of amazing stories a pulp magazine published by hugo gernsback by end of 1930s field was booming edwards nicholls 1993 pp 1066 1068 louis silberkleit a publisher who had once worked for gernsback launched a pulp magazine in march 1939 titled science fiction under his blue ribbon magazines imprint ashley thompson 1985 pp 518 519 for an editor gernsback recommended charles hornig who had edited wonder stories for gernsback from 1933 to 1936 silberkleit took recommendation and hornig was hired in october 1938 ashley 2000 p 260 davin 1999 p 102 davin 1999 pp 111 112 hornig had no office he worked from home coming into office as needed to drop off manuscripts and dummy materials and pick up typeset materials to proof he was given broad freedom to select what he wanted to publish since silberkleit s chief editor abner j knew little about sf and did not get involved in running magazine davin 1999 p 121 to spread his costs over more magazines silberkleit soon decided to launch two additional titles ashley 2000 pp 147 149 in november 1939 first issue of future fiction appeared it was followed in july 1940 by science fiction quarterly hornig was editor for all three of magazines in october 1940 hornig who was a pacifist received his military call up he decided to move to california and register as a conscientious objector he continued to edit magazines from west coast but silberkleit was unhappy with arrangement silberkleit allowed hornig to retain his post as editor of science fiction and offered editorship of other two titles to sam moskowitz ashley thompson 1985 p 512 moskowitz declined saying afterwards that he would never strike at a man s job knight 1977 p 64 but donald wollheim a member of a group of aspiring writers called futurians heard about offer wollheim told robert w lowndes another member of futurians about opening and urged him to write to silberkleit lowndes later recalled wollheim s idea in letter i d suggest that it might be a good idea to add a science fiction title to list offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than hornig was being paid and also find fault with all other sf titles presently out but particularly with hornig s ashley 1985a p 278 lowndes relates that silberkleit took bait and hired him in november 1940 hornig recalls separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to california lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be real reason silberkleit replaced hornig davin 1999 pp 122 123 davin 1999 p 115 first issues lowndes was responsible for were spring 1941 issue of science fiction quarterly and april 1941 issue of future fiction ashley 1985a p 284 initially silberkleit kept tighter control on lowndes editorial selections than he had over hornig vetoing five of seven stories lowndes proposed for april 1941 future but by august 1941 issue lowndes later recalled silberkleit was satisfied that i knew what i was doing and didn t need to oversee any story i had accepted davin 1999 p 119 in 1950 silberkleit revived future fiction and following year he brought back science fiction quarterly with first issue of new series dated may 1951 ashley 2005 pp 41 42 a new magazine dynamic science fiction followed in 1952 ashley 2005 p 44 all three were edited by lowndes and all were in pulp format sales were satisfactory but silberkleit decided to experiment with digest format which was starting to become more popular by end of 1955 he had cancelled dynamic science fiction switched future fiction to digest format and relaunched science fiction as a digest under a new title science fiction stories only science fiction quarterly was left in pulp format silberkleit felt that a quarterly digest would not be as successful as a quarterly pulp ashley 2005 p 60 pulps were dying off and when other worlds switched to digest format in 1956 science fiction quarterly became only remaining sf magazine still being published as a pulp ashley 2005 p 73 in 1957 american news company one of biggest magazine distributors was liquidated and resulting changes in national magazine distribution network along with poor sales finally killed science fiction quarterly ashley 1976 p 54 ashley 1985b p 548 ashley 2005 p 190 last issue was dated february 1958 ashley 1985b pp 549 550 contents and reception thumb upright august 1955 issue cover art by ed emshwiller silberkleit s magazines were given very limited budgets hornig worked with julius schwartz a literary agent who was a friend of his this gave him access to stories by writers schwartz represented but schwartz would not allow his authors real names to be used unless they were paid at least one cent per word hornig could not afford to pay one cent rate for everything he bought so he paid half a cent a word for much of what he acquired through schwartz and ran those stories under pseudonyms unsurprisingly given low rates stories sent to hornig had usually already been rejected by better paying markets result was mediocre fiction even from better known writers that hornig was able to attract ashley 2000 pp 147 148 magazines paid on publication rather than acceptance and this slower payment also discouraged some authors from submitting material del rey 1979 p 123 science fiction quarterly was intended by silberkleit to include a full length novel in each issue silberkleit obtained permission from hugo gernsback to reprint two novels from science wonder quarterly moon conquerors by r h romans and shot into infinity by otto willi gail although these stories were somewhat dated they were better quality than fiction hornig was able to obtain for his other magazines ashley 2000 p 148 when lowndes took over policy of including a novel in every issue continued and silberkleit again obtained reprint rights to fill some of these slots this time with ray cummings five of whose novels would appear in science fiction quarterly over next two years starting with conqueror in summer 1941 issue ashley 1985b pp 546 547 lowndes bought many stories from futurians to fill remaining space in magazine these were of variable quality but overall science fiction quarterly improved once lowndes took control and fiction was as good as or better than stories to be found in many of contemporary magazines when magazine was revived stated policy was still to publish lead novels and fill remaining space with short stories but in fact with few exceptions lead fiction was not of novel length there were no more reprints as there had been for first series lowndes was unable to pay his writers rates that were competitive with magazines that were leading field but he was an able editor and produced a magazine of reasonable quality every quarter futurians still occasionally appeared in science fiction quarterly but lowndes also attracted some of newer writers such as poul anderson william tenn and arthur c clarke clarke s second dawn which appeared in august 1951 issue is among better stories lowndes was able to obtain he also published isaac asimov s last question in november 1956 issue and james blish s common time in august 1953 lowndes was also able to acquire some good quality nonfiction for magazine including a series of articles by james blish on science in sf and articles on science fiction by thomas d clareson and l sprague de camp blish writing as william atheling jr commented in 1953 that lowndes was doing a surprisingly good job with all of silberkleit s science fiction magazines despite low rates and slow payment to authors atheling 1967 p 47 bibliographic details winter spring
