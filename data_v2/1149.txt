form similar in sound to their 2001 debut album jason heller of a v club awarded album an a heller felt that oddfellows featured tighter songs and sturdier structures than band s previous work which

finding that dunn s bass playing improves band s sound without altering it radically comaratta felt that album rewarded patient listeners but did not provide memorable hooks or melodies and compared its laid back sound to that of nick cave and bad seeds cole waterman of popmatters awarded album a score of eight out of ten finding record to be group s most accessible by far waterman described album s composition as catchy finding it to be an appropriate response to band s previous album anonymous he also highlighted absurdist tone of record s lyrics pointing out south paw and waratorium as particular examples of this pitchfork media s paul thompson scored oddfellows 6 8 out of ten considering it tomahawk s most straightforward stripped down release to date thompson considered group s main dynamic to consist of denison s compositions and patton s vocals finding that bass player dunn hangs back here ably holding down low end without himself thompson also debated effect that album s short germination period had on its overall composition believing that brief recording time lent record a feeling that whenever you get these guys in same room this music just comes tearing out track
