raccoon or procyon lotor sometimes spelled racoon also known as common raccoon north american raccoon northern raccoon or coon is a medium sized mammal native to north america raccoon is largest of procyonid family having a body length of and a body weight of its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather three of raccoon s most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws its facial mask and its ringed tail which are themes in mythologies of indigenous peoples of americas raccoons are noted for their intelligence with studies showing that they are able to remember solution to tasks for at least three years they are usually nocturnal and omnivorous eating about 40 invertebrates 33 plants and 27 vertebrates original habitats of raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas coastal marshes and urban areas where some homeowners consider them to be pests as a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in mid 20th century raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland europe caucasus and japan though previously thought to be generally solitary there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender specific social behavior related females often share a common area while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during mating season and other potential invaders home range sizes vary anywhere from for females in cities to for males in prairies after a gestation period of about 65 days two to five young known as kits are born in spring kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years their life expectancy in wild is only 1 8 to 3 1 years in many areas hunting and vehicular injury are two most common causes of death etymology thumb mask of a raccoon is often interrupted by a brown black streak that extends from forehead to nose word raccoon was adopted into english from native powhatan term as used in colony of virginia it was recorded on john smith s list of powhatan words as and on that of william strachey as other attested colonial spellings of powhatan word include and it has also been identified as a reflex of a proto algonquian root koon em meaning one who rubs scrubs and scratches with its hands similarly spanish colonists adopted spanish word from nahuatl of aztecs meaning one who takes everything in its hands in many languages raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language s term for bear for example wash bear in german huan xiong wan xiong wash bear in chinese washing bear in hebrew little washer bear in italian and washing bear in japanese alternatively only washing behavior might be referred to as in russian colloquial abbreviation coon is used in words like coonskin for fur clothing and in phrases like old coon as a self designation of trappers in 1830s united states whig party used raccoon as an emblem causing them to be pejoratively known as coons by their political opponents who saw them as too sympathetic to african americans soon after that term became an ethnic slur especially in use between 1880 and 1920 see coon song and term is still considered offensive taxonomy in first decades after its discovery by members of expedition of christopher columbus who were first europeans to leave a written record about species taxonomists thought raccoon was related to many different species including dogs cats badgers and particularly bears carl linnaeus father of modern taxonomy placed raccoon in genus ursus first as ursus cauda elongata long tailed bear in second edition of his systema naturae 1740 then as ursus lotor washer bear in tenth edition 1758 59 in 1780 gottlieb conrad christian storr placed raccoon in its own genus procyon which can be translated as either before dog or doglike it is also possible that storr had its nocturnal lifestyle in mind and chose star procyon as eponym for species evolution based on fossil evidence from russia and bulgaria first known members of family procyonidae lived in europe in late oligocene about 25 million years ago similar tooth and skull structures suggest procyonids and weasels share a common ancestor but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between raccoons and bears after then existing species crossed bering strait at least six million years later in early miocene center of its distribution was probably in central america coatis nasua and and raccoons procyon have been considered to share common descent from a species in genus present between 5 2 and 6 0 million years ago this assumption based on morphological comparisons of fossils conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to ringtails unlike other procyonids such as crab eating raccoon procyon cancrivorus ancestors of common raccoon left tropical and subtropical areas and migrated farther north about 2 5 million years ago in a migration that has been confirmed by discovery of fossils in great plains dating back to middle of pliocene its most recent ancestor was likely procyon a large blancan raccoon from formation characterized by its

of an adult raccoon varies considerably with habitat making raccoon one of most variably sized mammals it can range from but is usually between smallest specimens live in southern florida while those near northern limits of raccoon s range tend to be largest see bergmann s rule males are usually 15 to 20 heavier than females at beginning of winter a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of fat storage largest recorded wild raccoon weighed and measured in total length by far largest size recorded for a procyonid most characteristic physical feature of raccoon is area of black fur around eyes which contrasts sharply with surrounding white face coloring this is reminiscent of a bandit s mask and has thus enhanced animal s reputation for mischief slightly rounded ears are also bordered by white fur raccoons are assumed to recognize facial expression and posture of other members of their species more quickly because of conspicuous facial coloration and alternating light and dark rings on tail dark mask may also reduce glare and thus enhance night vision on other parts of body long and stiff guard hairs which shed moisture are usually colored in shades of gray and to a lesser extent brown raccoons with a very dark coat are more common in german population because individuals with such coloring were among those initially released to wild dense underfur which accounts for almost 90 of coat insulates against cold weather and is composed of long hairs raccoon whose method of locomotion is usually considered to be plantigrade can stand on its hind legs to examine objects with its front paws as raccoons have short legs compared to their compact torso they are usually not able either to run quickly or jump great distances their top speed over short distances is raccoons can swim with an average speed of about and can stay in water for several hours for climbing down a tree headfirst an unusual ability for a mammal of its size a raccoon rotates its hind feet so they are pointing backwards raccoons have a dual cooling system to regulate their temperature that is they are able to both sweat and pant for heat dissipation raccoon skulls have a short and wide facial region and a voluminous braincase facial length of skull is less than cranial and their nasal bones are short and quite broad auditory bullae are inflated in form and sagittal crest is weakly developed dentition 40 teeth with dental formula is adapted to their omnivorous diet carnassials are not as sharp and pointed as those of a full time carnivore but molars are not as wide as those of a herbivore penis bone of males is about long and strongly bent at front end and its shape can be used to distinguish juvenile males from mature males seven of thirteen identified vocal calls are used in communication between mother and her kits one of these being birdlike twittering of newborns senses most important sense for raccoon is its sense of touch hyper sensitive front paws are protected by a thin horny layer that becomes pliable when wet five digits of paws have no webbing between them which is unusual for a carnivoran almost two thirds of area responsible for sensory perception in raccoon s cerebral cortex is specialized for interpretation of tactile impulses more than in any other studied animal they are able to identify objects before touching them with vibrissae located above their sharp claws raccoon s paws lack an opposable thumb thus it does not have agility of hands of primates there is no observed negative effect on tactile perception when a raccoon stands in water below 10 degc 50 degf for hours raccoons are thought to be color blind or at least poorly able to distinguish color though their eyes are well adapted for sensing green light although their accommodation of 11 is comparable to that of humans and they see well in twilight because of tapetum lucidum behind retina visual perception is of subordinate importance to raccoons because of their poor long distance vision in addition to being useful for orientation in dark their sense of smell is important for intraspecific communication glandular secretions usually from their anal glands urine and feces are used for marking with their broad auditory range they can perceive tones up to 50 85 khz as well as quiet noises like those produced by earthworms underground intelligence zoologist clinton hart merriam described raccoons as clever beasts and that in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of fox animal s intelligence gave rise to epithet sly coon only a few studies have been undertaken to determine mental abilities of raccoons most of them based on animal s sense of touch in a study by ethologist h b davis in 1908 raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating action when locks were rearranged or turned upside down davis concluded they understood abstract principles of locking mechanisms and their learning speed was equivalent to that of rhesus macaques studies in 1963 1973 1975 and 1992 concentrated on raccoon memory showed they can remember solutions to tasks for at least three years in a study by b pohl in 1992 raccoons were able to instantly differentiate between identical and different symbols three years after short initial learning phase stanislas reports in his book number sense that raccoons can distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes from those containing three in research by suzana herculano and other neuroscientists raccoons have been found to be comparable to primates in density of neurons in cerebral cortex which they have proposed to be a neuroanatomical indicator of intelligence behavior social behavior thumb eastern raccoons p l lotor in a tree raccoon s social structure is grouped into what ulf hohmann calls a three class society studies in 1990s by stanley d gehrt and ulf hohmann suggest that raccoons engage in gender specific social behaviors and are not typically solitary as was previously thought related females often live in a so called fission fusion society that is they share a common area and occasionally meet at feeding or resting grounds unrelated males often form loose male social groups to maintain their position against foreign males during mating season or against other potential invaders such a group does not usually consist of more than four individuals since some males show aggressive behavior towards unrelated kits mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves with respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons hohmann called their social structure a three class society samuel i zeveloff professor of zoology at weber state university and author of book raccoons a natural history is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at least females are solitary most of time and according to erik k fritzell s study in north dakota in 1978 males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well shape and size of a raccoon s home range varies depending on age sex and habitat with adults claiming areas more than twice as large as juveniles while size of home ranges in habitat of north dakota s prairies lie between for males and between for females average size in a marsh at lake erie was irrespective of whether home ranges of adjacent groups overlap they are most likely not actively defended outside mating season if food supplies are sufficient odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and identify individuals urine and feces left at shared raccoon latrines may provide additional information about feeding grounds since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating sleeping and playing concerning general behavior patterns of raccoons gehrt points out that typically you ll find 10 to 15 percent that will do opposite of what is expected left thumb on an apple tree diet though usually nocturnal raccoon is sometimes active in daylight to take advantage of available food sources its diet consists of about 40 invertebrates 33 plant material and 27 vertebrates since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods zeveloff argues raccoon may well be one of world s most omnivorous animals while its diet in spring and early summer consists mostly of insects worms and other animals already available early in year it prefers fruits and nuts such as acorns and walnuts which emerge in late summer and autumn and represent a rich calorie source for building up fat needed for winter contrary to popular belief raccoons only occasionally eat active or large prey such as birds and mammals they prefer prey that is easier to catch specifically fish amphibians and bird eggs raccoons are virulent predators of eggs and hatchlings in both birds and reptile nests to such a degree that for threatened prey species

activity drastically as long as a permanent snow cover makes searching for food impossible dousing thumb right upright captive raccoons often douse their food before eating one aspect of raccoon behavior is so well known that it gives animal part of its scientific name procyon lotor lotor is neo latin for washer in wild raccoons often dabble for underwater food near shore line they then often pick up food item with their front paws to examine it and rub item sometimes to remove unwanted parts this gives appearance of raccoon washing food tactile sensitivity of raccoons paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwater since water softens hard layer covering paws however behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to wash or douse it before eating has not been observed in wild naturalist georges louis leclerc comte de buffon believed that raccoons do not have adequate saliva production to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a fixed action pattern from dabbling behavior performed when foraging at shores for aquatic foods this is supported by observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently cleaning dirty food does not seem to be a reason for washing experts have cast doubt on veracity of observations of wild raccoons dousing food reproduction raccoons usually mate in a period triggered by increasing daylight between late january and mid march however there are large regional differences which are not completely explicable by solar conditions for example while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average mating season in manitoba also peaks later than usual in march and extends until june during mating season males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during three to four day period when conception is possible these encounters will often occur at central meeting places copulation including foreplay can last over an hour and is repeated over several nights weaker members of a male social group also are assumed to get opportunity to mate since stronger ones cannot mate with all available females in a study in southern texas during mating seasons from 1990 to 1992 about one third of all females mated with more than one male if a female does not become pregnant or if she loses her kits early she will sometimes become fertile again 80 to 140 days later left thumb an eastern raccoon p l lotor kit after usually 63 to 65 days of gestation although anywhere from 54 to 70 days is possible a litter of typically two to five young is born average litter size varies widely with habitat ranging from 2 5 in alabama to 4 8 in north dakota larger litters are more common in areas with a high mortality rate due for example to hunting or severe winters while male yearlings usually reach their sexual maturity only after main mating season female yearlings can compensate for high mortality rates and may be responsible for about 50 of all young born in a year males have no part in raising young kits also called cubs are blind and deaf at birth but their mask is already visible against their light fur birth weight of about long kits is between their ear canals open after around 18 to 23 days a few days before their eyes open for first time once kits weigh about they begin to explore outside den consuming solid food for first time after six to nine weeks after this point their mother suckles them with decreasing frequency they are usually weaned by 16 weeks in fall after their mother has shown them dens and feeding grounds juvenile group splits up while many females will stay close to home range of their mother males can sometimes move more than away this is considered an instinctive behavior preventing inbreeding however mother and offspring may share a den during first winter in cold areas life expectancy right thumb young florida raccoon p l elucus crossing a road captive raccoons have been known to live for more than 20 years however species life expectancy in wild is only 1 8 to 3 1 years depending on local conditions in terms of traffic volume hunting and weather severity it is not unusual for only half of young born in one year to survive a full year after this point annual mortality rate drops to between 10 and 30 young raccoons are vulnerable to losing their mother and to starvation particularly in long and cold winters most frequent natural cause of death in north american raccoon population is distemper which can reach epidemic proportions and kill most of a local raccoon population in areas with heavy vehicular traffic and extensive hunting these factors can account for up to 90 of all deaths of adult raccoons most important natural predators of raccoon are bobcats coyotes and great horned owls latter mainly preying on young raccoons but capable of killing adults in some cases in florida they have been reported to fall victim to larger carnivores like american black bear and cougars and these species may also be a threat on occasion in other areas where still present gray wolves may still occasionally take

themselves such as fishers to those as large and formidable as jaguars in mexico in their introduced range in former soviet union their main predators are wolves lynxes and eurasian eagle owls however predation is not a significant cause of death especially because larger predators have been exterminated in many areas inhabited by raccoons range left thumb mississippi delta raccoon p l searching for food on a lake shore habitat although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in last decades raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb when they feel threatened therefore they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations of beech trees as beech bark is too smooth to climb tree hollows in old oaks or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping winter and litter dens if such dens are unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient raccoons use burrows dug by other mammals dense undergrowth or tree crotches in a study in range of hills in germany more than 60 of all sleeping places were used only once but those used at least ten times accounted for about 70 of all uses since amphibians crustaceans and other animals around shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of raccoon s diet lowland deciduous or mixed forests abundant with water and marshes sustain highest population densities while population densities range from 0 5 to 3 2 animals

raccoons are common throughout north america from canada to panama where subspecies procyon lotor coexists with crab eating raccoon procyon cancrivorus population on hispaniola was exterminated as

separate species bahamas raccoon guadeloupe raccoon and tres marias raccoon were classified as endangered by iucn in 1996 there is archeological evidence that in pre columbian times raccoons were numerous only along rivers and in woodlands of southeastern united states as raccoons were not mentioned in earlier reports of pioneers exploring central and north central parts of united states their initial spread may have begun a few decades before 20th century since 1950s raccoons have expanded their range from vancouver island formerly northernmost limit of their range far into northern portions of four south central canadian provinces new habitats which have recently been occupied by raccoons aside from urban areas include mountain ranges such as western rocky mountains prairies and coastal marshes after a population explosion starting in 1940s estimated number of raccoons in north america in late 1980s was 15 to 20 times higher than in 1930s when raccoons were comparatively rare urbanization expansion of agriculture deliberate introductions and extermination of natural predators of raccoon have probably caused this increase in abundance and distribution distribution outside north america right thumb distribution in germany raccoons killed or found dead by hunters in hunting years 2000 01 2001 02 and 2002 03 in administrative districts of germany as a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in mid 20th century raccoon is now distributed in several european and asian countries sightings have occurred in all countries bordering germany which hosts largest population outside of north america another stable population exists in northern france where several pet raccoons were released by members of u s air force near laon air base in 1966 furthermore raccoons have been known to be in area around madrid since early 1970s in 2013 city authorized capture and death of any specimen it is also present in italy with one reproductive population in lombardy about 1 240 animals were released in nine regions of former soviet union between 1936 and 1958 for purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur two of these introductions were successful one in south of belarus between 1954 and 1958 and another in azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957 with a seasonal harvest of between 1 000 and 1 500 animals in 1974 estimated size of population distributed in caucasus region was around 20 000 animals and density was four animals per square kilometer 10 animals per square mile distribution in japan in japan up to 1 500 raccoons were imported as pets each year after success of anime series rascal raccoon 1977 in 2004 descendants of discarded or escaped animals lived in 42 of 47 prefectures range of raccoons in wild in japan grew from 17 prefectures in 2000 to all 47 prefectures in 2008 it is estimated that raccoons cause thirty million yen of agricultural damage on hokkaido alone distribution in germany in germany where raccoon is called literally wash bear or washing bear due to its habit of dousing food in water two pairs of pet raccoons were released into german countryside at reservoir in north of hesse in april 1934 by a forester upon request of their owner a poultry farmer he released them two weeks before receiving permission from prussian hunting office to enrich fauna several prior attempts to introduce raccoons in germany were not successful a second population was established in eastern germany in 1945 when 25 raccoons escaped from a fur farm at today district of east of berlin after an air strike two populations are distinguishable 70 of raccoons of hessian population are infected with roundworm baylisascaris procyonis but none of brandenburgian population has parasite estimated number of raccoons was 285 animals in hessian region in 1956 over 20 000 animals in hessian region in 1970 and between 200 000 and 400 000 animals in whole of germany in 2008 by 2012 it was estimated that germany now had more than a million raccoons raccoon was a protected species in germany but has been declared a game animal in 14 of 16 states since 1954 hunters and environmentalists argue raccoon spreads uncontrollably threatens protected bird species and supersedes domestic carnivorans this view is opposed by zoologist frank uwe who finds no evidence a high population density of raccoons has negative effects on biodiversity of an area hohmann holds that extensive hunting cannot be justified by absence of natural predators because predation is not a significant cause of death in north american raccoon population raccoon is extensively hunted in germany as they are seen as an invasive species and pests in 1990s only about 400 raccoons were hunted yearly this increased to 67 700 by 2010 11 hunting season and tally broke 100 000 barrier in 2013 during 2015 16 hunting season tally was 128 100 animals 60 percent of which were provided by federal states of hesse distribution in former ussr experiments in raccoons into ussr began in 1936 and were repeated a further 25 times until 1962 overall 1 222 individuals were released 64 of which came from zoos and fur farms 38 of them having been imports from western europe remainder originated from a population previously established in transcaucasia range of soviet raccoons was never single or continuous as they were often introduced to different locations far from each other all introductions into russian far east failed melanistic raccoons were released on petrov island near vladivostok and some areas of southern primorsky krai but died in middle asia raccoons were released in kyrgyzstan s jalal abad province though they were later recorded as practically absent there in january 1963 a large and stable raccoon population yielding 1000 1500 catches a year was established in azerbaijan after an introduction to area in 1937 raccoons apparently survived an introduction near terek along river into lowlands attempts to settle raccoons on kuban river s left tributary and were unsuccessful a successful acclimatization occurred in belarus where three introductions consisting of 52 37 and 38 individuals in 1954 and 1958 took place by january 1 1963 700 individuals were recorded in country urban raccoons thumb on roof of a house in germany due to its adaptability raccoon has been able to use urban areas as a habitat first sightings were recorded in a suburb of cincinnati in 1920s since 1950s raccoons have been present in metropolitan areas like washington dc chicago and toronto diploma thesis at university of halle wittenberg since 2010s a nuisance population of raccoons has been present in albuquerque new mexico since 1960s kassel has hosted europe s first and densest population in a large urban area with about 50 to 150 animals per square kilometer 130 to 390 animals per square mile a figure comparable to those of urban habitats in north america home range sizes of urban raccoons are only 3 to 40 hectares 7 5 to 100 acres for females and 8 to 80 hectares 20 to 200 acres for males in small towns and suburbs many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in settlement area
