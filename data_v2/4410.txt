a variety of social cultural ethnic and linguistic factors contributed to sparking of unrest in eastern and southern ukraine in aftermath of early 2014 revolution in ukraine following ukrainian independence from soviet union in 1991 resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered development of a unified ukrainian national identity in eastern and southern ukraine russification and ethnic russian settlement during centuries of russian rule caused russian language to attain primacy even amongst ethnic ukrainians in crimea ethnic russians have comprised majority of population since deportation of indigenous crimean tatars by soviet union leader joseph stalin following second world war this contrasts with western and central ukraine which were historically ruled by a variety of powers such as polish lithuanian commonwealth and austrian empire in these areas ukrainian ethnic national and linguistic identity remained intact tensions between these two competing historical and cultural traditions erupted into political and social conflict during ukrainian crisis which began when then ukrainian president viktor yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with european union on 21 november 2013 support for closer ties with europe was strong in western and central ukraine whilst many in eastern and southern ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with russia president yanukovych who drew most of his support from eastern regions was forced out of office in february 2014 his ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern ukraine that placed a strong emphasis on importance of historical ties to russia russian language and antipathy towards euromaidan movement crimea after russo turkish war of 1768 1774 crimean khanate a vassal of ottoman empire formed in 1441 was made nominally independent by treaty of kucuk kaynarca in 1774 it was annexed by russian empire in 1783 as taurida governorate demographics of crimea underwent dramatic changes in centuries following annexation prior to its incorporation into russia crimea had been inhabited primarily by crimean tatars a turkic people who were predominately muslim empress catherine great gave many of lands that had been annexed to her advisors and friends native inhabitants of these lands were frequently forced out spawning a large exodus of tatars to ottoman controlled anatolia russian settlers were brought in to colonise lands that were once occupied by fleeing tatars by 1903 39 7 of population of crimea excluding cities sevastopol and yeni kale were members of russian orthodox religion 44 6 were muslim in context of this survey identifier muslim is synonymous with ethnic crimean tatars russians constituted majority of population in two excluded and separately administered cities during and directly prior to this time crimea became considered heart of russian romanticism it was popular with russians on holiday because of its warm climate and seaside this association continued into soviet period soviet period crimea had autonomy within russian soviet federative socialist republic sfsr as crimean autonomous soviet socialist republic assr from 1921 until 1944 according to soviet census of 1926 42 2 of population of crimean assr was ethnic russian 25 was crimean tatar 10 8 was ethnic ukrainian 7 was jewish

about one fifth of population of crimea and numbered about 183 155 people most were sent to deserts of soviet controlled central asia around 45 of deportees died during deportation process crimea was made crimean oblast of russian sfsr following these events for first time in history ethnic russians comprised majority of population of crimea soviet premier nikita khrushchev transferred crimea from russian sfsr to ukrainian ssr in 1954 this event passed with little fanfare and was viewed as an insignificant symbolic gesture as both republics were a part of soviet union and answerable to government in moscow crimean autonomy was re established in 1991 after a referendum just prior to dissolution of soviet union ukrainian period ukrainian independence was confirmed by a referendum held on 1 december 1991 in this referendum 54 of crimean voters supported independence from soviet union this was followed by a 1992 vote by crimean parliament to hold a referendum on independence from ukraine which spawned a two year crisis over status of crimea at same time supreme soviet of russia voted to void cession of crimea to ukraine in june of same year ukrainian government in kiev voted to give crimea a large amount autonomy as autonomous republic of crimea within ukraine despite this fighting between crimean government russian government and ukrainian government continued in 1994 russian nationalist yuri meshkov won 1994 crimean presidential election and implemented earlier approved referendum on status of crimea 1 3 million people voted in this referendum 78 4 of whom supported greater autonomy from ukraine whilst 82 8 supported allowing dual russian ukrainian citizenship later in that same year status of crimea as part of ukraine was recognised by russia which

office of president of crimea in 1995 crimea was granted a new constitution in 1998 which granted lesser autonomy than previous one crimean officials would later seek to restore powers of previous constitution throughout 1990s many crimean tatar deportees and their descendants returned to crimea one of main tensions between russia and ukraine in aftermath of dissolution of soviet union was status of black sea fleet which was and is based in sevastopol under 1997 russo ukrainian partition treaty which determined ownership of military bases and vessels in crimea russia was allowed to have up to 25 000 troops 24 artillery systems with a calibre smaller than 100 mm 132 armoured vehicles and 22 military aeroplanes in crimea this treaty was extended in 2010 by ukrainian president viktor

of feodosia protested against docking of us navy ship advantage in june 2006 protesters carried signs with anti nato slogans and considered presence of nato affiliated troops an intrusion some commentators in ukraine viewed protests as being driven by a russian hand in 2010 elections to crimean parliament party of regions received largest share of votes whilst second placed communist party of ukraine received a much smaller share both of these political parties would later be targets of euromaidan movement former president of crimea yuriy meshkov called for a referendum on restoring

for being wild fields dyke pole area that is now called donbass was largely under control of ukrainian cossack hetmanate and turkic crimean khanate until mid late 18th century when russian empire conquered hetmanate and annexed khanate it named conquered territories new russia novorossiya as industrial revolution took hold across europe vast coal resources of donbass began to be exploited in mid late 19th century this led to a population boom in region largely driven by russian settlers in 1858 population of region was 700 767 by 1897 it had reached 1 453 109 according to russian imperial census of 1897 ethnic ukrainians comprised 52 4 of population of region whilst ethnic russians comprised 28 7 ethnic greeks germans jews and tatars also had a significant presence in donbass

with first parliamentary elections in independent ukraine these questions included whether russian should be enshrined as an official language of ukraine whether russian should be language of administration in donetsk and luhansk oblasts whether ukraine should and whether ukraine should have closer ties with commonwealth of independent states close to 90 of voters voted in favour of these

controversial regional language law in 2012 this law granted a language status of regional language where percentage of representatives of its ethnic group exceeded 10 of total population of a defined
