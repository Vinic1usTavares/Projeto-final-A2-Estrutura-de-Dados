notoc kepler 9d formerly known as koi 377 03 is a planet in orbit around sun like star kepler 9 initially discovered by kepler spacecraft a terrestrial planet searching satellite built and operated by nasa kepler 9d is most likely a super earth with an estimated radius approximately 60 larger than that of earth s although its exact mass cannot be determined kepler 9d orbits kepler 9 every 1 56 days at a distance of 0273 au from its star an extremely close distance although kepler 9d is closest planet to its star in its system it is named kepler 9d instead of kepler 9b because two gas giants kepler 9b and kepler 9c were confirmed first original studies into system first suggested that kepler 9d might be a planet but a follow up investigation made by kepler team later confirmed that it was confirmation of kepler 9d as a planet was made public with team s paper which was published in astrophysical journal on january 1 2011 team used telescopes at w m keck observatory in hawaii to follow up on kepler space telescope s initial discovery discovery and name kepler 9d s name comes from it being third planet discovered in orbit of kepler 9 kepler 9 was named for kepler spacecraft a nasa satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around or crossing in front of their host stars as seen from earth this transit causes a regular interval in which star briefly and slightly dims as planet crosses it flagged initially as a transit event by satellite kepler 9d was given designation koi 377 03 it was recognized as a potential planet after a study into system confirmed kepler 9b and kepler 9c but follow up studies had to be completed to verify that it was indeed a planet and that apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in aperture of kepler s photometer kepler s team exhaustively disproved that small transit event could have been anything but a planet and their results were published in astrophysical journal on january 1 2011 follow up observations were conducted by high resolution echelle spectrometer at w m keck observatory in hawaii as well as wiyn observatory in arizona and palomar observatory in california host star kepler 9 is a sun like star in constellation lyra that lies some 640 parsecs away from earth with a mass of and a radius of kepler 9 is almost exactly same size and width of sun being only 7 more massive and 2 wider kepler 9 has an effective temperature of 5777 61 k as compared to sun s at 5778 k and is approximately 32 more metal rich in terms of iron than sun kepler 9 is younger than sun and is estimated to be one billion years old kepler 9 has two planets other than kepler 9d gas giants kepler 9b and kepler 9c characteristics based on size of its light curve kepler 9d is assumed to be a super earth although its exact mass is not known it is presumed to be at least 1 5 earth masses planet s radius is inferred to be 1 64 re or approximately 64 larger than earth s radius with an equilibrium temperature of 2026 k it is hotter than all previous planets discovered by kepler not counting three previously discovered ones located in its field of view its density is not known with an average distance of 0273 au 2 537 695 73 miles from its star which it orbits every 1 days kepler 9d is closest planet to its star in kepler 9 system to compare planet mercury is 3871 au away from sun which it orbits every 87 97 days references category exoplanets discovered in 2011 category lyra constellation category terrestrial planets category super earths category transiting exoplanets 9d
