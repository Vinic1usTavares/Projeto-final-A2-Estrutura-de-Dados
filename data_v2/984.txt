carmina drapier s letters is collective name for a series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by dean of st patrick s cathedral in dublin jonathan swift to arouse public opinion in ireland against imposition of a privately minted copper coinage that swift believed to be of inferior quality william wood was granted letters patent to mint coin and swift saw licensing of patent as corrupt in response swift represented ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of britain in drapier s letters since subject was politically sensitive swift wrote under pseudonym m b drapier a drapier or draper is a merchant of cloth to hide from retaliation letter 1 intro note although letters were condemned by irish government with prompting from british government coxe 396 399 they were still able to inspire popular sentiment against wood and his patent popular sentiment turned into a nationwide boycott which forced patent to be withdrawn swift was later honoured for this service to people of ireland cambridge history of english and american literature volume ix vi 19 pamphlets on irish affairs drapier s letters many irish people recognised swift as a hero for his defiance of british control over irish nation smith p 271 beyond being a hero many critics have seen swift through persona of drapier as first to organise a more universal irish community although it is disputed as to who constitutes that community moore p 84 regardless of to whom swift is actually appealing what he may or may not have done nickname provided by archbishop king our irish copper dean and his connection to ending controversy stuck moore p 87 first complete collection of drapier s letters appeared in 1734 george faulkner edition of works of jonathan swift along with an allegorical frontispiece offering praise and thanks from irish people weedon p 44 48 today drapier s letters are an important part of swift s political writings along with gulliver s travels 1726 a tale of a tub 1704 and a modest proposal 1729 background in 1722 hardware manufacturer william wood was granted letters patent to produce copper coinage of up to 000 around ps as of for use in ireland goodwin p 649 patent was secured by a bribe of ps10 000 around ps as of to duchess of kendal p 34 mistress to king george i although wood s copper coins were subsequently alleged to be underweight undersized and made from inferior materials drapier s letters p 142 assays had found they were not so prior to their approval by british parliament for use in ireland martin pp 1 14 irish complaint against wood was not that they had enough copper coins but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into irish economy these coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in irish economy and since new copper coins would not be minted under irish authority no way existed for irish to control quality and amount moore p 66 also wood s coin was only one example of allegedly unfavourable economic practices that hurt ireland irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage and wood s coin became a way to express their economic nationalist desires moore p 73 patent issue soon became a struggle between prime minister robert walpole with authority of british parliament and leaders of ireland all attempts by irish privy council and church of ireland to prevent release of coinage proved fruitless goodwin p 661 it was soon thought by many that william conolly s commissioners of revenue might pay soldiers stationed in ireland with new coin if soldiers were paid with coin then merchants of ireland would be forced to accept coin from soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business this worried leadership of ireland and they requested help in challenging wood s patent and leading a boycott of coin swift was asked by archbishop king and lord chancellor midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against wood s coin ferguson p 96 during this time lord carteret british secretary of state whose remit included ireland publicly pushed walpole into defending wood s patent however carteret privately attempted to destroy patent to damage walpole s reputation thus carteret appeared to british as a defender of patent because he seemingly tried to prevent an irish uprising against british rule especially by finding drapier but he was really furthering his anti walpole agenda and aiding irish cause ehrenpreis p 198 pamphleteering jonathan swift then dean of st patrick s cathedral in dublin was already known for his concern for irish people and for writing several political pamphlets one of these proposal for universal use of irish manufacture 1720 had so inflamed british authorities that printer john harding was prosecuted although pamphlet had done little more than recommend that irish use materials they produce rather than export them to england smith p 266 267 also irish authorities knew that swift s political pamphleteering had been employed by tory government of queen anne and that he would use his abilities to undermine whig government of walpole thumb left alt a man is sitting in a chair facing to right he is wearing a dark robe and has a powder wig on his head his face is plump in his right hand is a pen and his left hand is a document charles s portrait of jonathan swift 1718 swift analysed forensic and economic disadvantages of wood s inferior coinage and effects it would have over ireland in first of pamphlets a letter to shop keepers 1724 in pamphlet swift adopted persona of drapier a common irishman a talented and skilled draper a religiously devout individual who believes in scripture and a man loyal to both church of ireland and to king of ireland beaumont p 44 swift s pseudonymous choice served two essential purposes it provided him with an alternate persona which he could use to hide from potential political reprisals and it allowed him to create an identity that was closely aligned with common people of ireland according to 20th century swift scholar irvin ehrenpreis debate arose in academic community over how much swift may have wished his audience to identify him as drapier especially since drapier constantly includes religious imagery that was common to swift s sermons however religious rhetoric probably used to justify an irish rebellion against coinage is merely meant as an important aspect of drapier s identity without it being meant as evidence that swift was author ehrenpreis p 208 regardless of how secret swift may have wanted his identity to be most people in ireland including members of irish privy council certainly knew that swift was author of letters unfortunately for walpole administration little legal proof was available of a relationship between two that would justify them trying swift as drapier over course of a year four more pamphlets filled with invective and complaints against both wood and his patent followed first pamphlet was successful and public opinion became so hostile against wood s coinage that patent was withdrawn by 1725 at one point lord carteret and irish privy council offered a significant reward of ps300 for information that would verify identity of pamphlet s author but swift was neither arrested nor charged for works lack of an arrest and unity of irish people behind drapier was an important motivating factor behind walpole s withdrawal of patent irish independence although swift knew that duchess of kendal was responsible for selling patent to wood he rarely mentions this fact in letters instead his first three letters describe wood as mastermind behind patent although drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to king his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him in response to third and fourth letters in third and fourth letters swift argues that irish deserve independence from england but not from king this of all of drapier s arguments is what agitated walpole as head of british parliament most thus drapier was condemned like william molyneux whose case of ireland 1698 pleaded for irish independence using same arguments ferguson p 110 claims of treason levelled against drapier were of treason to english parliament which only caused more resentment among irish people who sided with swift s constitutional argument that irish people owed their allegiance only to king pamphlets first three pamphlets were written as a set intended to conclude matter however when lord carteret was sent to control ireland and placed a bounty on drapier s head swift felt that a fourth pamphlet was necessary fifth in this list was written at height of controversy over wood s coin and constitutes final public writing of drapier prose works letter 6 intro note letter to lord chancellor middleton was signed with swift s works letter 5 and not collected until faulkner s 1735 edition last letter an humble address was also published after conflict had ended prose works letter 7 intro note to shop keepers right thumb 200px alt a document reading a letter to shop keepers tradesmen farmers and common people of ireland concerning brass half pence coined by mr woods with design to have them pass in this kingdom explanation of text follows at bottom is by m b drapier and dublin printed by j harding in molesworth s court title page from 1724 pamphlet to shop keepers drapier s first letter to shop keepers tradesmen farmers and common people of ireland was printed in march 1724 shortly afterwards a copy of first letter was forwarded by swift to lord carteret on 28 april 1724 and knowledge of letter s contents had spread all way to london by april 1724 letter was popular and swift claimed that over 2 000 copies had been sold in dublin letters p 106 letter was retitled fraud detected or hibernian patriot by faulkner s dublin journal which published piece in 1725 prose works letter 1 fraud detected was later used by faulkner as title of collection of first five letters published after patent controversy ended ehrenpreis p 317 318 drapier introduces his subject by invoking duty of his readers as christians as parents and as lovers of your country his purpose is to introduce background of wood s coin and then he suggests a boycott similar to one in his proposal for universal use of irish manufacture throughout his monetary arguments drapier constantly acknowledges how humble his station in life is and incorporates theological and classical allusions to mock wood drapier places blame for coin upon wood stating it is no treason to rebel against mr wood there are many religious overtones similar to swift s sermons such as drapier s combination of a duty to god with duty to one s king and country many critics compare language and rhetorical style of first letter to a hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns masses of an imminent threat to their soul ehrenpreis p 210 however final judgment had not yet come so drapier also included arguments claiming that wood s halfpence would destroy irish economy and souls of citizenry ferguson p 99 one of concerns of irish discussed in first letter was over what is now known as gresham s law moore p 81 debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from country which would further debase currency tenant farmers would no longer be able to pay their landlords and after tenants were removed there would be fewer crops grown in ireland increase of poverty and decrease of food supply would completely ruin ireland s economy although some critics and historians view language and examples employed by drapier to describe possible economic harms as over top others consider that swift s imagery was grounded in truth ferguson p 101 even swift s satire of wood s character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what wood provided public through his words and actions treadwell p 76 91 although drapier emphasises wood s involvement and not king s glosses of first letter reveal allusions to wood bribing duchess of kendal that obscure distinction to careful reader however drapier always respects king as leader of irish nation and irish church although some critics see his bold language and free use of king s name and title as undermining those positions drapier makes sure that wood appears to be primary target which when combined with only an indirect attack upon people at top of british political system reassured people of ireland that they could rebel against an insignificant hardware man ferguson p 98 to mr harding thumb right 200px alt a document reads a letter to mr harding printer upon occasion of a paragraph in his news paper

testing of wood s coin prose works letter 2 intro note drapier alludes to involvement of duchess of kendall in his first letter in second drapier de emphasises her involvement and shifts his focus to blame whig party according to drapier whigs are ones who wood bribed in securing his patent treadwell p 86 central target for this letter is privy council s report produced under authority of walpole it was necessary for drapier to attack report to ensure that people would be willing to resist coin and deny truth that wood s supporters issued ferguson p 104 therefore drapier describes them as only a few betrayers of their country confederates with woods ref name prose works letter 2 works prose works letter 2 ref drapier does not directly attack isaac newton s assay of wood s coin but instead attacks process behind assay and witnesses who testified before privy council in his criticism of privy council s report drapier claims that report is part of wood s propaganda and lies because wood released three proposals concurrent with report lowering patent production quota from ps100 800 to ps40 000 worth that no one is obliged to accept more than five pence halfpenny per transaction and to sell coin at 2s 1d a pound or his raw copper at 1s 8d a pound ehrenpreis p 226 229 230 249 250 wood s choice of wording that irish would be obliged to accept coin was criticised by drapier who then accused wood of perfect high treason for obliging people to take any copper coin when king lacked constitutional authority to do such a thing ferguson p 105 in second letter drapier walks a careful line between openly indicting king and merely hinting at his relationship with wood s patent while drapier accuses wood he constantly refers to king s authority and power to issue legal tender this is called king s prerogative in particular drapier claims that king is unable to force his people to accept any copper based currency ferguson p 106 107 as drapier points out constitution establishing ireland as a kingdom limits authority of monarch because it forces people of ireland to use only gold or silver coins as official currency throughout this argument drapier compares king s ability to print money with petty amount of political power held by wood which undermines image of king as supreme authority in ireland while hinting that king is not protecting rights of irish people drapier stops himself before he commits treason and he instead argues that king would never accept a patent that could harm ireland to drapier king would never act in such a way as to help wood harm people of ireland ferguson p 107 in response to calls for action from drapier in second letter a group of bankers joined together on 17 august 1724 agreeing in writing that they would not accept coin produced under wood s patent ehrenpreis p 324 other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion however this did not stop walpole from ordering commissioners of revenue in ireland to enter coin into irish economy ehrenpreis p 235 regardless of walpole s orders irish lord justices did not act lord shannon did not command that his troops should be issued wood s coin and middleton s house of lords and conolly s house of commons did not pass any resolution backing up walpole s order which effectively prevented coin from being distributed to nobility and gentry right thumb 200px alt a document reads some observations upon a paper call d report of committee of most honourable privy council in england relating to wood s half pence at bottom is same signature and printer as before title page from 1724 pamphlet some observations drapier s third letter to nobility and gentry of kingdom of ireland some observations upon a paper call d report of committee of most honourable privy council in england relating to wood s half pence was printed on 25 august 1724 prose works letter 3 intro note subject matter of third letter is similar to that of second letter and some scholars have explained this as a result of swift being forced to respond so quickly to privy council s report ehrenpreis p 238 drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to pride of his audience nobility drapier spends most of his letter responding to report of committee of most honourable privy in england this document released by walpole served as a defence of wood s coin report argued that coin was important to people of ireland however report was not officially released by walpole in parliament s gazette but published without parliament s authority in london journal in august 1724 some scholars have speculated that walpole had report published in a non parliamentary magazine so that he would not be connected directly to wood s coin however lack of parliamentary authority behind report allowed drapier to undermine credibility of report s content mason p 336 drapier claims mr wood in publishing this paper would insinuate to world as if committee had a greater concern for his credit and private emolument than for honour of privy council and both houses of parliament here for it seems intended as a vindication of mr wood not without several severe remarks on houses of lords and commons of ireland prose works letter 3 to drapier wood has utter contempt for political authority of ireland and would use his coin and report to mock them however attack extends beyond wood to encompass a dispute about authority of england to rule over kingdom of ireland ferguson p 109 central argument in letter is that british have negated rights of irish people by relying on a completely british system to pass patent without allowing irish parliament a say william wood according to drapier was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for massachusetts wood drapier claims hath already tried his faculty in new england and i hope he will meet with an equal reception here what that was i leave to publick intelligence response to wood s coin was a complete boycott of coin drapier does not blame production of coining on walpole s policies in regard to england s colonies but on wood s and his accomplice s actions this criticism of wood s actions allows drapier to attack patent process in such a way that could not be used directly against british parliament ehrenpreis p 240 in referring to this point drapier asks were not people of ireland born as free as those of england final image of this letter is that of small but brave david versus giant goliath beaumont p 42 wood is giant invader who wears his brass coin as armour and drapier is just small merchant who is not big enough to fill king s armour beaumont p 43 this image resonated with people and a sign was displayed by people of dublin which read and people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to ground for he hath wrought with god this day so people rescued jonathan that he died not smith p 274 third letter openly incorporates swift s argument that political authority stems from consent of a population as such third letter has been seen as a response in part to declaratory act which had undermined independence and authority of irish legislature and judiciary in favour of british ehrenpreis p 243 declaratory act removed ability for any in ireland to speak for people of ireland and it was necessary for act to be removed before people could be heard fabricant p 481 however such an attack on declaratory act was common in swift s works and he constantly argued against act by promoting irish autonomy mahony p 508 this does not mean that irish independence is to be taken lightly because swift viewed self reliance as only means of halting their irish irish protestant self destructive complicity of which they were inadequately aware in england s ongoing consumption of ireland to whole people of ireland right thumb 200px alt a document reads letter to whole people of ireland at bottom is same signature and printer as before title page from 1724 pamphlet to whole people of ireland drapier s fourth letter to whole people of ireland a word or two to people of ireland a short defense of people of ireland was written on 13 october 1724 and was either published on 21 october 1724 or on 22 october 1724 day lord carteret arrived in dublin throughout letter drapier pretends that carteret s transfer to ireland to enforce wood s patent was a rumour produced by wood s allies although swift had knowledge to contrary ferguson p 114 fourth letter was written in response to many charges put forth by british supporters of wood s patent against irish including claims of papal influence and of treason a large portion of letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that wood s coin could be beneficial to irish people prose works letter 4 tone of letter is clear wood s allies are promoting an evil that will harm ireland however wood is only a secondary target figures like walpole are mocked for their role in controversy ehrenpreis p 255 majority of fourth letter is devoted to an argument revolving around political liberty of irish people it is for this argument that drapier was persecuted because his words were seen as a call to challenge british authority and possibly to declare independence from king drapier walks a fine line between loyalty and disloyalty because he charges that irish are loyal only to their king who had title king of ireland but not to england to this drapier states in defence of his nation drapier turns around claims of treason and papal loyalty against wood and his defenders especially walpole calling them as treasonous as jacobite rebels and parliamentary rebels craik p 74 drapier believed that god s providence supported people of ireland but his will required people of ireland to stand up against treasonous british johnson p 76 most famous and controversial statement of drapier s letters follows claims of loyalty to irish king i have digressed a little to refresh and continue that spirit so raised amongst you and to let you see that by laws of god of nature of nations and of your own country you are and ought to be as free a people as your brethren in england this line of argument follows political philosophy of john locke in two treatises on government 1689 locke wrote that people had right to resist their government when their property rights were violated and that nations have same sovereign rights even when they have been conquered by another a secondary rhetorical battle began between walpole and irish in regard to wood s patent rest of constitutional debate was over nature of law a law that was brought back into use through declaratory act 1720 moore p 75 poyning s law was a law that british claimed allowed them to control all of ireland s legal actions and to revoke irish parliamentary independence traditionally rulers of ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by poyning s law drapier agreed with irish interpretation of law and incorporated aspects of molyneux s arguments that combined proof law was misinterpreted and locke s political philosophy lord carteret read passages from fourth letter about irish constitutional independence to irish privy council and claimed that they were treasonable coxe p 396 397 it was then that harding was arrested for printing letters and a reward of ps300 was offered for identity of drapier ferguson p 115 lord carteret wrote that arrest and bounty were result of an unfortunate accident and he did not want to respond in such a way drapier s letters p xliii lord midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally drapier when did so when he wrote to provoke england to that degree as some have endeavoured to do is not true way to keep them out henry downes 25 october 1724 letters on various subjects p 588 archbishop king responded to letters by saying they were ludicrous and writ goodwin p 671 however archbishop publicly supported constitutional actions more than other three and his support caused others important officials to criticise him ferguson p 121 regardless of proclamation against drapier and words issued by important irish officials people of ireland had stood by writer and it was their support that protected swift drapier s letters pp xlii xliii some critics have viewed this support as resulting from letter s appeal to mob or common people of ireland to viscount molesworth thumb right 200px alt a document with title a letter to right honourable lord viscount molesworth and containing several biblical excerpts it has same signature and printer as before title page of to viscount molesworth from 1735 faulkner edition and reproduced by 1903 temple scott edition drapier s fifth letter a letter to honourable lord viscount molesworth at his house at near swords was published on 31 december 1724 letter includes most pseudo biographical information on drapier ferguson p 128 this letter is seen as final salvo in drapier s fight against wood s patent although there was a possible agreement between carteret and walpole over ending patent swift found it necessary to publish this defence of fourth letter to ensure that walpole would not back down from his promise of removing patent ehrenpreis p 286 it has also been seen as a letter celebrating harding s release from being tried for printing drapier s letters drapier begins his letter with three quotations psalm 109 ecclesiasticus sirach 7 and virgil s aeneid book five prose works letter 6 with these passages he sets tone for his own defence by appealing to both reason and religious sentiments of his audience to prove his innocence some critics argue that swift did not need to defend himself and to viscount molesworth was written to gloat ferguson p 130 however essence of letter encourages irish to remember actions of walpole wood and british parliament by willingly throwing himself before judgement of his fellow irishmen and before final judgement of god drapier claims that he is and always will be on correct side of argument other critics emphasise that letter s object lord molesworth was targeted to bind higher and lower classes together using molesworth a religious dissenter a nobleman and opposite of swift drapier unites all of various people of ireland in a common nationalist cause ehrenpreis p 289 instead of defending charges against himself drapier is calling up more support for irish cause he seeks attention so that greater liberty of ireland will be respected ehrenpreis p 291 letter serves one other purpose to delight in drapier s lack of being captured and his victory over whitshed william whitshed lord chief justice of king s bench in ireland was one who actually arrested harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials ehrenpreis p 289 290 a letter written anonymously by swift seasonable advice to grand jury motivated irish jury to stand up against whitshed and release printer ehrenpreis p 293 drapier hints at letter and freeing of harding when he lists many other works written by jonathan swift and in process nearly reveals his own identity however his tone may not be mocking as he could just be flaunting his own position and some have credited this idea to incorporation of so many biblical and classical allusions beyond three that begin letter scholar herbert davis declared this letter is in some ways best written of all letters drapier s letters p lvii to lord chancellor middleton sixth letter during drapier s campaign to lord chancellor middleton is dated 26 october 1724 and was written as a private letter from jonathan swift to alan brodrick lord midleton with misspelling of his title prose works letter 5 intro note it is not a true drapier letter because author professes to be different from drapier although he was known to be one and same by lord midleton sir walter scott includes this letter as number five although faulkner sheridan deane swift hawkesworth and nichols label it as number six purpose of sixth letter was to ensure that midleton would stay true to his opposition of wood s patent although extent to which midleton was influenced by letter cannot be known it is certain that midleton believed that patent would harm ireland and that he would resist it at all costs coxe p 395 399 regardless swift wrote letter to express himself in a way that drapier could not as dean of a great irish cathedral ehrenpreis p 271 he asserts his status to verify that drapier s intentions must be good in essence letter rehashes many of previous letters arguments to draw midleton into openly supporting drapier s actions ehrenpreis p 274 swift also admits to actively working against patent and mentions how his on doing good sermon is similar to ideas expressed by drapier prose works iv on doing good sermon intro note an humble address drapier s last letter an humble address to both houses of parliament was completed in june 1725 it was written before wood s patent was defeated and it was stopped from being printed when word reached swift that patent had been withdrawn this letter remained unpublished for 10 years letter challenges ireland s parliament to investigate how wood originally attained patent even though most in power knew that patent was result of bribery ehrenpreis p 303 although nothing new would be discovered in an investigation letter served purpose of trying to unite people of ireland to fight for further economic freedom drapier refers to ireland s lack of economic freedom when he claims irish are altogether losers and england a gainer prose works letter 7 swift s intentions behind letter are uncertain and some critics believe that swift did not desire such an investigation into wood s supporters while others contend that swift was serious about promoting a public inquiry into matter ehrenpreis p 305 ehrenpreis challenges ferguson s characterization of swift as not actually caring about an investigation topics drapier addresses span from absentee land owners to importing of goods from britain to favouring of englishmen over irishmen for irish governmental positions these issues were many issues that swift cared about and saw as threatening ireland before wood s halfpence controversy ferguson p 133 however these individual issues were not as important as independence and unity of ireland specifics of independence were less important than self rule ehrenpreis p 308 some argue that swift after wood s patent was withdrawn removed himself from political landscape to focus on writing gulliver s travels in which he picked up many of same ideas ferguson p 135 publication john harding published first four letters before he was arrested and fifth after his release after harding s death george faulkner became swift s primary publisher in ireland and a letter to lord chancellor middleton and an humble address were copied from manuscript copies provided by author to faulkner and then printed with other letters ehrenpreis p 780 781 drapier s letters were first collected and published in their entirety by faulkner in 1735 ferguson p 134 on 9 february 1733 faulkner advertised his future publication of swift s collected works in four volumes first containing drapier s letters in dublin journal drapier s letters xiv p 42 however this edition led to motte v faulkner 1735 lawsuit since london bookseller benjamin motte had publication rights under british copyright legislation to many of works included in faulkner s edition ehrenpreis p 787 although drapier s letters were not under copyright complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in england by a ruling on 28 november 1735 cornu p 120 121 it is uncertain if swift allowed faulkner to publish works to allow an irish publisher to compete against a british publisher or if swift had no say in matter and faulkner published works against swift s will in a letter to motte in may 1736 swift did not defend faulkner s legal right to publish works instead swift admonished motte for prosecuting faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow faulkner to reprint copyrighted material correspondence p 493 494 reception although original printing of drapier s letters resulted in arrest of harding and a bounty placed upon drapier s head swift s actions in defending ireland were deemed heroic among irish citizenry ferguson p 138 he was titled hibernian patriot for his actions mahony p 518 some residents of dublin placed banners and signs in city to recognise swift s deeds and images from letters such as drapier comparing his campaign to david fighting goliath became themes in popular literature scholar herbert davis claims that by end of 1725 swift was darling of populace his image and superscription on a great many sign posts in ireland drapier s letters p lxvi swift did not fully embrace his popularity but he enjoyed it on his birthday 30 november 1727 a large group of men came to st patrick s cathedral to pray and afterwards celebrate throughout city this gathering commemorated swift and his letters and also protested against harsh british treatment of ireland ehrenpreis p 514 according to robert mahony drapier s letters especially fourth were later praised by irish nationalists mahony p 517 however as he continued many recent critics have re examined this nationalistic claim and asserted a counterclaim that swift is speaking more for protestants of ireland than for entire nation many critics including carol fabricant have asked who whole people of ireland are who drapier s letters are speaking to and if swift has right as a protestant englishman to speak for entire nation fabricant p 465 r f foster believes that swift represented ascendancy attitudes foster p 175 but this view is not held by all some critics like leerssen believe that swift s work contributed greatly to a common irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation and that swift was able to relate to all of ireland through a unified suffering under british rule leerssen p 311 in overall effect fabricant argued that swift s ability to speak for whole populace is further suggested by wide consensus opposed to coinage plan along with this swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights in drapier s letters to all people of ireland without any regard to restriction fabricant p 482 483 notes references external links plain text drapier s letters at internet archive scanned books category essays by jonathan swift category 1724 books category 1725 books
