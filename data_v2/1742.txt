tropical storm laura was a large but short lived tropical cyclone that developed over north central atlantic ocean in late september during 2008 atlantic hurricane season 12th named storm of season laura formed out of a large extratropical area of low pressure located about 1015 miles 1635 km west of azores on september 29 laura slowly developed tropical characteristics throughout day as it moved over warmer waters on afternoon of september 30 laura had acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated a tropical storm shortly after being declared tropical laura began to undergo an extratropical transition which did not fully take place until morning of october 1 laura degenerated into a post tropical cyclone later that morning and final advisory by national hurricane center was issued remnants of laura contributed to heavy rainfall and power outages in british isles netherlands and norway on october 5 to 8 meteorological history on september 26 a very large extratropical area of low pressure developed along a quasi stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of azores low intensified into equivalent of a category 1 hurricane with winds of 80 mph 130 km h at 12 00 utc on september 27 over following days low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction by september 29 low had developed sufficient convection and was declared subtropical storm laura upon being upgraded cold cloud tops began to wrap around center of laura and consolidate near center of circulation convection organized around center quickly and a satellite pass over storm revealed that it could be intensifying a later satellite pass disregarded possibility of intensification as intensity was confirmed to be at 60 mph 95 km h overall structure of laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics during afternoon satellites revealed that laura had developed a deep warm core a characteristic of a tropical cyclone but wind field remained subtropical in nature by nighttime hours radius of strongest winds contracted to 80 mi 130 km much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone however laura was still under influence of an upper level low and cloud tops remained shallow however cloud tops became colder overnight and laura was on verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by morning of september 30 but strong interaction with upper level low meant it was still subtropical despite moving over colder waters a water vapor satellite image determined that laura had separated itself from upper level low signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone laura was re classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude 40 not long after being declared tropical early signs of an extratropical transition appeared cold air began to enter storm on west side and forecast models showed laura becoming extratropical next morning and non tropical later next day right thumb laura on september 29 overnight convection associated with laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics but still retained its status early on october 1 extratropical transition was fully apparent laura remained tropical but cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around center of system with minimal shower and thunderstorm activity remaining around center of laura storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on october 1 while still producing tropical storm force winds next day remnant system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and began to re intensify as it rapidly tracked towards north early on october 3 system slowed down as it turned towards east and strengthened into a hurricane force cyclone with winds of 75 mph 120 km h after accelerating towards east another large extratropical cyclone absorbed remnants of laura while located several hundred miles west of british isles on october 4 impact thumb left tropical storm laura at peak intensity on september 30 as a tropical cyclone laura never approached land and no damages or fatalities occurred since storm remained over open waters for most of its life several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm force winds highest recorded winds were at an oil platform with call sign at 03 00 utc on october 1 winds were recorded up to 47 knots 54 mph 87 km h despite lack of impact storm s remnants were caught in an upper level jet stream and steered towards europe there they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of britain on october 5 causing localized accumulation of flood waters as a result glebe road near windermere england was closed in both directions and along road between old hutton and kirkby lonsdale previously saturated soil combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding traffic on m6 motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions one person had to be rescued from her car after driving into a flooded street uk environment agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings as a result of rainfall on october 8 remnants of laura reached netherlands at time its rain bands began interacting with a cold front associated with a well developed low west of norway dropping up to 113 mm 4 4 in of precipitation in northwestern netherlands consequently streets and homes in village of were reportedly inundated large amounts of precipitation broke daily and monthly rainfall records for october which were previously set in 2006 gradually passing through norway remnants of storm caused significant damage to electric utilities as a result more than 10 000 people lost power in southern parts of country
