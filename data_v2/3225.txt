tropical storm ana was earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in united states in any given year a relatively rare pre season system ana was first tropical storm of 2015 atlantic hurricane season it developed as a subtropical cyclone from a non tropical low north of bahamas and intensified to attain peak winds of before transitioning into a fully tropical cyclone early on may 9 sustained in part by warm waters of gulf stream ana made landfall along northeast coast of south carolina early next morning becoming earliest u s landfalling system on record overall damage from storm was minor heavy rainfall and gusty winds affected parts of carolinas and some vulnerable beaches endured coastal flooding and several feet of erosion gusty winds damaged trees and powerlines causing sporadic power outages and a weak tornado was reported in association with ana in north carolina two deaths one direct and one indirect were attributed to storm meteorological history in first week of may 2015 a strong cold front became stationary to north of greater antilles where warm ocean waters dissipated temperature gradient across front western section of front drifted westward as a surface trough of low pressure arriving at bahamas by may 5 trough was attended by an expanse of showers and thunderstorms extending from northwestern caribbean sea to southern florida a sharp mid to upper level trough interacted with system and facilitated gradual cyclogenesis and early on may 6 a distinct non tropical center of low pressure developed off southeastern florida tracking slowly toward north over next two days system showed signs of increased organization and a hurricane hunter aircraft found tropical storm force winds to north and west of center on may 7 with development of deep convection system was classified subtropical storm ana at 00 00 utc on may 8 while situated about to south southeast of myrtle beach south carolina due to its involvement with upper trough as well as its large wind field system was considered subtropical as opposed to fully tropical newly designated storm drifted toward northwest caught in an upper air blocking pattern that yielded weak steering currents dry air within its circulation initially kept ana weak with sparse thunderstorm activity however warm waters of gulf stream coupled with atmospheric instability resulting from cold temperatures aloft enabled formation of curved banding features near storm s core at same time wind field constricted indicating an imminent transition to a fully tropical storm late on may 8 ana attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 998 mbar by next morning most of convection on storm s periphery dissipated with persistent thunderstorms near center and favorable anticyclonic outflow ana became a tropical storm about to southeast of myrtle beach right thumb infrared satellite loop of ana moving ashore on may 10 dry air and northwesterly wind shear plagued system keeping strongest thunderstorms confined to eastern side of circulation despite an improved presentation on satellite and radar imagery on may 9 wind speeds remained about same that night storm accelerated slightly toward north northwest and gradually weakened as it approached land diminished by cooler waters of continental shelf ana made landfall along coast of south carolina near north myrtle beach at around 10 00 utc on may 10 over land storm turned toward north in advance of an approaching trough it weakened to a tropical depression on afternoon of may 10 system maintained well defined rainbands as it curved northeastward passing through eastern north carolina and into southeastern virginia by evening of may 11 after degenerating into a remnant low by 00 00 utc on may 12 system emerged off coast of delmarva peninsula back into western atlantic accelerating northeastward low passed south of new england and merged with a frontal system near nova scotia late on may 12 impact and records ana was earliest atlantic subtropical or tropical cyclone since 2003 s tropical storm ana which formed on april 20 it was also earliest tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in united states a storm in 1952 was thought to have made landfall as a tropical system much earlier on february 3 but recent reanalysis efforts revealed that storm was not fully tropical until after clearing florida thumb left map of rainfall totals associated with ana across eastern united states immediately upon storm s formation on may 8 a tropical storm watch was issued for coastal locations between edisto beach south carolina and cape lookout north carolina early on may 8 watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning between mouth of south santee river in south carolina and surf city north carolina remainder of watch north of surf city was updated to a warning shortly thereafter all tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued shortly after ana made landfall ana produced a small storm surge along coasts of northeastern florida georgia and carolinas peaking at near south of myrtle beach south carolina surge and above normal tides produced minor coastal flooding as well as of beach erosion storm left road washouts in north myrtle beach and worsened a long term erosion problem along cherry grove beach shifting volumes of sand in surf city exposed structure of wrecked schooner william h sumner which grounded in 1919 and is occasionally visible along beach on may 7 heightened swells in charleston harbor drove a sailboat aground forcing coast guard to rescue stricken vessel s two occupants rip currents from storm pulled a swimmer underwater for over ten minutes off oak island man died of his injuries next day upon making landfall ana produced gusty winds and moderate to heavy rainfall in parts of carolinas storm s lopsided convection pattern yielded much higher rain totals to north of its track than to south as a general fell over eastern north carolina and extreme northeastern south carolina precipitation peaked at near kinston while north myrtle beach recorded of rain a lake in north myrtle beach rose above its banks to inundate homes and local streets more extensive freshwater flooding occurred in lenoir county north carolina where swollen southwest creek flooded its environs up to deep local fire department rescued several stranded individuals by boat when rising floodwaters isolated about 10 residences despite sporadic cases of flooding rainfall was considered beneficial having arrived during a typically dry part of year ana also caused crop damage and forced commercial growers to delay their planting dates winds gusted as high as in coastal areas of carolinas and at offshore anemometers near richlands north carolina gusty winds toppled a tree onto a roadway causing a traffic accident that left one man dead another tree in same area fell through roof of a mobile home and several flimsy structures sustained wind damage damage to electrical wires triggered scattered power outages in north carolina a waterspout developed on croatan sound in one of storm s outer bands becoming a tornado as it moved over roanoke island tornado rated ef0 on enhanced fujita scale brought down a few small trees and damaged roof of a house see also list of north carolina hurricanes list of off
