new york state route 22 ny 22 is a north south state highway that parallels eastern border of u s state of new york from outskirts of new york city to hamlet of mooers in clinton county near canadian border at it is state s longest north south route and third longest state route overall after ny 5 and ny 17 many of state s major east west roads intersect with and often join route 22 just before crossing into neighboring new england states where u s route 7 us 7 which originally partially followed ny 22 s alignment similarly parallels new york state line almost all of route 22 is a two lane rural road through small villages and hamlets exceptions are its southern end in heavily populated bronx and lower westchester county and a section that runs through city of plattsburgh near northern end rural landscape that road passes through varies from horse country and views of reservoirs of new york city watershed in northern suburbs of city to dairy farms further upstate in taconic and berkshire mountains to undeveloped heavily forested adirondack park along shores of lake champlain an section from fort ann to keeseville is part of all american road known as lakes to locks passage oldest portions of today s route 22 in westchester county and along lake champlain shoreline were native american trails dutch and after them english settlers continued to use road to get their farm products to market with southernmost portion eventually becoming white plains post road in 18th and 19th centuries in early 20th century as automobile use became widespread state paved more heavily used sections and built new roads to create current highway first designated as route 22 in 1930 in its early years highway began in manhattan until 2008 its northern end was canadian border route description route 22 starts as an urban arterial road passing through most populous communities along its route within its first after running northerly from its origin in bronx it veers slightly to northeast in vicinity of a traffic circle near kensico dam before heading northward for good as a mostly two lane rural route all way to state s north country majority of ny 22 s routing is maintained by new york state department of transportation nysdot however several sections are maintained by other jurisdictions southernmost of these is in bronx where entirety of highway within borough is maintained by new york city department of transportation nycdot in westchester county route 22 is mostly locally maintained within city of mount vernon and is county maintained within city of white plains in clinton county route is locally maintained within city of plattsburgh during its course ny 22 intersects or runs concurrently with 46 other designated routes one state parkway five interstate highways and seven u s highways not counting its own termini of surface road intersections 18 terminate at route 22 and 15 are concurrencies shared with crossing routes accounting for or 21

route 1 us 1 in eastchester section of bronx intersecting with east 233rd street about to north it soon crosses westchester county line into mount vernon and becomes south third avenue beginning a section in that county shortly after county line route 22 makes a sharp turn to east at south columbus avenue intersection soon passing st paul s church national historic site on its north then curving back to that direction it parallels nearby hutchinson river parkway as it passes through suburbs of bronxville and tuckahoe at wilson woods lake it crosses under a railroad bridge on metro

old native american path this path was later used and widened by first european settlers during colonial times road was known as road to bedford and vermont further north near lake champlain route now used by route 22 was used by st francis indians of canada as they went south to find warmer fishing areas old road was also used heavily during american revolution to transport iron south from mines in adirondacks once white plains became county seat of westchester in 1759 road between village and city of new york then encompassing only manhattan became an important route and was established as white plains post road before 1797 main road heading to points north and east out of manhattan went via kingsbridge along old boston post road a new bridge over harlem river original harlem bridge was opened in 1797 shortening route out of manhattan this also relocated boston and white plains post roads to a new alignment along third avenue and boston road white plains post road separated from boston post road in with road to boston heading east and road to white plains heading north old white plains post road roughly followed alignment of modern day white plains road which was laid out in 1863 original post road was to east of modern day avenue white plains post road continued north through wakefield and mount vernon where route shifted east to modern day white plains post road going through bronxville and scarsdale to white plains stretch from salem to vermont border in granville was part of old northern turnpike which began in lansingburgh and went along modern day ny 40

to regulate grade widen gravel and improve old white plains post road which was amended in 1870 to road between mount vernon and white plains post road south of mount vernon which was part of new york city was later widened between 1902 and 1908 state highways were first formally defined by state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations although these initial designations were not publicly signed portions of modern route 22 were defined as part of legislative routes 1 and 22 legislative route 1 went from new york city line north along white plains post road to white plains then detoured to harrison via westchester avenue before proceeding north to armonk via modern ny 120 legislative route 1 continued north along modern ny 22 to austerlitz where it then turned northwest to valatie via modern ny 203 and ny then followed us 9 to albany legislative route 22 had two segments southern segment began in troy following ny 7 to hoosick then went north along modern ny 22 up to

pictures but with an additional black border letters ny above numbers and a different typeface for numbers themselves in 1924 new york signed several major state roads with route numbers most of legislative route 1 was designated as ny 22 but with a direct route between white plains and armonk also instead of continuing to valatie ny 22 initially ended at ny 23 intersection in hillsdale by 1929 road to valatie had been improved and ny 22 was extended to us 9 with a length of middle section of modern ny 22 was designated in 1924 as ny 24 running for from stephentown to comstock portion of modern ny 22 north of whitehall remained unnumbered in 1924 but next year ny 30 a route assigned in 1924 that linked mechanicville to whitehall was extended north from whitehall to canadian border north of mooers in 1930 renumbering ny 24 and ny 30 designations were both reassigned elsewhere ny 22 was then extended north along their former routes incorporating newly improved roads between austerlitz and stephentown creating route that existed until 2008 segment of old ny 22 between austerlitz and valatie was renumbered to ny 203 left thumb view down lenox avenue from west 124th street

extended south from mount vernon line in bronx along white plains road then following east 233rd street to webster avenue until fordham road us 1 from there it continued south along grand concourse then overlapped with ny 100 crossing into manhattan via east 149th street to 145th street bridge in manhattan ny 22 100 concurrency continued south along lenox avenue 110th street fifth avenue 96th

city via east 233rd street as before on january 1 1970 ny 22 designation was removed from manhattan and most of bronx and short piece remaining in city was realigned to meet us 1 at route 22 s current southern terminus u s route 7 in original plan for u s highway system as approved by bureau of public roads in november 1926 us 7 was defined as beginning in new york city and designated on alignment of ny 22 to amenia where it shifted northeast into sharon connecticut to use old new england route 4 through massachusetts and vermont all way to canadian border apparently new york did not approve this plan and by mid 1927 official route log published by american association of state highway officials had relocated southern end of us 7 to norwalk connecticut state route 9n concurrency in 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york stretch from ticonderoga to keeseville now concurrent with ny 9n was designated solely as route 22 north end of ny 47 was also located at an intersection with route 22 in ticonderoga at westport ny 22 connected to ny 195 an east west highway leading to elizabethtown at time route 9n only extended from there to keeseville ny 9n was extended southward to lake george supplanting routes 47 and 195 and becoming concurrent with ny 22 between ticonderoga and westport ny 8 originally extended eastward from hague to a ferry across lake champlain at putnam when it was assigned as part of renumbering in between two locations route utilized modern ny 9n montcalm street ny 22 and wrights ferry and wrights roads it was realigned in early 1930s to continue east from ticonderoga on what is now ny 74 to another ferry across lake ny 8 was altered again to follow ny 22 north from ticonderoga to crown point where it turned off highway onto bridge road now ny 185 route
