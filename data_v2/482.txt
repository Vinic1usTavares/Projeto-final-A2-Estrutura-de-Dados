protest songs and it has been covered by over a dozen artists it was named 272nd greatest song by rolling stone on their list of 500 greatest songs of all time writing and recording sunday bloody sunday grew from a guitar riff and lyric written by edge in 1982 while newlyweds bono and ali hewson honeymooned in jamaica edge worked in ireland on music for band s upcoming album following an argument with his girlfriend and a period of doubt in his own song writing abilities edge feeling depressed channelled his fear and frustration and self loathing into a piece of music mccormick 2006 pp 135 139 this early draft did not yet have a title or chorus melody but did contain a structural outline and theme after bono had reworked lyrics band recorded song at windmill lane studios in dublin during sessions producer steve lillywhite encouraged drummer larry mullen jr to use a click track but mullen was firmly against idea a chance meeting with andy newmark of sly family stone a drummer who used a click track religiously changed mullen s mind opening drum pattern soon developed into song s hook a local violinist steve wickham approached edge one morning at a bus stop and asked if u2 had any need for a violin on their next album in studio for only half a day wickham s electric violin became final instrumental contribution to song direct impetus for lyrics was an encounter with ira supporters in new york city as a promotional gimmick u2 manager paul mcguinness had made arrangements for band to appear in 1982 st patrick s day parade however he later found that there was a possibility that bobby sands an ira hunger striker who had starved to death previous year would be parade s honorary marshal as they felt that ira s tactics were prolonging fighting in northern ireland mcguinness and band members mutually decided they should withdraw from parade mcguinness met with one of parade s organizers in a new york bar to arrange cancellation and ended up in a heated debate about ira mcguinness recalled he kept telling me to keep my voice down place was full of new york policemen irish cops and he thought i was going to get us killed drummer mullen said of song in 1983 we re into politics of people we re not into politics like you talk about northern ireland sunday bloody sunday people sort of think oh that time when 13 catholics were shot by british soldiers that s not what song is about that s an incident most famous incident in northern ireland and it s strongest way of saying how long how long do we have to put up with this i don t care who s who catholics protestants whatever you know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate and we re saying why what s point and you can move that into places like el salvador and other similar situations people dying let s forget politics let s stop shooting each other and sit around table and talk about it there are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap etc well so

minor chord territory of piece as song progresses lyrics and guitar become more furious guitar riff has been described as bone crushing arena rock riff of decade by rolling stone a bass drum kick on every beat provides musical foundation until first chorus when adam clayton s bass guitar enters in contrast to violent nature of verses emergence of major chords creates a feeling of hope during bono

parts are muted this part of song deviates musically from raw aggression seen in song s verses and gives song a more uplifting structure bono once commented that love is a central theme of sunday bloody sunday band have said lyrics refer to events of both bloody sunday in 1972 and bloody sunday in 1920 but are not specifically about either event song takes standpoint of someone horrified by cycle of violence in province bono rewrote edge s initial lyrics attempting to contrast two events with easter sunday but he has said that band were too inexperienced at time to fully realise that goal noting that it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength early versions opened with line don t talk to me about rights of ira uda u2 s bassist adam clayton recalls that better judgment led to removal of such a politically charged line and that song s viewpoint became very humane and non sectarian which is only responsible position stokes 1996 pp

were aware when they decided to record sunday bloody sunday that its lyrics could be misinterpreted as sectarian and possibly place them in danger some of edge s original lyrics explicitly spoke out against violent rebels but were omitted to protect group even without these lyrics some listeners still considered it to be a rebel song even one which glorifies events of two bloody sundays to which lyrics refer flanagan 1996 p 385 commercially single had its biggest impact in netherlands where it reached number 3 on national charts in us song gained significant album oriented rock radio airplay
