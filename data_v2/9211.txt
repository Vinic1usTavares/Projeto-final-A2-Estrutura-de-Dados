it moved quickly westward and organized developing banding features and cirrus outflow near blossoming convection wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on august 21 though its fast forward motion dislocated low level circulation from deep convection wave entered an area of dry air in central atlantic ocean and by late on august 22 most of convection dissipated from system on august 24 convection increased as wave passed through lesser antilles though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development tropical wave moved through caribbean sea and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over gulf of honduras on august 28 wave crossed yucatan peninsula and developed a surface low pressure area on 29th in gulf of mexico convection continued to organize and tropical wave developed into tropical depression eleven on august 30 while located 335 miles 540 km east southeast of corpus christi texas depression moved to northwest and intensified into tropical storm grace six hours after forming despite increase in winds center of circulation remained very broad with reconnaissance aircraft having difficulty pinpointing center in addition an upper level low located over brownsville texas produced shear over western portion of system which limited outflow to east side forecasters predicted upper level low to weaken allowing for possibility of grace to intensify to a 65 mph 100 km h tropical storm over warm waters however upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across system a new center of circulation reformed 115 miles 185 km north of original center and made landfall near san luis pass on southwestern portion of galveston island on august 31 as a minimal tropical storm grace quickly
