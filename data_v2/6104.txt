writers of day but occasionally obtained work from well known authors including isaac asimov and clifford d simak in 1952 planet stories published philip k dick s first sale and printed four more of his stories over next three years two writers most identified with planet stories are leigh brackett and ray bradbury both of whom set many of their stories on a romanticized version of mars that owed much to depiction of barsoom in works of edgar rice burroughs bradbury s work for planet included an early story in his martian chronicles sequence brackett s best known work for magazine was a series of adventures featuring eric john stark which began in summer of 1949 brackett and bradbury collaborated on one story lorelei of red mist which appeared in 1946 it was generally well received although

was not primarily a science fiction magazine but often featured storylines with marginally science fictional themes such as survivors from atlantis at end of 1939 fiction house decided to add an sf magazine to its lineup it was titled planet stories and was published by love romances a subsidiary company that had been created to publish fiction house s romance titles first issue was dated winter 1939 two comics were launched at same time jungle comics and planet comics both were published monthly whereas planet stories was quarterly and it is quite likely that success of comics funded early issues of pulps ashley time machines pp 151 152 malcolm reiss edited planet stories from beginning and retained editorial oversight and control throughout its run though he was not always named editor

alexander leydenfrost planet stories was one of magazines to make bug eyed monster or bem a staple of science fiction art kyle pictorial history p 96 fiction house apparently made decision to launch planet stories so quickly that there was little time for reiss to obtain new stories so he worked with julius schwartz and other authors agents to fill first issue results were unremarkable but reiss was energetic and was able to improve quality of fiction in succeeding issues though he occasionally apologized to readers for printing weak material magazine was exclusively focused on interplanetary adventures often taking place in primitive societies that would now be regarded as sword and sorcery settings and was aimed at a young readership result was a mixture of what became known as space opera and planetary romances melodramatic tales of action and adventure on alien planets and in interplanetary space planet stories relied on a few authors to provide bulk of its fiction in early years with nelson bond providing eight lead stories some of them novels fourteen more were written by ray cummings and ross rocklynne and leigh brackett was also a regular contributor with seventeen stories in total published over lifetime of magazine letter column in planet stories was titled it was very active with long letters from an engaged readership it often printed letters from established writers and from fans who would go on to become well known professionally damon knight s letters are described by sf historian mike ashley as legendary and robert silverberg commented in a letter in summer 1950 issue that ray bradbury certainly gets some original ideas if not good ones ashley transformations p 47 editors put a good deal of effort into keeping letter column friendly and lively contemporary writer and editor robert lowndes recalls that reiss was sincere and urbane wilbur peacock enjoyed taking his coat off and being one of crowd ashley history of science fiction

stories on a romanticized version of mars that owed much to barsoom of edgar rice burroughs brackett s writing improved during 1940s from formulaic pulp adventure to a more mature style and she became most accomplished writer of planetary romances of her day she wrote a well received series of stories featuring adventurer eric john stark which began in summer 1949 planet stories with queen of

reprinted from june 28 1952 issue of collier s weekly bradbury s work in planet stories is regarded by one pulp historian tim de forest as magazine s most important contribution to genre several other well known writers appeared in planet stories including isaac asimov clifford simak james blish fredric brown and damon knight asimov s story originally titled pilgrimage appeared in 1942 asimov had been unable to sell piece elsewhere and rewrote it numerous times for different editors adding a religious element at john campbell s request and removing it again when malcolm reiss asked for further

sf though he had primarily written western fiction in his short tenure he did much to improve magazine persuading established writers to produce better material and finding unusual variations on interplanetary adventure theme such as poul anderson s duel on syrtis in march 1951 about an earthman tracking an alien on mars and theodore sturgeon s on planet x about aliens who kidnap earth women ashley transformations pp 11 12 after bixby s departure in 1952 planet stories major contribution to genre was discovery of philip k dick whose first sale beyond lies wub appeared in july 1952 issue

planet stories by kelly freas showing sexual dimorphism mentioned by harry harrison and also showing new cover logo that was adopted from spring 1947 stories clearly targeted a young readership and simultaneous launch in 1939 of planet comics may have been instrumental in attracting young readers to science fiction but ashley suggests that it is more likely that planet stories attracted experienced readers of genre who still yearned for early days of sf critic and sf historian thomas clareson has commented that planet seemed to look backward towards 1930s and earlier an impression that was strengthened by extensive use of interior artwork by frank paul who had been cover artist for early gernsback magazines in 1920s paul s distinctive style was strongly associated with early years of field cover art was also melodramatic with beautiful women sometimes human sometimes princesses from other planets and threatening aliens on cover read strange adventures on other worlds universe of future centuries until end of 1946 see individual issues for convenience an online index is available at although almost every story that appeared in planet could be described as space opera there was some variety of approach to basic themes earth was sometimes threatened but more often action took place on other worlds bringing earthmen into local conflicts this often involved beautiful native princesses though romantic storylines were stereotyped in one story which appeared in fall 1940 carl selwyn s venus has green eyes venusian princess is dissuaded from her hatred of humans when hero seizes her and kisses her she slaps him but succumbs to his charm some respite from these depictions of women was provided by leigh brackett who described her own heroines as usually on bitchy side warm blooded hot tempered but and intelligent with bitchy intended as a compliment carter creation of tomorrow p 186 during world war ii it was in planet stories that a reader was most likely to come across a female character who could fight instead of merely being fought over carter creation of tomorrow p 189 sex itself had long been taboo in pulp magazines but some stories in planet depicted sexuality more directly than competing magazines would readers were not always accepting one reader in a letter in 1949 supported jettisoning taboos carter creation of tomorrow p 192 but a letter writer in 1946 objected to lorelei of red mist saying that he needed a pint of to wash dirty taste out of my mouth cover artwork generally emphasized sex as well with what sf author and critic harry harrison sardonically referred to as sexual dimorphism in space heavy functional spacesuits for men and transparent suits through which bikinis or swimsuits could be seen for women harry harrison machine as hero in holdstock encyclopedia of science fiction p 97 hannes bok contributed much of interior artwork and covers were often by allen anderson during early years later kelly freas became a frequent cover artist one of best artists to work on planet was alexander leydenfrost whose work according to clareson epitomized much of what planet stories represented in 1940s though his cover artwork was less impressive than his black and white interior illustrations jon gustafson and peter nicholls alexander leydenfrost in clute nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction p 718 artist and sf historian david hardy has described leydenfrost s black and white illustrations as almost rembrandtian in his use of light and shade david hardy art and artists in holdstock encyclopedia of
