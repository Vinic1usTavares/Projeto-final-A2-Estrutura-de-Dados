discussed his early political involvement with his father when his father oswald died london daily mail described him as a much maligned and much misunderstood political giant of his era certainly his father s political presence affected his early years but mosley reflected on this time i was born into this rather strange family and then at a certain point you get away from that whilst he has distanced himself from this period of his life misunderstanding has remained and today he carries that weight on his shoulders in a 1961 by election mosley was an election agent for union movement supporting walter hesketh um s parliamentary candidate for manchester moss side union movement choice for moss side times tuesday 26 september 1961 p 7 issue col a motor racing journalist alan henry

working for uk conservative party and hoping to become a parliamentary candidate bernie ecclestone s biographer terry lovell writes that he gave up this aspiration after being unimpressed by calibre of senior party officials he also felt his name would be a handicap and has since said if i had a completely open choice in my life i would have chosen party politics but because of my name that s impossible by late 1990s he had become a donor to labour party and a supporter of government of tony blair labour party has since decided not to accept further donations from mosley labour says it

couple went out of curiosity mosley was attracted by sport and once qualified as a barrister began teaching law in evenings to earn enough money to start racing cars himself lawrence 1989 p 13 sport s indifference to his background appealed to mosley at national level in uk mosley competed in over 40 races in 1966 and 1967 he won 12 and set several class lap records in 1968 he formed london racing team in partnership with driver chris lambert to compete in european formula two which at that time was level of racing just below formula one their cars were prepared by frank williams later a formula one team owner it was a dangerous time to race mosley s first formula two race was 1968 deutschland at hockenheim in which double world champion jim clark was killed and within two years both of mosley s 1968 teammates piers courage and chris lambert were dead in racing accidents mosley s best result that year was an eighth place at a non championship race at monza engine builder brian hart says that as a driver mosley might not have been particularly quick but he was a thinking driver he kept out of trouble and generally used his head henry 2003 p 93 mosley s team mates chris lambert and piers courage were killed in separate accidents at zandvoort circuit march engineering thumb right mosley s legal skills were frequently called on at march one example was a contract dispute with frank costin designer of novel aerodynamics of march 711 seen here lawrence 1989 p 57 in 1969 after two large accidents due to breakages on his lotus car mosley decided that it was evident that i wasn t going to be world champion and retired from driving he was already working with robin herd alan rees and graham coaker to establish racing car manufacturer march engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters name march is an acronym based on initials of founders m stands for mosley like other founders mosley put in ps2 500 of capital his father told him that company would certainly go bankrupt but it would be good training for something serious later on lawrence 1989 p 18 mosley played a key role in publicising new outfit although march had few resources and limited experience firm announced ambitious plans to enter formula one pinnacle of single seater racing in 1970 team had initially intended to enter a single car but by beginning of season partly due to deals made by mosley number of march cars entered for their first formula one race had risen to five two of these were run by march s own in house works team and rest by customer teams lawrence 1989 pp 22 27 mosley also negotiated sponsorship from tyre maker firestone and oil additive manufacturer stp lawrence 1989 pp 23 30 new operation was initially successful in formula one march cars won three of their first four races one of these was a world championship race 1970 spanish grand prix won by reigning world champion jackie stewart in a customer car run by tyrrell racing as a result march finished third in 1970 constructors championship factory also sold 40 cars to customers in various lower formulae despite these successes organisation got into financial difficulty almost immediately formula one operation was costing more than customer car business was making march works team s contract with its lead driver chris amon was expensive and mosley in his own words tried at every opportunity to get rid of him lawrence 1989 p 34 he reasoned that stewart s highly competitive customer car was enough to show march in a good light amon stayed to end of year but mosley succeeded in restructuring his contract saving company some much needed money henry 1989 p 40 at end of season mosley successfully demanded full control of finances including factory run by coaker who left shortly afterwards mosley and herd borrowed ps20 000 from relatives and friends to support company into its second year according to lovell money came from mosley s half brother jonathan guinness lovell 2004 p 119 tyrrell started making its own cars towards end of 1970 and march s 1971 program in formula one was much reduced with no recognised front running driver firestone and stp sponsorship was insufficient and mosley failed to attract a large backer for 1971 motorsport author mike lawrence has suggested that shortfall forced him into short term deals which maintained cashflow but were not in best long term interests of company lawrence 1989 p 46 mosley negotiated a deal for team to use alfa romeo engines in a third car bringing much needed funding engines proved uncompetitive and his hopes of an ongoing partnership with italian automobile manufacturer were not met lawrence 1989 pp 54 59 nonetheless march again finished third in constructors championship and works driver ronnie peterson in a cosworth dfv powered car was second in drivers championship march s financial woes continued company had lost ps71 000 at end of 1971 mosley and rees disagreed over how to rectify situation and rees left march early in 1972 henry 1989 p 64 thumb left mosley pushed for unusual six wheeled march 2 4 0 designed by robin herd to be built because of its significant aerodynamic and other advantages car never raced however sales of models of car are said to make it most profitable car company ever made march was more successful in selling large numbers of customer cars in lower formulae mosley organised extensive test sessions for 1971 cars for journalists and drivers and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for season rather than buying them outright losing money on a deal to supply jochen neerpasch then motorsport manager at ford with a formula two car paid off when neerpasch moved to bmw and offered march an exclusive deal to use bmw s formula two engine for 1973 season lawrence 1989 p 70 march cars powered by bmw engines won five of next 11 european formula two championships lawrence 1989 pp 238 251 however bmw also put pressure on herd to concentrate on formula two programme as a result he spent less time with formula one team where mosley started to act as a race engineer although march considered quitting formula one on several occasions money was always found to support at least one car motorsport historian mike lawrence credits mosley with pressing for a six wheeled march to be built as a draw for sponsors having seen popularity with fans of tyrrell s six wheeled p34 resulting march 2 4 0 never competed in formula one but generated required publicity and a model was profitable lawrence 1989 pp 113 115 mosley spent much of his time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling marches to other formula one teams such as williams and penske cars were rarely frontrunners although works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976 by end of 1977 mosley was fed up with struggle to compete in formula one with no resources and left to work for foca full time selling his shares in company to herd but remaining as a director march s involvement in formula one ended same year lawrence 1989 p 122 formula one constructors association from 1969 mosley was invited to represent march at grand prix constructors association which negotiated joint deals on behalf of its member teams although new march organisation was not popular with established teams mosley has said that when they went along to meetings to discuss things such as prize money they felt they ought to take me along because i was a lawyer lawrence 1989 p 33 he was unimpressed with standard of negotiations our side all went in a group because no one trusted anyone else and all were afraid that someone would break ranks and make a private deal in 1971 british businessman bernie ecclestone bought brabham team and mosley recalls that formula one constructors association foca was created in 1974 by ecclestone colin chapman teddy mayer mosley ken tyrrell and frank williams foca would represent commercial interests of teams at meetings with commission sportive internationale csi a commission of fia and motorsport s world governing body csi later became federation internationale du sport automobile fisa motorsport s world governing body after leaving march at end of mosley officially became legal advisor to foca which was led by ecclestone in his biography of ecclestone terry lovell suggests that he appointed mosley to this role not only because of his legal ability but also because he saw in mosley necessary diplomatic and political skills that made him perfectly suited to establishment of fia lovell 2004 p 107 federation internationale de l automobile fia founded in 1904 was fisa s parent body representing road car users worldwide in same year mosley was nominated for a role at fia s bureau permanent international de d automobile bpica his nomination was blocked by french italian and german manufacturers lovell 2004 pp 105 107 in early 1980s mosley represented foca in fisa foca war a conflict between foca representing mainly uk based independent teams and fisa which was supported by grandee constructors owned by road car manufacturers primarily alfa romeo ferrari and renault in 1980 foca announced its own world federation of motor sport and ran non championship 1981 south african grand prix staging of this event with worldwide television coverage helped persuade jean marie balestre fisa president that fisa would have to negotiate a settlement with foca as mosley has since commented we were absolutely if balestre could have held manufacturer s support for a little bit longer constructors would have been on their knees outcome would then have been very different lovell 2004 p 142 mosley helped draw up concorde agreement a document which resolved dispute by essentially giving fisa control of rules and foca control of commercial and television rights most recent version of concorde agreement expired on 31 december 2007 and a new one was being discussed as of 2008 in 1982 year after first concorde agreement was signed mosley left his role at foca and formula one to work for conservative party lovell 2004 pp 230 231 fisa presidency mosley returned to motorsport in 1986 with support of ecclestone and balestre to become president of fisa manufacturers commission successor body to bpica with a seat on fisa world council that same year he established simtek research a racing technical consultancy firm with nick wirth a former march employee he sold his share of simtek in 1991 when elected president of fisa lovell 2004 pp 230 231 245 246 according to lovell in 1987 mosley suggested to balestre that he could deal with his problems with ecclestone by mak ing him a member of establishment later that year ecclestone was appointed a vice president of fia with responsibility for promotional affairs with authority over formula one and other motor sports authorised by fia lovell 2004 pp 226 227 in 1991 mosley challenged balestre for presidency of fisa mosley said that his decision to challenge frenchman was prompted by balestre s reported intervention on behalf of his countryman alain prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified brazilian driver ayrton senna from 1989 japanese grand prix howell 9 october 1991 lovell 2004 p 242 mosley campaigned on basis that balestre who was also president of fia and of federation francaise du sport automobile could not effectively manage all these roles together he also said that no one challenged balestre because they were afraid of consequences and suggested that fisa president should not interfere with f1 which could be left to run itself mosley won fisa presidency by 43 votes to 29 balestre remained as fia president mosley resigned a year later fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re affirmation of his mandate i wanted to show people that i do what i say he said now they can judge me in a year s time howell 10 october 1991 fisa immediately re elected him lovell 2004 p 244 fia presidency thumb right 200px three times wtcc champion andy priaulx wearing hans device now mandated in fia championships 1993 1997 in 1993 mosley agreed with balestre that frenchman would stand down as president of fia in mosley s favour in return for new role of president of fia senate to be created after mosley s election as well as motorsport fia s remit includes interests of motorists worldwide an area in which mosley wanted to involve himself that is what really interested me in f1 you maybe save one life every five years whereas in road safety you are talking about thousands of lives lovell 2004 pp 247 248 a challenge to mosley s election by jeffrey rose chairman of british royal automobile club was withdrawn when it became clear that majority of voters were already committed to mosley fisa was then merged into fia as its sporting arm after deaths of drivers ayrton senna and roland ratzenberger at 1994 san marino grand prix worldwide media attention focused on charismatic triple world champion senna rather than ratzenberger a virtual unknown driving for minor simtek team mosley did not go to senna s funeral but attended that of ratzenberger in a press conference 10 years later mosley said i went to his funeral because everyone went to senna s i thought it was important that somebody went to his in aftermath of deaths and a number of other serious accidents mosley announced formation of advisory expert group chaired by professor sid watkins to research and improve safety in motor racing watkins who learned of his new role by hearing mosley announce it on radio has called it a novel and revolutionary approach watkins 1996 pp 175 179 resulting changes included reducing capacity and power of engines use of grooved tyres to reduce cornering speeds introduction of hans device to protect drivers necks in accidents circuit re design and greatly increased requirements for crash testing of chassis mosley was criticised for some of very rapid changes announced in immediate aftermath of deaths at san marino race in 1995 a deal was signed between ecclestone and fia that passed all of commercial rights to formula one to him for 15 years on condition that they would return to fia at end of that period ecclestone had been building up formula one as a television package since early 1990s investing heavily in new digital television technology for duration of deal fia would receive an index linked annual fixed royalty estimated by lovell at around 15 mosley said my belief is that i got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long lovell 2004 pp 254 256 following year fia also passed rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to ecclestone also for 15 years an attempt to add a 10 year extension to f1 contract in return for a share in ecclestone s proposed flotation of formula one was later vetoed by european commission lovell 2004 p 269 mosley s agreement with ecclestone on tv rights for f1 angered three of team principals in particular ron dennis mclaren frank williams williams and ken tyrrell tyrrell who felt that neither ecclestone nor fia had right to make such an agreement without teams they refused to sign 1997 concorde agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under european union competition rules lovell 2004 pp 271 274 european commission was already investigating fia s agreement with ecclestone in what lovell calls a highly personal and bitter battle between max mosley and eu commissioner karel van miert lovell 2004 p 265 1997 2001 mosley was elected to his second term as president of fia in october 1997 later that year eu commission directorate general for competition made a preliminary decision against ecclestone and fia resulting warning letters from van miert to fia and ecclestone were leaked and ended attempt to float f1 fia won a case against commission for leak in 1998 lovell 2004 pp 289 292 at same time a local court in germany ruled that television rights to fia european truck racing cup passed to ecclestone by fia previous year along with all other fia authorised championships should be returned to series organiser following a complaint from german television company ae tv cooperations tv company argued that ecclestone and mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in treaty of rome following court s decision mosley appealed judgement and cancelled series until further notice on appeal court ruled that series organiser should be able to sell television rights to whoever they felt was best option for coverage and fia reinstated european truck racing cup between 1997 and 2000 mosley repeatedly warned that if any eu decision went against fia marketing organisations and f1 itself would be moved out of europe in 1999 eu commission directorate general for competition issued a statement of objections listing a number of grievances surrounding fia s dealings with ecclestone and formula one fia released statement to media and held a press conference in brussels ridiculing commission s case commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti competitive and invited fia and ecclestone s companies isc and foa to submit proposals to modify these arrangements in 2001 nine months after settlement talks had begun parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts which included ecclestone stepping down as fia s vice president of promotional affairs and fia ending all involvement in commercial activities of formula one mosley came up with an innovative way to dispose of fia s involvement in commercial activities of formula one in order to maintain ecclestone s investment to deliver digital television he proposed extending ecclestone s rights for f1 coverage to 100 years from initial 15 arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti competition as it was effectively same as an outright sale commission agreed with his assessment and in interest of impartiality mosley removed himself from negotiations which eventually returned around 300 million ps150 million fia planned to put almost all of it into a charitable foundation which will then have resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety and thus fia foundation was created in 2001 in addition fia continued to receive an annual dividend from deal mosley stated over totality of contract and on an annual basis sum we have accepted represents billions of dollars looked at from that point of view it is a huge amount of money lovell compares figure to extend rights to 100 years to ps600 million paid for rights to 2002 football world cup and ps1 1 billion british sky broadcasting paid for a three year package of english premier league football lovell 2004 pp 277 278 280 281 306 314 figure was not entirely comparable however due to dispute over who actually owned formula one before settlement with eu commission was reached mosley feared that fia was losing control over sport following a heated argument with ecclestone in paris ecclestone argued that he had built formula one into entity that it was and fia only had rights to designate event as official ecclestone threatened to do a scorched earth if another party were to gain control of commercial side of formula one mosley came up with solution in order for fia to retain its sporting management role and ecclestone to retain his commercial role thumb left from late 1960s to early 2000s f1 teams were heavily dependent on funding from cigarette companies like rothmans mosley attempted to delay european legislation to outlaw practice over same period mosley was attempting to delay european legislation banning tobacco advertising at this time all leading formula one teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands such as rothmans west marlboro and mild seven labour party had pledged to ban tobacco advertising in its manifesto ahead of its 1997 general election victory supporting a proposed european union directive labour party s stance on banning tobacco advertising was reinforced following election by forceful statements from health secretary frank dobson and minister for public health tessa jowell rawnsley 2001 pp 91 94 ecclestone appealed over jowell s head to jonathan powell tony blair s chief of staff who arranged a meeting with blair ecclestone and mosley both labour party donors met blair on 16 october 1997 mosley argued that proposed legislation was illegal by eu rules that formula one needed more time to find alternative sources of funding and that prompt introduction of a ban would lead to races being held outside europe while coverage including tobacco logos would still be broadcast into eu lovell 2004 pp 330 343 he also argued that on 4 november fiercely anti tobacco jowell argued in brussels for an exemption for formula one media attention initially focused on labour bending its principles for a glamour sport and on false trail of jowell s husband s links to benetton formula one team on 6 november correspondents from three newspapers enquired whether labour had received any donations from ecclestone he had donated ps1 million in january 1997 on 11 november labour promised to return money on advice of sir patrick neill on 17 november blair apologised for his government s mishandling of affair and stated decision to exempt formula one from tobacco sponsorship was taken two weeks later it was in response to fears that britain might lose industry overseas to asian countries who were bidding for it revised directive went into force in june 1998 and banned sponsorship from 2003 with a further three year extension for global sports such as formula one on 5 october 2000 directive was overturned in european court of justice on grounds that it was unlawful a new tobacco advertising directive took effect in july 2005 financial times described mosley as furious that this was a year earlier than provided for under 1998 directive as of 2009 ferrari is only f1 team to retain tobacco sponsorship although team carries no explicit branding in races because of european legislation although fia moved its headquarters out of eu in 1999 it returned in 2001 all of f1 teams remain in europe and six are in uk compared to seven of eleven at end of 1997 thumb right mosley considered use of f1 to promote euro ncap testing of cars his most enduring achievement as fia president asked in a 2003 interview about his most enduring achievement as president of fia mosley replied i think using formula one to push encap crash testing european new car assessment programme euro ncap is a european car safety performance assessment programme that originated with work done by transport research laboratory for uk department for transport fia became involved in programme in 1996 taking a lead in promoting it and mosley chaired body from its launch as euro ncap in 1997 to 2004 despite what ncap describes as a strong negative response from car manufacturers at first initiative has expanded and ncap says that there has been a clear increase in safety of modern cars as a result eu commission in 2000 stated that had become single most important mechanism for achieving advances in vehicle safety and most cost effective road safety action available to eu mosley has continued to promote matter through his membership of initiatives such as cars 21 european commission s policy group aimed at improving worldwide competitiveness of european automotive industry in february 2001 mosley announced his intention to stand again for presidency in october of that year saying that if successful this third term would be his last 2001 2005 thumb right formula one fans at controversial 2005 united states grand prix holding a banner with words blame mosley mosley was elected to his third term as president of fia in 2001 from 2000 formula one saw return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers who feared that under ecclestone s management f1 coverage would go to pay television reducing value of their investment in 2001 grand prix manufacturers association gpma announced an alternative world championship grand prix world championship to start by 2008 gpma stipulated that championship should not be regulated by fia which lovell believes was because organisation believed mosley was too close to ecclestone lovell 2004 pp 357 361 proposed championship came to nothing and gpma later became formula one teams association fota in june 2004 mosley announced that he would step down from his position in october of that year one year early saying i no longer find it either satisfying or interesting to sit in long meetings i have achieved in this job everything i set out to one month later he rescinded his decision after fia senate called for him to stay on according to a bbc sport profile many insiders considered that announcement and mosley s public disagreements with ecclestone were just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over sport ron dennis mclaren team principal suggested that it arose because mosley s proposals for formula one met opposition in 2004 mosley said he felt ferrari s then team principal jean todt should succeed him as president of fia when he stepped down 2005 united states grand prix was run with only six cars after michelin tyres used by other 14 cars proved unsafe for circuit a proposal involving addition of a temporary chicane to slow cars through fastest corner of circuit was suggested but rejected by mosley he stated his reasons for not agreeing to chicane formula one is a dangerous activity and it would be most unwise to make fundamental changes to a circuit without following tried and tested procedures what happened was bad but can be put right this is not true of a fatality he continued formula one is a sport which entertains it is not entertainment disguised as sport mosley gave three possible solutions for michelin runners to use qualifying tyres but change them whenever necessary on safety grounds to use a different tyre to be provided by michelin or to run at reduced speed these were all rejected by michelin shod teams paul stoddart owner of minardi team who ran on bridgestone tyres was prepared to compromise to accommodate michelin teams even though a reduced field would guarantee his team much needed points and was particularly vocal in his criticism and renewed his calls for mosley to resign 2005 2009 mosley was elected unopposed to his fourth term as president of fia in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to road safety and motorsport mosley was made a chevalier dans l ordre de la legion d honneur in 2006 legion d honneur legion of honour is france s highest decoration for outstanding achievements in military or civil life a chevalier knight is fifth class continuing a theme of his presidency in 2006 mosley called for formula
