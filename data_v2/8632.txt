according to band drummer paul thomson most of material on album had been written and demoed at sausage studio and black pudding band recalled having about five or six sessions of recording instead of recording all music at once they sought out to record different batches of songs over a period of time kapranos described album direction as forward and revealed that band decided to keep a low profile about things as their last album was tainted by misinformation prior to its release regarding lyrics kapranos said idea of cynic s search for optimism and sceptic s search for a manual crop up here and there i ve always liked lead character in alasdair gray s lanark growing hard scales to defend soft inner self from world socially awkward asthmatic with a self consuming imagination my 19 year old self was electrified maybe album is about how to shed those scales album title kapranos had talked about background of album title in a documentary about album i think when you name a record you have to choose something which you feel reflects record or that collection of songs you also want to choose something that reflects not just mood of record but mood of people who made it mood of those people when they recorded it and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas but right thoughts right words right action seemed to sum it up best it s probably most positive record we ve made and band have been yeah most optimistic we ve been since before we had any encounter with music industry probably because we ve been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much production and composition for right thoughts right words right action franz ferdinand collaborated with other artists for parts of album hot chip band members joe goddard and alexis taylor produced opening track right action and co produced final track goodbye lovers and friends norwegian dj todd terje co produced tracks evil eye and stand on horizon and peter bjorn and john band member bjorn yttling produced treason animals and co produced universe expanded all tracks on album were written by alex kapranos and nick mccarthy with additional writing from bob hardy on right action and universe expanded as well as alexander ragnew on bullet kapranos also co produced majority of album under pseudonym prince house rabbit with exception of right action and treason animals right thoughts right words right action features indie rock dance punk and disco rock throughout opening line to right action was inspired by a postcard alex kapranos had found in london which featured phrase come home practically all is nearly forgiven following line right thoughts right words right action was thought of as a great response to former by kapranos evil eye is about evil eye and all seeing eye which are things that kapranos was very interested about guitar riff to love illumination was created by kapranos and originally thought of as too rocky by nick mccarthy but he later claimed that he enjoyed playing it song was fully written and recorded during a weekend session at mccarthy s sausage studio kapranos explained meaning of song by stating we all feel as sensitive to satisfaction at times we can look outside us and see nothing but destruction avarice and boredom so we look to find that love where we can find it some people look to hollywood some people look to blackpool and bright lights of blackpool that s probably where i would look stand on horizon was labeled by kapranos as something neither franz ferdinand or todd terje co producer of song have done before he also called ending of song a beautiful uplifting piece of music for fresh strawberries band called upon roxanne clifford of veronica falls to provide additional vocals for song band originally wanted a falsetto section for song but they were not able to reach necessary high notes themselves which is why they wanted clifford to provide vocals idea for universe expanded comes from theory of universe expansion kapranos calls song both heartbreaking and funny at same time song also features a heartbeat for a kick drum and scratches of stubble for hi hats album

adam silverstein commends that more often than not right thoughts right words right action is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction commenting on band s future he says that half sorry half bitter goodbye lovers friends is probably not franz ferdinand s very last act even if kapranos proclaiming in final seconds but this really is end would make one awesome blowout although after delivering a record as good as this they can take as long as they want at a v club annie zaleski wrote positively of musical differences between many of this album s tracks compared to band s prior work adding admittedly these more nuanced right thoughts right words right action sounds aren t as easily accessible it s much easier to gravitate toward more familiar raucous post punk bullet right action or clash reminiscent punk funk of evil eye but by expanding its worldview franz ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity writing for mojo victoria segal says that franz ferdinand remain in robust good health athletic aesthetes who have yet to break their stride there s no great leap forward here but spring in their step is unmistakable all present all correct at alternative press reed fischer called title resolute and said that fortunately his cruelty translates into charming melodies here that almost excuse long wait for them conversely tim stegall in austin chronicle wrote t he satisfaction appears sonic alone not a song sticks it s sheer style that carries this disc caleb caldwell for slant magazine wrote more or less scottish answer to american bands like interpol and strokes franz ferdinand with their du jour cool and deft combination of insular art flair and dance floor populism was hailed by british hype machine new musical express as dawn of a new rock revolution band s blue appeal however started to slip after 2009 s overly serious concept album tonight franz ferdinand four years later zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with suspenders and banjos but franz ferdinand s right thoughts right words right action is an unapologetically swaggering disco rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome
