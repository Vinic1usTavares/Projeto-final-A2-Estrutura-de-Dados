adopting a more straightforward harder rock sound and an emphasis on stage theatrics they became band kiss in early 1973 history rainbow origins of band trace to 1970 when bassist gene klein and keyboardist brooke ostrander recruited lead guitarist stephen coronel a childhood friend and former bandmate of klein group took name rainbow shortly thereafter coronel recommended rhythm guitarist stanley eisen who had actually been rejected by group after a previous audition shortly after eisen joined ostrander recruited drummer joe davidson and first rainbow lineup was completed davidson s stay did not last long and he was replaced by drummer tony zarrella in early 1971 rainbow played its first show which consisted of two sets performed at richmond community college in staten island after show group discovered that there was already another band called rainbow they decided to drop name and came up with name wicked lester which klein liked because it was unusual while decision to change group s name came partly out of a desire to avoid any potential legal issues it also reflected klein and eisen s desire to start playing more original compositions crossroads during their brief existence wicked lester performed in public twice first show took place at rivoli theatre in south new york on april 23 1971 second in late summer 1971 was at an atlantic city new jersey hotel hosting a b nai b rith youth organization event not long after that show band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen after a chance meeting with electric lady studios engineer ron johnsen wicked lester was given opportunity to record some demos in late 1971 johnsen who produced demo tape shopped it to a few labels with no success eventually tape was screened by epic records who purchased masters and agreed to fund recording of a full album one of conditions however was that stephen coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist coronel was replaced by session musician ron leejack and group continued their efforts to finish album some songs were completely re recorded to accommodate leejack s different playing style entire recording process which followed a haphazard schedule took nearly a year to complete when completed album was presented to don ellis epic s a r director he stated that he hated album and was not going to release it next day wicked lester manager lew linet requested and received group s release from epic records kiss at this time klein and eisen now using stage names gene simmons and paul stanley decided that one of reasons for wicked lester s lack of success was their lack of a singular image and musical vision they made decision to move forward and start a new band wicked lester began auditioning for a drummer tony
