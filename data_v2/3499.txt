pokiri or kick go without expectations and you will be entertained karthik pasupulate of times of india gave film 3 out of 5 stars and felt that film is designed for hardcore mega fans and it makes no bones about it he added clearly there are a lot of prospective hooting opportunities for die hard ram charan fans as for other kind of audience well you ll have to ask them we suspect they might just
