tricolored bat perimyotis subflavus is a species of native to eastern north america formerly known as eastern pipistrelle based on errant belief that it was closely related to european pipistrellus species closest known relative of tricolored bat is now recognized as canyon bat its common name tricolored bat derives from coloration of hairs on its back which have three distinct color bands it is smallest bat species in eastern and midwestern us with individuals weighing only this species mates in fall before hibernation though due to sperm storage females do not become pregnant until spring young are born helpless though rapidly develop flying and foraging for themselves by four weeks old it has a relatively long lifespan and can live nearly fifteen years in summer females roost in small groups and males roost solitarily in tree foliage or beard lichen it eats a diverse array of insects foraging with a slow erratic flight and navigating via echolocation though once considered one of most common bat species in its range its populations have declined rapidly since 2006 with introduction of fungal disease white nose syndrome it was listed as an endangered species in 2012 in canada and has been petitioned for inclusion on us endangered species list along with silver haired bat tricolored bat is one of two bat species whose rabies variants have most frequently been implicated in human rabies deaths in us with sixteen deaths from 1958 2000 taxonomy thumb a tricolored bat tricolored bat was described as a new species in 1832 by french zoologist frederic cuvier who placed it in genus vespertilio with a scientific name of vespertilio subflavus holotype had been collected in us state of georgia by american naturalist john le conte in 1897 american zoologist gerrit smith miller placed it in genus pipistrellus for first time as a result of its physical similarities to other members of genus its common name was thus eastern pipistrelle in 1984 its status was reviewed with h menu concluding that it was more similar in appearance to species in genus myotis rather than pipistrellus erecting a new genus for taxon perimyotis name perimyotis means around myotis alluding to its similarities with genus this classification was not immediately accepted however with a 1985 study instead grouping it and canyon bat into genus and a 1987 publication maintaining that tricolored bat was part of pipistrellus genus though they listed perimyotis as one of seven subgenera however in 2003 a genetic study concluded that tricolored bat was distinct from pipistrellus species and canyon bat confirming validity of genus perimyotis usage of scientific name perimyotis subflavus is widely accepted as of 2019 its common name was changed from eastern pipistrelle to tricolored bat to reflect its revised classification a 2010 study found that sister taxon of tricolored bat is canyon bat with authors suggesting that these two genera form a tribe though declining to name and formally describe tribe instead they referred to it as group which they gave as most basal member of a clade that also included following tribes and another unnamed tribe referred to as group including and its species name subflavus means a little less than yellow meaning yellowish or pale yellow four subspecies are recognized p s clarus baker 1954 p s floridanus davis 1957 p s subflavus cuvier 1832 p s ward 1891 description tricolored bat has blond fur that is distinctly tricolored on its back individual hairs tricolored dark gray at base buffy yellowish brown in middle and brown or reddish brown at tip it is smallest bat species found in eastern and midwestern us individuals have a forearm length of and weigh its forearms are reddish contrasting sharply with black membranes of its wings its wingspan is it has a dental formula of for a total of 34 teeth biology and ecology reproduction and life cycle tricolored bat is a seasonal breeder with copulation mating occurring in fall before hibernation ovulation does not occur until spring however and females store males sperm in their uteruses through winter gestation pregnancy length is about forty four days with females giving birth in june or july litter size is typically two individuals as newborns combined mass of twin pups can be as great as 58 of mother s postpartum mass at birth young lack fur and their eyes are closed mother leaves offspring behind at roost while she forages at night offspring develop rapidly beginning to fly at three weeks old by four weeks old they are foraging for themselves young do not reach sexual maturity in their first fall they do not breed until their second fall individuals can live at least 14 8 years in wild juveniles have higher mortality rates than adults and females have higher mortality rates than males behavior during summer tricolored bat will roost in tree foliage or buildings with females alone or in maternity colonies of up to thirty individuals trees used for this purpose include oak maple eastern cottonwood and american tulip tree males are solitary and do not form colonies in nova scotia researchers discovered nearly one hundred roosts of this species finding that all sampled individuals were roosting not in tree foliage but rather in a species of beard lichen usnea this was thought to be first documentation of a bat using beard lichen as a roosting substrate it was speculated that tricolored bat may use lichen to ward off parasites acid which has anti insect and anti bacterial properties naturally occurs in beard lichens and no ectoparasites external parasites have been documented on tricolored bat in nova scotia in winter tricolored bat hibernates in mines caves or other human structures a years long study of a mine in us state of nebraska found that in summer mine was mostly occupied by males total number of tricolored bats using mine at one time ranged from zero to forty three bats were in a state of torpor from november to april more bats used mine as a roost in winter than in summer in another abandoned mine in us state of indiana researchers found that tricolored bat roosts solitarily during hibernation for majority of time 96 8 of observations were singletons during hibernation males lose an average of while females lose an average of diet and foraging tricolored bat is insectivorous consuming small prey of in length prey taxa include mosquitoes beetles ants moths and cicadas it forages with slow erratic flight in areas near water or forest edges it is one of first bat species to begin foraging each night it navigates and searches for prey via echolocation sonar its echolocation calls are at a high frequency visual renderings of calls show a distinctive hook shaped call profile with lowest frequencies bottom of hook shape at 42 khz predators parasites and disease thumb tri colored bat with tell tale symptom of white nose syndrome infection tricolored bat s natural predators include northern leopard frog birds of prey raccoons snakes skunks and prairie voles feral cats will also catch and kill them as they leave their hibernacula cave or mine used for hibernation there are also records of it being attacked by hoary bat tricolored bat is host to several species of endoparasites internal parasites and ectoparasites spores of an eimeria species eimeria have been recovered from its guano feces tricolored bat has experienced severe population decline as a result of fungal disease white nose syndrome which arrived in us in 2006 with losses of 70 and greater detected in multiple us states disease kills bats by colonizing their skin during winter causing them to arouse from torpor and burn through their limited fat reserves though its population experienced dramatic reduction subsequent studies have found that their numbers may be stabilizing though hibernacula where many individuals once roosted may only host fewer than five bats or even one solitarily range and habitat tricolored bat is common throughout eastern north america with southern extent of its range in central america and northern extent in southern canada its range has expanded since 1980s with westward expansion reaching us states of colorado new mexico south dakota and wyoming additionally its range started to include great lakes basin conservation as of 2018 it is listed as a vulnerable species by iucn in 2008 however it was considered a least concern species which is iucn s lowest conservation priority in time between two assessments fungal disease white nose syndrome became widespread in eastern north america severely impacting tricolored bat historically it was one of most common bat species of eastern north america after an emergency assessment tricolored bat is considered an endangered species under committee on status of endangered wildlife in canada as of 2012 in 2016 center for biological diversity and defenders of wildlife submitted a petition to united states fish and wildlife service usfws to list tricolored bat under endangered species act of 1973 usfws determined that petition demonstrated that listing species as threatened or endangered may be warranted as of 2019 listing consideration was still under review relationship to people along with silver haired bat tricolored bat is one of two species of bat whose rabies variants are responsible for 70 of human rabies cases from bats in us additionally rabies virus variants associated with these two species caused 75 of cryptic rabies deaths in us rabies cases where exposure route is unclear and no bite history exists from 1958 2000 sixteen people in us died from rabies variant associated with tricolored bats or 46 of all nationwide indigenous not acquired elsewhere rabies fatalities tricolored bat is infrequently encountered by humans and submitted for rabies testing with only thirty one individuals tested for rabies in us in 2017 of those one 3 4 tested positive for virus see also bats of
