central park new york city where pair performed in front of more than 500 000 people proceeds went toward redevelopment and maintenance of park which had deteriorated due to lack of municipal funding concert and album marked start of a short lived reunion for paul simon and art garfunkel concept of a benefit concert in central park had been proposed by parks commissioner gordon davis and promoter ron delsener television channel hbo agreed to carry concert and worked with delsener to decide on simon and garfunkel as appropriate act for this event besides hit songs from their years as a duo their set list included material from their solo careers and covers show consisted of 21 songs though two were not used in live album among songs performed were classics sound of silence mrs robinson and boxer event concluded with a reprise of simon s song late in evening ongoing personal tensions between duo led them to decide against a permanent reunion despite success of concert and a subsequent world tour album and a film were released year after concert simon and garfunkel s performance was praised by music critics and album was commercially successful it peaked at number six on billboard 200 album charts and was certified double platinum by recording industry association of america riaa video recordings were initially broadcast on hbo and were subsequently made available on laserdisc ced vhs and dvd idea and arrangement a concert for park thumb view of stage from deep in audience new york city s central park an oasis that functions as city s green lung was in a state of deterioration in mid 1970s though central park had been designated a national historic landmark in 1962 at start of 1980s city lacked financial resources to spend an estimated us 3 000 000 to restore or even to maintain park nonprofit central park conservancy was founded in 1980 and began a successful campaign to raise renovation funds in early 1980s parks commissioner gordon davis responsible for new york city s green areas and ron delsener one of city s most influential concert promoters developed idea of helping central park financially with a free open air concert under legal guidance of bob donnelly city would use profits from merchandising television and video rights to renovate park earlier park performances by elton john and james taylor showed that this concept could be a success davis authorized project and delsener entered discussions with cable tv channel hbo to decide who would perform they decided on simon garfunkel a group that had formed in new york city in 1960s and had been one of most successful folk rock groups through late 60s early 70s simon garfunkel had broken up at height of their popularity and shortly after release of their fifth studio album bridge over troubled water which is deemed to be their artistic peak and which topped 1970 billboard charts for ten weeks they had grown apart artistically and did not get along well with each other in following eleven years both continued musical careers as solo artists and worked together only sporadically on single projects garfunkel made brief guest appearances at simon s concerts which were always successful delsener presented plan to paul simon in summer of 1981 simon was enthusiastic about idea but questioned whether it could be financially successful especially given poor audience attendance of his last project autobiographical movie one trick pony simon s confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression he questioned whether he and art garfunkel could work together but contacted garfunkel who was vacationing in switzerland garfunkel was excited about idea and immediately returned to us from promoter s viewpoint simon and garfunkel were ideal choices not only were they likely to draw a large crowd to concert they also had roots in city both had grown up and gone to school in forest hills queens music critic stephen holden pointed out that unlike artists who had left in pursuit of lifestyles offered by other locales two had always been a part of new york city both gained inspiration from cityscape and cultural variety of new york and spoke of these influences in their songs planning and rehearsals planning and rehearsals for concert took about three weeks in a manhattan theater rehearsals were characterized by past tensions that resurfaced between performers under intense time pressure paul simon later said well rehearsals were just miserable artie and i fought all time an early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance with simon allotted greater amount of time and to conclude with duo performing their joint works this idea was rejected because according to garfunkel it didn t seem right to either of us that paul should be opening act for simon garfunkel and for him to follow simon garfunkel didn t make show business sense two decided to perform most of show together with room for each to showcase some solo material simon who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for concert preparations he used live show as an opportunity to test one of his new songs in front of an audience garfunkel also planned to present a new song a heart in new york from his soon to be released album scissors cut thumb left upright michael doret poster for concert two differed on presentation of concert garfunkel wanted to recreate duo s mid 1960s live performances using only their voices backed by simon s acoustic guitar simon felt that this was impossible as an injury had rendered him incapable of playing guitar for full length of a concert and his newer material was typically arranged for larger ensembles that often included horns and amplified instruments such as electric piano and electric guitar garfunkel initially agreed to hire a second guitarist but later rejected idea a group of eleven musicians was assembled for concert most of whom were experienced studio musicians and had played on albums involving simon or garfunkel and these included billy joel s guitarist david brown guitar muscle shoals guitarist pete carr guitar anthony jackson bass guitar rob mounsey synthesizer john eckert trumpet john gatchell trumpet dave tofani saxophone gerry niewood saxophone steve gadd and grady tate drums percussion and richard tee piano https www discogs com simon garfunkel concert in central park release musical arrangements for concert were written by paul simon and david matthews some songs differed significantly from their original versions for example me and julio down by schoolyard featured more prominent latin elements and included a salsa break while folk rock kodachrome was set as a harder rock song and played together with chuck berry classic maybellene as a medley military rhythm of 50 ways to leave your lover was replaced with a latin arrangement that included brass garfunkel had difficulties in rehearsals both men easily recalled their songs from 1960s but garfunkel had to learn harmonies and arrangements for simon s solo songs as modified for reunion concert he was also uncomfortable that simon had rewritten some of lyrics for their old songs despite need to adapt to simon and his style garfunkel enjoyed some of songs and was glad to perform a duet version of simon s american tune news reports and michael doret designed posters of central park show named musicians individually and did not bill them as simon garfunkel that two singers would perform together on stage in a reunion was not officially

and again on august 8 2015 futon critic pbs special critical reception concert and recordings were positively received by music critics stephen holden praised performance in new york times day after concert he subsequently praised live album in rolling stone magazine he wrote that simon and garfunkel were successful in reviving their sound that backing band was one of finest groups of musicians ever to play together at a new york rock concert and rearrangements of simon s solo material were improvements over originals despite risks in performing so many acoustic ballads in an open air concert on a cool night songs were beautifully articulated in near perfect harmony an october 1981 review in rolling stone called concert one of finest performances of 1981 one that vividly recaptured another time an era when well crafted melodic pop bore meanings that stretched beyond musical sphere and into realms of culture and politics this reviewer noted that garfunkel s voice was noticeably restrained in high passages though still harmonious and that evening s only weak spot was kodachrome maybellene medley because neither singer could raise right level of emotion for rock songs a billboard reviewer wrote in march 1982 this 19 song two record set gloriously recaptures past with sterling renditions of most of duo s classics as well as a few of simon s solo compositions filled out by garfunkel s harmony however robert christgau of village voice dismissed album as a corporate boondoggle a classy way for warner bros artist simon to rerecord rerelease and resell catalogue cbs is sitting on he felt simon had been better off without garfunkel since 1971 and quipped live doubles are live doubles nostalgia is nostalgia wimps are wimps and who needs any of em aftermath duo were disappointed with their performance particularly garfunkel who felt that he sang poorly simon said that he did not immediately realize magnitude of event i didn t get what had happened how big it was until i went home turned on television and saw it on all news and later that night on front pages of all newspapers then i got it in may 1982 simon garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in japan germany denmark sweden switzerland netherlands ireland france great britain new zealand us and canada european leg of their tour began on may 28 1982 at stadion am berg in offenbach am main this was their first performance in germany and had an attendance of around 40 000 spectators when they were not on road duo went into studio to work on what was to be a reunion simon garfunkel album tentatively entitled think too much with garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which simon had already laid down some backing tracks they set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned north american tour but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements simon told warner brothers he could no longer work with garfunkel and that project as an s g album was cancelled thus garfunkel dropped out of project which then became simon s november 1983 solo album hearts and bones several years would pass before simon garfunkel worked together again
