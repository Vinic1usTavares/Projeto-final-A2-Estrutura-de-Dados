virgin islands dwarf sphaero virgin gorda least gecko or virgin islands dwarf gecko sphaerodactylus parthenopion is a species of gecko and also one of smallest terrestrial vertebrates it has only been found on three of british virgin islands virgin gorda tortola and moskito island also spelled mosquito island it was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of sphaerodactylus nicholsi a dwarf sphaero from nearby island of puerto rico it shares its range with big scaled least gecko s macrolepis which is found in leaf litter unlike this larger gecko virgin islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks adaptations necessary for preventing water loss which is a significant problem due to its small body size virgin islands dwarf sphaero has a deep brown colour on its upper side often with a speckling of darker scales on average it measures from its snout to its vent and is nearly as small as a u s dime at most it weighs there are several stripes or bars of lighter colouration behind eyes and at top of neck that help distinguish it there are no differences in colouration between males and females although females are slightly larger in size its tail will regenerate when broken off little is known about its population size or its biology taxonomy virgin islands dwarf sphaero also referred to as virgin islands dwarf gecko was discovered in summer of 1964 by biologist richard thomas during a collecting trip along dry wooded slopes of virgin gorda in british virgin islands holotype for sphaerodactylus parthenopion mcz was an adult female collected on 12 august 1964 on a hillside above pond bay a total of eight paratypes were collected on virgin gorda and used to describe new species classified as a species of dwarf sphaero or dwarf gecko genus sphaerodactylus it is characterised not only by its small body size but also by a distinctive scale colouration pattern on its head scales that are small but keeled having a central ridge and imbricate on its upper dorsal side a generally uniform dark colouration of dorsal side a lack of granular scales on mid dorsal area and a lack of colouration patterns around shoulders scapular region and pelvis sacral region despite striking differences in appearance s parthenopion may be most closely related to s nicholsi like diminutive s parthenopion in virgin islands s nicholsi smallest endemic in puerto rico is very small geographic range of another species s townsendi divides these two closely related populations suggesting that s townsendi evolved after s parthenopion and s nicholsi diverged description virgin islands dwarf sphaero is one of smallest known amniotes which includes 23 000 species of reptiles birds and mammals with an average body size measured as snout vent length or svl of and a maximum body mass of but ranging as low as and averaging only known amniote that is smaller is closely related s which measures and weighs a maximum of left thumb alt virgin islands dwarf sphaero is nearly as small as a u s dime typically species has a deep brown colouration on dorsal side and legs often with a scattering or a fine pattern of interconnected darker scales species has a transverse bar a line of coloured scales in front of eyes at base of snout although this can be hard to see in some individuals along each side and directly behind eyes a narrow dark edged yellow brown postocular stripe crosses temple and fades out near base of head in occipital region on top of head behind eyes an almost oval shaped dark edged yellow brown bar stretches from one side of head to other and sometimes connects with postocular stripes dark brown scales on dorsal side cross over to ventral side underside and fade out although many scales retain dark edges ventral side is light grey or cream tail is mostly yellowish brown with occasional clusters or short lines of darker scales gular throat pattern has faint to bold lines of light scales running laterally there is no sexual dichromatism in this species sexes do not differ in colour although females may be larger than males with svl of females averaging but only in males snout is moderate in length and blunt tail regenerates if broken off thumb right alt close up left profile of a virgin islands dwarf sphaero a yellow brown stripe extends behind eyes and over each temple and then fades out at base of head dorsal scales are generally small acute keeled imbricate and flattened while throat and pectoral chest scales are keeled granular bumpy scales are found on top of head and anterior neck while scales on middle of neck are keeled acute flattened and imbricate in middle of back there is some crowding and size reduction in scales and none of these scales are granular on dorsal side of tail scales are acute keeled imbricate and flattened on underside of tail scales are smooth rounded and enlarged towards centre of tail mid ventrally ventral scales are rounded smooth cycloid have a smooth outer edge and imbricate scales on ventral caudal head scales are smooth cycloid and enlarged mid ventrally count of dorsal scales from axilla armpit to groin averages 32 with a range of 30 to 35 ventral count from axilla to groin along line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29 scales around midbody average approximately 52 and range from 50 to 55 there are two and one to three usually two internasal scales there are two to three usually three scales from upper lip to eye upper labials on fourth toe of right foot there are eight or nine usually eight lamellae or plate like scales that provide traction for geckos escutcheons scales around genital region are relatively small and only slightly extend onto thighs varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width comparisons with related species s nicholsi from puerto rico is both bulkier and larger than virgin islands dwarf sphaero measuring from snout to vent it also differs in size of its dorsal scales which is reflected in scale count comparisons s nicholsi has 19 to 24 dorsal scales from axilla to groin whereas s parthenopion has 30 to 35 also s nicholsi has only 34 to 42 scales around midbody compared to 50 to 55 in s parthenopion and its ventral scales from axilla to groin range from 21 to 26 which is still less than 26 to 29 in s parthenopion s nicholsi typically has one internasal scale versus two more commonly seen in s parthenopion escutcheons are also larger in male s nicholsi on average in terms of colouration both species are very similar but s nicholsi usually has a crescent shaped pattern on its head that touches postocular stripes instead of an oval shaped pattern that may or may not reach stripes also its postocular stripes run length of its body and tail instead of ending on neck dorsolateral stripes of s nicholsi converge to make a dark edged u or y shaped pattern in sacral pelvic region majority of s nicholsi have a pattern on scapular shoulder region consisting of two small pale dots encompassed by small regions of black big scaled least gecko is significantly larger than virgin islands dwarf sphaero measuring from snout to vent it also has larger coarser scales according to thomas s macrolepis has a pattern of dark lateral stripes and dorsal spotting on a tan or light brown ground color with a boldly black edged pair of scapular spots females or a nearly uniform yellow brown body color weak or absent scapular pattern and contrasting head pattern of black vermiculations irregular wavy lines on a grey ground color or unicolor yellow or orange heads male distribution and habitat originally found only on island of virgin gorda it has since been reported on tortola and moskito island its range is sometimes estimated to encompass entire british virgin islands although original expedition by thomas did not find any specimens on tortola anegada or other smaller islands nor in united states virgin islands of saint croix saint thomas and saint john its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative s nicholsi in puerto rico another species puerto rican crested toad bufo lemur has a geographic range that includes both islands yet it has not diverged virgin islands dwarf sphaero appears to favour dry xeric scrub forests often mixed with cacti and thorny scrub on rocky hillsides it has been found at sea level although not on beach among seaweed litter or in piles of rotting palm debris in littoral zone like more abundant and larger big scaled least gecko s macrolepis with which it shares its range also unlike big scaled least gecko they do not swarm in leaf litter but are only uncommonly found hiding under rocks which are considered moist or mesic microhabitats within their dry ecological niche ecology and behaviour as with other dwarf sphaeros little is known about ecology and behaviour of virgin islands dwarf sphaero because of its high surface area to volume ratio that results from its diminutive size species was thought to be susceptible to water loss so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi arid habitat unlike desert dwelling lizards virgin islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats from size differences alone it loses water 70 faster than larger and sympatric big scaled least gecko it survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during time of year with highest precipitation and by reducing activity during driest parts of day conservation too little data has been gathered to assess population size and trend of virgin islands dwarf sphaero it has been reported as moderately common although difficult to find because of its size and ability to blend into its surroundings its distribution across british virgin islands seems to be limited and development may affect it further in early 2011 virgin islands dwarf sphaero gained international attention when sir richard branson announced plans to introduce lemurs endangered primates from madagascar to moskito island as part of a captive breeding project for conservation purposes biologists conservationists and general public quickly voiced concerns over impact that would have on native species of island in particular people feared that lemurs would wipe out local population of virgin islands dwarf sphaeros which was referred to as one of world s rarest lizards because of lemurs aggressive omnivorous behaviour other researchers instead focused on concerns about lemurs ability to thrive or pathogens they might introduce leader of branson s environmental impact assessment agreed that caution was needed with introduction even before plans to introduce lemurs were announced regarding virgin islands dwarf sphaero branson stated that concerns were misplaced because lemurs mostly eat plant material and would rarely eat geckos if at all however branson ultimately backed down stating i will keep lemurs enclosed whilst we get experts to conduct further surveys on geckos and particularly dwarf geckos if these studies indicate any real risk to these geckos we will keep lemurs enclosed references literature cited category sphaerodactylus category lizards of caribbean category fauna of british virgin islands category reptiles described in 1965
