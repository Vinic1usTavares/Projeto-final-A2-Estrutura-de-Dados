alconetar bridge spanish puente de alconetar also known as puente de mantible was a roman segmental arch bridge in extremadura region spain ancient structure which featured flattened arches with a span to rise ratio of 4 5 1 is one of earliest of its kind due to its design it is assumed that bridge was erected in early 2nd century ad by emperors trajan or hadrian possibly under guidance of apollodorus of damascus most famous architect of time almost 300 m long alconetar bridge served as a crossing point for roman via de la plata most important north south connection in western hispania over tagus longest river of iberian peninsula it presumably remained in service until reconquista after which numerous early modern reconstruction attempts by spanish engineers failed ruins which were mainly to be found on right river bank were relocated from their original position in 1970 when alcantara reservoir was created location and road access thumb 300px left location of alconetar bridge within roman road network in hispania historic alconetar bridge which should not be confused with monumental alcantara bridge further downstream spanned tagus not far from mouth of almonte in heart of spanish caceres province in extremadura region a modern motorway and a railway which cross tagus in immediate vicinity underline historical importance of this crossing point between northern and southern spain during building of alcantara dam in 1970 remains of bridge were moved from their original site to a meadow six kilometers to north close to municipality of de alconetar by contrast few traces are left of neighbouring ancient bridge over river almonte in classical period alconetar bridge was part of roman road iter ab emerita caesaraugustam that was later called via de la plata this important inner iberian connection led from provincial capital merida in south through river valleys of and tagus to north then on to western part of meseta central passing major town of salamanca its terminal point was astorga in north western spain via de la plata was one of four main routes which were established by augustus 30 bc 14 ad and his successors for military control of peninsula and for facilitating exploitation of rich spanish silver and gold mines apart from junction over tagus remains of four other ancient bridges can be found along road one over another over a third close to and a fourth over tormes in hills overlooking alconetar bridge a roman mansio with name of spanish ad was established according to then customary distance intervals it was fourth of a total number of sixteen between merida and astorga history thumb relocated remains during a flood exact construction date of puente de alconetar is unknown because of missing literary and epigraphic sources its segmental arches suggest that it was built in early 2nd century ad more specifically during reign of emperors trajan 98 117 ad or hadrian 117 138 ad as use of this arch form was typical of that era both rulers were born in southern spanish province of baetica and trajan is known to have ordered restoration of iter ab emerita caesaraugustam when he came to power segmental arches were often employed by trajan s court architect apollodorus of damascus such as in trajan s forum and most notably in greatest civil engineering achievement of its time trajan s bridge which rested on twenty huge concrete piers and was used during dacian wars for moving troops across more than wide danube thumb left 2nd arch thickness is 1 20 m moorish geographers make no mention of alconetar bridge even though they praise roman bridge of alcantara which also leads across tagus there is some evidence that a community called alconetar or arabic small bridge existed at least temporarily probably an indirect reference to high rising bridge of alcantara it also remains unknown why bridge of alconetar is called puente de mantible in local vernacular an expression which alludes to legend of charlemagne and his twelve paladins bridge was probably in use until time of reconquista when tagus constituted border between christian and moorish realm from 11th to 13th century and frequent clashes might have easily made ancient bridge unusable according to another theory water could have begun to wash away ancient foundations at time thumb two arches 1 and 3 reconstructed in later times alconetar bridge first appears in records in 1231 and again in 1257 when it is explicitly referred to as being in use it was probably repaired by knights templar who had taken control of bridge as well as village in meantime extant arches 1 and 3 both of which are not of roman fabric are assumed to date back to this period around 1340 however bridge was apparently unusable again so that a ferry service was established to cross river which is also recorded at later times on site of ancient way station a fortress was erected in middle ages its tower built of roman spolia emerges from alcantara reservoir at low water several attempts to reopen bridge in early modern era proved unsuccessful in 1553 architect rodrigo gil de calculated a cost of 80 000 ducats for reconstruction of bridge without ever realising his plans construction project of alonso de covarrubias and hernan ruiz of 1560 never went beyond planning stage and neither did another project between 1569 and 1580 thumb left in foreground two roman flood openings 1 and 2 in 18th century two further attempts to repair bridge failed in 1730 and 1760 70 latter plan of military engineer jose garcia galiano included a complete reconstruction with three large span segmental arches planning sketch shows that already at that time remaining arches were limited to right bank a finding confirmed by drawing of fernando rodriguez from 1797 and engravings in alexandre de labordes voyage pittoresque de l espagne a few years later reconstruction sketch produced by rodriguez see diagram below shows profile of bridge rising evenly and dominated by three central arches in centre of river these arches are flanked by a further nine segmental arches on both sides symmetry of arches suggests that in lieu of fortification on right bank viewed upstream there might have been another segmental arch in roman times basis for modern scientific analysis of bridge was laid out by civil engineer antonio prieto in his 1925 survey which details condition of bridge before its relocation in 1970 although this was a serious attempt to reconstruct bridge as close to original as possible spanish scholar duran points out that slight changes to main body can never be avoided in course of such a difficult undertaking alconetar bridge has been classified as historical heritage since 1931 by spanish authorities patrimonio historico

elevation of pier no 3 by using degree of curvature of originally preserved supports for arch span to rise ratio of ancient segmental arches can be calculated main feature of alconetar bridge was segmental shape of its arches which were rather uncommon in ancient bridge building in a survey of roman bridges in hispania only one in ten showed same characteristics vast majority being of semi circular design according to prieto bridge had sixteen arches not including flood openings on right approach with following spans estimates are in square brackets meters 7 30 8 20 9 10 15 11 12 13 14

spanned riverbed at low water if one adds clear span of arches and assumes on basis of preserved piers an average pier thickness of then distance between both bridge ramps was 178 15 x 4 4 which corresponded to a river cross section of 73 by comparison corresponding discharge profiles for roman bridges of cordoba of merida and salamanca were 62 64 and 80 respectively most of surviving fabric was concentrated on right bank of tagus where current was less strong a number of pier stumps rose just above water surface in middle of river whilst on left bank a further two piers remained standing

corresponds to a span to rise ratio of 4 0 and 3 3 to 1 respectively accurately fitting inclined contact surface of clearly proves roman origin of these arches with an extraordinary width of voussoirs appear oversized in relation to span arch slenderness of 1 5 8 and 6 2 respectively in contrast two surviving bridge arches no 1 and 3 are substitutions made of carelessly laid rubble date of these arches is unknown as with all other repairs possibly they were built in period of knights templar equally evidently of post classical origin is masonry of first two piers above lower cornice which projects from all piers at same height superstructure of these piers could have been reconstructed for a drawbridge or a tower which according to an illustration in voyage pittoresque rested upon pier 2 in contrast third pier has still preserved its original roman character up to top at its carefully worked ashlar and second cornice which ran along all ancient piers provide us with most distinct impression of original shape of roman bridge in particular it is possible to reconstruct relatively precisely rise of roman segmental arches on basis of angles of inclined stone supports at springing level thus third arch originally described a circular sector of 95deg which points to a span to rise ratio of about 4 5 to 1 for other segmental arches this value is supported by de labordes engravings which depict an intact roman segmental arch spanning adjoining fourth bay as late as early 19th century along with other early examples such as limyra bridge and ponte san lorenzo alconetar bridge therefore ranks among oldest segmental arched bridges in world its existence demonstrates that in contrast to what had previously been widely believed and taught roman bridge builders possessed intimate knowledge of flattened arches pier thicknesses measuring and increase slightly towards middle of river while distances between piers increase from to fifth and ultimate pier which carries distinctive nickname bishop s table takes an advanced position in riverbed and possesses by far largest cross section it may be of medieval origin and could have served as a base for a watchtower replacing two ancient arches all five piers are strengthened on upstream face by pointed cutwaters facing of piers consists of local granite ashlar set in parallel courses without use of mortar or iron ties opus their interior as those of ramps was filled with roman concrete a common method applied for roman bridges outwardly flattened arches must have lent bridge a rather elongated appearance
