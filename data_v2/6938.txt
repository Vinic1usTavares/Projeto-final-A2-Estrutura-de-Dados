campylocephalus is a genus of eurypterid a group of extinct aquatic arthropods fossils of campylocephalus have been discovered in deposits ranging from carboniferous period in czech republic species c salmi to permian period of russia species c oculatus and c permianus generic name is composed of greek words kampulos kampylos meaning curved and kephale kephale meaning head it was a member of hibbertopterid family of eurypterids and probably looked much same as other members of family hibbertopterus and vernonopterus in that it was a large broad and heavy animal quite different from famous swimming eurypterids such as pterygotus and eurypterus which had been common during earlier periods like all other stylonurine eurypterids campylocephalus completely lacked swimming paddles hibbertopterids such as campylocephalus were as many other families within stylonurine suborder sweep feeders sweep feeding food strategies involve specialized appendages with blades that could be used by animals to rake through substrate of their living environments in search for small prey items species c permianus known from deposits of late permian age in russia is only species of campylocephalus preserved well enough to allow for size estimates published estimates putting its size at potentially 1 4 metres 4 6 feet in length this species was last known surviving eurypterid living just before or during permian triassic extinction event 251 9 million years ago before extinction event eurypterids had been declining in numbers and diversity for millions of years campylocephalus had been only known genus of living eurypterids for more than 20 million years since extinction of related genus hastimima description left thumb restoration of c oculatus missing elements have been based on closely related hibbertopterids classified as a member of hibbertopterid family of eurypterids campylocephalus was overall similar to other members of family it was a large broad and heavy creature quite unlike most earlier and more famous swimming eurypterids such as pterygotus and eurypterus as a member of stylonurine suborder campylocephalus completely lacked swimming paddles several distinguishing features separate campylocephalus from other genera in its family in particular from closely related hibbertopterus campylocephalus had a subelliptical almost elliptical prosoma head which was almost shaped like a semicircle and strongly convex being at its broadest in midsection compound eyes of campylocephalus were laterally placed on sides of head and were separated from each other by inflated lobes in middle behind eyes on carapace exoskeleton segment covering head there were some further lobe like structures referred to as palpebral lobes as with prosoma tergites segments on upper side of body of abdomen were convex in shape and possessed articular processes projecting structures that helped segments to fit together appendages limbs of campylocephalus are only very rarely preserved and are as such almost completely unknown due to just how incomplete fossil remains referred to campylocephalus are determining its size is difficult and as of yet no formal published size estimates exist for either type species c oculatus or species c salmi sole known fossil remains of c permianus a massive incomplete carapace suggests a very large eurypterid potentially reaching lengths of 1 4 metres 4 6 feet lamsdell james c braddy simon j 2009 cope s rule and romer s theory patterns of diversity and gigantism in eurypterids and palaeozoic vertebrates biology letters rsbl20090700 supplementary information in c oculatus eyes were in shape almost moon shaped and placed near middle of carapace with small ocelli light sensitive simple eyes between them its carapace had small irregular prominences a rounded anterior edge and an indented posterior edge thoracic segments segments of thorax of species were straight and narrow eyes of c salmi were similar being placed very close together eyes were also a distinguishing feature in c permianus where they were placed more posteriorly than in other species history of research thumb left drawings of fragmentary fossil carapaces of c salmi then referred to as eurypterus salmi by dionys stur 1877 fossils today recognized as belonging to campylocephalus were first described in 1838 as belonging to a species of genus limulus same genus as modern atlantic horseshoe crab by russian paleontologist stepan s kutorga citing similarities with members of modern genus in appearance and anatomy of somewhat incomplete fossil kutorga named it limulus oculatus scottish naturalist john scouler described genus eidothea in 1831 based on a single fossil prosoma from scotland but did grant it any specific name creating a genus with no species goes against orthodox zoological nomenclature specifically conflicting for instance with opinion 65 of international commission on zoological nomenclature any taxonomical difficulties implied with scouler s designation were easily avoided however by discovery that genus name was preoccupied by a genus of molluscs described in 1826 nevertheless name eidothea would be associated with scottish eurypterid species eurypterus scouleri with a near identical prosoma described in 1836 in 1860 french paleontologist edouard d eichwald recognized that carapace and thoracic segments which had been described by kutorga were quite distinct from limulus and thus a new genus was named to contain limulus oculatus dubbed by d eichwald as campylocephalus this generic name is composed of greek words kampulos kampylos meaning curved and kephale kephale meaning head second species of campylocephalus to be described c salmi was named as a species of quite distantly related eurypterus by slovak geologist and paleontologist dionys stur in 1877 stur s description was based on two incomplete fossil carapaces first fragmentary carapace only preserved lower part of head ending in two pointed and concave arches eyes of this carapace were close together in middle of carapace and on a shaped elevated portion similar to some specimens of related hibbertopterus scouleri in second carapace specimen carapace began to stretch forward above eyes both of these fossils also possessed protuberances of different sizes across exoskeleton showing vague forms and shapes not seen in other specimens of genus thumb reconstruction of closely related hibbertopterus scouleri once considered to be a species of campylocephalus fossils of eurypterus scouleri were compared to carapace described by kutorga in 1838 by norwegian paleontologist leif stormer in 1951 who concluded that two were clearly congeneric at this point d eichwald had already recognized fossils designated as eidothea by scouler as representatives of campylocephalus as such e scouleri was classified as campylocephalus scouleri though legs of campylocephalus were still unknown at time even with addition of scottish species any grouping with other genera would have to be made using features of carapace comparing ornamentation of carapace to other eurypterids stormer found it to be similar to genus tarsopterella where legs were also more or less unknown which allowed campylocephalus to be firmly placed within stylonuridae family which would later be raised to become stylonurina suborder not to be confused with presently recognized eurypterid family stylonuridae english paleontologist charles d waterston was first to suggest that c scouleri perhaps shouldn t be considered as congeneric with campylocephalus raising issue in a 1958 paper he posited that though dorsal anatomy of prosoma was quite similar between c scouleri and c oculatus designated type species multiple well preserved fossils had allowed for detailed research into ventral anatomy and appendages of c scouleri since two had been placed in same genus whilst ventral anatomy and appendages of c oculatus remained unknown a year later in 1959 american paleontologist erik norman kjellesvig waering created new genus hibbertopterus to contain c scouleri now hibbertopterus scouleri and placed both genera within family hibbertopteridae described by russian paleontologist alexey g ponomarenko in 1985 c permianus was originally named as a species of hibbertopterus only known specimen of this species is holotype pin 2 an incomplete carapace but ponomarenko could list several features that distinguished it from other species referred to hibbertopterus among these were most prominently posterior position of lateral eyes and said eyes not being circular in shape in 2012 american paleontologist james c lamsdell could demonstrate that these unique features were actually diagnostic features of genus campylocephalus and thus reclassified it as its current combination though ponomarenko had mentioned several features that also distinguished c permianus from then currently recognized species of campylocephalus including a different carapace shape and some thickening of exoskeleton around eyes lamsdell determined that these distinctions were not valid in view of lamsdell specimens of type species c oculatus are not well preserved enough to determine precise structure of eyes and because fossils of its carapace are either flattened or incomplete its shape can not be ascertained with complete accuracy classification campylocephalus is classified as part of family hibbertopteridae a family of eurypterids within superfamily mycteropoidea alongside genera hibbertopterus and vernonopterus genus contains three species c oculatus and c permianus from permian of russia and c salmi from carboniferous of czech republic classification of c salmi is considered

are united as a group by being large mycteropoids with broad prosomas a hastate e g shaped like a gladius a roman sword telson with paired keels on ventral side ornamentation consisting of scales or other similar structures on exoskeleton fourth pair of appendages possessing spines more posterior tergites of abdomen possessing tongue shaped scales near their edges and there being lobes positioned poterolaterally posteriorly on both sides on prosoma features of campylocephalus and vernonopterus makes it clear that both genera represent hibbertopterid eurypterids but incomplete nature of all fossil specimens referred to them make any further study of precise phylogenetic relationships within hibbertopteridae difficult both genera could even represent synonyms of hibbertopterus itself though highly incomplete nature of their remains again makes that hypothesis impossible to confirm cladogram below is adapted from lamsdell 2012 collapsed to only show superfamily mycteropoidea paleoecology thumb estimated size of c permianus compared to a such as campylocephalus were sweep feeders having modified spines on their forward facing prosomal appendages that allowed them to rake through substrate of their living environments though sweep feeding was used as a strategy by many genera within stylonurina it was most developed within hibbertopterids which possessed blades on second third and fourth pair of appendages some species of closely related hibbertopterus had specialized comb like rachis shafts that were able to entrap small prey and other organic food particles though they would have been slow owing to their massive size and robust form studies on hibbertopterus footprints discovered in scotland have demonstrated that hibbertopterids would have been able to walk on land for at least short periods of time tracks discovered indicate that they would have utilized a lumbering jerking and dragging movement and that keeled belly and telson tail spike left a central groove behind some studies suggest that eurypterids possessed a dual respiratory system which would have allowed for this kind of occasional terrestrial movement c salmi is known from ostrava formation of czech republic and would have lived during age 326 4 318 1 million years ago of carboniferous period deposits were eurypterid fossils were found are lacustrine meaning that they formed on bottom of an ancient lake spiders of genus part of extinct arachnid order are known from same location and age and numerous anthozoans group that contains animals such as corals and sea anemones are known from same age within ostrava formation it is difficult to make any statements on paleoecology of type species c oculatus as precise location and dating of fossil specimen remains somewhat unclear most accounts place fossil as having been found at a location named in russia and being from guadalupian epoch 272 3 259 8 million years ago of permian period species of c permianus represents latest known surviving eurypterid species sole fossil representing species was discovered in komi autonomous soviet socialist republic of soviet union modern komi republic of russia in deposits of approximately age of permian triassic extinction event 251 9 million years ago in permian komi would have been a coastal region of supercontinent pangaea though no other fossils of exact same age have been reported other permian age life known from region include bryozoans and bivalves by beginning of permian eurypterids were already in a bad position relative to what their numbers and diversity had once been group was one of many heavily affected by late devonian extinction which rendered all but a single genus of those with swimming paddles eurypterids extinct adelophthalmus of 16 eurypterid families that had lived during beginning of devonian period three families survived and persisted into carboniferous period all of which solely contained non marine species hallam anthony wignall paul b 1997 mass extinctions and their aftermath oxford university press p 70 by permian only three genera were still alive adelophthalmus an adelophthalmid hastimima a and campylocephalus itself both adelophthalmus and hastimima went extinct during early permian which left campylocephalus as sole living genus of eurypterids for more than 20 million years until its own extinction in
