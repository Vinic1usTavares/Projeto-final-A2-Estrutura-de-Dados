boeing 767 is a mid to large size mid to long range wide body twin engine jet airliner developed and manufactured by boeing commercial airplanes it was boeing s first wide body twinjet and its first airliner with a two crew glass cockpit aircraft has two turbofan engines a conventional tail and for reduced aerodynamic drag a supercritical wing design designed as a smaller wide body airliner than earlier aircraft such as 747 767 has a seating capacity for 181 to 375 people and a design range of depending on variant development of 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow body twinjet 757 resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths original 767 200 entered service in 1982 followed by 767 300 in 1986 and 767 400er an extended range er variant in 2000 extended range 767 200er and 767 300er models entered service in 1984 and 1988 respectively while a production freighter version 767 300f debuted in 1995 conversion programs have modified passenger 767 200 and 767 300 series aircraft for cargo use while military derivatives include e 767 surveillance aircraft kc 767 and kc 46 aerial tankers and vip transports engines featured on 767 include general electric cf6 pratt whitney jt9d and pw4000 and rolls royce rb211 turbofans united airlines first placed 767 in commercial service in 1982 aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes during which it demonstrated reliability of its twinjet design 767 became first twin engined airliner to be used on extended overseas flights in 1985 aircraft was then used to expand non stop service on medium to long haul intercontinental routes in 1986 boeing initiated studies for a higher capacity 767 ultimately leading to development of 777 a larger wide body twinjet in 1990s 767 became most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between north america and europe 767 is first twinjet wide body type to reach 1 000 aircraft delivered boeing has received 1 254 orders for 767 from 74 customers with 1 161 delivered a total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in july 2018 most popular variant is 767 300er with 583 delivered delta air lines is largest operator with 77 aircraft competitors have included airbus a300 a310 and a330 200 non passenger variants of 767 remain in production while passenger variant s successor 787 entered service in 2011 development background in 1970 boeing s 747 became first wide body jetliner to enter service 747 was first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin aisle cabin two years later manufacturer began a development study code named 7x7 for a new wide body aircraft intended to replace 707 and other early generation narrow body jets aircraft would also provide twin aisle seating but in a smaller fuselage than existing 747 mcdonnell douglas dc 10 and lockheed l 1011 tristar wide bodies to defray high cost of development boeing signed risk sharing agreements with italian corporation aeritalia and civil transport development corporation ctdc a consortium of japanese aerospace companies this marked manufacturer s first major international joint venture and both aeritalia and ctdc received supply contracts in return for their early participation initial 7x7 was conceived as a short take off and landing airliner intended for short distance flights but customers were unenthusiastic about concept leading to its redefinition as a mid size transcontinental range airliner at this stage proposed aircraft featured two or three engines with possible configurations including over wing engines and a t tail thumb 7x7 made its farnborough airshow debut in 1982 as 767 200 alt side view of twin engine jet touching down on runway with deployed flaps and thrust reversers by 1976 a twinjet layout similar to one which had debuted on airbus a300 became baseline configuration decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in reliability and economics of new generation jet powerplants while airline requirements for new wide body aircraft remained ambiguous 7x7 was generally focused on mid size high density markets as such it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities advancements in civil aerospace technology including high bypass ratio turbofan engines new flight deck systems aerodynamic improvements and lighter construction materials were to be applied to 7x7 many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid size narrow body airliner code named which would become 757 work on both proposals proceeded through airline industry upturn in late 1970s in january 1978 boeing announced a major extension of its everett factory which was then dedicated to manufacturing 747 to accommodate its new wide body family in february 1978 new jetliner received 767 model designation and three variants were planned a 767 100 with 190 seats a 767 200 with 210 seats and a trijet 767mr lr version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes 767mr lr was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes 767 was officially launched on july 14 1978 when united airlines ordered 30 of 767 200 variant followed by 50 more 767 200 orders from american airlines and delta air lines later that year 767 100 was ultimately not offered for sale as its capacity was too close to 757 s seating while 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around twinjet configuration design effort in late 1970s operating cost replaced capacity as primary factor in airliner purchases as a result 767 s design process emphasized fuel efficiency from outset boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft mainly through new engine and wing technology as development progressed engineers used computer aided design for over a third of 767 s design drawings and performed 26 000 hours of wind tunnel tests design work occurred concurrently with 757 twinjet leading boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features including avionics flight management systems instruments and handling characteristics combined development costs were estimated at 3 5 to 4 billion thumb left forward view of a continental airlines 767 400er showing

electric cf6 turbofans marking first time that boeing had offered more than one engine option at launch of a new airliner both jet engine models had a maximum output of of thrust engines were mounted approximately one third length of wing from fuselage similar to previous wide body larger wings were designed using an aft loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of manufacturer s previous aircraft wings provided higher altitude cruise performance added fuel capacity and expansion room for future stretched variants initial 767 200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across north america or across northern atlantic and would be capable of operating routes up to 767 s fuselage width was set midway between that of 707 and 747 at while it was narrower than previous wide body designs seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted and reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard wide body unit load devices side by side so a smaller container ld2 was created specifically for 767 using a conventional tail design also allowed rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section providing for parallel aisles along full length of passenger cabin and eliminating irregular seat rows toward rear of aircraft thumb first built n767ba in flight near mount rainier in 1980s alt boeing twin engine jetliner in flight near a snow capped mountain 767 was first boeing wide body to be designed with a two crew digital glass cockpit cathode ray tube crt color displays and new electronics replaced role of flight engineer by enabling pilot and co pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly despite promise of reduced crew costs united airlines initially demanded a conventional three person cockpit citing concerns about risks associated with introducing a new aircraft carrier maintained this position until july 1981 when a us presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide body jets a three crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to first production models ansett australia ordered 767s with three crew cockpits due to union demands it was only airline to operate 767s so configured 767 s two crew cockpit was also applied to 757 allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types although nominally similar in control design flying 767 feels different from 757 757 s controls are heavy similar to 727 and 747 control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll and control yoke has approximately 2 3 rotation travel production and testing to produce 767 boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from italy s aeritalia and japan s ctdc wings and cabin floor were produced in house while aeritalia provided control surfaces boeing vertol made leading edge for wings and boeing wichita produced forward fuselage ctdc provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies namely fuji heavy industries wing fairings and gear doors kawasaki heavy industries center fuselage and mitsubishi heavy industries rear fuselage doors and tail components were integrated during final

across northern atlantic under extended range twin engine operational performance standards etops regulations faa s safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines before 767 overwater flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from diversion airports in may 1985 faa granted its first approval for 120 minute etops flights to 767 operators on an individual airline basis starting with twa provided that operator met flight safety criteria this allowed aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours distance from land larger safety margins were permitted because of improved reliability demonstrated by twinjet and its turbofan engines faa lengthened etops time to 180 minutes for cf6 powered 767s in 1989 making type first to be certified under longer duration and all available engines received approval by 1993 regulatory approval spurred expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted aircraft s sales stretched derivatives forecasting airline interest in larger capacity models boeing announced stretched 767 300 in 1983 and extended range 767 300er in 1984 both models offered a 20 percent passenger capacity increase while extended range version was capable of operating flights up to japan airlines placed first order for 767 300 in september 1983 following its first flight on january 30 1986 type entered service

service with american airlines on march 3 1988 767 300 and 767 300er gained popularity after entering service and came to account for approximately two thirds of all 767s sold after debut of first stretched 767s boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models including a partial double deck version informally named hunchback of from a town near boeing s everett factory with a 757 body section mounted over aft main fuselage in 1986 boeing proposed 767 x a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin but received little interest by 1988 767 x

firm orders by early 1990s wide body twinjet had become its manufacturer s annual best selling aircraft despite a slight decrease due to economic recession during this period 767 became most common airliner for transatlantic flights between north america and europe by end of decade 767s crossed atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined 767 also propelled growth of point to point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes taking advantage of aircraft s lower operating costs and smaller capacity operators added non stop flights to secondary population centers thereby eliminating need for connecting flights increased number of cities receiving non stop services caused a paradigm shift in airline industry as point to point travel gained prominence at expense of traditional hub and spoke model in february 1990 first 767 equipped with rolls royce rb211 turbofans a 767 300 was delivered to british airways six months later carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in engine pylons of several aircraft cracks were related to extra weight of rb211 engines which are heavier than other 767 engines during grounding interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks boeing also performed a structural reassessment resulting in production changes and modifications to engine pylons of all 767s in service thumb boeing 767 400er was publicly unveiled on august 26 1999 alt side quarter view of twin engine jetliner
