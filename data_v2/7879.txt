elements of a stealth game game is based on works of h p lovecraft author of call of cthulhu and progenitor of cthulhu mythos it is a reimagining of lovecraft s 1936 novella shadow over innsmouth set mostly in year 1922 story follows jack walters a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate in innsmouth a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself off from rest of united states in development since 1999 project was repeatedly delayed going through several revisions and having some of its most ambitious and immersive features abandoned and initially planned playstation 2 version cancelled although well received by most critics and regarded by some as one of best horror video games of all time dark corners of earth was a commercial failure at least two additional cthulhu mythos games were planned by headfirst productions including a direct sequel titled call of cthulhu destiny s end but neither were completed due to headfirst s bankruptcy gameplay thumb left alt hud less first person view game s entirely hud less first person view presentation lacks typical fps features such as ammo and health indicators or aiming reticle initial gameplay of call of cthulhu dark corners of earth comprises unarmed escape and evasion together with investigative exploration although first person shooter fps style combat is introduced later on as with most survival horror video games ammunition is limited and must be conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable occasionally requiring player to avoid combat even when armed game as a whole is heavily scripted and very linear with only one path through chapters from start to finish in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as original alone in dark which itself was inspired by mythos game features no heads up display instead condition of player character is relayed through sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing which become more pronounced when wounded and color draining from screen with loss of blood and strength specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally for example a broken leg causes character to limp while making appropriate noises while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult health system was designed as a more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds including poisoning and bleeding require different remedies such as a splint for a broken leg inventory screen shows character s injuries displayed on his character model and all carried items player s character gradually loses sanity when he looks directly at upsetting aspects of game world character s mental degradation can lead him to hearing hallucinations and visions which manifest as graphical anomalies and sound distortion and changes in control sensitivity if character becomes too unsettled results may include his permanent insanity or suicide and a game over sanity can be restored through finding areas of sanctuary or defeating enemies areas marked with elder signs serve as sanctuaries against enemies and as save points to enhance its replayability value game features a system whereby players can gain mythos points supposed to reflect a level of gained knowledge such points can be used to unlock in game bonuses such as additional information and items most of ranged weapons are based on real firearms with exception of a yithian directed energy weapon introduced at end of game player character can also perform a melee attack with a crowbar or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used up game features a realistic combat system due to lack of hud player has to count shots manually to know when gun goes empty there is also no artificial on screen targeting reticle instead player must aim through iron sights on weapons themselves but sustained aiming tires character and drops accuracy shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where gun s barrel is pointing for example if player character readies a reloaded weapon and player pulls trigger before character animation has finished round will be discharged in direction gun was pointing when shot was fired plot on september 6 1915 police detective jack walters milton lawrence is summoned to siege of a decrepit manor house in boston manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called fellowship of yith led by one
