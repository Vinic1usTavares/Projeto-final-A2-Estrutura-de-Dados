le hardi class consisted of twelve destroyers built for french navy during late 1930s only seven ships were ultimately completed while construction of remaining five ships was interrupted by french defeat in battle of france in may june 1940 and were never finished seven ships that were seaworthy sailed for french north africa to prevent their capture by advancing germans several ships later sailed for french west africa where played a minor role in battle of dakar in september they captured two ships that were still under construction and attempted to finish them both before abandoning effort in 1943 vichy french reformed high sea forces fhm after french surrender in late june after most of sister ships returned to france in november three of them were assigned to fhm and others were placed in reserve seven completed ships were scuttled in toulon when germans occupied vichy france in november 1942 royal italian navy salvaged most of them during 1943 and towed three of them to italy for repairs all of ships were captured by germans after italian armistice in september but they made little effort to finish repairs they did attempt to complete but were unsuccessful before end of war three ships in italy were scuttled in april 1945 to prevent their capture by allies remaining ships in toulon were either sunk by allied bombers or scuttled by germans after operation dragoon allied invasion of southern france in august 1944 all of ships were salvaged for scrap or broken up on slipway after war except for l opiniatre which was launched after war and used for testing before she was scrapped in 1971 lansquenet was refloated and towed back to toulon in 1946 and was still incomplete when she was scrapped in 1958 background and description thumb left line drawing of le hardi

one forward and a superfiring pair aft of superstructure electrically powered turrets were protected by of armour guns had an elevation range between 10deg and 30deg and each one was provided with 170 semi armour piercing and 10 star shells jordan moulin pp 186 187 they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of campbell p 300 this gave them a range of at an elevation of 30deg jordan moulin p 187 modele 1932 guns had a rate of fire of 10 15 rounds per minute although rammer was underpowered and often caused jams in loading system in one engagement against a british destroyer in september 1940 was only able to fire 14 rounds in six minutes before all her guns broke down given time and training these problems could be fixed as le hardi demonstrated during battle of dakar when she fired 60 rounds without any problems she had previously fired over 700 rounds during thirteen sessions on gunnery ranges jordan moulin pp 187 188 primary anti aircraft aa armament of le hardi class ships was intended to consist of a twin gun mount for 70 caliber canon de modele 1935 guns development of automatic weapon was still in progress when ships were completed in 1939 1940 and a twin gun mount for 50 caliber canon de 37 mm modele 1933 guns on aft superstructure was installed instead these semi automatic guns could elevate to a maximum of 80deg and they had a practical rate of fire of 15 21 rounds per minute ships carried a total of 2 960 rounds for guns their muzzle velocity of gave their shells an effective range of ships were also fitted with two twin hotchkiss modele 1929 anti aircraft machine gun mounts abreast bridge weapons had a practical rate of fire of 250 rounds per minute and an effective range of ready use lockers stowed 480 rounds near each gun and remaining 1 920 rounds per gun were in magazine campbell p 307 jordan moulin pp 119 148 188 189 ships carried one triple and two twin sets of torpedo tubes amidships twin tube aft mounts were positioned one on each broadside but triple tube forward mount could traverse to both sides one depth charge chute was built into stern in first batch of six ships this housed eight depth charges other side of stern was used for handling gear for a towed ginocchio captive anti submarine torpedo but this was removed before they were completed second batch of six ships had two depth charge chutes in stern with a capacity of a dozen depth charges jordan moulin pp 186 190 fire control fire control system of le hardi class as designed was identical to that of larger s with a director equipped with a opl modele pc 1936 stereoscopic rangefinder built around base of foremast above bridge director sent range to where it was fed into a modele 1929 electro mechanical computer which calculated firing solution and transmitted it to turrets intended to equip turrets so they could be controlled by director but abandoned effort in 1942 after equipment trials were unsuccessful and it concluded that ships lacked necessary electrical capacity jordan moulin pp 146 148 188 space and weight had been allocated for a director for 37 millimetre modele 1935 guns but when this was unavailable a rangefinder on a pedestal for main armament was substituted in all ships except which received an enclosed mounting with a five meter rangefinder a high angle rangefinder was fitted for ant aircraft guns jordan moulin pp 188 189 a torpedo director was located above primary gunnery director on foremast it used a separate five meter opl modele 1935 stereoscopic rangefinder to provide bearing and range to a modele 1933 electro mechanical computer which calculated torpedo firing angle this was sent to remotely controlled torpedo tubes and command to fire could be given by either torpedo director or either of secondary positions on wings of bridge jordan moulin pp 149 171 189 modifications in early 1941 a pair of single mounts for browning 13 2 millimetre aa machine guns were added to all ships on quarterdeck in late 1941 le hardi had her anti aircraft suite reinforced and rearranged twin hotchkiss machine gun mounts were repositioned on quarterdeck and a pair of single mounts for hotchkiss aa guns were installed in their place in front of bridge in addition browning machine guns were transferred to newly built platforms on sides of superfiring turret aft later in year and in early 1942 l adroit casque and mameluk received same modifications jordan moulin p 192 revised design in 1938 after observing experiences of ships attacked by aircraft while performing neutrality patrols during spanish civil war of 1936 1939 naval general staff revised its assumptions about a naval war it now viewed a dual purpose dp armament as a requirement for ships intended to escort capital ships this was role of le hardi class and staff wanted to evaluate how four ships scheduled to be laid down in mid 1939 could be modified to accommodate dp guns three proposals were submitted in response on 30 november all on a hull that was enlarged by more than staff accepted two of them first for three ships to be armed with 130 mm dp mounts derived from those used on dunkerque class battleships while remaining ship was to be armed with standard 130 mm low angle mounts to allow it to form a three ship division with le corsaire and le flibustier but its aa armament was to consist of a pair of twin gun high angle mounts one of which replaced a torpedo tube mount and standard pair of twin gun aa machine gun mounts its torpedo armament was reduced to a pair of triple mounts jordan moulin pp 193 194 start of war in september 1939 completely disrupted this plan as building of these ships was suspended when construction was resumed in march 1940 admiral francois darlan navy s chief of staff was informed that no newly designed destroyers could enter service before 1944 but that either three le hardi class ships or four could begin sea trials in 1943 on 28 april darlan decided on modified le hardis with either originally specified hull or proposed larger version depending on how advanced design work was he also specified a top speed of and a range of at their armament was to consist of two or three 130 millimetre dp guns with an elevation limited to 40 or 50deg as mounts were not likely be ready before ships were completed he proposed an interim armament of three or four 100 millimetre guns in high angle mounts rest of armament was to consist of one twin and two single mounts for 37 millimetre aa guns two twin gun aa machine gun mounts two triple mounts for torpedoes and a pair of depth charge rails and a pair of depth charge throwers for twenty 100 kilogram depth charges jordan moulin pp 194 196 ships name ship of class was authorized in 1932 naval estimates but construction was significantly delayed by financial impact of great depression and bilateral arms limitation talks between france and fascist italy that caused french parliament to suspend all new naval construction until 1934 even then le hardi was not laid down until late following year to be followed a few months later by two sister ships authorized in 1935 naval estimates and then three more in mid 1936 as part of that year s naval remaining six ships were authorized in 1937 1938 and naval estimates jordan moulin pp 160 180 182 construction of first six ships was slowed by social and industrial disruptions associated with that took power in 1936 so that le hardi was only ship to complete all of her sea trials next four ships began their acceptance trials between march and may 1940 and all
