amagi akagi atago and takao conway s all world s fighting ships p 235 states that takao was named for town of takao formosa and some sources repeat this however name takao for japanese warships predated renaming of town and lacroix p 122 states that name was simply re used for battlecruiser amagi design was essentially a lengthened version of battleship but with a thinner armored belt and deck and a modified secondary armament arrangement gardiner and gray 1984 p 235 limitations imposed by 1922 washington naval treaty prevented class from being completed as designed however treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers amagi and akagi were both intended for conversion but an earthquake damaged hull of amagi so extensively that ship was scrapped akagi was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction as part of kido butai during second world war participating in japanese attack on pearl harbor before being sunk at battle of midway design dimensions and machinery ships had a planned displacement of and at full load class design was long at waterline and overall ships would have had a beam of and a draft of and would have used four propeller shafts powered by steam turbines design staff intended to use turbines which were to be powered by 19 kampon water tube boilers eleven of which were oil fired while other eight were to have mixed oil and coal for fuel this system was designed to provide for a top speed of planned fuel stores amounted to 3 900 tons of oil and 2 500 tons of coal ships had a planned cruising speed of and with full fuel stores ships would have had a maximum range of armament ships were to be equipped with a main battery of ten l 45 45 denotes length of gun barrels in this case gun is 45 calibers meaning that gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter guns in five twin gun turrets although an l 50 gun tested in 1920 might have been used instead guns fired armor piercing projectiles with a propellant charge at at a rate of fire between 1 5 and 2 5 rounds per minute each gun had 90 rounds and an approximate barrel life of 250 300 shots turrets would have been arranged along centerline two superfiring turrets fore and three in line aft of superstructure gun turrets weighed 1 004 tons 1 020 mt and allowed for depression of 5 degrees and elevation of 30 degrees secondary battery was to have consisted of sixteen l 50 guns mounted in casemates along center of ship these guns fired projectiles and used of propellant at a muzzle velocity of guns had a maximum elevation of 25 degrees which enabled a maximum range of four later increased to six l 45 anti aircraft guns were to have been mounted amidships along with eight above water torpedo tubes armor it was planned that amagi class would be protected by a main belt thick sloped at 12 degrees and a torpedo bulkhead thick main battery barbettes were designed to have between of armor plating and conning tower would have had armor ranging in thickness from to a maximum of deck armor was to have been thick background experiences in russo japanese war convinced naval war planners that more fast capital ships were needed so on 4 april 1907 imperial defence council approved an eight eight policy this plan originally called for a fleet of eight battleships and eight armored cruisers that would all be under ten years old later changed to eight battlecruisers and reduced to eight years old however advent of dreadnought battleship crippled this plan at beginning given japan s weak and underdeveloped economy and enormous strain that had been put on it during russo japanese war japan emerged from war victorious but bankrupt gardiner and gray 1984 p 222 launch of was a disaster for japan gardiner and gray 1984 p 223 in 1907 japan was halfway to eight eight with two newly delivered battleships in fleet and two more and four armored cruisers authorized or under construction in addition three more battleships and four armored cruisers had been authorized though not funded however naval technology was changing older battleships including all of japan s battleships in commission or under construction while s were technically semi dreadnoughts due to their heavy secondary battery they were still made obsolete by were quickly rendered obsolete with commissioning of hms dreadnought hence terms dreadnought and pre dreadnought and armored cruisers were seemingly useless in face of new battlecruisers being laid down by great britain and germany ijn recognized this and proposed in 1909 that two battlecruisers be ordered from british plans with one to be built in great britain and one to be built at home these two ships became another pair of kongos were later built in japan in 1910 there was still authorization for one battleship and four armored cruisers this battleship a more heavily armored version of kongo class battlecruisers became japan s first super dreadnought with these ships japan appeared to be getting closer to eight eight goal however these new ships represented a new level of naval strength for ijn and they made all previous japanese capital ships obsolete this meant that any naval planner aiming for an eight eight fleet would have to call for seven more battleships and four more battlecruisers at a time when japan was trying to weather a worldwide economic depression after proposals from ijn in 1911 and 1912 for massive shipbuilding programs cabinet compromised down to a four four plan under this three new battleships other ship and two ships and no new battlecruisers were authorized gardiner and gray 1984 pp 222 223 navy did not agree and instead called for an eight four fleet while imperial defence council called for original eight eight cabinet relented and by july 1914 it was decided to aim first for an eight four fleet followed by eight eight fleet eight four plan was presented to diet of japan in 1915 it aimed to have eight battleships and four battlecruisers by 1923 with building of two and two s problem with this was that old plan intended all of ships of eight eight fleet to be under eight years old by time these new ships were completed fuso and first two kongo ships would be past their replacement age gardiner and gray 1984 p 224 plan was approved in 1917 along with funding for two battlecruisers which became amagi class in late 1917 navy proposed to expand eight four plan by adding two more battlecruisers this was approved and two more amagi class ships were ordered however having eight gun ships four battleships and four battlecruisers on order put an enormous financial strain on japan which was spending about a third of its national budget on navy massive size and scale of its building program was rapidly driving up cost of naval construction and armament construction cancellation and conversion thumb left 240px akagi after her launch in april 1925 she had already been converted to an aircraft carrier alt a large ship covered with scaffolding sits in harbor under a large gantry was first ship of class to be laid down construction began on 6 december 1920 at naval yard in kure amagi followed ten days later at yokosuka naval yard projected completion dates for first pair of ships were december and november 1923 respectively atago was laid down in kobe at kawasaki shipyard on 22 november 1921 and was projected to be finished in december 1924 takao fourth and final ship of class was laid down at mitsubishi shipyard in nagasaki on 19 december 1921 and was also projected to be completed in december 1924 washington naval treaty signed in february 1922 greatly reduced tonnage allowed for capital ships in signatory nations treaty also instituted a moratorium on new warship construction battlecruisers canceled under this included one class each from japan united states and great britain amagi class and g3 class respectively see washington naval treaty chapter ii part iii section ii treaty did allow for battleship and battlecruiser hulls currently under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers but only if these new carriers were kept under a 27 000 ton limit considering that amagi class were designed to displace at full load in their battlecruiser configuration this would have been a rather difficult displacement to obtain however americans also had same problem when designing a conversion of their lexington class so an exception spearheaded by us assistant secretary of navy theodore roosevelt jr was added to treaty that gave five signatories option of converting up to two capital ships that were under construction to 33 000 ton aircraft carriers friedman 1983 p 43see washington naval treaty chapter i article ix this resulted in united states and japan quickly reordering two ships each japan chose amagi and akagi two ships nearest to completion for conversion their guns were turned over to imperial japanese army for use as coastal artillery three of their main gun turrets were installed in tokyo bay busan korea and on iki island in strait of tsushima rest of their guns were placed in reserve and scrapped in 1943 gibbs tamura 1982 pp 192
