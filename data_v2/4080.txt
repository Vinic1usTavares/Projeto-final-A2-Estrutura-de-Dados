blue lake crater also known as blue lake maar is a maar or a broad low relief volcanic crater in u s state of oregon located in jefferson county it consists of three overlapping craters which hold blue lake drainage basin for blue lake has very steep forested slopes and is mostly part of explosion crater left by volcano s eruption volcano lies within metolius river basin which supports a wide array of plant life large and small mammals and more than 80 bird species in 2009 governor of oregon ted kulongoski signed a bill designating metolius river basin as an area of critical concern preventing large scale development on land and protecting its wildlife despite having erupted at some point within past 4 000 years blue lake crater is considered one of least known holocene volcanoes in cascade volcanic arc it forms a modest volcanic cone its lake surrounded by a crescent shaped agglutinate ridge consisting of volcanic bombs northern side of blue lake crater s rim collapsed during eruptive activity while southern wall remains intact overall composition is mafic rich in magnesium and iron chiefly basalt and picrite basalt picrobasalt other associated volcanic features include a chain of spatter cones about to south which erupted material that shares petrographic qualities with erupted material from blue lake crater geologists disagree on exact date of blue lake crater s most recent activity w e scott and e m taylor place eruption at 3 440 250 years ago while more recent publications estimate that date as maximum age and suggest it is more likely eruption occurred about 1 330 140 years ago united states geological survey has assessed threat potential from blue lake crater as low very low part of elliott corbett memorial state recreation site blue lake crater supports an arts center named caldera as well as a resort there is a campground on nearby suttle lake and blue lake is used for fishing surroundings support hiking and horseback riding discontinuity of publicly accessible land has made blue lake area little known as a recreation destination though a round trip on public trails runs for more than beginning with a scramble geography thumb left 300px blue lake in 1940 blue lake crater is located in jefferson county in u s state of oregon elevation of lake at bottom of crater is while elevation at rim is geological feature consists of three overlapping craters which are filled by waters of blue lake often called crater lake of central oregon cascades with an area of blue lake has dimensions of with a depth of more than it has a shoreline length of lake has a cold temperature at below depths of and low productivity rate of generation of biomass in an ecosystem blue lake s depth gives it its eponymous blue color which atlas of oregon lakes describes as bluest of many blue lakes in oregon blue lake also has a strange water chemistry with samples collected in october 1972 by oregon department of environmental quality showing increased conductivity owing to high concentrations of sodium and chloride ions possibly as a result of inflow from hot springs drainage basin for blue lake has very steep forested slopes and is mostly part of crater left by volcano s eruption about three percent of water s surface area has a depth of less than lake is fed by underground springs near eastern shore snowmelt from its surroundings and a stream from northwest one outlet link stream runs through eastern crater wall for to nearby suttle lake a moraine dammed lake that is popular among tourists which is warmer and eutrophic near blue lake lie terminal moraines from an ice sheet between mount washington and three fingered jack which are covered with of volcanic ash deposited by cinder cones in sand mountain volcanic field and about of cinders produced by blue lake crater ecology blue lake always exhibits an extremely high concentration of phosphorus which is normally associated with eutrophic lakes but blue lake is distinctly oligotrophic with small phytoplankton populations there are also rainbow trout stocked annually and kokanee in lake there were historically sockeye salmon runs in lake and adjoining water systems which ceased with construction of pelton dam on deschutes river in 1960s there are ongoing efforts to restore anadromous fish to waterway forest fires have badly damaged much of forested area near blue lake crater blue lake is part of metolius river basin river passes through old growth ponderosa pine forests as well as forests of douglas fir and western larch in may of each year native plants and wildflowers start to appear including early blue violets larkspur sitka valerian and western buttercups during summer season river trails more prominently display plant species like american bigleaf lupine douglas s spirea indian paintbrush and monkeyflower plants wildflowers sometimes form on islands in river as their seeds bloom after falling into water and accumulating over time area is also noted for a rare species of penstemon known as penstemon peckii a wildflower that grows in 7 different colors which is endemic to sisters area other plants that live within metolius preserve include incense cedar trees rose ocean spray snowberry and vine maple trees more than 80 species of bird inhabit metolius preserve area such as white headed woodpecker area supports large mammals like american black bears badgers bobcats beavers deer cougars elk and otters as well as smaller mammals like northern flying squirrels shrews and voles geology thumb right 350px blue lake crater is made up of basalt and picrite basalt or picrobasalt representative sample pictured blue lake crater is part of oregon branch of cascade volcanic arc in western north america though it lies about to east of major crest despite being located close to a major highway that crosses cascades blue lake crater is considered one of least known holocene volcanoes in cascade arc it fits into a greater geographic trend that includes belknap crater cinder pit volcano to north and a chain of spatter cones to south which may indicate an underlying fault system or fractures blue lake crater is considered a holocene maar a broad low relief volcanic crater with at least three overlapping explosion craters which trend to northeast there is a crescent shaped agglutinate ridge consisting of volcanic bombs surrounding crater which reaches heights of above lake surface and above surrounding topographic features some of volcanic bombs on outer slopes of blue lake crater reach lengths of many of inner slopes lead to cliffs northern wall of crater appears to have collapsed during an eruption while southern wall is intact and made of cinder and a matrix of bedrock and volcanic bombs overall blue lake crater has a modest volcanic cone in contrast to many maars blue lake crater has vesicular scoria with little evidence of extensive interaction with external water its eruption less than 3 000 years ago makes blue lake crater one of youngest volcanoes in cascade range and with spatter cone chain nearby it may also be newest volcanic feature in santiam and mckenzie passes region maar forms part of sisters reach which extends for and contains at least 466 quaternary volcanoes reach is characterized by aligned vents and a high vent density with a number of eruptive units containing rhyolite which is rare for cascade arc blue lake crater has a mafic composition rich in magnesium and iron blue lake crater s major rock composition components are basalt and picrite basalt picrobasalt analysis of components from blue lake crater eruptive deposits for calc alkaline melt inclusion showed compositional similarities with and collier cones indicating that blue lake crater is also made up of basaltic andesite by weight percentage blue lake crater deposits consist of about 54 silicon dioxide silica and about 5 magnesium oxide it has a phosphorus pentoxide to potassium oxide ratio between 0 2 and 0 3 which is an indicator for distinguishing distinct magma types as two chemical compounds act as incompatible elements except for late stage crystallization subfeatures there is a chain of spatter cones about south of blue lake crater which display a similar alignment north northeast for chain runs for in length between blue lake crater and mount washington and lies south of another vent with a circular crater that is deep which likely only erupted gas their eruption products show petrographic similarities to blue lake eruptive material suggesting that their eruptive activity overlapped in time erupted tephra from both is moderately porphyritic with 1 percent olivine phenocrysts about across and 10 15 percent plagioclase phenocrysts that are slightly larger at up to across none of spatter cones erupted lava flows trenches run parallel to midsection of spatter cone chain suggesting underground continuity there are segments of fractured bedrock in area but no displacement is visible there are three fissures associated with spatter cone chain southern and middle fissures are nearly connected with furrows lined with lithic tephra cinder pit is a small cinder cone located north of blue lake crater which is now occupied by a basalt volcanic plug a narrow lava flow sits a few hundred feet to east of cinder pit sitting on top of oxidized glacial deposits another two cinder cones are located nearby with heights of and above northern and northeastern flanks of black crater volcano respectively another line of volcanic vents lies to south eruptive history volcanic activity in santiam pass and mckenzie pass has included eruptions of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows from cinder cones and shield volcanoes most of these events occurred within past 7 650 years after deposition of mazama ash yielding lava flows with rugged surfaces unlike more ancient glaciated lava deposits that preceded them ash from these eruptions is also present three regional pulses of eruptive activity took place first from 4 000 to 3 000 years ago second from 2 900 to 2 500 years ago and third from 2 000 to 1 300 years ago age progression is not clearly related to geographic distribution though blue lake crater and spatter cone chain nearby mark two small eruptive centers in eastern santiam pass area blue lake crater erupted at some point within past 4 000 years maximum age determined by taylor 1965 was 3 440 250 years for a tree limb between blue lake crater tephra deposits and volcanic ash from sand mountain volcanic field scott 1977 also concludes that evidence suggests eruption took place 3 440 250 years ago charred forest litter was found under cinders from spatter cone chain near blue lake crater and used to determine a minimum age of 1 330 140 years sherrod et al 2004 argue that charred limb was likely from a tree killed by eruptions from sand mountain field rather than blue lake crater and thus that date of 3 440 years ago should be treated as a maximum limiting age for blue lake crater instead cashman et al 2009 argue that identification of a ash layer from a core from round lake located northwest of blue lake which shows geochemical similarities to blue lake crater tephra suggests minimum age of blue lake crater is even younger at 1 860 25 years however mckay 2012 shows that there is a strong chemical correlation between this layer and tephra from blue lake crater as well as collier cone volcano blue lake crater s eruption violently broke through bedrock layers producing basaltic volcanic bombs and cinders as well as a blanket of tephra that was deposited to east and southeast reaching a maximum thickness of more than it likely formed an eruption column of tephra which was deflected by wind and then reached suttle lake forming a deposit with a thickness greater than on its southwestern shore eruptive products consisted of scoria black volcanic ash and lapilli with scoria dominating scoria from eruption had a coarse texture possibly most recent eruption in santiam and mckenzie passes region this event formed an elongated crater with steep walls but a low rim there were no lava flows eruption was one of several postglacial mafic events in area which are more common in sisters reach than anywhere in cascade arc it was part of a pulse of more than a dozen mafic eruptions during late holocene epoch in mckenzie and santiam passes region between 4 500 and 1 100 years ago isopach mapping of deposits from blue lake crater suggest an eruptive volume of eruption was predominantly fed by magma and produced thick scoria fall which overlies phreatomagmatic surge deposits with thicknesses up to grain size for pyroclastic deposits is finest in base surge deposits increasing as it moves away from base lithic and dense fragments are most common near base of deposit with vesicular scoria transition from a glassier matrix in early stage eruptive material to a more microcrystalline character indicates that there was quenching of early stage deposits with external water this possibly suggests that eruption began with activity but quickly became predominantly magmatic for rest of its duration further evidence for a deep magmatic source includes high volatile content of olivine hosted melt inclusions additional melt inclusion data with abundant water and carbon dioxide absence of lithic fragments except late stage volcanic bombs and absence of lava flow deposits current threat no lava flows have been recently emplaced in area surrounding blue lake crater area near blue lake crater is not heavily populated though as of 2013 there were about 6 900 people living within of maar and more than 286 000 people living within according to volcano hazards program of usgs threat potential for blue lake crater is low very low j w ewert of usgs 2007 assessed volcano s hazard level using a fifteen factor method and likewise determined volcano s threat level to be low human history and recreation thumb right 150px governor of oregon ted kulongoski signed a bill to preserve a recreational area that includes blue lake
