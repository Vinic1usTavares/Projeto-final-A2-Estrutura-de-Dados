battle of arnhem battle of arnhem was part of operation market garden an attempt to secure a string of bridges through netherlands at arnhem british 1st airborne division and polish 1st independent parachute brigade were tasked with securing bridges across lower rhine final objectives of operation however airborne forces that dropped on 17 september were not aware that 9th ss and 10th ss panzer divisions were also near arnhem for rest and refit middlebrook p67 their presence added a substantial number of panzergrenadiers tanks and self propelled guns to german defenses and allies suffered heavily in ensuing battle only a small force managed to hold one end of arnhem road bridge before being overrun on 21st rest of division became trapped in a small pocket west of bridge and had to be evacuated on 25th allies failed to cross rhine which remained under german control until allied offensives in march 1945 kershaw p303 advance into arnhem allies planned to fly british and polish to arnhem in three separate lifts over three days waddy p38 major general roy urquhart decided to deploy 1st airlanding brigade first as glider troops could assemble more quickly than parachute infantry and secure landing areas middlebrook p31 cain took off with first lift along with two companies of south staffords but only five minutes after departing from raf manston tow rope connecting albemarle tug to his horsa glider pulled out of leading aircraft middlebrook p80 after landing safely glider s occupants were able to fly out following day with second lift thumb alt two men in military uniform

elements of lieutenant colonel john frost s 2nd battalion were able to reach bridge waddy p65 1st and 3rd battalions were unable to penetrate outer suburbs of city and their advance stalled so in order to support them first lift of south staffords were sent forward on morning of 18th waddy when cain arrived with second lift they too were sent forward arriving at outskirts of arnhem on night of 18th middlebrook lieutenant colonel david dobie of 1st battalion proposed a concentrated attack on a narrow front between lower rhine and arnhem railway line south staffords would advance toward bridge with remnants of 1st and 3rd battalions on their right flank while 11th parachute battalion remained in reserve middlebrook p191 staffords moved forward at 4 30am with d company in lead followed by b and a companies with c company in reserve middlebrook p200 in area around st elizabeth hospital lead company met heavy resistance clearing houses and b company took lead getting as far as a dell near arnhem city museum here cain and his men encountered enemy armour for first time waddy p89 company was only armed with piats and mortars and although cain and several of his company opened fire on tanks and guns they did not manage to disable any middlebrook p202 by 11 30 they had run out of piat ammunition and tanks now dominated area their position was clearly hopeless and so lieutenant colonel mccardie commanding officer co of 2nd battalion south staffordshire regiment ordered them to withdraw from dell middlebrook p205 cain fell back with several of his men but few of them were able to escape while men of other companies were forced to surrender in their droves cain was only senior officer of battalion to escape in what he later described as south staff s waterloo middlebrook p203 as surviving men fell back through 11th battalion s positions major gilchrist a company 11th battalion met cain who told him that tanks are coming give me a piat middlebrook p207 gilchrist was unable to oblige and so staffords regrouped behind 11th battalion s positions roughly 100 surviving men forming into five small platoons under cain s command waddy p91 lieutenant colonel george lea commander of 11th battalion ordered them to capture a piece of wooded high ground known as den brink to cover a fresh advance and a bayonet charge quickly cleared enemy there however thick tree roots on hill made it impossible to dig in and after suffering severe casualties cain took decision to withdraw back to oosterbeek oosterbeek perimeter thumb alt a large mechanised vehicle drives down a suburban road a german 42 at arnhem remnants of four battalions fell back in disarray to main divisional positions at oosterbeek here they were gathered into defensive units by lieutenant colonel sheriff thompson co 1st airlanding light artillery regiment who forcibly stopped many of panicked troops middlebrook p326 alarmed that many retreating units would soon leave his own 75 millimetre howitzers undefended he sought out cain most senior officer and ordered him to form men into a defensive screen ahead of gun positions thompson later sent major richard lonsdale to take command of these outlying troops and throughout wednesday 20 they weathered strong german attacks before falling back to main divisional perimeter waddy p134 sector was designated thompson force but was renamed lonsdale force when thompson was wounded following day middlebrook to north and west of oosterbeek other units fell back in face of strong german resistance and over next few days a thumb shaped perimeter formed around town with rhine at its base middlebrook p324 lonsdale force s sector covered southern end of eastern perimeter and cain was one of three majors defending this sector of line as battle progressed he became determined to destroy as much enemy armour as and sited himself in a laundry s garden much to chagrin of dutch owner ryan over coming days cain was everywhere dealing with armour and snipers and encouraging his men waddy p138 on afternoon of thursday 21st two tanks approached cain s position guided by a colleague in a building above him cain waited in a trench until first tank actually a stug iii self propelled gun spg was close enough to engage p343 spg fired at building killing cain s colleague and showering him with masonry but despite this cain kept his position staff sergeant richard long of glider pilot regiment remembered that through clouds of dust cain fired round after round from his piat until spg was disabled but whilst engaging second tank a round exploded in piat with a bright flash and cain was thrown backwards cain recalled thinking he was blind and shouting like a hooligan i shouted to somebody to get onto piat because there was another tank behind i and yelled and used some very colourful language they dragged me off to aid post middlebrook british brought forward one of light regiment s 75mm guns which destroyed tank witnesses believed that cain was incapacitated but within half an hour his sight returned he refused morphia and against all advice returned to front lines deciding that he wasn t wounded enough to stay where he was on following day his eardrums burst from constant firing and barrage but he was content to stuff his ears with bandages and continue fighting on sunday 24th shortly after a truce to allow evacuation of casualties cain was alerted to approach of a tiger tank together with a royal artillery gunner he raced for a 6 pounder anti tank gun manoeuvred it into position fired and disabled tank ryan he wanted to continue using gun but recoil mechanism was destroyed by 25 september area occupied by lonsdale force saw heavy fighting against self propelled guns flamethrower tanks and infantry there were no piats available to force by now instead cain armed himself with a two inch mortar mortars are muzzle loading indirect fire weapons but cain was forced to fire it on an almost horizontal plane due to enemy s proximity his citation states that his leadership ensured that south staffordshire gave no ground and drove enemy off in complete disorder by end of battle cain had been reportedly responsible for destruction or disabling of six tanks four of which were tigers as well as a number of self propelled guns that night division began to withdraw in operation berlin many men shaved and blackened their faces and cain removed a week s growth of beard from his face drying himself on his dirty blood soaked denison smock ryan after successfully crossing rhine this led brigadier pip hicks to comment there s one officer at least who s shaved cain s reply was i was well brought up sir ryan cain made sure all of his men were over river by dawn before he himself crossed

posthumous vcs were announced later including one for lance sergeant john baskeyfield of 2nd south staffordshire battalion s anti tank platoon middlebrook 2nd battalion thus became only british battalion to receive two vcs in one engagement during second world war there are some errors in cain s citation action described as occurring on 20th actually took place on 21st indeed this is day on which lieutenant meikle his spotter in building above was killed and tiger tank he engaged was in fact a stug iii hostilities in europe ended on 8 may 1945 when allies accepted unconditional surrender of nazi germany there were however a large number of german units in norway one of few places in europe still under german control and allies feared german commander there might attempt to fight on
