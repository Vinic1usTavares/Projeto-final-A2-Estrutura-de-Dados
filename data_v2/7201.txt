stafford leak warren july 19 1896 july 26 1981 was an american physician and radiologist who was a pioneer in field of nuclear medicine and best known for his invention of mammogram warren developed technique of producing stereoscopic images of breast with x rays while working in department of radiology at university of rochester school of medicine warren was commissioned as a colonel in united states army medical corps in 1943 and appointed chief of medical section of manhattan engineering district he was responsible for health and safety of thousands of personnel involved in manhattan

project to assess effects of atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1946 he was chief of radiological safety section of joint task force for operation crossroads nuclear test at bikini atoll in 1947 warren became first dean of school of medicine at university of california los angeles ucla under his leadership new school grew from nothing to a major medical school although controversial and opposed by james bryant conant warren would speak out about dangers of nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon castle bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence

warren was born in maxwell new mexico on june 19 1896 he attended university of california berkeley where he earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1918 he married viola lockhart on may 22 1920 their marriage produced two sons and a daughter he went to medical school at university of california san francisco graduating with his doctor of medicine degree in 1922 he then did post doctoral work at johns hopkins school of medicine and harvard university university of rochester warren joined faculty of department of radiology at university of rochester school of medicine in 1926 becoming an assistant professor of medicine department was a new one that had only been founded in 1921 based upon ideals of medical education propounded by abraham flexner in his 1910 flexner report medical school had opened in 1925 and did not graduate its first class until 1929 warren was one of original group that dean george whipple assembled to staff new medical school at rochester warren investigated effects of artificial fever including its possible use for treating infections he was also interested in radiography in 1930 warren became an associate professor of medicine that year he published a study of breast x ray imaging of breast had first been investigated by albert salomon at university of berlin in 1913 he produced images of over 3 000 mastectomy specimens and observed different forms and stages of cancer he was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst however salomon apparently did not appreciate life saving potential of his observations warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue as a result of pregnancy and he developed a stereoscopic technique using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose x ray equipment to his needs his method involved having patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being x rayed in 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases this represented a leap forward as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery it also sparked intense interest in technique around world today mammography saves thousands of lives manhattan project in february 1943 warren met with dr albert k chapman vice president and general manager of eastman kodak brigadier general leslie r groves director of manhattan project and colonel james c marshall commander of manhattan engineer district med they asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked warren to become a civilian consultant for med in march 1943 warren met with major l friedell at med s new york city headquarters friedell had joined metallurgical laboratory in august 1942 from university of california berkeley where he had been involved in radiology research under dr robert s stone friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation warren was unable to provide all information but agreed to initiate research at rochester 300px thumb left survey team from manhattan project in nagasaki october 1945 colonel warren is holding a doll and case given to team by japanese medical commandant of unit alt a group of men in uniforms stand in front of a wooden building one holding a box is very tall towering over asian man next to him friedell recommended that in view of scope of manhattan project a more senior officer be placed in charge in october groves penned a letter to surgeon general of united states army major general norman t kirk requesting that he cooperate with manhattan project in furnishing medical supplies providing funds for medical care of military personnel and directly commissioning warren and other doctors at specified ranks this letter was signed by lieutenant general brehon b somervell and delivered in person by colonel kenneth d nichols who had replaced marshall as district engineer kirk was furious at what he saw as usurpation of his statutory responsibilities as surgeon general when told that warren was man district had in mind to commission as a colonel and apparently familiar with warren s work only from his use of radiation to treat venereal disease asked why do you want that clap doctor warren was duly commissioned as a colonel in united states army medical corps on november 3 1943 he was appointed as chief of med s medical section and medical advisor to director of manhattan project with friedell as his deputy warren s office was initially located in new york city but moved to oak ridge tennessee soon after warren s initial task was to staff hospitals at oak ridge richland washington and los alamos new mexico warren s section was responsible for medical research but also for med s health and safety programs this presented an enormous challenge because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures working with high voltages used in novel ways and performing experiments involving explosives not to mention largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials yet in december 1945 national safety council presented manhattan project with award of honor for distinguished service to safety in recognition of its safety record between january 1943 and june 1945 there were 62 fatalities and 3 879 disabling injuries which was about 62 percent below that of private industry warren was personally responsible for safety aspects of trinity nuclear test on 16 july 1945 at alamogordo new mexico there was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track fallout cloud groves found warren at base camp shortly after explosion and was displeased to discover that warren had been awake for previous 48 hours groves had us navy captain george lyons take over so warren could get some rest fortunately no problems arose with test thumb right upright 250px alt aerial

hiroshima and nagasaki were carried out on 6 and 9 august 1945 on 11 august groves phoned warren and ordered him to organize a survey team and proceed to guam and thence to japan to evaluate effect of atomic bombs and take measures to insure safety of allied troops occupying cities initially survey team was to accompany assault troops of iii amphibious corps and v amphibious corps in invasion of japan but japan surrendered on 14 august day survey team departed san francisco by air survey team arrived on tinian on 17 august where it was split into two parties one under warren and other under friedell warren s party equipped with portable geiger counters arrived in hiroshima by air on 8 september as part of a group headed by brigadier general thomas f farrell that also included brigadier general james b newman jr and japanese rear admiral masao tsuzuki who acted as a translator they remained in hiroshima until 14 september and then surveyed nagasaki from 19 september to 8 october they were impressed by both damage done by atomic bombs and extensive japanese preparations for an american invasion detonation of two atomic bombs in japan raised as many military and questions as they answered a series of nuclear tests was planned codenamed operation crossroads some 42 000 personnel were deployed to bikini atoll as part of admiral william h p s joint task force 1 to conduct test their health and safety was lyons s responsibility but specialised job of radiological safety was handled by manhattan project warren as chief of radiological safety section radsafe planned and implemented measures to assess limit and control impact of radiation teams were given special training at oak ridge in operation of instrumentation to measure radioactivity and interpretation of their readings training was also conducted aboard en route to bikini atoll where it arrived on 12 june 1946 in all some 3 500 personnel were assigned to radsafe warren was appalled by effects of radioactive contamination on environment deadly range of radioactive products from atomic bomb has been clearly demonstrated under controlled conditions he wrote only defense against atomic bombs still lies outside scope of science it is prevention of atomic war warren left army on 6 november 1946 he temporarily became chief of medical section of atomic energy commission civilian agency which succeeded manhattan project in february 1947 he was replaced by dr shields warren for his services with manhattan engineer district warren was awarded army distinguished service medal and legion of merit university of california toward end of world war ii a group of physicians proposed that university of california should establish a medical school in southern california one of them was urologist elmer belt whose patients included governor of california earl warren university of california board of regents voted to establish a medical school as part of university of california at los angeles ucla on october 19 1945 in 1946 california state legislature unanimously voted 7 million to establish new school and earl warren signed it into law in 1947 warren was appointed new school s first dean once again he found himself involved in creating a new medical school his first appointments were three former associates in rochester dr charles carpenter as first professor of infectious disease dr andrew h dowdy as first professor of radiology and dr john s lawrence who had pioneered use of phosphorus 32 as a radioactive tracer as professor of medicine with dr william p longmire jr a 34 year old plastic surgeon from johns hopkins university recruited by lawrence as professor of surgery they became founding five of new school initially new school was accommodated in wartime quonset huts scattered about ucla campus warren was still wearing his army fatigues construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949 by 1951 when first students 26 men and two women arrived there were 15 faculty members by time first class graduated in 1955 there were 43 faculty members ucla medical center opened in 1955 under warren s leadership school grew steadily adding schools of dentistry nursing and public health against some influential opposition warren established his medical school on ucla campus rather than in another part of city he strove to integrate not only structures but faculty with other departments of university he fostered development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between life sciences and health sciences warren became vice chancellor health services in 1962 from 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to president john f kennedy and later lyndon b johnson on mental retardation returning to ucla in 1965 he became
