thumb right 240px protest against name of washington redskins in minneapolis nov 2014 use of terms and images referring to native americans first nations as name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in united states and canada since 1960s as part of indigenous civil rights movements there have been a number of protests and other actions by native americans and their supporters protests target prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as cleveland indians in particular their chief wahoo logo now officially retired and washington redskins term redskins being defined in most american english dictionaries as derogatory slang changes such as retirement of native american names and mascots in a wide array of schools has been a steady trend since 1970s issue is often discussed in media only in terms of offensiveness of certain terms images and performances to individuals of native american heritage which tends to reduce problem to one of feelings and personal opinions this prevents a more comprehensive understanding of history and context of use of native american names and images and reasons why sports teams should eliminate utilization of such terms social science research says that sports mascots and images rather than being mere entertainment are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects accumulation of research on harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights educational athletic and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that use of native american names and or symbols by non native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by native americans defenders of current usage often state their intention to honor native americans by referring to positive traits such as fighting spirit and being strong brave stoic dedicated and proud while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of native americans as savages in general social sciences recognize that all stereotypes whether positive or negative are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute fostering a disrespectful relationship injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals defenders of status quo also state that issue is not important being only about sports and that opposition is nothing more than political correctness which change advocates argue ignores extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias although there has been a steady decline in number of teams doing so native american images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in american and canadian sports and may be found in use at all levels from youth teams to professional sports franchises history european americans have had a history of playing indian that dates back to colonial period in 19th century fraternal organizations such as tammany societies and improved order of red men adopted words and material culture of native americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity while ignoring dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples this practice spread to youth groups such as boy scouts of america bsa in particular order of arrow and many summer camps university students in late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted indian names and symbols for their sports teams not from authentic sources but rather as native american life was imagined by european americans professional team nicknames had similar origins in professional baseball team that is now atlanta braves was founded as boston red stockings in 1871 becoming boston braves in 1912 their owner at that time james gaffney was a member of new york city s political machine tammany hall one of societies formed to honor a chief of delaware team that moved to become washington redskins in 1937 was originally also known as boston braves since football and baseball teams played at braves field after moving to fenway park home of boston red sox team name was changed to boston redskins in 1933 using a red identifier while retaining braves indian head logo while defenders of redskins often cite coach william henry dietz who claimed native american heritage to justify name use of native american names and imagery by this nfl team began in 1932 before hiring dietz in 1933 cleveland indians name originated from a request by club owner charles somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace naps following departure of their star player nap lajoie after 1914 season name indians was chosen as it was one of nicknames previously applied to old cleveland spiders baseball club during time when louis sockalexis a member of penobscot tribe of maine played for cleveland success of boston braves in 1914 world series may have been another reason for adopting an indian mascot story that team is named to honor sockalexis as first native american to play major league baseball cannot be verified from historical documents news stories published to announce selection in 1915 make no mention of sockalexis but do make many racist and insulting references to native americans stereotyping of native americans must be understood in context of history which includes conquest forced relocation and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures such as boarding schools of late 19th and early 20th centuries which separated young native americans from their families in order to educate them as european americans as stated in an editorial by carter meland anishinaabe heritage and david e wilkins lumbee both professors of american indian studies at university of minnesota since first europeans made landfall in north america native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes misconceptions and caricatures whether portrayed as noble savages ignoble savages teary eyed environmentalists or most recently simply as casino rich native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal historical and personal experience into one dimensional representations that tells us more about depicters than about depicted viewpoints native americans in 1940s national congress of american indians ncai created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of native american people in media over time campaign began to focus on indian names and mascots in sports ncai maintains that teams with mascots such as braves and redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of native american people and demean their native traditions and rituals often citing a long held myth by non native people that indian mascots honor native people american sports businesses such as nfl s washington redskins and kansas city chiefs mlb s cleveland indians and atlanta braves and nhl s chicago black hawks continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace several of founders of american indian movement including clyde bellecourt vernon bellecourt dennis banks and russel means were among first to protest names and mascots such as washington redskins and chief wahoo vernon bellecourt also founded national coalition against racism in sports and media in 1989 cornel comanche kiowa professor and director of indigenous nations studies at portland state university cites indigenous mascots as an example of racism which by placing images of native american or first nations people into an invented media context continues to maintain superiority of dominant culture such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism native mascots are also part of larger issues of cultural appropriation and violation of indigenous intellectual property rights which includes all instances where non natives use indigenous music art costumes etc in entertainment and commerce it has been argued that harm to native americans occurs because appropriation of native culture by majority society continues systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize assimilate and oppress indigenous groups some see use of caricatures of native americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization where other minorities would be consulted decisions impacting native americans such as building dakota access pipeline are made while excluding native concerns another incident cited as indicative of misunderstanding of native american legal status because of stereotyping is baby veronica case in which a child was adopted by a white family without consent of her father and enrolled member of cherokee nation not all native americans are united in total opposition to mascots steven denson director of diversity for southern methodist university and member of chickasaw nation while not issuing a blanket endorsement has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use native american mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner he states i believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of native american culture and it must also be done with support of native american community there is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals ncai recognized right of individual tribes to established relationships with teams which allowed them to retain their names social sciences and education damage caused by use of native american mascots particularly in an academic context was stated by society of indian psychologists in 1999 stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures when stereotypical representations are taken as factual information they contribute to development of cultural biases and prejudices clearly a contradiction to educational mission of university in same vein we believe that continuation of use of indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with philosophy espoused by many americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity sports mascots have been cited as an example of everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in comments and actions of other groups in society in 2005 american psychological association apa issued a resolution recommending immediate retirement of american indian mascots symbols images and personalities by schools colleges universities athletic teams and organizations due to harm done by creating a hostile environment negative impact on self esteem of american indian children and discrimination that may violate civil rights it also impacts non natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes preventing learning about native american culture apa states that stereotyping is disrespectful of beliefs traditions and values of native americans similar resolutions have been adopted by north american society for sociology of sport american sociological association american counseling association and american anthropological association in a 2005 report on status of native american students national education association included elimination of indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations in 2018 robert wood johnson foundation announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots such as kansas city and washington football teams for its annual sports award which recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports social science research gives weight to perceptions of those directly affected in particular studies support view that sports mascots and images are not trivial stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self esteem which contribute to all of other issues faced by native americans including suicide unemployment and poverty european americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true but that native americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes two studies examining effect of exposure to an american indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group asian americans which is indicative of a spreading effect exposure to any stereotypes increased likelihood of stereotypical thinking demonstrating harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind a connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing likelihood of stereotyping others was made by native americans opposing indians mascot in skowhegan maine when fliers promoting kkk were distributed in that town civil rights national association for advancement of colored people naacp passed a resolution calling for end of use of native american names images and mascots in 1999 in 2001 u s commission on civil rights released an advisory opinion calling for an end to use of native american images and team names by non native schools while recognizing right to freedom of expression commission also recognizes those native americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots by promoting stereotypes may violate anti discrimination laws when found in educational institutions mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in native american culture have not listened to native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of past and prevent understanding of contemporary native people as fellow americans in a report issued in 2012 a united nations expert on human rights of indigenous peoples cited continued use of native american references by sports team as a part of stereotyping that obscures understanding of reality of native americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes justice murray sinclair head of canada s truth and reconciliation commission said in 2015 sports teams with offensive names such as redskins and cartoonish aboriginal looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past legal remedies while all advocates for elimination of native mascots agree that practice is morally wrong many do not find a basis for legal remedy civil rights law in united states reflect difference between experience of racism by african americans and native americans effects of slavery continued after emancipation in form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor what european americans wanted from native americans was not labor but land and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process difference is reflected in continued popularity of native americans as mascots when similar usage of names and images of any other ethnic group in particular african americans would be unthinkable and continued claim that stereotype of noble savage honors native americans in february 2013 michigan department of civil rights mdcr filed a complaint with us department of education s office for civil rights ocr mdcr s complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of american indian imagery negatively impacts student learning creating an unequal learning environment in violation of article vi of civil rights act of 1964 in june 2013 ocr dismissed case on basis that legal standard required not only harm but intent to do harm which was not established a legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming native american heritage who say they are not offended this raised difficulty of native american identity in united states also an evolving controversy religious organizations in 1992 central conference of american rabbis issued a resolution calling for end of sports teams names that promote racism in particular atlanta braves and washington redskins in 2001 unitarian universalist association passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end use of indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots in 2004 united methodist church also passed a resolution condemning use of native american team names and sports mascots which was highlighted in a meeting of black caucus of that organization in 2007 a group of sixty one religious leaders in washington d c sent a letter to nfl commissioner roger goodell and redskins owner daniel snyder stating their moral obligation to join change mascot movement due to offensive and inappropriate nature of name which causes pain whether or not that is intended members of indian affairs committee of baltimore yearly meeting of society of friends approved a formal statement condemning name of washington football team stating that nfl has violated its core principles for decades by allowing team playing in washington d c to carry name redskins a racist epithet that insults millions of native americans continued use of term encourages and perpetuates persecution disrespect and bigotry against native men women and children torch committee student government organization of sandy spring friends school in maryland suburbs of washington voted to ban any apparel on campus which includes redskins name although logo would continue to be allowed in a meeting march 1 2014 board of directors of central atlantic conference of united church of christ ucc unanimously passed a resolution proposing that its members boycott washington redskins games and shun products bearing team s logo until team changes its name and mascot redskin s spokesman tony wyllie offered a response saying we respect those who disagree with our team s name but we wish united church of christ would listen to voice of overwhelming majority of americans including native americans who support our name and understand it honors heritage and tradition of native american community at its annual meeting in june 2014 membership of ucc also passed a resolution supporting boycott resolution and boycott was passed by national synod of ucc in june 2015 popular opinion thumb right 210px washington redskins logo at fedex field in maryland topic became an issue on a national level in twenty first century with a hearing before us senate committee on indian affairs in 2011 and a symposium at smithsonian national museum of american indian in 2013 in november 2015 president obama speaking at white house tribal nations conference stated names and mascots of sports teams like washington redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of native americans and praised adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of cost of new uniforms mainstream opinion reflects function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology there are many benefits associated with sports fandom both private increased self esteem and public community solidarity activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team name mascot cheerleaders and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences daniel snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family friends and an 81 year tradition as being most important reasons for keeping redskins name when self esteem becomes bound to players and team there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences including denial or rationalization of misbehavior however for some identity being expressed is one of supremacy with defense of native mascots being clearly racist some individuals who support use of native american mascots state that they are meant to be respectful and to pay homage to native american people many have made argument that native american mascots focus on bravery courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory karl swanson then vice president of washington redskins professional football team declared in magazine sports illustrated that his team s name symbolizes courage dignity and leadership and that redskins symbolize greatness and strength of a grand people however many note that behavior of fans at games is not respectful richard lapchick director emeritus of northeastern university s center for study of sport in society in an article could you imagine people mocking african americans in black face at a game yet go to a game where there is a team with an indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces is this not equivalent to black face others claim native american mascots help promote culture to those who might be unaware of its significance chief illiniwek former athletic symbol for university of illinois became subject of protest in 1988 in 1990 board of trustees of university of illinois called mascot a dignified symbol his ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty chief keeps memory of people of a great native american tribe alive for thousands of illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them however mascot costume was not based on clothing of people of illinois confederation but an imitation of clothing of lakota people and first three men to portray illiniwek were not performing authentic native american dances but routines they had learned from other non native hobbyists in boy scouts of america peoria people are closest living descendants of illiniwek confederacy in response to requests by those who had portrayed mascot to bring back occasional performances peoria chief john p froman reaffirmed tribe s position that chief illiniwek was not in any way representative of peoria culture conservative columnists often assert that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals rather than being authentic voice of native americans other team names and ethnic groups many argue there is a double standard in native americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group one current exception is coachella valley high school arabs which has also been subject of controversy resulting in retirement of its more cartoonish representations university of notre dame fighting irish and university of louisiana at lafayette s ragin cajuns are sometimes cited as counter arguments to those that favor change however rather than referring to others these teams employ symbols that european american cultures have historically used to represent themselves university of notre dame mascot university of notre dame dame fighting irish traditions leprechaun university of notre dame athletics is a mythical being that represents irish which is both an ethnic and a national group university of louisiana at lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper an ingredient frequently found in cajun cuisine opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency because it ignores systemic inequality and serves to discount native american voice by saying that if one group isn t hurt by a particular portrayal then no group has right to be hurt regardless of vastly different backgrounds treatment and social positions u s commission on civil rights call for an end to use of native american mascots was only for non native schools in cases where universities were founded to educate native americans such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping examples include fighting indians of haskell indian nations university and university of north carolina at pembroke uncp which continues to have a substantial number of native students and close ties to lumbee tribe uncp nickname is braves but mascot is a red tailed hawk pembroke middle school which also has close ties to lumbee tribe is nicknamed warriors financial impact of change many supporters of native american mascots feel that financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh benefits sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from t shirts to beer generate millions of dollars in sales each year and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items which must be paid out of local school funds is a greater factor for secondary schools opponents feel that despite cost of a change in team mascots it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping clyde bellecourt when director of american indian movement stated it s behavior that accompanies all of this that s offensive rubber tomahawks chicken feather headdresses people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in other all of these have significant meaning for us and psychological impact it has especially on our youth is devastating a study done by emory university goizueta business school indicates that growing unpopularity of native american mascots is a financial drain for professional teams losing money compared to more popular animal mascots in response to statewide ban passed by maine in 2019 marketing expert henry devries writes that teams that continued use of native mascots are on wrong side of history in terms of branding public opinion surveys a survey conducted in 2002 by harris poll for sports illustrated si found that 81 percent of native americans who live outside traditional indian reservations and 53 percent of indians on reservations did not find images discriminatory authors of article concluded that although most native american activists and tribal leaders consider indian team names and mascots offensive neither native americans in general nor a cross section of u s sports fans agree according to article there is a near total disconnect between indian activists and native american population on this issue an indian activist commented on results saying that native americans self esteem has fallen so low that they don t even know when they re being insulted soon after si article a group of five social scientists experienced in researching mascot issue published a journal article arguing against validity of this survey and its conclusions first they state that confidence with which magazine asserts that a disconnect between native american activists and native americans exists on this issue belies serious errors in logic and accuracy made in simplistic labeling of native americans who oppose mascots as activists king c richard native american mascot controversy a handbook p 268 peter harris research group 2002 methodology for sports illustrated survey on use of indian nicknames mascots etc document produced by peter harris research group and shared with ellen in january 2003 more recent surveys rather than addressing larger issue have targeted controversy over name of washington redskins asking if word is offensive or if it should be changed by a large majority 71 89 percent public opinion has maintained that name should not change however more than half 53 59 percent agree that redskin is not an appropriate term for native americans survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of native american opinion was performed in 2004 as part of national annenberg election survey among other questions regarding election year issues respondents who identified themselves as being native american were asked professional football team in washington calls itself washington redskins as a native american do you find that name offensive or doesn t it bother you in response ninety percent replied that name did not bother them while nine percent said that it was offensive and one percent would not answer methods used in this survey and conclusions that can be drawn from it have been criticized by social scientists native american scholars and legal experts for years in may 2016 washington post essentially replicated annenberg poll getting same results while attempting to address some of flaws in earlier poll it received many of same criticisms a flaw unique to polls of native americans is they rely upon self identification to select target population in an editorial in bloomington herald times steve russell an enrolled cherokee citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at indiana university states that both si and annenberg s samples of self identified native americans includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with indians individuals claiming to be native american when they are not is well known in academic research and people claiming indian identity specifically to gain authority in debate over sports mascots has been criticised at center for indigenous peoples studies at california state university san bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as native american was verified finding that 67 agreed with statement that redskins is offensive and racist response from non natives was almost opposite with 68 responding that name is not offensive trends while protests began in 1970s national attention to issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought behaviour of some fans to attention of native americans appearance of atlanta braves in 1991 world series and washington redskins at 1992 super bowl prompted largest response because games were played in minneapolis minnesota which has a large native american population documents most often cited to justify elimination of native mascots are advisory opinion by united states commission on civil rights in 2001 and a resolution by american psychological association in 2005 neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination however issue is often discussed in media in terms of feelings and opinions and prevents full understanding of history and context of use of native american names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated individual school districts have responded to complaints by local native american individuals and tribes or have made changes due to an increased awareness of issue among educators and students new native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition for example in 2016 when one of teams in national college prospects hockey league was announced as lake erie warriors with a caricature mohawk logo it was immediate changed to lake erie eagles little league international has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting use of team names mascots nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive derogatory or discriminatory in nature this decision has been applauded by national congress of american indians in february 2019 us lacrosse issued a position statement which said in part as sport s national governing body us lacrosse believes that misuse of native american nicknames logos and mascots reflect and promote misleading stereotypes that are degrading and harmful to native americans we will make every effort to assure that offensive or stereotypical mascots and logos will not be visible or promoted at events that us lacrosse controls legal and administrative action statewide laws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed in states with significant native american populations including california 2015 colorado 2014 oregon 2012 and michigan 2012 however opposing trend for change in response to tennessee commission of indian affairs seeking a ban though tennessee human rights commission tennessee senate passed a law allowing only elected officials to take any action banning school teams using american indian names and symbols wisconsin law passed in 2010 meant to eliminate race based nicknames logos and mascots was revised in 2013 making change much more difficult in original law a single individual could file a complaint with burden of proof on school to defend their mascot in new law a petition signed by 10 of school district residents is needed and petitioners need to prove discrimination secondary schools and youth leagues secondary schools in both united states and canada have had histories similar to colleges some changing voluntarily while others maintain their current mascots an analysis of a database in 2013 indicates that there are currently more than 2 000 high schools with mascots that reference native american culture compared to around 3 000 fifty years ago while 28 high schools dropped name redskins in 25 years between 1988 and mid 2013 14 schools changed name in years since canada department of educational foundations at university of saskatchewan passed a resolution calling for retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict first nations people in addition to moving to changing their own mascots school boards in ontario are also considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos be they professional or local teams ian an ojibway musician and activist in ottawa ontario filed a human rights complaint against nepean redskins football club on behalf of his five year old daughter in an effort to get team to change its name how are they going to differentiate playing field from school yard what s going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in school yard that s as offensive as using n word assembly of first nations national chief shawn said he supports move because word redskin is offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate team was changed to nepean eagles chosen from 70 suggestions submitted sinclair anishinaabe a writer and assistant professor at university of manitoba applauded decision and contrasted it to decision of daniel snyder washington team owner in 2017 swift current indians baseball club became swift current 57 s united states after receiving statements in opposition to indians name from penobscot nation and aclu of maine school board voted in

junior high braves in lewiston and high school indians school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision due to media coverage of washington redskins high schools with name redskins have received particular attention including three which have a majority of native american students advocates for name conclude that because some native americans use name to refer to themselves it is not insulting however principal of one of these red mesa high school in teec nos pos arizona said that use of word outside american indian communities

boards calling for elimination of native american mascots seneca nation tribal council joined with other members of community in seeking to retain warrior imagery although with individual differences of opinion salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community with warrior identity combining elements negotiated between seneca and non seneca population for example school

stanford cardinal reflecting primary school color that has been used from earliest days while unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is stanford tree another early change was saltine warrior that represented syracuse university from 1931 until 1978 after a brief attempt to use a roman warrior mascot became otto orange for school color miami university began discussion regarding propriety of redskins name and images in 1972 and changed its team nickname to redhawks in 1996 although team name of eastern michigan university changed from hurons to eagles in 1991 change remained controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it in 2012 university president brought back hurons logo which was placed inside a flap of band uniforms along with another historic logo with stated intent of recognizing past however return of hurons logo has prompted protests from native americans at university and in local community who state that old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility marquette university changed their team name from warriors to golden eagles in 1994 school s president stated we live in a different era than when warriors nickname was selected in 1954 perspective of time has shown us that our actions intended or not can offend others we must not knowingly act in a way that others will believe based on their experience to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings also in 1994 st john s university new york changed name of its athletic teams from redmen to red storm after university was pressured by american indian groups who considered term redmen

discussion mascot was changed to skyhawk in 2005 jim associate director of athletics stated twelve years ago college discarded logo that depicted indian with headdress and feathers and stuff we really did not have anything to represent our identity that we were comfortable with we felt that it wasn t appropriate to have a physical representation of a native american as our mascot additionally teams

american imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon principle of tribal sovereignty san diego state university sdsu was not cited by ncaa in 2005 due to a decision that aztecs were not a native american tribe with any living descendants however in february 2017 sdsu native american student alliance nasa supported removal
