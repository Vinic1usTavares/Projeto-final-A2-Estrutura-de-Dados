from october 1988 to september 1994 voices of representatives from sinn fein and several irish republican and loyalist groups were banned by british government from being broadcast on television and radio in united kingdom restrictions announced by home secretary douglas hurd on 19 october 1988 covered eleven organisations based in northern ireland and followed a heightened period of violence in history of troubles as well as government s belief in a need to prevent sinn fein from using media for political advantage broadcasters quickly found ways around ban chiefly by dubbing voice of anyone who was prevented from speaking with voice of an actor legislation did not apply during election campaigns and under certain other circumstances restrictions caused difficulties for british journalists who objected to censorship in various other countries such as iraq and india republic of ireland had its own similar legislation that banned anyone with links to paramilitary groups from airwaves but repealed this in january 1994 this added pressure on british government to do likewise broadcast ban was finally lifted on 16 september 1994 a fortnight after first provisional irish republican army ceasefire background throughout troubles uk broadcasters were regularly required to stop or postpone broadcast of documentaries and other programmes relating to ireland one of most prominent instances of this was 1985 real lives documentary for bbc at edge of union programme featured extensive footage of sinn fein s martin mcguinness and democratic unionist party s gregory campbell discussing troubles and following direct intervention by government it was temporarily blocked from being aired incident led to a one day strike by members of national union of journalists who walked out in protest that bbc s independence was being undermined thumb upright an irish republican anti censorship mural in belfast months leading up to introduction of ban had also seen a particularly intense period of troubles related violence one of bloodiest episodes of that time was ballygawley bus bombing which resulted in deaths of several british soldiers another incident killing of two off duty british soldiers who drove into an ira funeral procession brought media into conflict with government after journalists present at funeral declined a royal ulster constabulary request to hand over footage of incident amid concerns doing so would put them at risk in response prime minister margaret thatcher told house of commons journalists had a duty to assist with investigation either one is on side of justice in these matters or one is on side of terrorism film was subsequently seized from bbc and itn under prevention of terrorism and emergency provisions acts conservative government believed there was a need for it to act to prevent sinn fein from using media to defend actions of ira and measures were part of a wider government response to increase in violence which also included changes to right to silence and tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release further controversy also erupted in september 1988 over an intended edition of channel 4 discussion programme after dark which was to have featured sinn fein president gerry adams as a guest show was dropped after conservative academic paul wilkinson a professor at aberdeen university who specialised in study of terrorism and political violence voiced strong objections to its transmission ban thumb upright left douglas hurd seen here in 2007 introduced measures in october 1988 on 19 october 1988 home secretary douglas hurd issued a notice under clause 13 4 of bbc licence and agreement to bbc and under section 29 3 of broadcasting act 1981 to independent broadcasting authority prohibiting broadcast of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven irish political and military organisations ban prevented uk news media from broadcasting voices though not words of ten irish republican and ulster loyalist paramilitary groups as well as sinn fein among other groups affected were provisional ira irish national liberation army ulster defence association and ulster volunteer force although ban was targeted primarily at sinn fein addressing house of commons on ban hurd said terrorists themselves draw support and sustenance from access to radio and television time has come to deny this easy platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism while conservative prime minister margaret thatcher said it would deny terrorists oxygen of publicity 1981 act allowed home secretary to introduce measures in event of a public interest issue a parliamentary debate was not required though hurd acquiesced to one and issue was discussed in house of commons on 2 november 1988 opposition labour party introduced an amendment condemning government s decision as incompatible with a free society but it was rejected despite some conservative mps voting with labour legislation was condemned by national council for civil liberties national union of journalists planned a one day strike in protest at ban for 10 november but action was called off after its members failed to reach consensus a group of broadcast journalists subsequently launched a legal challenge to overturn ban but in may 1989 high court decided home secretary had acted lawfully a later hearing at appeal court upheld that decision in december 1989 hurd s belief was that ban would place print and broadcast media on a level footing but opponents of restrictions argued they were affecting quality of news reporting from northern ireland and consequently people s understanding of issues broadcaster scarlett mcgwire one of those to challenge regulations said in 1989 case is not just about journalists and being able to report northern ireland properly it is about people not being able to understand what is happening there because it is not reported properly marmaduke hussey chairman of bbc called ban a very dangerous precedent a petition organised by campaign for press and broadcasting freedom and including signatures of 50 mps was presented at 10 downing street on first anniversary of its commencement implementation media outlets were usually left to interpret restrictions in their own way and ban s remit was at first applied retrospectively to archive material though this was later relaxed following government advice in 2005 john birt a former director general of bbc said hurd s announcement came right out of blue while danny morrison who in 1988 was director of publicity for sinn fein spoke of total confusion that resulted i asked television and radio journalists what can be done was initially used but one of main ways new law was circumvented was by substituting voices of actors for those who could not speak directly bbc and its commercial counterparts compiled a list of actors who could be called upon to record voiceovers for news items and documentaries about troubles often at short notice actors frequently spoke words in real time along with person whose voice was being dubbed one such interview with gerry adams once appeared on us cnn network without anyone realising they were hearing an actor speak restrictions were also applied to television drama documentary and discussion programmes in december 1988 secretary of state for northern ireland tom king ordered channel 4 to cancel an episode of us drama series lou grant that featured story of a fictional ira even though it had aired previously mother ireland a 1988 documentary about women and irish nationalism that included an interview with farrell subsequently shot dead during an sas operation in gibraltar was also initially banned when screened by channel 4 during a season about censorship in april 1991 farrell s words on republicanism were muted with on screen subtitles on a later occasion appearance of political activist bernadette devlin on an edition of bbc s nation discussing reasons for political violence was also censored when much of what she said was subtitled county sound a radio station in surrey dropped an interview with errol smalley a campaigner for guildford four although he made a later appearance after overturning decision in november 1988 streets of sorrow birmingham six a song by pogues expressing support for birmingham six and guildford four was subject to regulations because it included general disagreement with way in which british government responds to and courts deal with terrorist threat in uk however ban was not always enforced restrictions were briefly lifted during 1992 general election allowing a political debate between sinn fein president gerry adams and social democratic and labour party leader john hume to be heard during election campaign but ban resumed once polls were closed even preventing adams reaction to loss of his parliamentary seat from being directly aired an individual s real voice could also be broadcast if news item in question did not directly relate to their political beliefs or paramilitary activities similarly anyone subject to restrictions who was an eyewitness to an event or incident could be heard in february 1992 voice of gerard mcguigan a sinn fein councillor was broadcast when he spoke about an attack on his house by ulster defence association adams was also allowed to speak about a similar attack against his property on another occasion journalist peter taylor was given access to inmates at maze prison for a documentary about jail but while prisoners were allowed to speak freely about their personal lives a complaint by ira prisoners food spokesman concerning size of prison s sausage rolls had to be revoiced in 2005 francis welch a television producer described incident as one that highlighted surreal nature of restrictions lifting of regulations thumb upright prime minister john major lifted restrictions in 1994 thatcher s successor as prime minister john major announced a review of regulations in november 1993 telling house of commons that general belief within conservative party was that interviews with those subject to restrictions were being stretched to limit and perhaps beyond his decision followed a television interview with gerry adams which a conservative mp jill knight described as having caused offence to a great number of people conservative backbenchers and unionist mps wanted more rigid restrictions and irish times reported a widespread feeling that major favoured a complete ban but that journalists were opposed to this it quoted bbc s john simpson who said that reporting events from northern ireland would become virtually impossible at that time coverage of northern ireland related topics was becoming more frequent with increasing pace of peace process review was conducted by secretary of state for heritage peter brooke in february 1994 major s government decided to maintain status quo pressure to reverse restrictions grew after statutory instruments of section 31 of irish government s broadcasting authority act 1960 lapsed in january 1994 these had prohibited radio and television interviews with representatives of paramilitary groups and sinn fein i e broadcasting authority act 1960 section 31 order 1977 s i no 7 1977 to broadcasting authority act 1960 section 31 order 1993 s i no 1 1993 from that point anyone in northern ireland with access to republic of ireland s state broadcaster rte could hear voices of anyone still banned from airwaves by uk regulations responding to dublin government s decision gerry adams said over 20 years of political censorship has served to stunt any hopes of a resolution of conflict it has denied right of information good riddance regulations particularly came under spotlight during a visit adams made to united states in 1994 where he gave a speech that was widely broadcast around world but had to be dubbed in uk because of ban in may 1994 national union of journalists launched a legal challenge with european commission of human rights seeking to take british government to court for breach of freedom of expression under european convention of human rights but case was rejected a similar challenge brought against irish government in 1991 over its broadcast ban had also been thrown out uk ban was lifted on 16 september 1994 a fortnight after first ira ceasefire was declared on same day major announced that ten roads linking northern ireland with republic which had been closed by british security forces would reopen and promised any negotiated deal on future of northern ireland s governance would be subject to a referendum deputy leader of sinn fein martin mcguinness gave his first direct interview to ulster television shortly after restrictions ceased decision to end ban was welcomed by broadcasters michael grade who was then chief executive of channel 4 said it had ended one of most embarrassing attempts to censor coverage of most important domestic political story of post war years while john birt commented we can once again apply normal and testing scrutiny to all sides in debate sinn fein also signalled their approval but ban s lifting was viewed with more caution by unionist politicians peter robinson of democratic unionist party felt decision was premature while ira remained an armed organisation it gives de facto recognition to a body of men who still have their guns and bombs under table who still reserve right to murder if they don t get their way analysis thumb upright left bbc foreign correspondent john simpson encountered difficulties while reporting from iraq because of restrictions francis welch producer of speak no evil a 2005 bbc documentary that discusses restrictions argued that legislation added pressure to process of reporting events in northern ireland while sinn fein s danny morrison believed ban was a weapon of war used by government in an attempt to silence republican movement however norman a former conservative mp said that media was giving sinn fein and ira publicity that they shouldn t have had peter robinson of democratic unionist party argued use of legislation was a legitimate weapon for state to use in 1994 tony hall head of bbc s news and current affairs argued that restrictions did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to rules as subtle changes to their voices could not be heard in particular he cited example of appearance of gerry adams on bbc s on record in september 1993 in which he spoke about prospect of peace in northern ireland hall said adams was nervous and defensive throughout interview as presenter sheena mcdonald argued that peace could not be achieved while ira continued its violent stance but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of discussion he also said that some countries such as india and egypt had quoted restrictions to bbc journalists who complained about over use of censorship by authorities in those countries additionally hall argued that sinn fein and ira had manipulated ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews bbc foreign affairs editor john simpson encountered similar difficulties on issue of censorship while reporting from iraq during gulf war in 1990 91 when i worked in baghdad officials there always used to mention our sinn fein ban if you criticised their censorship i don t like to see this country appearing on same side of dividing line as saddam hussein on anything at all at a conference on reporting of northern ireland related issues at university of london in november 1993 chaired by irish journalist mary holland several participants claimed it was undermining practice of investigative reporting research by glasgow media group indicates that coverage of sinn fein by bbc before ban was minimal in 1988 sinn fein was only heard or seen on television 93 times had only 17 of 633 formal bbc interviews as compared to 121 interviews with conservative party and 172 with royal ulster constabulary and civil service and were never interviewed in studio like many other participants however after ban there was a steep decline in coverage of sinn fein and republican views with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in following year and delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities voice overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely see also bbc controversies censorship in united kingdom notes b featured in an episode of derry girls
