premises for a bright future relationships within band were not so idyllic soon after release of decipher after forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist mark jansen and rest of band mark jansen had been main composer of band together with sander gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on musical style of after forever s first two albums prison of desire 2000 and decipher moreover his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs often collected under a common title e g embrace that smothers and my pledge of allegiance in next album mark jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments choruses in latin and death metal elements while gommans and others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music retaining some elements that made sound of band recognizable but expanding it in new and different directions these musical differences led to mark jansen leaving band in what he felt as an actual dismissal he quickly formed another band called sahara dust which later developed into symphonic metal band epica his place was taken by bas maas who had been guitar technician for after forever during tours of 2001 and 2002 august and september 2002 were dedicated to a european tour supporting finnish act and attending some rock festivals which exposed band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press further media exposure came from floor jansen s collaboration with dutch multi

2003 containing an instrumental track three new songs and two covers in jansen s words ep exordium was like an introduction to this new full length album and subjects of lyrics are already connected to concept meaning they are also dealing with modern social problems reviewers noticed some musical changes in new work but some of them suspended their judgement waiting for a full album to express their opinions about new course of after forever concept and storyline concept of invisible circles was shaped by after forever s singer and lyricist floor jansen taking inspiration from sander gommans job as an art teacher his daily contact with children with social and family problems had given him desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs he

circles tour in south america in august 2005 critical and commercial reception after almost unanimous praise received by album decipher and perplexities raised by new musical direction of ep exordium there were great expectations for new album by fans and specialized press alike complexity of music and concept of invisible circles produced mixed reviews ranging from highest praise to complete failure even in same publication bold move of making a concept album about such a controversial matter was generally appreciated but as eduardo rivadavia said in his allmusic review this could be a slightly overambitious creation maximum metal reviewer states that concept albums are always hard to pull off and not many bands can do it well and here is another failed attempt it was general opinion of most reviewers that floor jansen s lead vocals are at her best and her performance here is powerful dramatic and very impressive overall no matter how she chooses to sing however her lyrics were sometimes considered a weak point of album despite fact that band placed as much emphasis on them as they did on music sam grant of sonic cathedral webzine considered them trite and disappointing in particular spoken dialogue by somerville and lansford was generally considered badly acted and detrimental to music which on contrary was generally considered strong point of album change of musical direction with introduction of progressive metal elements and many variations of style adopted in songs were generally praised to point that a metal storm reviewer compares after forever to symphony x with floor jansen on vocals only a few reviewers remained nostalgic of gothic and symphonic sound of decipher and denounced a lack of direction and too much confusion in music of album
