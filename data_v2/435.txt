action series in august 2010 a reporter from entertainment website afterelton also stated to shows executive producers that some of their readers had been upset and concerned about details of storyline pullman s casting as danes was announced on 15 december 2010 prior to his role as danes pullman was best known to audiences for his portrayal of president of united states in independence day when pullman asked executive producer julie gardner why production team sought to cast him in role she replied that it was because he was perceived as america s sweetheart which he interpreted to mean they were looking to destabilise viewers torchwoods creator russell t davies noted that upon expressing an interest in casting pullman he was told you haven t got a chance though pullman was aware of torchwood having had a friend who d series he had not watched series before being cast upon reading scripts pullman commented that he had been impressed at how well series knows itself and strength of each character s individual voice in an interview with zap2it he remarked that he thought he was given best role in series pullman noted that he was prepared for role having played other troubled characters in past and re iterated that it was writing that attracted him to part adding i don t think i could do a child murderer just for a child murderer s sake io9 felt character of danes to be a cross between freddy krueger and jesus commenting on christ comparison pullman felt that his character was sort of doppelganger of jesus or something he stated of danes it s like he s been out in desert and he comes back in and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride sfx described danes journey as one from a hannibal lecter type character to a billy graham or messianic figure pullman observed that oswald s failure to die becomes pivot for a whole world that has changed feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear discussing danes fall from grace series writer jane espenson explains that humanity doesn t seize on heroes for long term and that danes descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic though danes dies helping torchwood team espenson remarked that we didn t want to outright redeem this horrible horrible man commenting that his death is intended as redemption and comeuppance both independents neela debnath observed that whilst character of danes had become likeable in an odd sort of way his last scenes reiterated just how despicable he was and that it was right time for him to depart cast reception charlie jane anders of io9 commented enthusiastically on danes portrayal stating that perhaps greatest miracle in torchwood miracle day is bill pullman s performance anders cited that character s journey seems bizarre and unlikely but pullman makes it work mikey o connell from zap2it likened pullman s performance to that of john lithgow as trinity killer in dexter both having sense of familiar comforting actor you ve watched for decades being hijacked by someone else in a review of first episode dan martin from guardian opined that pullman stole show as manipulative psychopath oswald danes predicting his character might give us one of most compelling narratives reviewing fifth episode of series independents neela debnath said of pullman that thus far he has given an extraordinary turn as danes which at times has veered towards hammy territory but has never entered it however debnath felt that with a key sequence where danes makes a public speech line was finally crossed believing sequence cliched and that it was improbable that he could instantaneously win over an angry lynch mob in moments daily telegraphs gavin fuller praised pullman s portrayal of danes singling it out as strongest of series next to lead female actor eve myles fuller also felt that giving such an unlikeable character a prominent focus and allowing him a shot at redemption in final episode was certainly a brave move from davies in a post series review of what worked and what did not during torchwood s fourth series digital spys morgan jeffrey stated that bill pullman made most of his tenure as oswald danes being both extremely charismatic and utterly repellent throughout jeffrey stated that we never like oswald but pullman s layered performance ensures that we do often sympathise with him before having rug pulled swiftly out from under us as he commits yet another heinous crime for his performance as danes pullman received a saturn award
