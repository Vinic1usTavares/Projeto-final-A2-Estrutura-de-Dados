development halo 3 was initially conceived before halo 2 was released in 2004 much of staff were preoccupied in making extra content for halo 2 while others continued with groundwork for development of halo 3 bungie remained quiet as to what their new project was leaving comments in their weekly update alluding to a new project game was officially announced with a real time cinematic trailer at e3 2006 bungie kept public informed on game development via weekly updates on their web site during development game was divided into single player and multiplayer builds this made debugging and testing much smaller multiplayer files quicker while details of halo 3s multiplayer were widely disseminated in sixteen months leading up to release single player aspect of storyline was kept relatively secret throughout much of development to build up interest first campaign screenshots did not appear until a year after announcement trailer on july 5 2007 as a tease for planned pace of marketing a public beta test of game s online multiplayer features as well as saved films and file share took place four months before full release players required a crackdown disc to play beta ai behavior was enhanced and improved behavior of enemy brutes player faces was modified giving them a pack mentality that causes aliens to perform similar actions at same time and altering gameplay graphics halo 3 utilizes a proprietary in house graphics engine as detailed on bungie website it employs advanced graphics technologies such as high dynamic range global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes motion blurring was absent from beta but was added to final game most of dynamic objects in game cast real time shadows on themselves and environment around them including game s plant life halo 3 uses normal bump and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing number of polygons players can see distances of up to away all fully three dimensional real time reflections were written into engine however they are often unused as bungie considered it a waste of resources halo 3 does not natively render at true hd resolution at least 720 lines of vertical resolution in a bungie weekly update it was confirmed that game renders at resolution instead of usual hd resolution that most xbox 360 games use this is because halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of usual one so lower resolution allowed bungie to preserve as much of dynamic range as possible for game s lighting without adversely affecting frame rate image can be upscaled to 1080p by xbox 360 audio as with all titles on xbox 360 halo 3 fully supports 5 1 surround sound audio in game there are over 50 000 pieces of audio with nearly 40 000 of those being npc dialogue this is far more than in either of preceding halo titles halo 2 had over 15 000 pieces of dialogue ai controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure exchanges flow naturally and convincingly separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in public beta and finished game uses waves audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in game depending on conditions distant gunfire sounds which may first seem like pre recorded ambient sound may often be result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in game marty o donnell again composed original score for game some pieces of game s music are produced with a much larger real orchestra than any pieces in prior two games for example music for announcement trailer was recorded with a 60 piece orchestra and a 24 piece choir halo 3 is first game in series to feature custom soundtracks allowing players to replace in game music with their own choices halo 3 original soundtrack

everything we hoped it would be and much much more reviewers including eurogamers rob fahey gamesradar s charlie barrett and gamespot s jeff gerstmann felt that underlying formula of previous halo games was unchanged but that this was not a detriment every type of halo fan from hardcore to casual to brand new will find something to satisfy them in master chief s third adventure barrett asserted while ign s hilary goldstein referred to halo 3 as most complete game available on any console specifically stating forge and replay functionality raise bar for console shooters so high it may never be surpassed this generation gameplay additions to game such as equipment and new vehicles were praised gerstmann and goldstein noted that equipment had much more relevance in multiplayer matches than campaign reception of single player aspect varied yin poole wrote that while cliffhanger ending of halo 2 was disappointing campaign of halo 3 was much more satisfying gerstmann gamespy s gabe graziani and goldstein maintained that campaign was too short especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co op goldstein was highly critical of eighth level stating penultimate chapter is so bad just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth new york times charles herold said game had a throwaway plot and total video games judged single player aspect ultimately disappointing goldstein and steve west of cinema blend thought a part of game s story was lost by not having arbiter featuring as prominently as character was in halo 2 most publications agreed that multiplayer was by far one of best features ign said that multiplayer map lineup was strongest of series and gamespy added that each multiplayer map is extremely well tuned forge level editor and saved films features were singled out as particularly strong features in addition to superb voice acting and martin o donnell s rich score other complaints focused on artificial
