lavochkin la 152 all lavochkin s jet aircraft were referred to in house and at government level as izdeliye item or product 152 etc usaf reporting name type 4 parsch andreas and aleksey v martynov designations of soviet and russian military aircraft and missiles designation systems net 2008 retrieved 19 august 2011 and its variants was a jet fighter prototype designed and manufactured by lavochkin design bureau okb shortly after end of world war ii derived from lavochkin la 150 152 used several different engines but program was canceled as other fighters with more powerful engines and swept wings showed more promise design and development izdeliye 152 following limited success of 150 drastic changes were introduced to improve performance and ease of maintenance rd 10 engine rated at of thrust was moved to front of nose and its cowling formed bottom of forward fuselage this position minimized thrust losses due to length of intake duct and allowed engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor cockpit was widened and moved to a position over mid set wings even with engine s exhaust nozzle pilot s seat back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of of fuel removable mid mounted wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span each wing had a single spar slotted flaps and ailerons tricycle undercarriage retracted into fuselage which meant that aircraft had a very narrow ground track aircraft was armed with three nudelman suranov ns 23 autocannon two on starboard side of aircraft s nose and other on port side each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition gordon 2002 pp 109 112 152 made its first flight on 5 december 1946 and manufacturer s trials completed on 23 june 1947 state acceptance trials commenced on 12 july but prototype crashed on eighth flight when engine failed on approach maximum speed attained by 152 before its crash was only izdeliye 154 lavochkin okb decided to improve performance of 152 in late 1946 by replacing rd 10 engine with a more powerful lyulka tr 1 turbojet of thrust design work was completed in september 1947 and construction began of a prototype shortly afterward but engine was not yet ready for testing and project was canceled only other significant difference from 152 was that each cannon was furnished with 75 rounds of ammunition gordon 2002 pp 109 110 112 izdeliye 156 meanwhile okb had been developing two afterburning versions of rd 10 to increase engine s power more successful model was only longer and weighed an additional more than original engine its power however was increased by an additional over 30 more thrust this engine was designated izdeliye yuf by some sources refer to both this engine and yakovlev s afterburning version of rd 10 as rd although they had two different afterburner designs and was fitted into an aircraft 152 prototype in november 1946 initially designated as second this was changed to aircraft 156 following month gordon 2002 pp 106 107 109 110 in addition to more powerful engine aircraft now had an ejection seat additional cockpit armor and a revised canopy more importantly it was fitted with new wings with a greater span and more surface area they also had a new airfoil designed to delay mach tuck area of tailplane and vertical stabilizer was also increased two prototypes were built and first one was completed in february 1947 and made its first flight on 1 march second prototype joined manufacturer s trials later that month one of these aircraft participated in tushino flypast on 3 august 1947 gordon 2002 pp 110 113 where it was given usaf reporting name of type 5 additional power increased aircraft s top speed by over 152 second prototype began state acceptance trials on 9 september and demonstrated a maximum speed of at an altitude of it could reach in four minutes using afterburner aircraft was rejected by soviet air forces when trials were concluded on 28 january 1948 report said that yuf engine was required more work before it was ready for production aircraft had problems with longitudinal stability excessive stick forces from ailerons and elevators and undercarriage was troublesome lavochkin consequently canceled program gordon 2002 pp 113 114 izdeliye 174tk an experimental version of izdeliye 156 was built in 1947 under name of izdeliye 174tk thin wing it had a very thin straight wing of 6 thickness believed to be thinnest yet flown in world and an imported rolls royce derwent v engine rated at mounted in nose three ns 23 cannon had to be repositioned on bottom of nose to accommodate engine it was first flown in january 1948 and had a top speed of at sea level it reached an altitude of 5 000 meters in only 2 5 minutes but even these impressive gains over 156 were inferior to swept wing lavochkin la 160 that had flown nine months earlier and program was canceled variants izdeliye 154 a second 152 airframe with a lyulka tr 1 turbojet canceled due to delays with engine izdeliye 156 originally known as aircraft a modified 152 with a yuf engine an afterburning version of rd 10 gordon 2002 pp 106 107 109 110 113 114 izdeliye 174tk a thin wing version of 156 with a rolls royce derwent engine but performance was already overshadowed by lower powered aircraft 160 so further development abandoned gunston 1995 p 168 specifications izdeliye 156 right 400px alt three line drawings of an aircraft top left hand drawing depicting a top view
