columbia slough is a narrow waterway about long in floodplain of columbia river in u s state of oregon from its source in portland suburb of fairview columbia slough meanders west through gresham and portland to willamette river about from willamette s confluence with columbia it is a remnant of historic wetlands between mouths of sandy river to east and willamette river to west levees surround much of main slough as well as many side sloughs detached sloughs and nearby lakes drainage district employees control water flows with pumps and floodgates tidal fluctuations cause reverse flow on lower slough columbia floodplain formed by geologic processes including lava flows volcanic eruptions and missoula floods is part of portland basin which extends across columbia river from multnomah county oregon into clark county washington five percent of oregon s population about 158 000 people live in slough watershed of about municipal wells near upper slough provide supplemental drinking water to portland and nearby cities cities drainage districts county and a regional government metro have overlapping jurisdictions in watershed a regional agency operates portland international airport along middle slough and marine terminals near lower slough oregon department of environmental quality deq and city s bureau of environmental services bes deal with environmental issues long before non indigenous people explored region tribes of native americans fished and hunted along slough in early 19th century fur trappers and explorers including lewis and clark visited area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from east newcomers farmed cut timber built houses and by early 20th century established cities shipping ports roads rail lines and industries near slough increased investment in floodplain led to larger losses during floods and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered area a flood pouring through a levee break in 1948 destroyed city of vanport which was never rebuilt used as a waste repository during first half of 20th century and cut off from columbia river by levees slough became one of oregon s most polluted waterways early attempts to mitigate pollution which included raw sewage and industrial waste were unsuccessful however in 1952 portland began sewage treatment and over next six decades federal clean water act and similar legislation mandated further cleanup state and local governments often assisted by community volunteers undertook projects related to public health natural resources and recreation in a region with many homes industries businesses and roads businesses and industries in watershed employ about 57 000 people which is also frequented by more than 150 bird species and 26 fish species and animals including otters beaver and coyotes one of nation s largest freshwater urban wetlands smith and bybee wetlands natural area shares lower slough watershed with a sewage treatment plant marine terminals a golf course and a car racetrack watercraft able to portage over culverts and levees can travel entire length of slough 40 mile loop and other hiking and biking trails follow waterways and connect

roughly portland basin which lies at northern end of willamette valley of oregon and extends north into clark county in state of washington region is underlain by solidified lavas of columbia river basalt group that are up to 16 million years old covered by later alluvial deposits basalts lie more than below surface within basin about 10 million years ago eruptions of cascade range volcanoes to east sent flows of mud ash and eroded volcanic debris into columbia which was powerful enough to carry material downstream deposited above basalt during miocene and early pliocene these loose sands and gravels formed part of what is known as troutdale formation extending to tualatin river valley to south and into clark county on north formation is an aquifer that is primary source of drinking water for vancouver in washington and an auxiliary source for portland portland basin is being pulled slowly apart between faults in tualatin mountains west hills on west side of portland east bank fault along east side of willamette river and other fault systems near gresham further east about 3 million years ago many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through thin stretched crust of basin and in cascade foothills to southeast ash cinders and debris from these boring lava field volcanoes added another layer of sediment to troutdale formation about 15 000 years ago cataclysmic ice age events known as missoula floods or bretz floods originating in clark fork region of northern idaho inundated columbia river basin many times these floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment water filled entire columbia gorge to overflowing and turned willamette valley into a lake long wide and deep floodwaters ripped face off rocky butte in portland and deposited a gravel bar alameda ridge that runs parallel to and slightly south of columbia slough faults associated with expanding portland basin are capable of producing significant earthquakes more than a thousand earthquakes many too small to be felt have been recorded in basin since 1841 stronger ones reached about magnitude 5 on richter scale in 1892 one estimated at magnitude 5 shook downtown portland for about 30 seconds in 1962 one centered about north of portland was estimated at between magnitude 4 9 and 5 2 hydrology rainfall and runoff based on records from 1961 to 1990 watershed s average annual precipitation as measured at portland international airport is about about falls from november through february and only about from june through september since temperatures are normally below freezing fewer than 30 days a year most of this precipitation reaches ground as rain historically most rain falling on watershed was taken up by vegetation flowed into wetlands soaked into ground or evaporated heavy rain in winter months recharged groundwater and provided to slough during dry summers urban development which replaced vegetation and water absorbing soils with airport runways house roofs highways warehouses parking lots and other hard surfaces interrupted this cycle in 1999 a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54 percent of watershed storm runoff that might have taken days to reach historic slough reaches developed slough in hours main channel until 20th century slough and its side channels and associated ponds and lakes were part of active columbia river floodplain when historic river was high slough received water from it near big four corners about from slough s mouth in 1917 landowners formed three drainage districts peninsula drainage district no

thumb alt chinook people lived on both sides of lower columbia river from a mountain range east of portland oregon to river s mouth on ocean traditional chinook tribal territory is shown in dark green in lower columbia river basin including columbia slough clackamas tribe of chinooks fished and hunted along slough until mid 19th century archeological evidence suggests that native americans lived along lower columbia river as early as 10 000 years ago including near what later became dalles on columbia river about east of columbia slough by 2 000 to 3 000 years ago clackamas indians had settled along clackamas river which empties into willamette river about south of slough clackamas tribe was a subgroup of chinookan speakers who lived in columbia river valley from celilo falls to pacific ocean clackamas lands included lower willamette river from willamette falls at what later became oregon city to willamette s confluence with columbia river columbia river floodplain near mouth of willamette contained many stream channels lakes and wetlands that flooded annually chinookan tribes hunted and fished there and traveled between two big rivers via protected waters of slough their main food sources were salmon sturgeon and camas in 1792 lieutenant william broughton a british explorer led first trip by non natives as far up columbia river as mouth of sandy river he and his men camped on sauvie island which lies between willamette and columbia rivers directly opposite mouth of slough broughton encountered many chinookans while exploring and mapping geographic features including hayden island and other islands in columbia just north of slough when lewis and clark visited area in 1806 clackamas tribe consisted of about 1 800 people living in 11 villages explorers estimated that 800 people of multnomah tribe of chinookans lived in five villages on sauvie island in 1825 hudson s bay company established its western administrative headquarters at fort vancouver across columbia river from slough british fort became center for fur trading and other commerce throughout pacific northwest including what would later become state of oregon by 1830s smallpox malaria measles and other diseases carried by non indigenous explorers and traders had reduced native population by up to 90 percent throughout lower columbia basin united states gained control over oregon territory including fort vancouver portland basin and slough by treaty with great britain in 1846 by 1851 clackamas tribe s population had fallen to 88 and in 1855 tribe signed a treaty surrendering

portland had become main livestock market for pacific northwest these and other early 20th century businesses including stockyards a dairy farm a shingle company and a lumber mill flushed waste products into slough starting in 1910 north portland s residential sewage also poured into slough through pipes laid for purpose in 1917 landowners along slough had formed three drainage districts to control floods they dug ditches deepened existing water channels and built levees to keep rivers and slough from flooding agricultural industrial and commercial property hoping to flush slough with clean water from river city engineers created crosscutting peninsula canal project largely failed because daily tides reversed slough s flow and because both ends of canal were at nearly same elevation over next 30 years more lumber and wood products companies opened along slough and tugboats moved log rafts up and down waterway truck freight and other transportation companies built in watershed city created st johns landfill on wetlands and small channels off lower slough and built a new portland airport on land along middle slough activists and civic leaders concerned about pollution on willamette river led cleanup campaigns but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment pollution eventually grew so bad on slough that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water world war ii and after after start of war with japan president franklin d roosevelt signed an order for internment of all people of japanese ancestry who lived on west coast about 1 700 of them lived in portland and some had farms or businesses near slough when government removed them from their homes in 1942 it housed them temporarily in livestock exposition center expo center

watershed continued through rest of century in 1964 port of portland interested in industrial development began to fill smith bybee and ramsey lakes with dredge sands from columbia in 1970s oregon legislature passed a law against filling smith or bybee lakes below a contour line above mean sea level except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat plans for a willamette river greenway project proposed by oregon governor tom mccall in late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored slough some planners argued that slough was so filthy that more industry was all it was good for they portrayed cleanup as a lofty but impractical goal at oregon s request u s congress stripped slough of its navigable status in 1978 this ended channel dredging on slough which could then be used for recreation other laws affecting slough in 1970s and beyond were federal clean water act and oregon comprehensive land use planning act in 1986 a
