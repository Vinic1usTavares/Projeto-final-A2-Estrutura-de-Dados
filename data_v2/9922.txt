hurricane marty was a tropical cyclone that produced heavy rains and flooding in several states in southwestern and western mexico twentieth named storm and twelfth hurricane of annual hurricane season marty developed from a tropical wave on september 26 2015 to southwest of acapulco guerrero in mexico initially a tropical depression system strengthened into a tropical storm early on following day due to favorable atmospheric conditions marty continued to intensify but wind shear sharply increased as storm approached a large mid to upper level trough despite this cyclone deepened further becoming a hurricane on september 28 and peaking with sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h shortly thereafter wind shear quickly took its toll on hurricane weakening it to a tropical storm early on september 29 about 24 hours later marty degenerated into a post tropical low pressure area offshore guerrero low further degenerated into a trough later on september 30 and eventually dissipated on october 4 in anticipation of storm tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in states of guerrero and michoacan flooding occurred particularly in guerrero where areas near acapulco observed of rainfall there were several landslides and over 300 homes in municipality of coyuca de benitez were flooded remnants also caused severe flooding in sonora about 800 homes and 400 vehicles were damaged in city of guaymas alone total damage in state reached mxn 500 million us 30 million meteorological history thumb map plotting track and intensity of storm according to saffir simpson hurricane wind scale left a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa on september 10 tracking westward wave split into two portions with slower moving northern portion ultimately developing into atlantic tropical depression nine on september 16 southern portion crossed venezuela and colombia and emerged into pacific where a large area of deep convection began to form a well defined low pressure area developed on september 26 and organized into a tropical depression by 18 00 utc 1 p m cdt same day while situated about 335 mi 540 km southwest of acapulco guerrero six hours later after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using dvorak technique showed a slight increase in intensity depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named marty by national hurricane center nhc at time storm was moving slowly northward due to influence of a large mid to upper level trough located in a favorable environment of sea surface temperatures around and low vertical wind shear marty strengthened steadily early on september 27 nhc noted that rapid intensification was possible however as marty neared base of trough westerly vertical wind shear increased rapidly causing low level circulation center to be partially exposed despite hostile wind shear cyclone reformed a central dense overcast and intensified into a hurricane by 12 00 utc 7 a m cdt on september 28 as a mid level eye feature was seen in microwave satellite imagery operationally nhc upgraded marty to a hurricane nine hours later after a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed hurricane force winds at 18 00 utc marty attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 987 mbar hpa 29 15 inhg computer forecast models indicated that storm would pass within just 25 mi 40 km of southwestern mexican coast on september 29 or september 30 turning north and northeast while under influence of aforementioned trough marty began to weaken soon after peak intensity as deep convection was displaced to east due to strong westerly shear low level circulation center became fully exposed in a span of three hours late on september 28 upwelling of cooler waters further decayed deep convection prompting nhc to downgrade marty to a tropical storm at 06 00 utc 1 a m cdt on september 29 continuing to steadily weaken marty degenerated into a post tropical low a day later about 140 mi 225 km west southwest of acapulco while still producing gale force winds shallow system turned westwards in low level flow and eventually opened up into a trough twelve hours later about 195 mi 315 km west of acapulco low became closed once again on october 1 however it failed to produce sufficient organized deep convection to re qualify as a tropical cyclone it turned north northeastwards towards southern gulf of california however it dissipated before reaching coast of western mexico remnant moisture continued into northwestern mexico and caused flooding in sonora preparations and impact thumb right nhc s five day forecast track for hurricane marty at 2 00 p m pdt 21 00 utc on september 28 2015 depicting storm stalling just off southwestern mexico as a hurricane in preparation for arrival of marty classes were suspended in acapulco and costa grande region mexican navy was put on standby to deal with incidents occurring within zones of chiapas guerrero michoacan and jalisco government of mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities across guerrero by 21 00 utc 4 p m cdt on september 28 a tropical storm watch was in effect for west of lazaro cardenas to punta san telmo a tropical storm warning for acapulco to east of tecpan de galeana and a hurricane warning for tecpan de galeana to lazaro cardenas these were discontinued as marty weakened and moved away from region all had been cancelled by early on september 30 stalling south of mexico marty produced heavy rains mainly in state of guerrero many areas reported at least 2 in 50 mm of rain between september 26 and october 1 coastal areas near and west of acapulco received up to 6 in 150 mm as river levels rose a state of emergency was declared for eight municipalities which was only concluded on september 30 two landslides occurred in several others occurred in coyuca de benitez and sierra de more than 300 homes were flooded with up to 6 in 15 cm of water in coyuca de benitez three temporary shelters were opened in barra de coyuca however they were closed as no one moved in as remnants of marty moved into northwestern mexico heavy rains and flooding rendered 35 000 people homeless in sonora a state of emergency was declared in 16 municipalities flooding in guaymas which was hit hardest damaged 800 homes and 400 vehicles three people sustained injuries when a wall collapsed mexico nogales highway between guaymas and ciudad obregon had to be closed due to floods total estimated damage in state amounted to mxn 500 million us 30 million see also other storms of same name hurricane manuel hurricane carlos 2015 references external links national hurricane
