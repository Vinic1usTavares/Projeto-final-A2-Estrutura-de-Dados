placed his hand on bible and recited presidential oath nearly four years earlier then senator obama had been one of 22 senators to vote against roberts during roberts supreme court nomination inauguration marked first time a chief justice administered oath to a president elect who had previously voted against chief justice s confirmation roberts and obama made several mistakes as they recited oath proper wording for oath of office is prescribed in constitution roberts had practiced for ceremony carefully however a memo noting his planned pauses in recitation of oath failed to reach obama s staff before swearing in as a result obama inadvertently interrupted roberts during first phrase stating i barack while roberts was finishing do solemnly swear obama then correctly repeated entire phrase i barack hussein obama do solemnly swear roberts who was not using notes rendered next phrase as that i will execute office of president to united states faithfully misplacing word faithfully and saying president to instead of president of obama repeated that i will execute then paused roberts attempted to correct wording but stumbled off faithfully pres office of president of united states obama then repeated roberts initial incorrect wording roberts ended presidential oath by appending phrase so help you god to end of constitutionally prescribed oath and obama responded so help me god when he was prompted obama had asked previously to include so help me god after oath roberts then congratulated obama as new president second oath ceremony thumb right 240px alt obama

justice roberts stand near a portrait of benjamin henry latrobe designer and an early architect of capitol much public discussion arose about errors in administering and reciting oath several constitutional scholars said that obama should retake oath boston university constitutional scholar jack suggested that while courts would likely never even consider a challenge he would still advise obama to retake oath if he were his lawyer since constitution says what he s supposed to say although robert gibbs white house press secretary indicated at first that president obama did not plan to retake oath chief justice roberts agreed to re administer oath at request of white house counsel greg craig second oath ceremony took place on evening of january 21 2009 in map room of white house before a small audience of presidential aides reporters and a white house photographer craig said that white house ultimately decided to re administer oath out of an abundance of caution craig added that oath of office was administered effectively and president was sworn in appropriately but oath appears in constitution itself no bible was present during retake of inauguration inaugural address a central theme of president obama s inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility both in terms of accountability in washington and responsibility of ordinary people to get involved obama s address did not have memorable sound bite phrases instead he used traditional references to connect his new administration with nation s history in a speech that was understated deliberately according to rhetoric expert james mackin obama concluded second paragraph of his address by saying we people have remained faithful to ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents speech reinforced words such as legacy and heritage as well as values such as honesty courage and patriotism which are old values near end of speech obama referred to words written by thomas paine in american crisis which were ordered by george washington to be read to his troops let it be told to future world that in depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that city and country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it because obama s campaign message focused on need for change mackin noted that obama sought to reassure americans that he would operate as president within margins of nation s traditions obama s goal for his inaugural speech was to stir following response among americans this is why i want to go into public service and be a better politician this is why i want to go home and be a better parent better worker better citizen alter jonathan promise president obama year one simon schuster 2010 as part of obama s call for responsibility he said what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition on part of every american and those of us who manage public s dollars will be held to account obama quoted lyrics of jerome kern and dorothy fields song pick yourself up from musical comedy swing time saying that starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again work of remaking america in an article for new york times columnist and former drama critic frank rich noted link to lyric in field s song from movie writing that obama offered in his address one subtle whiff of great depression obama s speech contained several biblical references and was compared to oratory of black church tradition obama also highlighted united states religious diversity referring to country s patchwork heritage as a strength and saying we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non believers this was first time a united states president acknowledged american non believers in an inaugural address obama s inaugural address received mixed reviews with some describing tone of speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking while others described speech as low brow and cliched despite his optimism obama was critical of former presidents george w bush and bill clinton david e sanger chief washington correspondent for new york times described speech as harshest rebuke of an outgoing president during an inaugural address since franklin roosevelt s call for restoration of american values bush administration was upset about tone of speech saying that speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe members of republican party viewed speech as a missed chance to seek unity while rahm emanuel obama s white house chief of staff described speech as a reflection of mandate of people in an analysis of inaugural address one reporter described speech as one that emphasized burdens of moment and cloudy future whose challenges may be met with resolve that is part of our american heritage prayers obama s selections of warren and lowery to deliver prayers for inaugural ceremony were controversial warren had a history of vocal opposition to same sex marriage and lowery had a background as a civil rights activist neither obama nor warren made references during inaugural program to issues of direct concern to gay community in invocation warren asked for forgiveness for americans when we fight each other and civility in our attitudes even when we differ warren mentioned dr martin luther king and jesus in invocation and he concluded invocation with lord s prayer lowery used humor as he delivered benediction one of his messages was statement that as we leave this mountaintop help us to hold on to spirit of fellowship and oneness of our family lowery concluded benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for day when brown can stick around when yellow will be mellow
