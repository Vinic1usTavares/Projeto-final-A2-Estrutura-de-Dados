considered to be impaired by organic enrichment and or low levels of dissolved oxygen and its ph ranges from moderately acidic to slightly alkaline big wapwallopen creek has three large waterfalls all of which are more than high creek flows through wapwallopen gorge in its lower reaches where it descends it mainly flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale creek has existed for several million years but portion of its course that flows through wapwallopen gorge is less than 20 000 years old creek s watershed is mainly rural and most of it is forested it is main source of flooding in six townships wapwallopen creek is named after a native american village that historically existed on creek delaware tribe inhabited area by 1675 and shawnee tribe also historically inhabited area numerous mills were built on creek in 1700s and 1800s including two powder mills in wapwallopen gorge second powder mill was built in 1859 by e i du pont de nemours and company and was

wapwallopen creek however creek s original channel in this location was slightly to west of its current one it moved to its present channel 20 000 years ago during last ice age when glaciers covered area for a thousand years along most of creek s length it cut through glacial material to flow through its preglacial valley however at site of wapwallopen gorge it failed to do this and instead carved a new path through bedrock old glacial valley of big wapwallopen creek was broad and gently sloping big wapwallopen creek has been described as a small creek topography of creek s watershed

gorge in 1795 mill eventually burned down by accident cornelius garrison built a mill on creek in southwestern wright township in 1833 a mill owned by samuel heller was operational on creek as late as late 1800s in 1856 william silver also built a powder mill in wapwallopen gorge he then sold partial ownership of mill to g p parrish however early in 1859 a freshet and an explosion destroyed mill and caused silver s and parrish s company went bankrupt e i du pont de nemours and company bought site in april 1859 and constructed powder mills known as wapwallopen mills there at that time mills were one of largest powder mills in united states while mills were in operation there were fatal explosions every eight years and infrastructure was destroyed by flooding numerous times however by 1868 mills were producing 70 000 tons of black powder per year mills operated until 1912 when du pont company moved machinery to moosic due to increasing costs of shipping black powder and also a desire to consolidate operations only ruins remain today there were still some gristmills on creek as late as 1955 artist thomas addison richards created a graphite on wove paper drawing of big
