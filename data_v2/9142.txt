explained that song s title refers to love s tendency to get in way of itself elaborating we want things so much that we sabotage them he was cautious about use of word love believing that he would have to differentiate it from its use in other songs to that end love interruption features gory lyrics in which a narrator expresses desires to be treated violently by love i want love to roll me over slowly stick a knife inside me and twist it all around pitchfork s ryan dombal viewed line i won t let love disrupt corrupt or interrupt me anymore as an indication that song is a form of self discipline rather than some masochistic fantasy reception song was met with favorable reviews from critics jon dolan of rolling stone gave song a rating of 3 5 out of 5 stars describing it as a loopy little soul sketch and stating that song s organ spritz and puppy eyed casio bassoon evoke son of a preacher man he spoke favorably of amanfu s vocals finding that her harried backing warble fits song jem aswad of billboard described love interruption as an unusual but tantalizing lead track and concluded that it leaves you lusting for more rebecca schiller of nme described song as a minimalist affair based on chord progression of beta band s dry rain she said that track s intensity is in lyrics and its powerful repetitive chorus and remarked i ve heard it three times and i can t get a second of it out of my head critics drew comparisons between love interruption and music produced under white s previous musical projects especially white stripes spins david marchese found song to differ from white s previous thunderous rock sound while aswad commented that it resembles deeper cuts on last few white stripes albums citing song s instrumentation michael roffman of consequence of sound said that love interruption didn t necessarily relive those feelings of seeing white stripes schiller found that on songs produced under dead weather and is absent on love interruption as is any trademark white riffing dolan stated that song adds an awkwardly personal wrinkle to white stripes errant primitivism promotion and other usage an accompanying music video for love interruption which
