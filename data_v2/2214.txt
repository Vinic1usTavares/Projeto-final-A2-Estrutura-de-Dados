commissioner government vlada or commissar government was a short lived serbian collaborationist puppet government established in german occupied territory of serbia within axis partitioned kingdom of yugoslavia during world war ii it operated from 30 april to 29 august 1941 and was headed by milan acimovic of ten commissioners four had previously been ministers in various yugoslav governments and two had been assistant ministers members were pro german anti semitic and anti communist and believed that germany would win war acimovic government lacked any semblance of power and was merely an instrument of german occupation regime carrying out its orders within occupied territory under overall control of german military commander in serbia supervision of its day to day operations was responsibility of chief of german administrative staff ss brigadefuhrer and state councillor harald turner one of its early tasks was implementation of german orders regarding registration of jews and romani people living in territory and placing of severe restrictions on their liberty in early july a few days after a communist led mass uprising commenced acimovic reshuffled his government replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of portfolios by mid july germans had decided that acimovic regime was incompetent and unable to deal with uprising and began looking for a replacement this resulted in resignation of commissioner government at end of august and appointment of government of national salvation led by former minister of army and navy general milan nedic in which acimovic initially retained interior portfolio members of commissioner government accepted collaboration with occupiers as a means to spare serbs from political influences that they considered more dangerous than germans such as democracy communism and multiculturalism they actively assisted germans in exploiting population and economy and took an extremely opportunistic view of jewish question regarding their own participation in holocaust as unpleasant but unavoidable there is no evidence that collaboration of commissioner government moderated german occupation policies in any way background thumb upright 1 5 partition of yugoslavia by axis powers alt a colour map showing partition of yugoslavia in april 1941 kingdom of yugoslavia was invaded and quickly defeated by axis powers yugoslavia was partitioned and as part of this germans established a military government of occupation in an area roughly same as pre 1912 kingdom of serbia consisting of serbia proper northern part of kosovo around kosovska mitrovica and banat this was due to key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it and its valuable resources particularly non ferrous metals they did this to secure two strategic lines of communication danube river and railway line that connected belgrade with salonika in occupied greece and thence by sea to north africa german occupied territory of serbia was also rich in non ferrous metals such as lead antimony and copper which germany needed to support its war effort even before yugoslav surrender on 17 april german army high command or okh had issued a proclamation to population under german occupation which included severe penalties for acts of violence and sabotage surrender of military firearms and radio transmitters a list of acts punishable according to military law including unauthorised public meetings continuation of operation of government agencies including police businesses and schools prohibition of hoarding fixing of prices and wages and use of occupation currency exact boundaries of occupied territory had been fixed in a directive issued by adolf hitler on 12 april 1941 which also directed creation of military administration this directive was followed up on 20 april 1941 by orders issued by chief of okh which established military commander in serbia as head of occupation regime responsible to quartermaster general of okh in interim staff for military government had been assembled in germany and duties of military commander in serbia had been detailed these included safeguarding lines of communication executing economic orders issued by reichsmarschall hermann goring and establishing and maintaining peace and order in short term he was also responsible for guarding huge numbers of yugoslav prisoners of war and safeguarding captured weapons and munitions in order to achieve this military commander s staff was divided into military and administrative branches he was allocated personnel to form four area commands and about ten district commands which reported to chief of administrative staff and military staff allocated troops of four local defence battalions across area commands first military commander in occupied territory was general der flieger helmuth forster a luftwaffe officer appointed on 20 april 1941 assisted by chief of his administrative staff ss brigadefuhrer and state councillor harald turner outside of military commander s staff there were several senior figures in belgrade who represented key non military arms of german government prominent among these was obergruppenfuhrer franz neuhausen who had been initially appointed by goring as plenipotentiary general for economic affairs in territory on 17 april a further key figure in initial german administration was ss standartenfuhrer wilhelm fuchs who commanded einsatzgruppe serbia which consisted of sicherheitsdienst security service or sd and sicherheitspolizei security police or sipo and geheime secret state police or gestapo detachments and controlled 64th reserve police battalion of ordnungspolizei order police or orpo while he was formally responsible to turner fuchs also reported directly to his superiors in berlin despite these organs of military occupation and orders issued by okh regulating as they did a wide range of administrative political economic cultural and social matters germans still needed to establish a public administrative body that would implement their directives it was decided to form a puppet government for that purpose establishment thumb upright 1 3 milan acimovic was selected to lead collaborationist regime a search began for a suitable serb to lead a collaborationist regime from date of yugoslav capitulation pro german politicians including president of fascist zbor movement dimitrije ljotic former belgrade police chief and minister of interior milan acimovic current belgrade police chief dragomir jovanovic along with dorde peric steven and met almost daily to assist in this process germans would have preferred pro axis former prime minister milan stojadinovic but he had been sent into exile before coup several high profile men were considered by germans including former prime minister dragisa cvetkovic former foreign minister aleksandar cincar markovic acimovic ljotic and jovanovic forster decided on acimovic who in early 1939 had briefly been minister of interior in stojadinovic s pro axis government with forster s approval he formed his commissioner government between 27 april and 1 may consisting of ten commissioners hitler preferred someone who was both flexible and had some local popularity to lead a puppet government in german occupied serbia germans passed over ljotic as they believed that he had a dubious reputation among serbs cincar markovic did not want to be part of a collaborationist administration he was also in poor health cvetkovic was suspected of being pro british and harbouring sympathies towards freemasonry he was also believed to have had roma ancestry which germans deemed unacceptable acimovic a virulent anti communist had been in close contact with german police and security services before war this included being appointed deputy to german head of interpol reinhard heydrich who was also chief of sd acimovic was also in close contact with head of gestapo heinrich muller other nine commissioners were risto jojic dusan letica dusan pantic momcilo jankovic vasiljevic lazo m kostic steven ivanic stanislav josifovic and jevrem protic each commissioner ran one of former yugoslav ministries less ministry of army and navy and ministry of foreign affairs which had been abolished according to philip j cohen acimovic vasiljevic and ivanic were german agents prior to invasion of yugoslavia in addition to being vehemently pro german and anti semitic commissioners were also strongly anti communist and believed that germany would win war they represented a wide spectrum of pre war serbian political parties vasiljevic and ivanic both had close links to zbor pantic kostic and protic being members of centre right people s radical party and josifovic was a member of democratic party no representatives of outlawed communist party and british backed serbian agrarian party were included new administration was experienced as like acimovic jojic letica and pantic had all served as ministers in various cabinets josifovic and protic had been assistant ministers kostic was a university professor and others were experts in their respective fields acimovic maintained existing yugoslav government apparatus and staff recalling personnel to their duties and former yugoslav officials played important roles in administration non serbs who left occupied territory had to be replaced and most serbian officials known or suspected to be anti german either resigned or were removed administration manifested german intentions to make best use of those who were willing to collaborate and save available german administrative staff for higher priority work composition of first commissioner government ministry commissioner head of council of education finance post and telegraph ministry of justice national economy transport social policy construction agriculture operation initial tasks thumb upright 1 3 map showing counties and districts of occupied territory during may earlier proclamation of okh was followed by orders issued by forster requiring registration of printing presses and restrictions on press within occupied territory orders were also issued regarding operation of theatres and other places of entertainment and imposing german criminal law in occupied territory forster also ordered resumption of production disestablished national bank of kingdom of yugoslavia and established serbian national bank to replace it from outset acimovic government lacked any semblance of power it was effectively a low grade and basic instrument of german military occupation regime which performed administrative duties within occupied territory on behalf of germans three main tasks of acimovic administration were to secure acquiescence of population to german occupation help restore services and identify and remove undesirables from public services these undesirables included jews roma and unreliable serbs commissioner government was capable of handling routine administrative tasks and maintaining law and order in a peacetime situation only and was closely controlled by turner and neuhausen neuhausen was effectively an economic dictator and had complete control over economy of occupied territory and finances of puppet administration to one end maximising contribution they made to german war effort this was demonstrated in fixing of wages and prices officially responsibility of letica s finance department they were actually set by neuhausen s staff also in may forster ordered acimovic administration to investigate causes of invasion inquiry duly concluded that yugoslav government had recklessly brushed off peaceful intentions of third reich and provoked war one of first tasks of administration involved carrying out turner s orders for registration of all jews and romani people in occupied territory and implementation of severe restrictions on their activities these were aimed at bringing occupied territory into line with rest of nazi occupied europe and included wearing of yellow armbands introduction of forced labour and curfews and restricted access to food turner explicitly stated that t he serbian authorities ie commissioner government are responsible for implementation of all measures contained in order by this means commissioner government took part albeit under german orders in registration marking and social exclusion of jewish community acimovic s interior ministry included a section dedicated to implementing anti jewish and anti roma laws but primary means for carrying out of such tasks was 3 000 strong serbian gendarmerie which was based on elements of former yugoslav gendarmerie units remaining in territory and regiments it had been formed on 17 april on forster s orders and its acting head was colonel jovan gendarmerie was also responsible for collecting taxes and overseeing harvest and was therefore unpopular particularly with rural population german concerns about reliability of gendarmerie meant that it was never adequately armed or equipped for its tasks makeup of puppet administration with representation from a number of different political parties meant that germans had no concerns about it developing a unified front that might hamper german efforts to pacify territory and exploit it economically its very limited powers were further eroded by constant german interference in its operations and requirement that all laws drafted by commissioners could only be implemented after their approval by germans overall german approach to acimovic and his administration was uneven as turner and plenipotentiary of foreign office felix benzler both pushed for co operation and accommodation with acimovic while forster and fuchs considered puppet government to be a mere supplement to german military administration that included a police function when acimovic requested release of serb pows arguing that camps could become hotbeds of nationalist and communist agitation and that men were needed as labourers forster flatly refused and deported them to germany in mid may acimovic s administration issued a declaration to effect that serbian people wanted sincere and loyal cooperation with their great neighbour german people most of local administrators in counties and districts remained in place and german military administration placed its own administrators at each level to supervise local authorities boundaries of occupied territory were settled on 21 may with of land and 3 81 million inhabitants including between 50 and 60 per cent of yugoslav serbs soon after acimovic government was appointed refugees escaping persecution in neighbouring independent state of croatia ndh and others fleeing bulgarian annexed macedonia albanian annexed western macedonia and kosovo and hungarian occupied backa and baranja began to flood into territory occupation troops forster was subsequently transferred and on 2 june was succeeded by general der ludwig von schroder another luftwaffe officer on 9 june commander of german 12th army generalfeldmarschall wilhelm list was appointed as wehrmacht commander in chief southeast europe with schroder reporting directly to him from his headquarters in belgrade schroder directly controlled four poorly equipped local defence battalions consisting of older age men these occupation forces were supplemented by a range of force elements including 64th reserve police battalion of orpo an engineer regiment consisting of a pioneer battalion a bridging column and a construction battalion and several military police units comprising a military police company a geheime secret field police group and a prisoner of war processing unit occupation force was also supported by a military hospital and ambulances veterinary hospital and ambulances general transport column and logistic units turner was responsible for staffing of four area commands and nine district commands in occupied territory in addition to occupation troops directly commanded by schroder in june wehrmacht deployed headquarters of lxv corps to belgrade to command four poorly equipped occupation divisions under control of general der artillerie paul bader three divisions were deployed in occupied territory and fourth was deployed in adjacent parts of ndh three divisions had been transported to occupied territory between 7 and 24 may and were initially tasked with guarding key railway lines to bulgaria and greece by late june bader s headquarters had been established in belgrade and three divisions in occupied territory were deployed with headquarters at valjevo in west topola roughly in centre of territory and nis in south status of bader s command was that schroder could order him to undertake operations against rebels but he could not otherwise act as bader s superior banat in late june acimovic administration issued an ordinance regarding administration of banat which essentially made region a separate civil administrative unit under control of local volksdeutsche led by sepp janko while banat was formally under jurisdiction of acimovic administration in practical terms it was largely autonomous of belgrade and under direction of military government through military area command in pancevo uprising thumb fighting against occupiers and acimovic administration began on 7 july in village of bela crkva alt a colour photograph of a building with three busts mounted on plinths in grassed foreground during june acimovic government preoccupied as it was with dreams of expanding occupied territory into a greater serbia wrote to schroder urging him to give serbian people its centuries old ethnographic borders in early july 1941 shortly after launching of operation barbarossa against soviet union armed resistance began against both germans and acimovic authorities this was a response to appeals from both joseph stalin and communist international for communist organisations across occupied europe to draw german troops away from eastern front and followed a meeting of central committee of yugoslav communist party in belgrade on 4 july this meeting resolved to shift from sabotage operations to a general uprising form partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance and call for populace to rise up against occupiers throughout yugoslavia this also coincided with departure of last of german invasion force that had remained to oversee transition to occupation from appearance of posters and pamphlets urging population to undertake sabotage it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of german propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines first fighting occurred at village of bela crkva on 7 july when two gendarmes were killed during an attempt to disperse a public meeting at end of first week in july list requested that luftwaffe transfer an aircraft training school to territory as operational units were not available soon after gendarmerie stations and patrols were being attacked and german vehicles were fired upon armed groups first appeared in district northwest of topola reshuffle three days after outbreak of rebellion acimovic reshuffled his council jojic kostic and protic were replaced and deputy commissioners were appointed for all portfolios except construction and agriculture among new members was peric another zbor member composition of second commissioner government ministry commissioner deputy head of council of of interior education finance post and telegraph justice national economy transport social policy construction agriculture resistance increases within a few weeks of its outbreak uprising in occupied territory had reached mass proportions between 1 july and 15 august rebels carried out 246 attacks against government representatives and facilities killing 26 functionaries wounding 11 and capturing 10 in same period serbian gendarmerie reported killing 82 rebels wounding 14 and capturing 47 to bolster its reputation with germans acimovic government arranged public meetings and conferences to encourage collaboration by populace with purported aim of saving occupied territory from civil war such a conference was addressed by vasiljevic and avramovic in mid july but ongoing german reprisal killings undermined their message in late july schroder died after being injured in an aircraft accident when new german military commander in serbia luftwaffe general der flieger heinrich danckelmann was unable to obtain more german troops or police to suppress revolt he had to consider every option available as danckelmann had been told to use available forces as ruthlessly as possible turner suggested that danckelmann strengthen acimovic administration so that it might subdue rebellion on its own germans were dissatisfied with acimovic administration s attempts at countering uprising acimovic whose sacking germans had been considering since mid july was thus deemed incompetent on 29 july in reprisal for an arson attack on german transport in belgrade by a 16 year old jewish boy einsatzgruppe serbia executed 100 jews and 22 communists on 1 august benzler wrote that despite goodwill of acimovic administration towards german occupiers puppet government was weak and unstable by august around 100 000 serbs had crossed into occupied territory from ndh fleeing ustase persecution they were joined by more than 37 000 refugees from hungarian annexed backa and baranja and 20 000 from bulgarian annexed macedonia on 13 august bader reneged on danckelmann s pledge to allow commissioner government to maintain control of serbian gendarmerie and ordered that it be re organised into units of 50 100 men under direction of local german commanders he also directed three divisional commanders to have their battalions form lightly armed and mobile hunter teams incorporating elements of einsatzgruppe serbia and gendarmerie in response to revolt acimovic administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential serbs to sign appeal to serbian nation which was published in german authorised belgrade daily newspaper novo on 13 and 14 august signatories included three serbian orthodox bishops four and at least 81 professors from university of belgrade according to historian stevan k pavlowitch many of signatories were placed under pressure to sign professor jozo tomasevich notes that many were known for their leftist views appeal called upon serbian population to help authorities in every way in their struggle against communist rebels and called for loyalty to germans condemning partisan led resistance as unpatriotic serbian bar association unanimously supported appeal but some notable personalities such as writers sekulic and ivo andric refused to sign acimovic administration also appealed for rebels to return to their homes and announced bounties for killing of rebels and their leaders in addition acimovic gave orders that wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held and germans burned their houses and imposed curfews replacement to strengthen puppet government danckelmann wanted to find a serb who was both well known and highly regarded by population who could raise some sort of serbian armed force and who would be willing to use it ruthlessly against rebels whilst remaining under full german control in response to a request foreign office sent ss standartenfuhrer edmund veesenmayer to provide assistance in establishing a new puppet government that would meet german requirements five months earlier veesenmayer had engineered proclamation of ndh veesenmayer engaged in a series of consultations with german commanders and officials in belgrade interviewed a number of possible candidates to lead new puppet government then selected former yugoslav minister of army and navy general milan nedic as best available germans had to apply significant pressure to nedic to encourage him to accept position including threats to bring bulgarian and hungarian troops into occupied territory and to send him to germany as a prisoner of war unlike most yugoslav generals nedic had not been interned in germany after capitulation but instead had been placed under house arrest in belgrade on 27 august 1941 about 75 prominent serbs convened a meeting in belgrade where they resolved that nedic should form a government of national salvation to replace commissioner government same day nedic wrote to danckelmann agreeing to become prime minister of new government on basis of five conditions and some additional concessions two days later german authorities appointed nedic and his government real power continued to reside with occupiers acimovic initially retained his position as minister of interior in march 1945 he joined a chetnik group in ndh and was killed battling partisans analysis apart from zbor activists some members of commissioner government may appear on face value to have been compliant bureaucrats with few ideological convictions on closer examination historian alexander prusin asserts that they accepted collaboration with occupiers as a means to spare serbs from political influences that they considered more dangerous than germans democracy communism and multiculturalism he observes that despite their extremely limited powers they actively assisted germans in exploiting population and economy and also took an extremely opportunistic view of jewish question regarding their own participation in holocaust as unpleasant but unavoidable despite claims of post war apologists prusin concludes that there is no evidence that collaboration of bodies like commissioner government moderated german policies in any way as germans carried out reprisal killings exploitation of economy and other harsh actions
