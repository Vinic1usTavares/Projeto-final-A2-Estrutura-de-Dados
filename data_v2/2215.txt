drax power station is a large biomass and coal fired power station in north yorkshire england capable of co firing petcoke it has a 2 6 gw capacity for biomass and 1 29 gw capacity for coal its name comes from nearby village of drax it is situated on river ouse between selby and goole its generating capacity of 3 906 megawatts mw is highest of any power station in united kingdom providing about 6 of united kingdom s electricity supply opened in 1973 and extended in mid 1980s station was initially operated by central electricity generating board since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times and it is operated by drax group completed in 1986 it is newest coal fired power station in england flue gas desulphurisation equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995 high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012 by 2010 station was co firing biomass in 2012 company announced plans to convert three generating units to solely biomass burning 7 5 million tonnes imported from united states and canada this work was completed in 2016 and a further fourth unit was converted in 2018 company now plans to convert its remaining two coal units to combined cycle gas turbine units and 200 mw battery storage history thumb left upright delivery of a babcock steam drum during construction 1974 drax was initially conceived by central electricity generating board in 1962 as country s largest power station thus far at about 3 000 mw subsequently it was decided to use this opportunity as their first station to use 660 mw turbogenerator sets which planned to become new standard so planning consents were revised to about 4 000 mw following selby coalfield discovery in 1967 board would build three large power stations to use its coal these were an expansion of station at ferrybridge a new station at eggborough and biggest being drax in 1983 84 drax was presented with hinton cup cegb s good house keeping trophy award was commissioned by sir christopher hinton first chairman of cegb construction authority to carry out preparatory works was granted in december 1964 leading to full permission in march 1966 on basis that station would be designed to accommodate six 660 mw units but that only first three be proceeded with for time being ground work for these three units known at time as drax first half started in 1967 two units were synchronised to grid in 1973 and third in 1974 although authorised second half of project known as drax completion was deferred because during project s gestation board s energy mix policy shifted to working towards a majority nuclear system board decided in 1977 that construction of final three units would commence in 1979 with target of commissioning in 1985 6 as part of meeting load growth with an adjusted mix policy aiming for a balance of coal nuclear and oil however later that year in july government requested that drax completion proceed immediately ahead of requirements in order to secure jobs in north east s heavy manufacturing industries board agreed to this subject to being compensated costain constructed foundations and cable tunnels sir robert mcalpine laid roads and built ancillary buildings mowlem laid deep foundations alfred mcalpine built administration and control buildings balfour beatty undertook general building works and james scott installed cabling tarmac construction undertook civil engineering works holst civil engineers built chimney n g bailey installed cabling reyrolle english electric and south wales switchgear produced and installed switchgear english electric manufactured generator cooling water pumps t w broadbent maintained temporary electrical supplies and sulzer brothers manufactured boiler feed pumps in both phases boilers were made by babcock power ltd and generators by c a parsons and company due to project being split into two phases it was decided for efficiency to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only handful of items whole site would share such as flue stack and coal handling area needing to be built in first half this concept extended to seeking same contractors and suppliers who worked on first half for completion unfortunately due to decade timespan between comparable works on two phases several manufacturers that had supplied first half had merged or ceased trading this combined with changes in legislation meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for first half were either no longer available for completion or had significantly changed separately operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvements in equipment and plant specified by board leading to a few significant areas of design of completion being altered second phase was completed in 1986 construction of power station entailed demolition of a farm known as wood house mitsui babcock fitted flue gas desulphurisation fgd equipment between 1988 and 1995 post privatisation on privatisation of central electricity generating board in 1990 station was transferred from central electricity generating board to privatised generating company national power which sold it to aes corporation in november 1999 for ps1 87 billion us 3 billion aes relinquished ownership in august 2003 after falling into ps1 3 billion of debt independent directors continued operation to ensure security of supply in december 2005 after refinancing ownership passed to drax group separate acquisition offers from international power private equity group texas pacific and a private equity backed bid from constellation energy were rejected for undervaluing company company s valuation subsequently increased to 2005 as a result of rising electricity prices and on 15 december 2005 drax group plc floated its shares on london stock exchange issuing ps400 million worth of shares on a valuation of ps2 3 billion in 2009 drax group submitted a planning application for 300 mw biomass ouse renewable energy plant next to power station government approval was obtained in mid 2011 in february 2012 company ceased planning development of plant citing logistics costs and uncertainty concerning government financial support for biomass carbon capture and storage in 2006 drax power limited in response to a government consultation stated they were sponsoring development studies into carbon capture and storage ccs but noted that it was not then commercially viable with costs comparable with nuclear or offshore wind power on 17 june 2009 secretary of state for energy and climate change ed miliband announced plans to require all uk coal fired power stations should be fitted with ccs technology by early 2020s or face closure in 2012 a ccs project at drax was shortlisted for government funding in 2013 white rose carbon capture and storage project formerly uk ccs project was shortlisted for uk government s ccs scheme and in late 2013 was awarded a two year feed contract front end engineering design for ccs project as of june 2014 drax is engaged in a joint venture with alstom and boc to build a 626 mw oxygen fuelled combustion power station adjacent to existing drax site national grid would simultaneously construct a pipeline to transport to yorkshire coast for sequestration in july 2014 project was awarded eur300 million funding from european commission thumb a schematic diagram of proposed pilot scheme at drax power station to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions in september 2015 drax announced it would not be making any further investments into ccs scheme after completion of feasibility study because negative changes to government support for renewable energy had made project too financially risky plus drops in company s share price due to same uncertainty had reduced drax s ability to raise funds front end engineering design was expected to continue under alstom and boc with project still being hosted at drax in late 2015 uk government withdrew its potential financial support for ccs projects up to ps1 billion of funding reversing support promised in governing party s 2015 election manifesto as a result leigh hackett ceo of capture power stated that i t is difficult to imagine its continuation in absence of crucial government support in may 2018 drax announced a new carbon capture and storage pilot scheme that it would undertake in conjunction with leeds based firm c capture focus of this pilot will be on capturing carbon post combustion from biomass burners as opposed to coal burners drax will invest ps400 000 into project company c capture is a side company of department of chemistry established at university of leeds this would yield about of co2 stored per day from process which could be sold on for use in drinks industry pilot scheme was launched in february 2019 capture of carbon from burners is known as bio energy with carbon capture and storage drax repower drax repower is a proposal to modify units 5 and 6 at drax power station by installing combined cycle gas turbines waste heat from gas turbines will pass to heat recovery steam generators which will generate steam for existing steam turbines in respective units units are expected to have a total electrical output of 3 6 gigawatts there is also a proposal to construct two battery storage facilities of 100 mw sic each statutory consultation on project took place in january and february 2018 design and specification thumb right turbine hall left outside right inside taller light coloured building behind is boiler house main buildings are of

chimney s dimensions including height were dictated by a design total capacity of 5 100 m3 s of gases at 26 m s as station was designed and constructed prior to cegb s commitment to flue gas extensive measures were made to limit acid attack from condensate namely lining of flues with a fluoroelastomer and coating of upper 29 0m of external surfaces with a mix of acid resisting tiles and said fluoroelastomer twelve high natural draft cooling towers stand in two groups of six to north and south of station they are made of reinforced concrete in typical hyperboloid design and each have a base diameter of other facilities include a coal storage area flue gas desulphurisation plant and gypsum handling facilities station is third largest coal fired power station in europe after power station in poland and neurath power station in germany it produces around 24 terawatt hours twh 86 4 of electricity annually although it generates around 1 500 000 tonnes of ash and 22 800 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year it is most carbon efficient coal fired power plant in united kingdom design life was set out in terms of number of start ups and operating cycles but with presumption that station would operate as a standard 2nd tier nuclear stations being 1st tier baseload generator in pattern well established under centralised state owned electricity system it was summarised as in order of 40 years minimum requirement was for providing full load for weekdays over a spell of 3 months with an availability over 85 weekend operations were expected to be between 50 100 of full power despite this intent for baseload operation it was designed with a reasonable ability for load following being able to ramp up or down by 5 of full power per minute within range of 50 100 of full power ouse jetty power station also has a jetty on river ouse with a loading capacity of 200 tonnes historically jetty was built and used for construction of power station in 1960s 70s such as delivery of equipment in 2015 a planning application was submitted for improvement of jetty s load capacity to 500 tonnes by white rose ccs developer capture power limited drax alstom boc joint venture for construction of ccs project fuel supply main transport route to power station for fuel originally coal is train via a long freight only section of former hull and barnsley railway from pontefract line at hensall junction a balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal do not need to be shunted after being unloaded merry go round trains are used so that wagons can be unloaded without train stopping as it passes through an unloading house on average there are 35 deliveries a day 6 days a week power station also has a jetty see ss jetty imports via jetty ended c 1980 in 2004 jetty was trialled for import of tall oil by barge coal supply thumb left rotary coal loader feeding plant from stockyard station has a maximum potential consumption of 36 000 tonnes of coal a day in 2011 it consumed 9 1 million tonnes of coal this coal comes from a mixture of both domestic and international sources with domestic coal coming from mines in yorkshire midlands and scotland and foreign supplies coming from australia colombia poland russia and south africa fuel and other bulk commodities are supplied via a 6 mile branch line off wakefield and goole railway line rail facilities include a west facing junction on goole line gross weight and tare weight limestone and gypsum handling facilities including a handling building and control room for flue gas desulphurisation fgd plant fgd sidings g and h biomass offload track a coal offload tracks a b and c bypass line track d oil siding track e and ash loading track f and an unloading building and control room when station opened most of coal burned was from local collieries in yorkshire including kellingley colliery prince of wales hall colliery colliery colliery and bentley colliery following miners strike in mid 1980s by 2006 all but kellingley had closed kellingley closed at end of 2015 uk coal had a five year contract to supply coal which ended at end of 2009 from kellingley maltby and until its closure in 2007 rossington coal was also brought from colliery until it was mothballed and was supplied by daw mill in warwickshire foreign coal is brought via various ports by rail in c 2007 gb railfreight won a contract to move coal brought from port of tyne celebrated by company naming one of their locomotives drax power station in 2007 db cargo uk haul coal from nearby ports of hull and immingham and from hunterston terminal on west coast of scotland freightliner group move coal imported through redcar in addition to burning coal station also co fires coal with biomass and petroleum coke petcoke biomass co firing goole straw pellet plant 2009 thumb station tested co firing biomass in summer of 2004 and in doing so was first power station in uk to be fuelled by wood initial trial of 14 100 tonnes of willow was locally sourced from nearby eggborough since trial station s use of biomass has continued it uses direct injection for firing biomass whereby it bypasses pulverising mills and is either injected directly into boiler or fuel line for greater throughput in 2009 a target was set for 12 5 of station s energy to be sourced from biomass and shift to biomass was intended to contribute to aim of cutting emissions by 15 station burns a large range of biomass mostly wood pellets sunflower pellets olive peanut shell husk and rape meal majority comes from overseas a 100 000 tonne pa capacity straw facility was constructed at capitol park goole in 2008 opened 2009 construction of specialised biomass handling facilities began in 2009 at port of tyne and at drax sources proposed new biomass plants in 2000s drax group applied for planning permission to build a new 300 mw power station fuelled entirely by biomass to north of station ouse renewable energy plant was expected to burn 1 400 000 tonnes of biomass each year saving 1 850 000 tonnes of emissions and expected to create 850 construction jobs and 150 permanent jobs created once opened through direct and contract employment plans were submitted to department of energy and climate change in july 2009 for review if permission was granted construction was scheduled begin in late 2010 and to take up to three and a half years two other 300 mw biomass plants were planned by drax at ports of hull and immingham in 2012 drax group abandoned plans for discrete biomass plant development due to changes in government subsidies for biomass energy production favouring plant conversions over newly built plants it switched to a project to convert half of units at its existing plant to biomass firing full firing with biomass in september 2012 drax group announced conversion to full firing with biomass of three of its six units first unit was scheduled to be online by june 2013 second unit in 2014 and third by 2017 initially a biomass supply had been secured for first unit cost was estimated at ps700 million 1 13 billion including modifications to fuel mills and boilers and construction of storage structures and conveyors for wood pellet fuel each unit will consume about 2 3 million tonnes of biomass yearly requiring an estimated annual total of 7 5 million tonnes in 2017 this is equivalent to two thirds of europe s entire energy biomass consumption in 2010 and requires of forest to supply on a continuous basis north america was expected to be source of vast majority of biomass although some would be domestically sourced willow and elephant grass drax group s decision was enabled by a new uk government policy effective in april 2013 to award 1 0 tradable rocs renewable obligation certificates per megawatt of power generation from coal power plants that are fully converted to burn biomass ceo dorothy thompson stated company intended to become a predominately biomass fuelled energy producer by april 2013 financing for scheme include ps190 million through sale of shares ps100 million from prudential m g uk companies financing fund ps50 million from uk green investment bank and ps75 million friends life underwritten by hm treasury as well as a ps400 million credit facility as of 2013 there were plans to install 1 million tonne per year wood pellets plants at morehouse parish louisiana and gloster mississippi which would be shipped by road and rail to port of baton rouge louisiana then shipped in 50 000 tonne cargo ships to uk in financial report for 2013 drax announced that an additional 2 million tons capacity was being considered likely to be built in us in 2013 company signed an agreement with abp to develop handling facilities at port of hull immingham and grimsby construction of automated facilities began in 2013 creating capacities of 3 and 1 million tonnes per year at ports of immingham and hull respectively adding to 1 4 million tonne per year port of tyne biomass facility built in 2009 in same year a new design covered rail wagon with high volumetric capacity for transporting low density biomass pellets was unveiled for use by drax in uk 200 wagons of type were ordered at drax pellets would be stored in domes and transferred by a pneumatic conveyor system before grinding to dust for use shepherd building group was contracted to construct biomass handling and storage facilities at drax with rps group as civil engineer design included automated rail to storage handling screening and storage facilities consisting of four high by wide storage domes with a capacity of concrete dome technology was supplied by e d company pllc trading as engineering system solutions and dome technology llc by july 2013 one firing unit had been converted and was reported to be functioning correctly by 2013 conversion of second and third units was scheduled for 2014 and during or before 2016 respectively second unit was converted by may 2014 initially co firing an 85 biomass coal mix due to limited biomass supply in april 2014 drax was awarded a renewable contract for difference cfd subsidy for biomass based power generation on another converted coal firing unit but a third unit which had been previously marked as eligible for cfd funding was excluded drax group then legally challenged decision initially obtaining a ruling in its favour which was overturned in court of appeal in july 2014 high court ruled in drax s favour biomass conversion at drax led to it requiring 82 of uk biomass imports from us in 2014 60 overall of all us wood pellet export a large factor in a 40 yearly increase in biomass export from that country us sourced imports represented 58 of drax s biomass use in 2014 with 22 from canada a port facility in baton rouge louisiana was completed by april 2015 in mid 2015 drax reached an agreement with peel ports to construct a 3million ton per year biomass importation facility at port of liverpool estimated cost ps100 million rail connected facility was to include 100 000 tonnes storage and be constructed by graham construction in september 2015 drax group and began a legal action against uk government due to claimed insufficient notice being given about withdrawal of a climate related tax exemption see climate change levy drax claimed change would reduce its earnings by ps30 million claim was rejected by high court in february 2016 in december 2016 european competition commission approved uk government subsidies for conversion of third unit to biomass burning petcoke station started to trial co firing of petcoke petroleum coke in one of its boilers in june 2005 ending in june 2007 burning 15 petcoke and 85 coal petcoke was burned to make electricity more competitive as price of running fgd equipment was making electricity more expensive environment agency ea granted permission for trial in june 2004 despite plans being opposed by friends of earth and selby council to meet their concerns emissions were constantly monitored through trial and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating fgd plant to remove high sulphur content of emissions trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on environment and so in late 2007 drax group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burning ea granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with drax s findings that fuel had no significant negative effects on environment station can now burn up to 300 000 tonnes of fuel a year and stock up to 6 000 tonnes on site electricity generation thumb right generator unit no 2 coal is fed into one of 30 coal bunkers each with a capacity of 1 000 tonnes each bunker feeds two of 60 pulverisers each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour station has six babcock power boilers each weighing 4 000 tonnes powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners which are ignited by propane in 2003 original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners each of six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set consisting of one high pressure hp turbine one intermediate pressure ip turbine and three low pressure lp turbines each hp turbine generates 140 mw exhaust steam from them is fed back to boiler and reheated then fed to 250 mw ip turbines and finally passes through lp turbines this gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660 mw with six generating sets station has a total capacity of 3 960 mw each of generating units is equipped with advanced plant management system apms a system developed by rwe npower and thales and implemented by station also has six gas turbines providing backup for breakdowns or shut downs in national grid their annual output is generally low generating 75 mw and three of units have been mothballed and are out of operation but they could be refurbished emissions from these units are released through station s second smaller chimney to south of main stack thumb southern cooling towers seen across river ouse which supplies water for condensers between 2007 and 2012 high and low pressure turbines were replaced by siemens in a ps100 million programme cooling system water is essential to a thermal power station heated to create steam to turn steam turbines water used in boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site once this water has been through turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from nearby river ouse water is pumped from river by a pumphouse on river north of station once it has been through condenser water is cooled by one of natural draft cooling towers with two towers serving each generating set once cooled water is discharged back into river waste products flue gas desulphurisation thumb right a train of gypsum heading from station to kirkby thore on settle carlisle railway all six units are served by an independent wet limestone gypsum flue gas desulphurisation fgd plant which was installed between 1988 and 1996 this diverts gases from boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry which removes at least 90 of sulphur dioxide so2 this is equivalent to removing over 250 000 tonnes of so2 each year process requires 10 000 tonnes of limestone a week sourced from quarry in derbyshire a byproduct of process is gypsum with 15 000 tonnes produced each week this goes to be used in manufacture of gypsum is sold exclusively to british gypsum and it is transported by rail to their plants at kirkby thore on settle carlisle line east leake on former great central main line and occasionally to robertsbridge on hastings line db cargo uk transport gypsum ash use and disposal pulverised fuel ash pfa and furnace bottom ash fba are two byproducts from burning of coal each year station produces about 1 000 000 tonnes of pfa and around 220 000 tonnes of fba all fba and 85 of pfa is sold under trade name drax ash products ash is sold to local building industry where it is used in manufacture of blocks cement products grouting and laying of roads ash is also used in other parts of country between 2005 and 2007 pfa was used as an infill at four disused salt mines in northwich in cheshire 1 100 000 tonnes was used in project which was to avoid a future risk of subsidence in town ash was delivered by db schenker in ten trains a week each carrying 1 100 tonnes following a trial in january 2010 pfa is also transported to waterford in ireland by boat one ship a month will transport 1 200 tonnes for manufacture of construction materials this will replace 480 lorry journeys annually and is deemed more environmentally friendly unsold pfa is sent by conveyor belt to barlow ash mound which is used for disposal and temporary stockpile three conveyors feed mound with a total capacity of 750 tonnes an hour fgd gypsum is disposed of on mound if it is not of a high enough grade to be sold mound has won a number of awards for its nature conservation work environmental effects thumb right drax power station is largest emitter in uk image is that of a cloud of water vapour also emitted by station environmental effects of coal burning are well documented coal is considered to be easily most carbon intensive and polluting form of energy generation available in 2007 station produced 22 160 000 tonnes of making it largest single source of in uk between 2000 and 2007 there has been a net increase in carbon dioxide of over 3 000 000 tonnes station also has highest estimated emissions of nitrogen oxides nox in european union in 2007 in a move to try to lower emissions drax group signed a ps100 million contract with siemens power generation to re blade steam turbines over four years this is largest steam turbine modernisation ever undertaken in uk and will increase efficiency coupled with co firing of biomass this is part of a target to reduce emissions by 15 by 2011 drax s annual report for 2013 reported that drax s annual emissions were at 20 612 000 tonnes of this was a slight decrease from 2007 levels due to burning of biomass drax remained uk s largest single emitter of carbon dioxide up until 2016 when power station claimed that its improvement programmes and conversion to burning biomass had meant a drastic decrease in greenhouses gases being released into atmosphere drax has opted in to large combustion plant directive and thus is permitted to continue operating beyond 2015 use of flue gas ensures that limits on sulphur dioxide emissions are not exceeded protests industrial action and incidents climate camp 2006 camp for climate action 2006 thumb on 31 august 2006 over 600 people attended a protest against high carbon emissions it was coordinated by camp for climate action group at least 3 000 police officers from 12 forces were reported to have been drafted in for duration of protest to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent protesters from shutting station down thirty nine people were arrested after trying illegally to gain access to plant train protest 2008 at 8 00 am on 13 june 2008 more than 30 climate change campaigners halted an ews coal train en route to station by disguising themselves as rail workers by wearing high visibility clothing and waving red flags stopping train on a bridge across river aire they scaled wagons with aid of bridge s girders they then mounted a banner reading leave it in ground on side of wagon and tied train to bridge preventing it moving they then shovelled more than 20 tonnes of coal on to railway line protest lasted whole day until several protesters were removed from train by police that night station s management said that protest had no effect on output action was coordinated by camp for climate action worker strike 2009 on 18 june 2009 fewer than 200 contractors walked out of or failed to show up in a wildcat strike showing solidarity with workers at lindsey oil refinery in lincolnshire where 51 workers had been laid off while another employer on site was employing
