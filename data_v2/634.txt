flora of madagascar consists of more than 12 000 species of vascular and non vascular plants although fungus lichens and algae are no longer included in plant kingdom they are discussed here as well around 83 of madagascar s vascular plants are found only on island these endemics include five plant families 85 of over 900 orchid species around 200 species of palms and such emblematic species as traveller s tree six species of baobab and madagascar periwinkle high degree of endemism is due to madagascar s long isolation following its separation from african and indian landmasses in mesozoic 150 160 and 84 91 million years ago respectively however few plant lineages remain from ancient gondwanan flora most extant plant groups immigrated via across ocean dispersal well after continental break up after its continental separation madagascar probably experienced a dry period and tropical rainforest expanded only later in oligocene to miocene when rainfall increased today humid forests including lowland forests are mainly found on eastern plateau where abundant rainfall from indian ocean is captured by an escarpment a large part of central highlands in sub humid forests ecoregion is today dominated by grasslands they are widely seen as result of human landscape transformation but some may be more ancient grassland occurs in a mosaic with woodland and bushland including tapia forest and hard leaved thickets on high mountains dry forest and succulent woodland are found in drier western part and grade into unique spiny thicket in southwest where rainfall is lowest and wet season shortest mangroves occur on west coast and a variety of wetland habitats with an adapted flora are found across island first human presence in madagascar dates only 2000 4000 years back and settlement in interior occurred centuries later malagasy people have used native flora for various purposes including food construction and medicine exotic plants were introduced by early settlers later traders and french colonialists and many have become important to agriculture among them are rice staple dish of malagasy cuisine grown in terraced fields in highlands and greater yam taro cowpea and plantain plantation crops include litchi cloves coffee and vanilla latter one of country s main export produce today more than 1 300 introduced plants are known of which around 600 have become naturalised and some invasive human population growth and economic activity have put pressure on natural vegetation in region especially through massive deforestation madagascar s high endemism and species richness coupled with a sharp decrease in primary vegetation make island a global biodiversity hotspot to preserve natural habitats around 10 of land surface is protected including world heritage sites tsingy de bemaraha and rainforests of atsinanana while historically mainly french naturalists described madagascar s flora today a number of national and international herbaria botanical gardens and universities document plant diversity and engage in its conservation diversity and endemism madagascar has been described as one of most floristically unique places in world 343 families of vascular plants and bryophytes with roughly 12 000 species were known according to catalogue of plants of madagascar many plant groups are still insufficiently known of vascular plants 83 are found only on island these endemics include five entire plant families asteropeiaceae sarcolaenaceae and as many as 96 of madagascan trees and shrubs are estimated to be endemic vascular plants

native tapia uapaca bojeri woodlands chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis responsible for chytridiomycosis an infectious disease threatening amphibian populations worldwide was long considered absent from madagascar in 2010 it was recorded however and has been confirmed since in various areas and in numerous frog families alerting scientists to a new threat to island s already endangered frog fauna over 500 species of lichens of madagascar have been documented but true number was estimated to be at least twice as high madagascar can be divided into two major habitats that can be associated with lichen distribution wet tropical areas of siliceous bedrock make up approximately two thirds of country and are where most of lichens have been documented dry tropical areas of granitic and limestone bedrock make up other one third of country with just over 20 species documented in these habitats algae algae classification is problematic they are a diverse group but no longer generally considered part of plant kingdom and are in general poorly known a review of freshwater diatoms listed 134 species most of them have been described from fossil deposits and it is

island vegetation types thumb 400px right alt two maps of madagascar showing land cover on left and topography on right land cover left note dark green belt of humid forest and topography right madagascar features contrasting and unique vegetation types determined mainly by topography climate and geology a steep eastern escarpment captures most of rainfall brought by trade winds from indian ocean consequently eastern belt harbours most of humid forests while west has a drier vegetation rain shadow region in southwest has a sub arid climate central highlands above feature some high mountains though massif in north has highest elevation namely temperatures are highest on west coast with annual means of up to while high massifs have a cool climate with a annual mean geology of madagascar features mainly igneous and metamorphic basement rocks with some lava and quartzite in central and eastern plateaus while western part has belts of sandstone limestone including tsingy formations and unconsolidated sand marked east central west distinction among madagascan flora was already described by english naturalist richard baron in 1889 twentieth century authors including henri perrier de la bathie and henri humbert built upon this concept and proposed several similar classification systems based on floristic and structural criteria a classification from 2007 atlas of vegetation of madagascar distinguishes 15 vegetation types including two degraded types and cultivation based on satellite imagery and ground surveys they are defined mainly based on vegetation structure and differ in species composition in different parts of island they partly correspond to seven terrestrial ecoregions defined by world wildlife fund wwf in madagascar humid forests tropical rainforest covers around 8 of island but used to encompass more than twice as much it ranges from sea level to elevation and is mainly found on eastern plateaus on basement rocks with lateritic soils in north humid forest extends west to sambirano river basin and islands including nosy be annual rainfall is up to in areas such as masoala peninsula and dry season is short or absent predominantly evergreen forest up to is composed of tree and understory species from various families such as burseraceae ebenaceae fabaceae and myristicaceae bamboos and lianas are frequent cyclones hit east coast of madagascar in some years and can destroy habitats wwf classifies eastern belt of humid forest below elevation in lowland forests ecoregion and montane forests of highlands in sub humid forests ecoregion degraded humid forest in malagasy covers ca 10 of island it spans various states of degradation and is composed of forest remnants and planted or otherwise introduced species it is primarily result of slash and burn cultivation in primary forest some forest fragments still harbour a considerable amount of biodiversity littoral forest found in several isolated areas along eastern coast covers less than 1 of land area on mainly sandy sediments climate is humid with annual rainfall littoral forest covers sandy soil forest marsh forest and grasslands its flora includes various tree families lianas and epiphytic orchids and ferns in marsh forests pandans pandanus and traveller s tree ravenala madagascariensis are common it is part of wwf s lowland forests ecoregion an isolated area of humid forest in south west on eastern slope of massif is classified as western humid forest by atlas it occurs on lavas and sand at elevation forest is maintained through moisture from ascending air it is unprotected but local population considers it sacred wwf includes it in sub humid forests ecoregion dry forests and thicket dry forest accounting for roughly 5 of surface is found in west from northern tip of island to mangoky river in south it ranges from sea level to in elevation climate is sub humid to dry with annual rainfall and a dry season of around six months geology is varied and can include limestone forming eroded tsingy outcrops vegetation is diverse it ranges from forest to bushland and includes trees of burseraceae fabaceae euphorbiaceae and baobab species wwf classifies northern part of this vegetation as dry deciduous forest ecoregion and southern part including northernmost range of as succulent woodlands ecoregion western sub humid forest occurs inland in southwest and covers less than 1 of surface mainly on sandstone at elevation climate is sub humid to sub arid with annual rainfall vegetation up to with a closed canopy includes diverse trees with many endemics such as baobabs adansonia madagascariensis and palm madagascariensis cutting clearing and invasive species such as opuntias and agaves threaten this vegetation type it is part of wwf s sub humid forests ecoregion driest part of madagascar in southwest features unique spiny forests ecoregion wwf they cover ca 4 of its area at an elevation below on limestone and sandstone bedrocks mean annual rainfall is very low and concentrated in one month or less it is a dense thicket composed of plants adapted to dry conditions notably through succulent stems or leaves transformed into spines characteristic plants are endemic subfamily baobabs and euphorbia species a more open coastal bushland within region is classified separately by atlas degraded spiny forest accounts for ca 1 of surface and is result of cutting clearing and encroachment introduced species such as agaves and opuntias are found with remnants of native flora grassland woodland and bushland grasslands dominate a large part of madagascar more than 75 according to some authors mainly found on central and western plateaus they are dominated by c4 grasses such as common aristida and simplex and burn regularly while many authors interpret them as result of human degradation through tree felling cattle raising and intentional burning it has been suggested that at least some of grasslands may be primary vegetation grassland is often found in a mixture with trees or shrubs including exotic pine eucalypt and cypress atlas distinguishes a wooded grassland bushland mosaic covering 23 of surface and a plateau grassland wooded grassland mosaic covering 42 both occur on various substrates and account for most of wwf s sub humid forests ecoregion at higher altitudes on thin soil they grade into an indigenous hard leaved vegetation that includes asteraceae ericaceae lauraceae and shrubs among others and is singled out by wwf as thickets ecoregion an evergreen open forest or woodland type tapia forest is found on western and central plateaus at altitudes of it is dominated by eponymous tapia tree uapaca bojeri and covers less than 1 of surface broad regional climate is sub humid to sub arid but tapia forest is mainly found in drier microclimates trees other than tapia include endemic asteropeiaceae and sarcolaenaceae with a herbaceous understory tapia forest is subject to human pressure but relatively well adapted to fire it falls in wwf s sub humid forests ecoregion wetlands marshes swamp forests and lakes are found in all regions along with rivers and streams typical species of wet habitats include several endemic cyperus sedges ferns pandans pandanus and traveller s tree two species of water lilies nymphaea lotus and n nouchali are found in west and east respectively lagoons are mainly found on east coast but also occur in west they have a specialised flora peat bogs are restricted to highlands above elevation their distinct vegetation includes among others sphagnum moss and sundew species drosera many wetlands have been converted into rice paddies and are otherwise threatened by destruction and pollution mangroves occur on western mozambique channel coast from very north to just south of mangoky river delta eleven mangrove tree species are known from madagascar of which most frequent belong to families acanthaceae lecythidaceae combretaceae and mangrove forests are threatened by encroachment and cutting wwf lists mangroves of madagascar as separate ecoregion origins and evolution paleogeography madagascar s high species richness and are attributed to its long isolation as a continental island since mesozoic era once part of gondwana supercontinent madagascar separated from continental africa and from indian subcontinent around 150 160 and 84 91 million years ago respectively madagascan flora was therefore long seen predominantly as a relict of an old gondwanan vegetation separated by vicariance through continental break up molecular clock analyses however suggest that most plant and other lineages immigrated via across ocean dispersal given that they are estimated to have diverged from continental groups well after gondwana broke up only endemic plant lineage on madagascar sufficiently old to be a possible gondwana relict appears to be perrieri most extant plant groups have african affinities consistent with relatively small distance to continent and there are also strong similarities with indian ocean islands of comoros mascarenes and seychelles there are however also links to other more distant floras such as those of india and after their separation from africa madagascar and india moved polewards to a position south of 30deg latitude during paleocene and eocene now separated from india moved northwards again and crossed subtropical ridge this passage likely induced a dry desert like climate across island which later contracted to what is today sub arid spiny thicket in southwest humid forests probably established since oligocene when india had cleared eastern seaway allowing trade winds to bring in rainfall and madagascar had moved north of subtropical ridge intensification of indian ocean monsoon system after around eight million years ago is believed to have further favoured expansion of humid and sub humid forests in late miocene especially in northern sambirano region some of grasslands may also date to late miocene when there was a global grassland expansion species evolution several hypotheses exist as to how plants and other organisms have diversified into so many species in madagascar they mainly assume either that species diverged in by gradually adapting to different environmental conditions on island for example dry versus humid or lowland versus montane habitats or that barriers such as large rivers mountain ranges or open land between forest fragments favoured allopatric speciation a madagascan lineage of euphorbia occurs across island but some species evolved succulent leaves stems and tubers in adaptation to arid conditions in contrast endemic tree ferns cyathea all evolved under very similar conditions in madagascan humid forests through three recent radiations in pliocene madagascar s fauna is thought to have coevolved to a certain extent with its flora famous plant pollinator mutualism predicted by charles darwin between orchid angraecum sesquipedale and moth is found on island highly unstable rainfall in madagascar was suggested to have created unpredictable patterns of flowering and fruiting in plants this in turn would have narrowed opportunities for flower and fruit feeding animals and could explain their relatively low numbers in madagascar among these lemurs are most important but historic extinctions of giant lemurs probably deprived some large seeded plants of their seed dispersers extinct madagascan megafauna also included grazers such as two giant tortoises aldabrachelys and malagasy hippopotamuses but it is unclear to what extent their habitats resembled today s widespread grasslands exploration and documentation early naturalists thumb upright right alt cover page of flacourt s book histoire de la grande isle madagascar histoire de la grande isle madagascar by etienne de flacourt 1658 was first detailed written account on madagascar madagascar and its natural history remained relatively unknown outside island before 17th century its only overseas connections were occasional arab portuguese dutch and english sailors who brought home anecdotes and tales about fabulous nature of madagascar with growing influence of french in indian ocean it was mainly french naturalists that documented madagascar s flora in following centuries etienne de flacourt envoy of france at military post of fort dauphin in south of madagascar from 1648 to 1655 wrote first detailed account of island histoire de la grande isle madagascar 1658 with a chapter dedicated to flora he was first to mention endemic pitcher plant nepenthes madagascariensis and madagascar periwinkle about one century later in 1770 french naturalists and voyagers philibert commerson and pierre sonnerat visited island from isle de france now mauritius they collected and described a number of plant species and many of commerson s specimens were described later by jean baptiste de lamarck and jean louis marie in france sonnerat described among others emblematic traveller s tree another contemporary louis marie aubert du petit thouars also visited madagascar from isle de france he collected on island for six months and wrote among others histoire des recueillis dans les iles australes d afrique and a work on orchids of madagascar and mascarenes 19th to 20th century french naturalist alfred grandidier was a preeminent 19th century authority on malagasy wildlife his first visit in 1865 was followed by several other expeditions he produced an atlas of island and in 1885 published l histoire physique naturelle et politique de madagascar which would comprise 39 volumes although his main contributions were in zoology he was also a prolific plant collector several plants were named after him including grandidier s baobab adansonia grandidieri and endemic succulent genus british missionary and naturalist richard baron grandidier s contemporary lived in madagascar from 1872 to 1907 where he also collected plants and discovered up to 1 000 new species many of his specimens were described by kew botanist john gilbert baker baron was first to catalogue madagascar s vascular flora in his compendium des plantes malgaches including over 4 700 species and varieties known at that time thumb upright left perrieri a now extinct grass species collected only once by henri perrier de la bathie in 1914 and described

national museum of natural history in paris among his publications were notably first classification of island s vegetation la vegetation malgache 1921 and des plantes de madagascar 1936 and he directed publication of catalogue des plantes de madagascar in 29 volumes his contemporary and collaborator henri humbert a professor in algiers and later in paris made ten expeditions to madagascar

flore de madagascar et des comores series begun by humbert in 1936 missouri botanical garden maintains catalogue of plants of madagascar a major online resource and also has a permanent base in madagascar human impact madagascar was colonised rather recently compared to other landmasses with first evidence for humans arrived from either africa or asia dating to 2 300 or perhaps 4 000 years before present it is assumed that humans first stayed near coast and penetrated into interior only several centuries later settlers had a profound impact on long isolated environment of madagascar through land clearing and fire introduction of zebu cattle and probably hunting to extinction native megafauna including among others elephant birds giant lemurs and giant tortoises first europeans arrived in 16th century starting an age of overseas exchange population growth and transformation of landscape was particularly rapid since mid 20th century uses of native species thumb upright right an elderly man sitting with a valiha instrument on his knees in front outside a house malagasy valiha zither is made from bamboo native flora of madagascar is used for a variety of purposes by malagasy people richard baron at end of 19th century described more than one hundred native plants used locally and commercially these include many timber trees such as native ebony diospyros and rosewood dalbergia species raffia palm raphia used for fibre dyeing plants as well as medicinal and edible plants traveller s tree has various uses in east of madagascar chiefly as building material madagascar s national instrument valiha is made from bamboo and lent its name to endemic genus valiha yams dioscorea in madagascar include introduced widely cultivated species as well as some 30 endemics all edible edible mushrooms including endemic species are collected and sold locally see above diversity and endemism non vascular plants and fungi many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions an ethnobotanical study in southwestern littoral forest for instance found 152 native plants used locally as medicine and countrywide over 230 plant species have been used as traditional malaria treatments diverse flora of madagascar holds potential for natural product research and drug production on an industrial scale madagascar periwinkle roseus a source of alkaloids used in treatment of different cancers is a famous example agriculture one of characteristic features of agriculture in madagascar is widespread cultivation of rice cereal is a staple of malagasy cuisine and has been an important export crop since pre colonial times it was likely introduced with early austronesian settlers and archaeobotanical remains evidence its presence in madagascar at least by 11th century both indica and japonica varieties were introduced early on rice was first cultivated in mud flats and marshes near coast reaching highlands much later its widespread cultivation in terraced fields was promoted with expansion of imerina kingdom in 19th century land conversion for rice cultivation has been an important cause of wetlands loss other major crops such as greater yam coconut taro and turmeric are also believed to have been brought in by early settlers from asia other crops have a likely african origin such as cowpea bambara groundnut oil palm and tamarind some crops like teff sorghum common millet and plantain may have been present before colonisation but it is possible that humans brought new cultivars arab traders presumably brought fruits such as mango pomegranate and grapes later european traders and colonists introduced crops like litchi and avocado and promoted cultivation of exports like cloves coconut coffee and vanilla in plantations today madagascar is primary vanilla producing country worldwide forestry in madagascar involves many exotic species such as eucalypts pines and acacias traditional slash and burn agriculture tavy practised for centuries today accelerates loss of primary forests as populations grow see below threats and conservation introduced plants more than 1 300 exotic plants have been reported in madagascar with legumes fabaceae most frequent family this represents around 10 relative to native flora a ratio lower than in many islands and closer to what is known for continental floras many exotic plant species have been introduced for agriculture or other uses around 600 species have naturalised and some are considered invasive a notorious example is south american water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes which spread widely through subtropical and tropical regions and is considered a serious plant pest in wetlands in general invasive plants spread mostly in already disturbed secondary vegetation and remaining primary forests of east appear little affected a prickly pear cactus opuntia was introduced to southwest madagascar in late 18th century by french colonialists who used it as natural fence to protect military forts and gardens cactus quickly spread and found use as cattle feed by antandroy pastoralists in early 20th century were introduced as a biological control for plant which had become a nuisance they rapidly eradicated most of cacti this probably led to famine among antandroy people although some authors challenge causal link between famine and cactus eradication today several opuntia species are again present mainly in south spreading into native vegetation in some areas prickly pear illustrates dilemma of plant introductions while many authors see exotic plants as a threat to native flora others argue that they have not yet been linked directly to extinction of a native species and that some may actually provide economic or ecological benefits a number of plants native to madagascar have become invasive in other regions such as traveller s tree in reunion and flamboyant tree regia in various tropical countries threats and conservation thumb left alt tree trunks piled up in front of a forest background with workers cutting them illegal logging of rosewood in north of madagascar madagascar together with its

vascular plant species and found over 1 000 of them to be endangered or critically endangered rapid human population increase and economic activity entail habitat loss and fragmentation in particular massive deforestation forest cover decreased by around 40 from 1950s to 2000 and remaining forests are highly fragmented slash and burn cultivation has a long tradition but with an ever denser population forest is cut faster than it especially in humid east in addition illegal logging of luxury timber species such as rosewood and ebony increased especially with 2009 malagasy political crisis rare plants such as endemic succulents and baobabs are threatened by harvest and trade for horticulture food or cosmetics global warming is expected to reduce or shift climatically suitable areas for plant species and threatens coastal habitats such as littoral forests through rising sea levels conservation of natural habitats in madagascar is concentrated in over around 10 of total land surface of national parks and other nature reserves an area that has tripled from 2003 to 2013 these protected areas include world heritage sites tsingy de bemaraha and rainforests of atsinanana some
