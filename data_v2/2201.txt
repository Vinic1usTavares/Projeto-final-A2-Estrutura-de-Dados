thumb right cover page of ars conjectandi ars conjectandi latin for art of conjecturing is a book on combinatorics and mathematical probability written by jacob bernoulli and published in 1713 eight years after his death by his nephew niklaus bernoulli seminal work consolidated apart from many combinatorial topics many central ideas in probability theory such as very first version of law of large numbers indeed it is widely regarded as founding work of that subject it also addressed problems that today are classified in twelvefold way and added to subjects consequently it has been dubbed an important historical landmark in not only probability but all combinatorics by a plethora of mathematical historians importance of this early work had a large impact on both contemporary and later mathematicians for example abraham de moivre bernoulli wrote text between 1684 and 1689 including work of mathematicians such as christiaan huygens gerolamo cardano pierre de fermat and blaise pascal he incorporated fundamental combinatorial topics such as his theory of permutations and combinations aforementioned problems from twelvefold way as well as those more distantly connected to burgeoning subject derivation and properties of eponymous bernoulli numbers for instance core topics from probability such as expected value were also a significant portion of this important work background thumb left 200px christiaan huygens published first treaties on probability in europe subject of probability was first formally developed in 16th century with work of gerolamo cardano whose interest in branch of mathematics was largely due to his habit of gambling he formalized what is now called classical definition of probability if an event has a possible outcomes and we select any b of those such that b a probability of any of b occurring is however his actual influence on mathematical scene was not great he wrote only one light tome on subject in 1525 titled liber de ludo aleae book on games of chance which was published posthumously in 1663 date which historians cite as beginning of development of modern probability theory is 1654 when two of most well known mathematicians of time blaise pascal and pierre de fermat began a correspondence discussing subject two initiated communication because earlier that year a gambler from paris named antoine had sent pascal and other mathematicians several questions on practical applications of some of these theories in particular he posed problem of points concerning a theoretical two player game in which a prize must be divided between players due to external circumstances halting game fruits of pascal and fermat s correspondence interested other mathematicians including christiaan huygens whose de ratiociniis in aleae ludo calculations in games of chance appeared in 1657 as final chapter of van s in 1665 pascal posthumously published his results on eponymous pascal s triangle an important combinatorial concept he referred to triangle in his work traite du triangle traits of arithmetic triangle as arithmetic triangle in 1662 book la logique ou l art de penser was published anonymously in paris authors presumably were antoine arnauld and pierre nicole two leading who worked together with blaise pascal latin title of this book is ars cogitandi which was a successful book on logic of time ars cogitandi consists of four books with fourth one dealing with decision making under uncertainty by considering analogy to gambling and introducing explicitly concept of a quantified probability in field of statistics and applied probability john graunt published natural and political observations made upon bills of mortality also in 1662 initiating discipline of demography this work among other things gave a statistical estimate of population of london produced first life table gave probabilities of survival of different age groups examined different causes of death noting that annual rate of suicide and accident is constant and commented on level and stability of sex ratio usefulness and interpretation of graunt s tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers ludwig and christiaan huygens in 1667 where they realized difference between mean and median estimates and christian even interpolated graunt s life table by a smooth curve creating first continuous probability distribution but their correspondences were not published later johan de witt then prime minister of dutch republic published similar material in his 1671 work van a treatise on life annuities which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes a demonstration of fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications de witt s work was not widely distributed beyond dutch republic perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672 apart from practical contributions of these two work they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry such as chances of dying at certain age unlike say rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin simply by counting frequency of occurrence thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics development of ars conjectandi thumb right portrait of jakob bernoulli in 1687 in wake of all these pioneers bernoulli produced many of results contained in ars conjectandi between 1684 and 1689 which he recorded in his diary meditationes when he began work in 1684 at age of 30 while intrigued by combinatorial and probabilistic problems bernoulli had not yet read pascal s work on arithmetic triangle nor de witt s work on applications of probability theory he had earlier requested a copy of latter from his acquaintance gottfried leibniz but leibniz failed to provide it latter however did manage to provide pascal s and huygen s work and thus it is largely upon these foundations that ars conjectandi is constructed apart from these works bernoulli certainly possessed or at least knew contents from secondary sources of la logique ou l art de penser as well as graunt s bills of mortality as he makes explicit reference to these two works bernoulli s progress over time can be pursued by means of meditationes three working periods with respect to his discovery can be distinguished by aims and times first period which lasts from 1684 to 1685 is devoted to study of problems regarding games of chance posed by christiaan huygens during second period 1685 1686 investigations are extended to cover processes where probabilities are not known a priori but have to be determined a finally in last period 1687 1689 problem of measuring probabilities is solved before publication of his ars conjectandi bernoulli had produced a number of treaties related to probability et basel 1685 in journal des scavans 1685 26 viii p 314 there appear two problems concerning probability each of two players may have of winning in a game of dice solutions were published in acta eruditorum 1690 may pp 219 223 in article quaestiones nonnullae de usuris cum solutione problematis de sorte alearum in addition leibniz himself published a solution in same journal on pages 387 390 theses de et a public lecture delivered at basel 12 february 1686 theses xxxi to xl are related to theory of probability de arte oratio 1692 letter a un amy sur les parties du jeu de paume that is a letter to a friend on sets in game of tennis published with ars conjectandi in 1713 between 1703 and 1705 leibniz corresponded with jakob after learning about his discoveries in probability from his brother johann leibniz managed to provide thoughtful criticisms on bernoulli s law of large number but failed to provide bernoulli with de witt s work on annuities that he so desired from outset bernoulli wished for his work to demonstrate that combinatorics and probability theory would have numerous real world applications in all facets of society in line of graunt s and de witt s work and would serve as a rigorous method of logical reasoning under insufficient evidence as used in courtrooms and in moral judgements it was also hoped that theory of probability could provide comprehensive and consistent method of reasoning where ordinary reasoning might be overwhelmed by complexity of situation thus title ars conjectandi was chosen a link to concept of ars from scholasticism which provided symbolic link to pragmatism he desired and also as an extension of prior ars cogitandi in bernoulli s own words art of conjecture is defined in chapter ii of part iv of his ars conjectandi as art of measuring as precisely as possible probabilities of things with goal that we would be able always to choose or follow in our judgments and actions that course which will have been determined to be better more satisfactory safer or more advantageous development of book was terminated by bernoulli s death in 1705 thus book is essentially incomplete when compared with bernoulli s original vision quarrel with his younger brother johann who was most competent person who could have fulfilled jacob s project prevented johann to get hold of manuscript jacob s own children were not mathematicians and were not up to task of editing and publishing manuscript finally jacob s nephew niklaus 7 years after jacob s death in 1705 managed to publish manuscript in 1713 contents thumb right cutout of a page from ars conjectandi showing bernoulli s formula for sum of integer powers last line gives his eponymous numbers bernoulli s work originally published in latin is divided into four parts it covers most notably his theory of permutations and combinations standard foundations of combinatorics today and subsets of foundational problems today known as twelvefold way it also discusses motivation and applications of a sequence of numbers more closely related to number theory than probability these bernoulli numbers bear his name today and are one of his more notable achievements first part is an in depth expository on huygens de ratiociniis in aleae ludo bernoulli provides in this section solutions to five problems huygens posed at end of his work he particularly develops huygens concept of expected value weighted average of all possible outcomes of an event huygens had developed following formula notation represents number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n distinguishable objects without replacement in this formula e is expected value pi are probabilities of attaining each value and ai are attainable values bernoulli normalizes expected value by assuming that pi are probabilities of all disjoint outcomes of value hence implying that p0 p1 pn 1 another key theory developed in this part is probability of achieving at least a certain number of successes from a number of binary events today named bernoulli trials given that probability of success in each event was same bernoulli shows through mathematical induction that given a number of favorable outcomes in each event b number of total outcomes in each event d desired number of successful outcomes and e number of events probability of at least d successes is first part concludes with what is now known as bernoulli distribution second part expands on enumerative combinatorics or systematic numeration of objects it was in this part that two of most important of twelvefold ways permutations and combinations that would form basis of subject were fleshed out though they had been introduced earlier for purposes of probability theory he gives first non inductive proof of binomial expansion for integer exponent using combinatorial arguments on a note more distantly related to combinatorics second section also discusses general formula for sums of integer powers free coefficients of this formula are therefore called bernoulli numbers which influenced abraham de moivre s work later and which have proven to have numerous applications in number theory in third part bernoulli applies probability techniques from first section to common chance games played with playing cards or dice he does not feel necessity to describe rules and objectives of card games he analyzes he presents probability problems related to these games and once a method had been established posed generalizations for example a problem involving expected number of court cards jack queen and king one would pick in a five card hand from a standard deck of 52 cards containing 12 court cards could be generalized to a deck with a cards that contained b court cards and a c card hand fourth section continues trend of practical applications by discussing applications of probability to and or to personal judicial and financial decisions in this section bernoulli differs from school of thought known as which defined probability in an empirical sense as a counter he produces a result resembling law of large numbers which he describes as predicting that results of observation would approach theoretical probability as more trials were held in contrast frequents defined probability in terms of former bernoulli was very proud of this result referring to it as his golden theorem and remarked that it was a problem in which i ve engaged myself for twenty years this early version of law is known today as either bernoulli s theorem or weak law of large numbers as it is less rigorous and general than modern version after these four primary expository sections almost as an afterthought bernoulli appended to ars conjectandi a tract on calculus which concerned infinite series it was a reprint of five dissertations he had published between 1686 and 1704 legacy thumb right abraham de moivre s work was built in part on bernoulli s ars conjectandi is considered a landmark work in combinatorics and founding work of mathematical probability preface by sylla vii among others an anthology of great mathematical writings published by elsevier and edited by historian ivor grattan guinness describes studies set out in work occupying mathematicians throughout 18th and 19th centuries an influence lasting three centuries statistician anthony edwards praised not only book s groundbreaking content writing that it demonstrated bernoulli s thorough familiarity with many facets of combinatorics but its form ars conjectandi is a very well written book excellently constructed perhaps most recently notable popular mathematical historian and topologist william dunham called paper next milestone of probability theory after work of cardano as well as jakob bernoulli s masterpiece it greatly aided what dunham describes as bernoulli s long established reputation bernoulli s work influenced many contemporary and subsequent mathematicians even afterthought like tract on calculus has been quoted frequently most notably by scottish mathematician colin maclaurin jacob s program of applying his art of conjecture to matters of practical life which was terminated by his death in 1705 was continued by his nephew nicolaus bernoulli after having taken parts verbatim out of ars conjectandi for his own dissertation entitled de artis conjectandi in jure which was published already in 1709 nicolas finally edited and assisted in publication of ars conjectandi in 1713 later nicolaus also edited jacob bernoulli s complete works and supplemented it with results taken from jacob s diary pierre de montmort in collaboration with nicolaus bernoulli wrote a book on probability essay d analyse sur les jeux de hazard which appeared in 1708 which can be seen as an extension of part iii of ars conjectandi which applies combinatorics and probability to analyze games of chance commonly played at that time abraham de moivre also wrote extensively on subject in de seu de in a casu of 1711 and its extension doctrine of chances or a method of calculating probability of events in play of 1718 de moivre s most notable achievement in probability was discovery of first instance of central limit theorem by which he was able to approximate binomial distribution with normal distribution to achieve this de moivre developed an asymptotic sequence for factorial function which we now refer to as stirling s approximation and bernoulli s formula for sum of powers of numbers both montmort and de moivre adopted term probability from jacob bernoulli which had not been used in all previous publications on gambling and both their works were enormously popular refinement of bernoulli s golden theorem regarding convergence of theoretical probability and empirical probability was taken up by many notable latter day mathematicians like de moivre laplace poisson chebyshev markov borel kolmogorov and complete proof of law of large numbers for arbitrary random variables was finally provided during first half of 20th century a significant indirect influence was thomas simpson who achieved a result that closely resembled de moivre s according to simpsons work s preface his own work depended greatly on de moivre s latter in fact described simpson s work as an abridged version of his own finally thomas bayes wrote an essay discussing theological implications of de moivre s results his solution to a problem namely that of determining probability of an event by its relative frequency was taken as a proof for existence of god by bayes finally in 1812 pierre simon laplace published his theorie analytique des in which he consolidated and laid down many fundamental results in probability and statistics such as moment generating function method of least squares inductive probability and hypothesis testing thus completing final phase in development of classical probability indeed in light of all this there is good reason bernoulli s work is hailed as such a seminal event not only did his various influences direct and indirect set mathematical study of combinatorics spinning but even theology was impacted see also distribution bernoulli trial law of large numbers bernoulli numbers binomial distribution
