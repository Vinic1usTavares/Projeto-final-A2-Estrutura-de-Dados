with fellow californian band muffs and later remarked that cavallo was only person we could really talk to and connect with eventually band left their independent record label lookout records on friendly terms and signed to reprise signing to a major label caused many of band s original fans from independent music club 924 gilman street to regard green day as sell outs club has banned green day from entering since major label signing reflecting back on period lead vocalist billie joe armstrong told spin magazine in 1999 i couldn t go back to punk scene whether we were biggest success in world or biggest failure only thing i could do was get on my bike and go forward cavallo was chosen as main producer of album with jerry finn as mixer green day originally gave first demo tape to cavallo and after listening to it during car ride home he sensed that he had stumbled on something big band s recording session lasted three weeks and album was mixed twice armstrong claimed that band wanted to create a dry sound similar to sex pistols album or first black sabbath albums band felt original mix to be unsatisfactory cavallo agreed and it was remixed at fantasy studios in berkeley california armstrong later said of their studio experience everything was already written all we had to do was play it writing and composition much of album s content was written by armstrong except written by bassist mike dirnt and hidden track all by myself which was composed and written by drummer tre cool album touched upon various experiences of band members and included subjects like

his mother and her husband he is quoted saying that song is about my mother s husband it s not really about a girl or like anyone directly related to me in a relationship in end s about my mother packaging name of album is a reference to band members often suffering from diarrhea which they referred to as liquid dookie as a result of eating spoiled food while on tour initially band was to name album liquid dookie however this was deemed too gross and so they settled on name dookie album artwork by fellow east bay punk richie bucher caused controversy since it depicted bombs being dropped on people and buildings setting is a replica of berkeley s telegraph avenue in center there is an explosion with band s name at top armstrong has since explained meaning of artwork back cover on early prints of cd featured a plush toy of ernie from sesame street which was airbrushed out of later prints for fear of litigation however canadian and european prints still feature ernie on back cover some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that dookie was a child s lullaby album or that creators of sesame street had sued green day release dookie was released on
