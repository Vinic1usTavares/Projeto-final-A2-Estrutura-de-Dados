production development thumb right characteristic subway station of blackeberg which features in film film project started in late 2004 when john nordling a producer at production company efti contacted ajvide lindqvist s publisher ordfront to acquire rights for a film adaptation of his novel let right one in at ordfront they just laughed when i called i was like 48th they put on list but i called john ajvide lindqvist and it turned out we had same idea of what kind of film we should make it wasn t about money but about right constellation a friend introduced tomas alfredson to novel while he normally does not like to receive books because it s a private thing to choose what to read he decided after a few weeks to read it depiction of bullying in novel affected alfredson deeply it s very hard and very down to earth unsentimental i had some period when i grew up when i had hard times in school so it really shook me he told los angeles times ajvide lindqvist already knew alfredson s previous work and he and alfredson discovered that they understood each other very well in addition to efti co producers included sveriges television and regional production centre nord production involved a total budget of around 29 million sek including support from swedish film institute and nordisk film tv fond and wag screenplay lindqvist had insisted on writing screenplay himself alfredson who had no familiarity with vampire and horror genres initially expressed skepticism at having original author do adaptation but found end result very satisfying many of minor characters and events from book were removed and focus directed primarily on love story between two leads in particular many aspects of character hakan including him being a paedophile were toned down and his relationship with eli was mostly left open to interpretation alfredson felt that film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner and that this element would detract from story of children and their relationship still film provided a few hints of which alfredson mentions one in director s comments hakan likes children for wrong reasons a key passage in novel details what happens when a vampire enters a room uninvited an action that traditional vampire lore usually prohibits alfredson originally wanted to omit this from film but ajvide lindqvist was adamant that it had to be included alfredson was initially nervous about scene he realized in post production that sound effects and music made it american in a bad way and had to be removed for scene to work end result which shows eli slowly beginning to bleed from her eyes ears and pores received positive notices from many critics peter bradshaw of guardian described it as a haemophilia of rejection novel presents eli as an androgynous boy castrated centuries before by a sadistic vampire nobleman film handles issue of eli s gender more ambiguously a brief scene in which eli changes into a dress offers a glimpse of a suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration when oskar asks eli to become his girlfriend eli tries to tell oskar i m not a girl an actress plays eli s character but her voice was considered to be too high pitched so it was dubbed by voice actress elif ceylan according to an interview with director as film was originally conceived flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail but these scenes were eventually cut in end ajvide lindqvist was satisfied with adaptation when alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for first time he started to cry because it was so damn beautiful he subsequently described film as a masterpiece it doesn t really matter that alfredson didn t want to do it way i wanted it in every respect he could obviously never do that film is his creative process he said casting and filming casting of lead actors took almost a year with open castings held all over sweden kare hedebrant selected to audition for role as oskar after an initial screening at his school eventually landed role lina leandersson responded to an online advertisement seeking a 12 year old boy or girl good at running after three more auditions she was selected to play eli alfredson has described casting process as most difficult part of making film he had particular concerns about interaction between two leads and fact that those who had read book would have a preconceived notion of how characters were supposed to look he wanted actors to look innocent and be able to interact in front of camera they were supposed to be mirror images of each other she is everything he isn t dark strong brave and a girl like two sides of same coin on another occasion alfredson stated that c is 70 percent of job it s not about picking right people to make roles it is about creating chords how a b and a minor interact together and are played together in end alfredson expressed satisfaction with result and has frequently lauded hedebrant and leandersson for being extremely intelligent incredibly wise and unprecedentedly fantastic thumb left absence of ceilings made various overhead lighting techniques possible although film takes place in blackeberg a suburb of stockholm principal photography took place in lulea in north of sweden to ensure enough snow and cold weather area where filming took place dated from around same time as blackeberg and has similar architecture however alfredson shot a few scenes in blackeberg area in particular scene where eli leaps down on virginia from a tree was shot in town square of blackeberg another scene where eli attacks jocke in an underpass was shot in nearby suburb of original blackeberg underpass that lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in picture some of outdoor close up scenes were made in a super cold studio jungle gym where much of interaction between oskar and eli takes place was constructed specifically for film its design was intended to suit cinemascope format better than a regular jungle gym which would typically have to be cropped height wise most of filming used a single fixed arri camera with almost no handheld usage and few cuts tracking shots relied on a track mounted dolly rather than steadicam to create calm predictable camera movement crew paid special attention to lighting cinematographer hoyte van hoytema and director alfredson invented a technique they called spray light in an interview van hoytema describes it as follows if you could capture dull electrical light in a can and spray it like hairspray across eli s apartment it would have same result as what we created for emotional scenes between oskar and eli van hoytema consistently diffused lighting post production film contains around fifty shots with computer generated imagery alfredson wanted to make them very subtle and almost unnoticeable sequence where multiple cats attack virginia one of most complicated scenes to film required several weeks of drafting and planning crew used a combination of real cats stuffed cats and computer generated imagery film features analogue sound effects exclusively throughout lead sound designer per sundstrom explained key to good sound effects is working with natural and real sounds these analogue sounds can be digitally reworked as much as necessary but origin has to be natural sundstrom designed soundscape to come as close to actors as possible with audible heartbeats breathing and swallowing late in production it was also decided to overdub actress lina leandersson s voice with a less feminine one to underline backstory she s 200 years old not twelve we needed that incongruity besides it makes her menacing sundstrom said both men and women up to age of forty auditioned for role after a vote film team ended up selecting elif ceylan who provides all of eli s spoken dialogue footage of ceylan eating melon or sausage was combined with various animal noises to emulate sound of eli biting into her victims and drinking their blood sound crew won a guldbagge award for best achievement from swedish film institute for nightmarishly great sound in film soundtrack swedish composer johan soderqvist wrote score alfredson instructed him to write something that sounded hopeful and romantic in contrast to events that take place in film soderqvist has described outcome as consisting of both darkness and light and emphasized melody and harmony as most important qualities of music slovak national symphony orchestra performed score two years earlier they had performed score for first swedish vampire movie on 11 november 2008 media released film soundtrack in a limited edition of 500 copies it contains 21 of soderqvist s original scores from film it placed fourth on ain t it cool news top 10 best scores of 2008 list being described as scrupulously weaving together strains of bone chillingly cold horror with encompassing warmth of newly acquired love if magazine described score as most beautifully emotional score yet to grace undead it s a feeling of tender melancholy that delivers its scares in a subtle chamber orchestra way song i min bil written and performed by per gessle resonates repeatedly through film originally an outtake from gessle s solo album en man song was specially provided for film to resemble sound of popular 1980s pop group gessle has described song as a bluesy tune with a nice guitar hook other songs in film include from 1968 written and performed by future abba member flash in night from 1981 written by tim norell and bjorn and performed by secret service
