powers are inherited by king and queen s daughter rapunzel removing gothel s access with her life suddenly endangered gothel kidnaps infant imprisoning princess in an isolated tower for eighteen years while posing as her mother in order to exploit her powers inspired by disney villainesses such as evil queen and lady tremaine from snow white and seven dwarfs 1937 and cinderella 1950 respectively gothel was developed by directors nathan greno and byron howard into a more original complex villain than witch upon whom she is based because character is forced to rely solely on her wit charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive film s most difficult character to develop gothel s exotic appearance whose beauty dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately designed to serve as a foil to rapunzel s was inspired by appearance of murphy herself and american singer cher mother gothel has been mostly well received by film critics who enjoyed character s humor complexity charisma and showmanship dubbing her a scene stealer while praising murphy s performance enthusiastically however some critics argued that gothel was too passive dismissing her as a weaker less intimidating disney villainess than maleficent from sleeping beauty 1959 and cruella de vil from one hundred and one dalmatians 1961 development conception and creation walt disney himself first attempted to adapt fairy tale rapunzel into a feature length animated film during 1940s however filmmaker s efforts were never fully realized because fairy tale was considered too small in 2008 co directors nathan greno and byron howard decided to enlarge film s scale in order to transform it into a big event in order for it to be successful meanwhile character mother gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than witch upon whom she is based conceiving her as a very lonely woman who really did not know how to have a relationship of any kind little else had been determined about character at time who was simply described as type of woman who envisioned herself in spotlight a departure from traditional disney villains mother gothel is not a witch or a sorceress because she lacks supernatural powers character is forced to rely solely on her wit charm intellect and charisma a conscious decision made by greno and howard however in brothers grimm s original fairy tale gothel is very much depicted as a typical witch like character an idea that was modified for disney film adaptation in favor of having gothel s instead be derive d from rapunzel s hair seeking inspiration for gothel and rapunzel s bizarre relationship greno and howard conducted a series of interviews with several female disney employees asking them to list qualities in their mothers that they found annoying and cloying or restricting specifically things that their mothers would do that made them feel trapped or made them feel smothered in order to make villain appear more relatable gothel s mother knows best line getting kind of chubby was in fact borrowed from one of these interviews gothel embodies darker side of overprotective parents at beginning of film gothel and rapunzel s relationship resembles more so of a pure mother daughter relationship elaborating on gothel s unique mothering style howard explained to den of geek that character has to convince this smart girl that she is her mother whatever her motivations are citing gothel as one of film s most difficult characters to develop as a result of her complex relationship with rapunzel greno explained to den of geek st paul pioneer press observed that gothel represents an update of traditional wicked stepmother evolving into passive aggressive stepmother instead in actress donna murphy s opinion a classic villainess is somebody who wants something with such intensity and such great need but comes to a place of not being bound by any kind of moral code or any sense of what s ethical concluding that they will do anything to get what they want austin chronicle observed that directors inclusion of gothel as an evil mother figure as a trigger for storyline remains one of classic hallmarks of disney animation according to kay turner author of book transgressive tales queering grimms gothel means godmother in german voice thumb mother gothel is voiced by broadway actress donna murphy in her voice acting debut actress would eventually go on to receive universal acclaim for her performance directors admitted that they were not keen on hiring solely big named a list celebrities or top billed actors to voice film s main characters howard explained that in order to be cast actors simply had to have right voice for characters preferring voice actors who could bring a natural ease to those characters greno elaborated it was never about how big star was it was always about who s best for part film critic james berardinelli of reelviews observed that this decision echoed disney s approach during late 1980s and early 1990s when big name stars where often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents an additional asset was that actor be able to perform well both independently and collaboratively mother gothel is voiced by american actress and singer donna murphy a tony award winning broadway actress who was informed about casting call for tangled by her agent having never voiced an animated character before actress decided to audition for role of film s villain based solely on expectation that unfamiliar experience would be fun almost immediately murphy developed a strong liking towards gothel because of character s complexity known for her award winning broadway performances murphy prepared herself for her tangled audition similar to way in which actress would have prepared for a broadway audition refusing to rely solely on her voice murphy also provided gothel with an additional background that flush ed out moments beyond what we see in film although greno and howard had already held murphy in high regard as a spectacular singer actress was required to audition a song for directors nonetheless performing children will listen from musical into woods howard revealed in an interview that murphy was ultimately chosen out of hundreds of actresses because she possessed something extra directors especially enjoyed charisma and intelligence murphy brought to role growing up a fan of disney films murphy had never wanted to play a princess preferring characters who were adventurous and drove action instead in actress opinion villains continue to be most dynamic characters in disney films describing opportunity to voice a disney villain as a juicy experience murphy explained that this is because these characters are not bound by ethics or moral codes or concern for what someone thinks or how it might hurt someone else providing actors with more freedom upon her first session murphy appreciated directors for exposing her to early concepts and ideas about gothel however murphy was not provided with a complete script because they re very protective about that murphy was directed to lower pitch of her voice in favor of demonstrating a rather flat sound although murphy did not base her own performance on any one individual in particular she admitted to babble that she was somewhat inspired by betty lou gerson s performance as cruella de vil in disney s one hundred and one dalmatians 1961 comparing voice acting to broadway murphy commented that in animation you re recording and you re discovering it and giving performance all at same time it s not like you have three weeks rehearsal additionally murphy never worked with co star mandy moore voice of rapunzel instead murphy revealed that scenes with gothel and rapunzel were actually recorded opposite one of directors impersonating moore who also explained to murphy that gothel s design will continue to evolve as character begins to adapt actress mannerisms howard enthused that murphy nailed gothel admitting to ultimately using 90 of actress original material and takes because character just came right to life when she came in characterization design and analysis left thumb gothel s exotic appearance was based on american singer cher convinced that disney does villains better than anyone directors felt pressured to create a villain who would ultimately live up to classic villains of disney s past films greno and howard wanted gothel to be both a funny and frightening character describing her as a commanding and powerful presence who could also have warmth greno believes that gothel is particularly scary because she is not a witch explaining she s a real world type villain considered one of film s hardest characters to crack by greno he and howard wanted gothel to be depicted as a conniving villain who is likeable and charismatic enough that audiences would be convinced by her and rapunzel s unconventional relationship greno explained if mother gothel was a mean villainess and looked like a villainess and acted scary you d be like why is rapunzel staying in tower in early drafts gothel was inspired by ursula from little mermaid 1989 causing character to become too dark ultimately filmmakers voted in favor of having gothel be subtle as opposed to having her remain a one note domineering mother similar to lady tremaine cinderella s cruel stepmother from disney s cinderella 1950 as reported by korea times thought of gothel being a villain who is both a greedy selfish woman and a mother figure to rapunzel was initially perplexing for animator jin kim and it wasn t until after kim heard gothel s mother knows best for first time that he came up with 1940s hollywood screen siren motif for character directors also strived to make it obvious that mother gothel and rapunzel are not related greno told animation world network when they re standing together it is very clear that this is not a mother and daughter just by frames of their bodies their hair pigments of their skin as opposed to when rapunzel is in close proximity with her true parents king and queen howard added that in comparison to rapunzel gothel is very tall and curvy she s very voluptuous she s got this very exotic look to her even down to that curly hair we re trying to say visually that this is not this girl s mother animators studied footage of murphy in order to get ideas about facial expressions and gestures after much speculation directors finally admitted that in addition to murphy gothel s physical appearance was in fact influenced by american singer cher howard explained that this was because cher is very exotic and gothic looking continuing that singer definitely was one of people we looked at visually as far as what gives you a striking character term passive aggressive has since gone on to be commonly associated with gothel critics felt that gothel could possibly pioneer a new kind of disney villainess introducing undermining passive aggressive guilt trip inducing witch village voice wrote that as a villain gothel is disney s first villainess whose chief crime is being an warning rapunzel that she is simply too silly too uneducated too unsophisticated to survive life outside of tower los angeles times referred to gothel as a guilt tripping overprotective super manipulative parent from hell one film critic observed that gothel is one of most understated villains disney has used in a long time she harkens back to wicked step mother idea in cinderella she proves it s possible to be evil without all theatrics author continued gothel is one for ages with a bit of darkly comedic timing and overall greed and menace a villain needs to be disdained character has received comparisons to evil queen snow white s stepmother from disney s snow white and seven dwarfs 1937 donna murphy believed that gothel did really love rapunzel in her own way music mother gothel performs two of film s songs mother knows best described as a brassy broadway targeted tune and an authoritarian anthem in which gothel warns her daughter all about evils out to get rapunzel and mother knows best reprise both written by composer alan menken and lyricist glenn slater while making rapunzel s music more modern in vein of a singer songwriter young and contemporary and fresh menken decided to make gothel s songs more classic broadway described as more of a big stage diva type of music critics have observed similarities between mother knows best and out there from disney s hunchback of notre dame 1996 on which menken also served as a composer musically filmmakers were open to ideas that murphy had as actress had felt different about a slightly different ending to something musically in arrangement requesting to try something else to which filmmakers responded absolutely appearances tangled mother gothel appears in tangled 2010 for hundreds of years gothel a
