development and military started using sde dov airport on a regular basis airport regained its commercial operations initially serving domestic flights mostly to single customers on piper cub aircraft it later expanded operations to scheduled service on larger aircraft to various parts of israel as a result of land availability an additional north south runway was built with no opposition by 1960 land in tel aviv became scarce and municipality demanded that airport be relocated northward so as to allow residential development in its place however a committee that investigated in 1961 options for such a relocation found no feasible site in proximity to tel aviv and suggested that flights be moved to lod airport now known as ben gurion airport and that road access from tel aviv to lod be improved this option however was blocked by israel defense forces government set up a second committee in 1968 who suggested that old east west runway be closed and airport s area reduced allowing for development to east of airport they suggested that this is replaced by a new runway in sea adjacent to beach runway was closed and a high density upper middle income neighborhood was built to east of airport although new runway was never constructed due to high cost involved as new residential area suffered from aircraft noise residents joined in demand that airport be relocated despite this number of flights to airport increased as newly formed israel airports authority strived to reduce congestion at ben gurion airport by shifting all domestic turbo prop flights to sde dov once again only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in sea and again high cost of this project meant that it never happened this was a large issue in area during whole of 1980s recent history and closure early 1990s saw a rapid rise in land values in tel aviv area following massive immigration wave from former soviet union and rapid economic growth fueled by israel s subsequent hi tech boom this brought issue of relocation back to light despite this however in 1997 sde dov was declared an international airport for private flights statistics for sde dov airport not

airport would be vacated to make way for residential redevelopment plan to close airport was strongly opposed by tel aviv and eilat municipalities and its implementation was postponed numerous times until airport finally closed on 30 june 2019 by 31 july 2019 a caterpillar 950m loader started first phase of removing runway and within days runway was airport prior to closure sde dov airport mostly handled domestic flights within israel as well as general aviation activity and limited international flights mostly to nearby cyprus airport had two terminals iaf took up about 40 of overall movements take offs and landings and used airport as a base for some of its operations as well as a convenient hub for military and government passenger traffic due to its location in centre of israel air force and civilian pilots alike crossed airspace controlled by sde dov s air traffic control tower from north to south and vice versa in order to reach their destination without landing at sde dov this significantly increased air traffic density above and around airport and efforts were made to keep crossing traffic away from approach and departure patterns in order to minimise their effect on air traffic safety at sde dov airport had seven check in desks and 45 aircraft stands airlines and destinations as of july 2019 airport no longer serves any traffic prior to its closure both arkia and
