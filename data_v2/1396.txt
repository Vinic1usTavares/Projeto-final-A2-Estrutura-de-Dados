was world s first commissioned ship that was built as an aircraft carrier pre dated hosho and had a long landing deck but was designed and initially built as an ocean liner first purpose designed aircraft carrier to be laid down was in 1918 but she was completed after hosho and first aircraft carrier of imperial japanese navy ijn commissioned in 1922 ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment techniques such as take offs and landings and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics ship provided valuable lessons and experience for ijn in early carrier air operations hosho superstructure and other obstructions to flight deck were removed in 1924 on advice of experienced aircrews hosho and her aircraft group participated in shanghai incident in 1932 and in opening stages of sino japanese war in late 1937 during those two conflicts carrier s aircraft supported imperial japanese army ground operations and engaged in aerial combat with aircraft of nationalist chinese air force small size of ship and her assigned usually around 15 aircraft limited effectiveness of her contributions to combat operations as a result carrier was placed in reserve after her return to japan from china and she became a training carrier in 1939 during world war ii hosho participated in battle of midway in june 1942 in a secondary role after battle carrier resumed her training role in japanese home waters for duration of conflict and survived war with only minor damage from air attacks she was used as a repatriation transport after war making nine trips to bring some 40 000 japanese soldiers and civilians to japan from overseas locations hosho was scrapped in japan beginning in 1946 design and description thumb left hosho in tsurumi ku after being

ship named shokaku was cancelled in 1922 before any construction started watts p p 148 gardiner and gray p 240 and jentschura jung and mickel p 41 state that hosho was initially laid down as a tanker named hiryu according to milanovich pp 10 11 this is only partially correct at best ship was ordered as one of six special ships as part of eight six fleet program other five ships were completed as oil tankers hosho was second warship after british to be built from keel up as an aircraft carrier but was launched and completed earlier than hermes evans and peattie pp 181 182 hosho was initially designed as a seaplane carrier like british with a forward flying off deck 32 aircraft four low angle guns and four anti aircraft aa guns plan was revised after reports were received from japanese observers with royal navy in europe about desirability to be able to land aircraft on ship new requirements were modeled on after she received her rear flight deck in 1918 ship was to be capable of and fitted with a forward flight deck superstructure and funnels amidships and a large hangar aft shortly thereafter based on observations of landing trials on furious and world s first flush decked aircraft carrier hosho s flight deck design was revised in april 1919 superstructure was removed and funnels were moved to one side to create an unobstructed full length flight deck and ship was reclassified as an aircraft carrier ship s hull was based on that of a large cruiser and she was given a small island her three funnels were mounted on starboard side and swiveled to lie horizontal

looking from forecastle forward photographed in october 1945 hoshos flight deck was long and wide forward end sloped down at an angle of 5deg to help aircraft accelerate during takeoff a small island was mounted well forward on starboard side and contained ship s bridge and air operations control center island was fitted with a small tripod mast intended to mount ship s fire control system fifteen different types of landing equipment were evaluated before british longitudinal wire system was adopted low landing speeds of time meant that aircraft had little difficulty in stopping but their light weight made them vulnerable to wind gusts that could blow them over side of carrier and longitudinal wires helped to prevent that forward of island was a collapsible crane for loading aircraft into forward hangar milanovich p and peattie p 315 flight deck unlike those on royal navy carriers was superimposed on ship s hull rather than constructed as a strength deck supporting carrier s hull structure a system of lights and mirrors along flight deck assisted pilots in landing on carrier hosho was only japanese aircraft carrier with two hangars forward hangar was and only one deck in height as it was intended to house nine small aircraft such as fighters two story rear hangar measured at forward end and at rear end it was designed to house six large aircraft such as torpedo bombers as well as six reserve aircraft each hangar was served by an aircraft elevator forward elevator was and aft elevator measured milanovich pp 13 15 22 air group thumb right hosho middle compared with other aircraft carriers constructed during same time period hosho had a normal capacity of fifteen aircraft subject to limitations of her hangars she was first commissioned with an air group of nine mitsubishi type 10 fighters and three to six mitsubishi b1m3 type 13 torpedo bombers in 1928 fighters were replaced by type 3 three years later air group consisted of nakajima a2n type 90 fighters and mitsubishi b2m type 89 torpedo bombers in 1938 nakajima a4n type 95 fighters and yokosuka type 92 bombers flew from ship in 1940 air group was modernized with mitsubishi a5m type 96 claude fighters and yokosuka b4y1 type 96 jean bombers armament hosho was armed with four 50 caliber 14 cm 50 3rd year type guns two on each side two forward guns had a firing arc of 150deg including

maximum range of campbell p 190 a heavy gun armament was provided for hosho as carrier doctrine was just evolving at this time impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized her large flight deck and lack of armor made her a vulnerable target in surface battles peattie pp 53 55the united states navy did much same with provision of four twin gun turrets on their carriers gardiner and grey p 110 a pair of 40 caliber 8 cm 40 3rd year type guns on disappearing mounts provided hoshos only anti aircraft defense they were positioned on flight deck just forward of

modified by yokosuka navy arsenal from 6 june to 20 august 1924 island tripod mast and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed flight deck and obscured pilot visibility forward part of flight deck was made horizontal and 8 cm aa guns were moved forward close to position of former island and out of way of landing operations milanovich pp 17 reason for removal of island was that navy found that it was too small to be of effective use in controlling air operations or conning ship watts p 169 after island was removed carrier s flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from side of flight deck a design that would be repeated in subsequent japanese aircraft carriers peattie p 53 ship was then assigned to 1st fleet until 15 november 1924 hosho was fitted with a net used as a crash barrier aft of forward elevator between 10 march and 2 july 1925 barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off and stop them from falling into open elevator well barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds milanovich pp 17 21 peattie p 53 as first of her kind hosho provided valuable experience and insight into carrier air operations for ijn ship was used for testing aircraft and equipment particularly various types of arresting gear and optical landing aids lessons

incident and tomozuru incident of 1934 in which a top heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather caused japanese command to investigate stability of all their ships resulting in a number of design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength while hosho was at dockyard between 22 november 1935 and 31 march 1936 her stability was improved forward flight deck s supports were reinforced and increased in number ship s aa guns aircraft crane and upper deck aviation fuel tanks were removed funnels were fixed in horizontal position with their mouths angled slightly downwards front sides of hoshos forward hangar and bridge were reinforced and ship s hull was reinforced in vicinity of her rear hangar to increase her longitudinal strength at full load her metacentric height after these
