amanita onusta commonly known as loaded lepidella or gunpowder lepidella is a species of fungus in amanitaceae family of mushrooms it is characterized by its small to medium sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical pyramidal or irregular gray warts stipe is whitish gray with woolly or wart like veil remnants and at base is a spindle or turnip shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in soil species is distributed in eastern north america from nova scotia to mexico and may be found growing on ground in deciduous forests particularly those with oak hickory and chestnut fruit bodies smell somewhat like bleaching powder and their edibility is unknown but possibly toxic taxonomy amanita onusta was first described in 1874 by american mycologist elliot calvin howe as agaricus later in 1891 pier andrea saccardo transferred species to genus amanita amanita authority cornelis bas writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on genus placed species in his stirps microlepis subsection solitariae section this grouping of amanita mushroom species also includes a a atkinsoniana a costaricensis a provisionally named species authored by tulloss halling g m muell a nitida as coker described species and a latin epithet means charged load carrying burdened and a regular adjective derived from onus burden same word that gave english onus a onusta is commonly known as loaded lepidella or gunpowder lepidella description fruit bodies of amanita onusta have caps that are initially broadly convex but flatten out as they mature reaching diameters of cap surface grayish white in color is ornamented with conical or pyramidal raised warts or flattened symmetrically arranged gray to brownish gray grayish brown or grayish orange small scales squamules that are densely arranged over surface thumb left detail of cap left cap margin has veil fragments hanging from it squamules are less crowded near edge of cap margin margin does not have striations and is typically fringed with remnants of veil gills on underside of cap are spaced closely together and either free or narrowly attached to stipe they are white to cream color and are interspersed with short lamellulae gills that do not extend completely from cap margin to stipe gills may look as if they are waterlogged stipe is long thick and tapers slightly upwards it is solid gray to brownish gray near base paler towards top and appears cottony floccose or hairy fibrillose bulb at base of stipe is roughly spindle to turnip shaped and may root deeply into soil especially if soil is loose short lived partial veil is white and attached just below top of stipe it is sticky and in maturity often clings to upper part of stipe or may have some meagre remnants hanging from cap margin universal veil remains are arranged in rows of warts and patches of gray to brownish gray small scales over upper portion of bulb below this color is a dirty white flesh is firm and white fruit bodies can range in smell from mild to slightly unpleasant odor has been described as resembling chloride of lime a smell similar to some bathroom disinfectants containing bleach microscopic characteristics viewed in deposit such as with a spore print spores are white viewed with a microscope spores are broadly ellipsoid to elongate translucent thin walled amyloid and have dimensions of 8 3 11 6 by 4 9 6 6 mm basidia spore bearing cells are 38 46 by 9 11 mm club shaped mostly 4 spored but some are 2 or 3 spored with clamps cheilocystidia cystidia found on edge of a gill are 23 3 31 5 by 11 6 15 7 mm ellipsoid club to pear shaped cells partly in short rows cap cuticle is up to 168 mm thick and consists of thin walled interwoven hyphae that are 2 5 3 mm diameter and gelatinized clamp connections are present in hyphae of this species these are short branches connecting one cell to previous cell to allow passage of products of nuclear division edibility edibility of a onusta is unknown but mushroom has been described as possibly poisonous in general species of amanita are best avoided for consumption because of prevalence of toxic species in that genus similar species amanita onusta may be confused with a cinereoconia because of similar gray powdery veil remnants on cap surface a cinereoconia is distinguished from a onusta by absence of clamps its powdery wooly to powdery warty cap as well as absence of warts or scales at base of stipe a cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime another similar species is a costaricensis found only in costa rica a atkinsoniana another north american species has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of a onusta and warts on basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows habitat and distribution amanita onusta grows solitary or scattered on ground in mixed oak hickory and chestnut forests from southern new england to texas species has a preference for sandy or loose soils its range extends north to nova scotia canada and south to mexico see also list of amanita species references cited books onusta category fungi described in 1874 category fungi of north america category inedible fungi
