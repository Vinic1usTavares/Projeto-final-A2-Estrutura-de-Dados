sarcophagus containing doom slayer along with his praetor suit who demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through hell facility is overrun by demons after one of hayden s researchers olivia pierce makes a pact with them and uses tower to open a portal to hell in desperation hayden releases doom slayer from his sarcophagus to repel demonic invasion and close portal doom slayer recovers his praetor suit and fights his way through overrun facility where he realigns a comms satellite dish to get a lay of land all guided by ai vega after clearing out facility core and preventing a meltdown he pursues pierce as he destroys energy induction filters to hayden s objections he pursues pierce up tower where she uses an argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into hell destroying

slayer s return to mars hayden confiscates crucible which he plans to use in his research despite all that has happened he insists that earth is too desperate for energy to give up to keep doom slayer from interfering with his plans hayden teleports him to an undisclosed location saying that they will meet again development as doom 4 thumb a screenshot of canceled doom 4 which showcased a more urban environment than its predecessors john carmack co founder of and then lead developer at id software indicated that doom 4 was in development at quakecon on august 3 2007 it was announced in may 2008 id software ceo todd hollenshead suggested that like doom ii hell on earth game would take place on earth carmack stated that it would feature gameplay more akin to original doom games rather than survival horror gameplay of doom 3 in 2008 carmack claimed that doom 4 would look three times better than rage even though it was intended to run at 30 frames per second on xbox 360 and playstation 3 rather than 60 that rage was targeting it was planned to run at 60 frames per second on windows with state of art hardware carmack also stated that game was running on id tech 5 game engine in 2009 he revealed that multiplayer component was being developed separately and would run at 60 frames per second he stated in 2011 that you can t have 30 guys crawling all over you at 60 frames per second at this graphics technology level because it s painful in april 2009 hollenshead said that doom 4 was deep in development asked whether doom 4 would be a sequel a reboot or a prequel his response was it s not a sequel to doom 3 but it s not a reboot either doom 3 was sort of a reboot it s a little bit different than those on june 23 2009 zenimax media parent company of bethesda softworks acquired id software and announced that future id games would be published by bethesda softworks including doom 4 id software creative director tim willits announced that key releases would be much sooner and that partnership allowed id software to have two teams each having a project in parallel development for first time carmack added that once rage was complete its development team would move to doom 4 doom 4 might also feature dedicated servers unlike rage at 2011 quakecon carmack mentioned that new doom would be using a new scripting language based on c and called it super script a superset of c with features such as scheduling and type safety at end of 2012 team decided to make doom 4 a reboot in november 2013 carmack left id software to commit to his work at oculus vr in april 2013 kotaku published an expose describing doom 4 as trapped in development hell citing connections to id article claimed that doom 4 had suffered under mismanagement and that development was completely restarted in 2011 inside sources described pre 2011 version which was to portray uprising of hell on earth as heavily scripted and cinematic comparing it to call of duty franchise pre 2011 version was criticized as mediocre and new version as lame and a mess while hollenshead initially stated that doom 4 team was doing something that fans would be happy with id s willits criticized game s lack of character in quakecon 2013 in july 2015 marty stratton criticized doom 4s lack of personality as id s primary reason to cancel game and pointed out its similarities to call of duty franchise and that game was not product that id thought people wanted in a 2016 video documentary by doom creative director hugo martin described hell on earth premise as it was like robert zemeckis see contact like if this really happened now let s be clear it was awesome but it was more realistic it was about global impact of a hellish invasion creative director of doom 4 prototype kevin cloud said in same interview as far as upper level creative direction that was me driving that and honestly again taking it in a direction i don t think fans would have enjoyed as doom after game s redesign began willits revealed in august 2013 that doom was still team s focus british science fiction writer graham joyce was enlisted to write game s story after joyce died in 2014 adam gascoine was brought in as a replacement a teaser trailer of doom was presented at electronic entertainment expo 2014 and on quakecon and doom websites a more expansive trailer was unveiled at quakecon 2014 on july 17 wherein a closed presentation was made mainly to silence ongoing rumors of project being in jeopardy id software executive producer marty stratton host of presentation announced that doom 4 had been renamed doom as it s an origin game reimagining everything about originals in light of crytek s financial difficulties it was announced that tiago sousa head r d graphics engineer at crytek was leaving to join doom and id tech 6 engine team as a lead programmer bethesda released a teaser trailer to promote gameplay being shown at e3 2015 on june 14 2015 trailer depicted double barreled shotgun and revenant a monster returning to game on june 14 around 15 minutes of gameplay footage were shown at e3 regarding progression system marty stratton thought that it was important to allow players personalization and customization id felt greatest challenge was to compete with other first person shooters such as call of duty and battlefield as younger players were less familiar with older doom franchise they also found it difficult to establish a game with its own identity while being faithful to other games in series team consulted game directors at bethesda game studios who stratton considered had gone through same thing when they were working on fallout 3 thumb 250px this cover is similar to and inspired by original game s cover art after being favored by fans and in response to criticisms of primary cover this reversible cover was elected to be official one it was used later by nintendo switch port as default box art on july 2 2015 stratton revealed that game would not take place on earth and that unlike doom 3 game was comic and very juvenile director hugo martin later said that game was heavily inspired by rock and roll and he man and masters of universe and that its hell themed levels would feature much heavy metal dooms world was designed to have personality and be over top uac industrial field was designed to be massive underbelly of corporation uac corporate field zone was designed to be much cleaner in terms of splattered than other zones to prevent repetition skulls were used in hell as iconic elements and titan s realm zone was constructed from dead ancient colossal demons at quakecon 2015 it was announced that game would run at 1080p and 60 frames per second on console as id considered it most necessary graphical goal which could effectively improve gameplay fluidity according to martin team put little emphasis on story as they believed that it was not an important feature of franchise instead they added codex items to let interested players speculate about story and identity of player character according to stratton and martin movement is game s most important pillar to help keep movement fast weapon reloading was excluded and levels were designed to discourage players from hiding on january 25 stratton confirmed game s feature of non linear exploration and stated that combat is game s focus and that difficulty of game was raised with aim of creating an ultimate first person shooter on march 31 2016 release date of doom beta a cinematic trailer directed by joe kosinski was created to evoke game s three core pillars incessant combat terrifying demons and powerful guns dooms multiplayer was developed in conjunction with certain affinity snapmap was developed in conjunction with escalation studios and designed to be powerful to give players opportunity to create their own content as part of doom and id legacies and target those who have no experience or expertise in traditional modding soundtrack doom soundtrack was composed by mick gordon with additional contributions by richard devine gordon aimed to treat game s original soundtrack with utmost respect while modernizing it however team at id stipulated in initial brief that they wanted no guitars on soundtrack fearing that it would make game feel like bill ted and that heavy metal music itself has become a bit of a joke gordon s initial concept was based around idea of argent energy corrupting human made devices to mirror this in music he fed basic waveforms sine waves and white noise through a complex array of effects units such as distortion and compression while this resulted in a unique electronic sound game still wasn t sounding like doom gordon then gradually started adding more and more guitar elements which eventually resulted in desired tone and feel for game gordon used seven and eight string guitars to give music a lower tone and used a nine string guitar for game s main theme a variation on bobby prince s at doom s gate theme gordon would eventually admit that using a nine string was kinda stupid in its excess and that while he eventually sold guitar to fredrik from even he can t find a use for it soundtrack contains numerous easter eggs some songs reference themes or sounds from older doom games others contain backmasking jesus loves you images of pentagrams and number 666 embedded into sound via gordon intended these as a joke and never thought anyone would find them but they were discovered shortly after release and widely covered in media soundtrack was widely praised and won best music sound design award at game awards 2016 gordon joined by periphery drummer matt halpern and quake ii composer sascha dikiciyan aka sonic mayhem performed a short medley of soundtracks rip and tear and bfg division as well as quake iis descent into live at awards show soundtrack was released in september 2016 it contains 31 tracks from game over 2 hours of music release and marketing thumb statue of

release initial reception of quakecon 2014 trailer accumulated considerable acclaim among fans and initial reception of e3 2015 trailer was also positive despite receiving criticisms by some critics who considered game to be too violent pete hines from bethesda softworks responded by saying that game is designed to allow players to apply violence on demons instead of humans hines added that if you re not into violent bloody games doom probably not a game for you during open multiplayer beta ign writer nathan lawrence called beta disappointing considering it less of a classic style arena shooter and unfavorable compared to other shooters such as halo similarly beta was negatively received by players on steam with mostly negative reviews at time when beta was active rock paper shotgun writer adam smith found beta both to be similar to games such as quake 3 unreal tournament and call of duty series and not to feel like doom itself and criticized weapon loadout concept review copies of game were held back until release day post release doom was released to positive reception regarding fast paced gameplay single player campaign visuals and soundtrack whereas criticism was predominantly toward multiplayer mode many critics believed that doom was a successful return to form for series following wide release game received scores of 85 100 for pc and playstation 4 and 87 100 for xbox one on metacritic nintendo switch edition released in november 2017 was also positively received by professional reviewers garnering a 79 100 on metacritic most reviewers praised job of

game creators including cliff bleszinski and greg kasavin who said that game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer game s single player elements received critical acclaim alec meer of rock paper shotgun favorably compared doom to 2014 game wolfenstein new order also published by bethesda but added that dooms quality surpassed that of wolfenstein due to its fast pace and solid gunplay peter brown of gamespot praised single player because he thought that reboot captured spirits of older games while refining them with modern elements brown also drew attention toward soundtrack calling it impactful gary jones in daily express felt that game had one of best single player campaigns made for playstation 4 and xbox one successfully combining traditional gameplay of series with a very fast pace mike henriquez of game revolution favored visual and artistic design calling it top notch sam white in daily telegraph commended id software for dooms delivery of performance on all platforms and praised weapon design for dooms continuity to introduce new weapons at a perfect speed so that gamers always play with something new and exciting polygons arthur gies remarked positively upon exploration for collectables and secrets and their relevance to new upgrade feature but he was critical of instances where game would lock away sections of a level without warning zack furniss of destructoid was originally skeptical regarding glory kills feature as were other critics fearing that they might distract from fast paced gameplay he ultimately considered them to fit well in flow of gameplay that keeps players in middle of combat without a slowed pace giant bombs brad shoemaker felt that glory kills generating small amounts of health and armor makes them an essential part of give and take of dooms super fast combat do you dart into fray for a glory kill to get a little health back and risk getting mobbed by all other enemies around conversely kyle orland of ars technica felt that glory kills briefly taking control away from player can easily players or them finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them snapmap mode was also positively received with hardcore gamer jordan helm s noting possibilities yet simplicity with its use calling it an admirable feat matt peckham of time thought that mode added further value to overall package of game matt bertz of game informer commented upon accessibility but criticized lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community based mod james davenport of pc gamer compared it to modification in original games which he views as one of primary reasons why doom is still a recognizable title he was disappointed by lack of mod support though he nevertheless noted snapmap for its simple use and variety of ideas already created by players multiplayer mode however garnered a mixed reception from critics ign s joab was less favorable toward multiplayer calling overall game a tale of two very different shooters stating that multiplayer did not live up to standard set by single player components and would not satisfy players simon miller of videogamer com found multiplayer to be only all right matt of egm criticized what he felt was network s poor handling of latency and failing to register on target shots as hits in some instances while not in others edwin evans thirlwell of eurogamer singled out warpath multiplayer mode as most interesting of match type describing it as memorable while he regarded other multiplayer modes as underdeveloped and underwhelming julian benson from kotaku wrote that dooms multiplayer was very similar to other modern games more positively however david houghton of gamesradar enjoyed multiplayer for fast pace yet quick decision making needed to succeed calling it endlessly playable smart brutal fun doom was placed 1st in gamesradar s list of top fps games of all time sales it was
