united states trade dollar was a dollar coin minted by united states mint to compete with other large silver trade coins that were already popular in east asia idea first came about in 1860s when price of silver began to decline due to increased mining efforts in western united states a bill providing in part for issuance of trade dollar was eventually put before congress where it was approved and later signed into law as coinage act of 1873 act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars a number of designs were considered for trade dollar and an obverse and reverse created by william barber were selected first trade dollars were struck in 1873 and majority of coins were sent to china eventually bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars causing coins to make their way into american commercial channels this caused frustration among those to whom they were given in payment as coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each in response to their wide distribution in american commerce coins were officially demonetized in 1876 but continued to circulate production of business strikes ended in 1878 though mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883 trade dollar was re monetized when coinage act of 1965 was signed into law background thumb left 200px john jay knox popularized idea of a dollar coin to compete with mexican dollar for use in east asia following california gold rush that began in 1849 and australian gold rush that began in 1851 a larger amount of gold was put into commerce than could be easily absorbed by normal channels julian p 869 this resulted in a decrease in value of gold and an increase in relative value of silver as a result silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to hoarding or melting in response congress authorized mint to reduce quantity of silver in all denominations except three cent piece and silver dollar beginning in 1860s silver production rose and price decreased julian p 870 during this time silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by copper and paper currency in china mexican peso successor to spanish dollar was greatly valued in commerce however chinese were sensitive to any changes in coin s design and were reluctant to accept newer coins due to a minor design change american silver dollar lighter than its spanish counterpart was unpopular in orient due to its light weight forcing american merchants to purchase spanish or mexican pieces to use in trade taxay p 251 beginning in 1866 during reign of emperor maximilian design was changed to show emperor s portrait this caused widespread nonacceptance of coins in china julian p 945 while conducting an investigation of mint at san francisco deputy comptroller of currency john jay knox began discussing monetary situation with louis a garnett a man who had worked as both treasurer and assayer of san francisco mint julian p 871 garnett recommended that united states mint a commercial dollar that would be exported to orient to compete with other countries silver trade coins that were already popular in that region garnett s rationale was that majority of coins would be hoarded or melted in asia and would never be presented for redemption allowing government to make a profit from seigniorage during his time in san francisco knox also discussed proposed commercial dollar with henry linderman who was working as a special agent for treasury department at that time in 1870 knox wrote a report to treasury and wrote draft for a bill on coinage knox s bill was approved by george boutwell secretary of treasury after modification and review from current and former government officials bill was put before congress julian p 872 thumb 200px designed by mint chief engraver william barber this amazonian design showing columbia with an eagle was rejected by mint authorities as too militaristic on november 19 1872 while coinage bill was still before congress linderman made a report to secretary of treasury in report linderman argued that coin need not hold legal tender status and that it could simply be a piece of silver imprinted with its weight and fineness linderman also notes that such a product could supersede mexican dollar and eventually command a six to eight percent premium at that time american silver exported to orient was being sold at a two percent discount linderman proposed that coin be named silver union in order to distinguish it from standard coins then in production in february 1872 bill was amended by a house of representatives committee to include authorization for a commercial dollar weighing but this proposal was replaced three months later when house voted to include provisions for production of a standard silver dollar weighing while in senate a provision was added to bill requiring treasury to coin a trade dollar of as had been done earlier in house revised bill which came to be known as coinage act of 1873 was approved in house and senate and was signed by president ulysses s grant on february 12 1873 thumb left 240px patterns for trade dollar bill provided in part for striking of trade dollars which held legal tender status up to five dollars julian p 876 legal tender provision was added by a last minute rider at behest of silver interests at insistence of ohio senator john sherman weight and fineness of piece was indicated on reverse an attribution which numismatic historian don taxay found incomprehensible as chinese merchants would never understand them taxay pp 257 258 prior to passage of coinage act director of philadelphia mint oversaw all branch mints evans p 99 after act office of director was transferred to washington d c and responsibility for each mint was handed over to a superintendent design selection throughout year of 1872 mint struck a series of commercial dollar patterns in anticipation of passage of coinage bill julian p 873 production of patterns continued into 1873 but denomination of pattern coins was changed from commercial dollar to trade dollar before bill was signed into law after passage of coinage act linderman met with director of mint james pollock to discuss design of newly authorized trade dollar two men agreed to request a jewelry and engraving firm bailey banks biddle of philadelphia to create designs that would be compared to those already created by chief engraver william barber after examining designs of both parties linderman ordered that design would depict a seated figure representing liberty facing to viewer s left representing direction of orient linderman apparently selected designs from two different patterns taxay p 279 in june 1873 linderman reviewed various patterns created by barber he chose an obverse which one contemporary reporter described as a female figure seated on bales of merchandise holding in her left hand a scroll bearing word liberty at her back is a sheaf of wheat expressing with bales of goods commercial character of coin right hand extended holds olive branch vermeule pp 67 68 selected reverse depicts bald eagle as required by law julian p 875 eagle has three arrows in right claw and an olive branch in left a reversal to most other u s silver coins of era lange p 104 a set of six patterns four with variations on adopted obverse and two showing portraits of liberty was sold by mint to public in limited quantities vermeule pp 68 69 production thumb left 175px coiner a loudon snowden formally complained that high points of trade dollar were not being fully struck linderman assumed position of director of mint and pollock became superintendent of philadelphia mint evans p 100 in july 1873 production began on dies needed to strike coins during this time in a telegram to pollock linderman asked that production of trade dollars be hastened because mexico was preparing to issue another series of dollars with older design popular in asia a design that was discontinued in 1866 first trade dollars were struck during a ceremony held on july 11 1873 forty thousand pieces were issued in first release on july 14 breen p 467 carson city mint received its first dies for new coins on july 22 and those intended for san francisco mint arrived shortly after in total 396 635 business strikes and 865 proof coins were struck at philadelphia mint during first year of production yeoman p 216 carson city and san francisco mints struck 124 500 and 703 000 coins respectively thumb 250px experimental reverse design created by anthony c paquet paired with a obverse linderman approved design but did not implement it due to fears of chinese disapproval of a new and unfamiliar design there were complaints that year from officials at all three of mints concerning quality of coins produced in summer of 1874 coiner a loudon snowden issued a formal complaint to pollock about quality of strikings most notably on high points of design barber began modifying design later that year reducing relief modified dies began service in 1875 in fall of that year linderman suggested that reverse of trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate centennial of american independence pollock opposed idea noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause coin to lose favor in orient julian p 877 in may 1876 former assistant engraver anthony c paquet created a reverse die after being hired by linderman to improve striking quality of coins julian p 878 linderman approved of new design but it was ultimately rejected by mint officials due to fears of chinese disapproval though production of business strikes ended in 1878 striking of proof coins continued in limited numbers until 1883 when final mintage of 979 coins was struck at philadelphia mint yeoman p 217 in 1908 it was discovered that ten proofs dated 1884 and five dated 1885 were produced but these pieces are not listed in official records and it is unknown when they were created reception most of 1873 production was exported to china and in october of that year tongzhi emperor had an assay test conducted on coins evans p 52 in a proclamation translated by chinese consul and interpreter walter hillier emperor stated this proclamation therefore is for information of you merchants traders soldiers and people of every district you must know that eagle trade dollar that has lately come to hong kong has been jointly assayed by officers specially appointed for purpose and it can be taken in payment of duties and come into general circulation you must not look upon it with suspicion at same time rogues and like are hereby strictly forbidden to fabricate spurious imitations of this new eagle dollar with a view to their own profit and should they dare to set this prohibition at defiance and fabricate false coin they shall upon discovery most assuredly be arrested and punished let every one obey with trembling let there be no disobedience evans p 53 thumb 350px a political cartoon published in april 25 1874 issue of harper s weekly entitled rags for our working men specie for foreigners caption for this cartoon reads columbia dear me i do think it very wrong that good nice trade dollar worth 100 cents should be sent out of country for benefit of heathen chinee for if these gentlemen are permitted to have their own way it will take a basket full of greenbacks worth to buy dinner for my children julian p 964 in 1874 trade dollars began appearing in american commerce in early 1875 congress passed specie redemption act allowing treasury to pay out silver coins in exchange for paper currency that act combined with a drop in price of silver caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within united states taxay p 265 many trade dollars were especially to california after value of silver began to decline and intrinsic value of coins fell below one dollar bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout country bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because coinage act of 1873 specified that silver brought to mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars congress considered raising five dollar legal tender limit on trade dollars lange p 116 but instead passed a bill that officially demonetized trade dollar on july 22 1876 secretary of treasury was directed by act to strike no more of coins than necessary for use in trade taxay p 282 despite demonetization of trade dollar bullion producers continued to place coins into american market resulting in an estimated seven million coins circulating within united states of which more than four million were placed in circulation in 1877 despite 1876 act it was not until october 15 1877 that sherman now secretary of treasury finally ordered that mints not accept orders for trade dollars on november 5 apparently believing a false report that additional supplies were needed for chinese new year he rescinded his order finally ending orders for trade dollars on february 22 1878 taxay p 283 linderman ordered a review of success of trade dollar in china it was discovered that coins circulated reasonably well in southern china but usage in north was limited as price of silver decreased employers in united states began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount julian p 879 situation frustrated public as coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them in response many towns mostly in western states set a fixed value on trade dollars businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes and sold them to brokers brokers in turn recirculated coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers pay packets in 1883 members of new york mercantile exchange petitioned congress to allow redemption of coins by government taxay p 284 lange p 117 thumb left 250px carson city mint s trade dollar ledger book bullion prices continued to drop through 1880s increasing loss by anyone forced to sell at melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value despite support of secretary of treasury charles j folger question of redemption of trade dollar became caught up in controversy over heavy coinage of new morgan dollar under inflationary bland allison act silver interests objected to silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards mint s monthly quota under act preferring to sell newly mined silver instead and opposed acts which so provided it was not until 1887 that congress ostensibly to relieve poor though most trade dollars were by then in hands of speculators provided for redemption of unmutilated trade dollars act which did not count redeemed silver towards bland allison act quota passed into law on february 14 1887 when ten day period which president grover cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by president many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by chinese businessmen which was done to affirm coin s silver content dollars were only redeemable for six months and recovered silver was struck into dimes quarters and half dollars numismatic historian walter breen criticized both legal tender provision and coin in general stating that coin s issuance was an expensive mistake its motivation mere greed its design a triumph of dullness its domestic circulation and legal tender status a disastrous provision of law leading only to ghastly abuses during 1870s an attempt by japan to introduce its own trade dollar to china fared no better trade dollars were again made legal tender by coinage act of 1965 which stated in part all coins and currencies of united states including federal reserve notes and circulating notes of federal reserve banks and national banking associations regardless of when coined or issued shall be legal tender for all debts public and private public charges taxes duties and dues however numismatic and bullion value of any trade dollar far exceeds its face value of one dollar breen p 466 because of its demand by collectors a
