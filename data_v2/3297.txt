sedimentary layer described in this article geology of grand canyon area includes one of most complete and studied sequences of rock on earth nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in grand canyon and in grand canyon national park area range in age from about 200 million to nearly 2 billion years old most were deposited in warm shallow seas and near ancient long gone sea shores in western north america both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented including lithified sand dunes from an extinct desert there are at least 14 known unconformities in geologic record found in grand canyon uplift of region started about 75 million years ago during laramide orogeny a mountain building event that is largely responsible for creating rocky mountains to east in total colorado plateau was uplifted an estimated adjacent basin and range province to west started to form about 18 million years ago as result of crustal stretching a drainage system that flowed through what is today eastern grand canyon emptied into now lower basin and range province opening of gulf of california around 6 million years ago enabled a large river to cut its way northeast from gulf new river captured older drainage to form ancestral colorado river which in turn started to form grand canyon wetter climates brought upon by ice ages starting 2 million years ago greatly increased excavation of grand canyon which was nearly as deep as it is now 1 2 million years ago volcanic activity deposited lava over area 1 8 million to 500 000 years ago at least 13 lava dams blocked colorado river forming lakes that were up to deep end of last ice age and subsequent human activity has greatly reduced ability of colorado river to excavate canyon dams in particular have upset patterns of sediment transport and deposition controlled floods from glen canyon dam upstream have been conducted to see if they have a restorative effect earthquakes and mass wasting erosive events still affect region

reddish rock face with rough surface adjacent to a river vishnu basement rocks were deposited as volcanic rocks and sediments but were later metamorphosed and intruded by igneous rock at about 2 5 and 1 8 billion years ago in precambrian time sand mud silt and ash were laid down in a marine basin adjacent to an orogenic belt from 1 8 to 1 6 billion years ago at least two island arcs collided with proto north american continent this process of plate tectonics compressed and grafted marine sediments in basin onto mainland and uplifted them out of sea later these rocks were buried under surface and pressure cooked into metamorphic rock resulting granite gorge metamorphic suite which is part of vishnu basement rocks consists of metasedimentary vishnu schist and metavolcanic brahma and rama schists that were formed 1 75 billion to 1 73 billion years ago this is resistant rock now exposed at bottom of canyon in inner gorge as volcanic islands collided with mainland around 1 7 billion years ago blobs of magma rose from subduction zone and intruded granite gorge metamorphic suite these plutons slowly cooled to form zoroaster granite part of which would later be metamorphosed into gneiss this rock unit can be seen as light colored bands in darker garnet studded vishnu schist see 1b in figure 1 intrusion of granite occurred in three phases two during initial vishnu metamorphism period and a third around 1 4 billion years ago third phase was accompanied by large scale faulting particularly along north south faults leading to a partial rifting of continent collision expanded continent from wyoming colorado border into mexico and almost doubled crust s thickness in grand canyon region part of this thickening created high ancestral mountains subsequent erosion lasting 300 million years stripped much of exposed sediments and mountains away this reduced very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet tens of meters high geologist john wesley powell called this major gap in geologic record which is also seen in other parts of world great unconformity other sediments may have been added but if they ever existed were completely removed by erosion such gaps in geologic record are called unconformities by geologists great unconformity is one of best examples of an exposed nonconformity which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks grand canyon supergroup in late precambrian time extension from a large tectonic plate or smaller plates moving away from laurentia thinned its continental crust forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split continent eventually this sunken region of laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present day lake superior to glacier national park in montana to grand canyon and uinta mountains resulting grand canyon supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1 2 billion and 740 million years ago in this sea good exposures of supergroup can be seen in eastern grand canyon in inner gorge and from desert view point and moran point a geologic formation is a rock unit that has one or more sediment beds and a member is a minor unit in a formation groups are sets of formations that are related in significant ways and a supergroup is a sequence of vertically related groups and lone formations alt layered dark brown rock in stairstep pattern in ledges above a river in a canyon with exposed reddish and tan rock thumb left cardenas basalt was laid on top of rest of grand canyon supergroup oldest section of supergroup is unkar group it accumulated in a variety of fluvial deltaic tidal nearshore marine and offshore marine environments first formation to be laid down in unkar group was bass formation fluvial gravels initially accumulated in shallow river valleys they later lithified into a basal conglomerate that is known as member of bass formation bass formation was deposited in a shallow sea near coast as a mix of limestone sandstone and shale diagenesis later altered bulk of limestone into dolomite it is thick and grayish in color averaging 1250 million years old this is oldest layer exposed in grand canyon that contains fossils stromatolites shale is made of thin beds of marginal marine derived mudstones sandstones and shale that together are thick this formation indicates a short lived regression retreat of seashore in area that left mud flats today it is very bright orange red and gives red canyon its name shinumo quartzite is a resistant marine sedimentary quartzite that was eroded to form that later became islands in cambrian time those islands withstood wave action long enough to become re buried by other sediments in cambrian period dox formation is over thick and is made of sandstone with some interbedded shale beds and mudstone that were deposited in fluvial and tidal environments ripple marks and other features indicate it was close to shore outcrops of this red to orange formation can be seen in eastern parts of canyon fossils of stromatolites and algae are found in this layer at 1070 70 million years old cardenas basalt is youngest formation in unkar group it is made of layers of dark brown basaltic rocks that flowed as lava up to thick nankoweap formation is around 1050 million years old and is not part of a group this rock unit is made of coarse grained sandstone and was deposited in a shallow sea on top of eroded surface of cardenas basalt nankoweap is only exposed in eastern part of canyon a gap in geologic record an unconformity follows nankoweap upright thumb alt a ledge made of pebbly rock with lichen on it sixtymile formation is last rock unit in chuar group all formations in chuar group were deposited in coastal and shallow sea environments about 1000 to 700 million years ago galeros formation is a mainly greenish formation composed of interbedded sandstone limestone and shale fossilized stromatolites are found in galeros formation consists of black shale and red to purple mudstone with some limestone isolated pockets of reddish sandstone are also found around carbon butte stromatolites are found in this layer sixtymile formation is made of tan colored sandstone with some small sections of shale about 800 million years ago supergroup was tilted 15deg and block faulted in grand canyon orogeny some of block units moved down and others moved up while fault movement created north south trending fault block mountain ranges about 100 million years of erosion took place that washed most of chuar group away along with part of unkar group exposing shinumo quartzite as previously explained mountain ranges were reduced to hills and in some places whole of supergroup were removed entirely exposing basement rocks below any rocks that were deposited on top of grand canyon supergroup in precambrian were completely removed this created a major unconformity that represents 460 million years of lost geologic history in area tonto group during paleozoic era western part of what would become north america was near equator and on a passive margin cambrian explosion of life took place over about 15 million years in this part of world climate was warm and invertebrates such as trilobites were abundant an ocean started to return to grand canyon area from west about 550 million years ago as its shoreline moved east ocean began to concurrently deposit three formations of tonto group thumb left alt wide canyon with steep tan colored walls a river inside a valley is below a broad gently sloping surface tonto group is most easily seen as broad tonto platform just above colorado river tapeats sandstone averages 525 million years old and is made of medium to coarse grained sand and conglomerate that was deposited on an ancient shore see 3a in figure 1 ripple marks are common in upper members of this dark brown thin bedded layer fossils and imprint trails of trilobites and brachiopods have also been found in tapeats today it is a cliff former that is thick bright angel shale averages 515 million years old and is made of mudstone derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and shaly limestone with a few thin beds of dolomite it was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod trilobite and worm fossils see 3b in figure 1 color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish tan to gray parts it is a slope former and is thick is responsible for green coloration of bright angel muav limestone averages 505 million years old and is made of gray thin bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from calcium carbonate precipitates see 3c in figure 1 western part of canyon has a much thicker sequence of muav than eastern part muav is a cliff former thick these three formations were laid down over a period of 30 million years from early to middle cambrian time trilobites followed by brachiopods are most commonly reported fossils in this group but well preserved fossils are relatively rare we know that shoreline was transgressing advancing onto land because finer grade material was deposited on top of coarser grained sediment today tonto group makes up tonto platform seen above and following colorado river tapeats sandstone and muav limestone form platform s cliffs and bright angel shale forms its slopes unlike proterozoic units below it tonto group s beds basically lie in their original horizontal position bright angel shale in group forms an barrier to groundwater seeping down and thus collects and directs water through overlying muav limestone to feed springs in inner gorge temple butte redwall and surprise canyon next two periods of geologic history ordovician and silurian are missing from grand canyon sequence geologists do not know if sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in first place either way this break in geologic history of area spans about 65 million years a type of unconformity called a was formed show erosional features such as valleys hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments thumb left alt annotated photo of different colored rock units on a cliff temple butte formation was deposited on eroded surface of muav limestone it in turn was buried by redwall limestone geologists do know that deep channels were carved on top of muav limestone during this time streams were likely cause but marine scour may be to blame either way these depressions were filled with freshwater limestone about 385 million years ago in middle devonian in a formation that geologists call temple butte formation see 4a in figure 1 marble canyon in eastern part of park displays these filled purplish colored channels well temple butte formation is a cliff former in western part of park where it is gray to cream colored dolomite fossils of animals with backbones are found in this formation bony plates from freshwater fish in eastern part and numerous marine fish fossils in western part temple butte formation is thick thinner near grand canyon village and thicker in western grand canyon an unconformity representing 40 to 50 million years of lost geologic history marks top of this formation next formation in grand canyon geologic column is cliff forming redwall limestone which is thick see 4b in figure 1 redwall is composed of thick bedded dark brown to bluish gray limestone and dolomite with white chert nodules mixed in it was laid down in a retreating shallow tropical sea near equator during 40 million years of early to middle mississippian many fossilized crinoids brachiopods bryozoans horn corals nautiloids and sponges along with other marine organisms such as large and complex trilobites have been found in redwall in late mississippian time grand canyon region was slowly uplifted and redwall was partly eroded away a karst topography consisting of caves sinkholes and subterranean river channels resulted but were later filled with more limestone exposed surface of redwall gets its characteristic color from rainwater dripping from iron rich of supai and hermit shale that lie above surprise canyon formation is a sedimentary layer of purplish red shale that was laid down in discontinuous beds of sand and lime above redwall see 4c in figure 1 it was created in very late mississippian and possibly in very earliest pennsylvanian time as land subsided and tidal estuaries filled river valleys with sediment this formation only exists in isolated lenses that are thick surprise canyon was unknown to science until 1973 and can be reached only by helicopter fossil logs other plant material and marine shells are found in this formation an unconformity marks top of surprise canyon formation and in most places this unconformity has entirely removed surprise canyon and exposed underlying redwall supai group thumb alt tan to cream colored layer cliff face above water supai group with a stranded log from a pre glen canyon dam flood an unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates supai group from previously deposited redwall formation supai group was deposited in late mississippian through pennsylvanian and into early permian time some 320 million to 270 million years ago both marine and non marine deposits of mud silt sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to texas gulf coast of today around this time ancestral rocky mountains rose in colorado and new mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to grand canyon area supai group formations in western part of canyon contain limestone indicative of a warm shallow sea while eastern part was probably a muddy river delta this formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft around 200 m shale in early permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color fossils of amphibian footprints reptiles and plentiful plant material are found in eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in western part formations of supai group are from oldest to youngest an unconformity is present at top of each see 5a in figure 1 is a slope forming gray limestone with some red chert bands sandstone and purple siltstone that is thick see 5b in figure 1 is a cliff and slope forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages thick in grand canyon see 5c in figure 1 is a ledge and slope forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is thick esplanade see 5d in figure 1 is a ledge and cliff forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is thick an unconformity marks top of supai group hermit coconino toroweap and kaibab like supai group below it permian aged hermit formation was probably deposited on a broad coastal plain see 6a in figure 1 alternating thin bedded iron oxide mud and silt were deposited via freshwater streams in a semiarid environment around 280 million years ago fossils of winged insects cone bearing plants and ferns are found in this formation as well as tracks of vertebrate animals it is a soft deep red shale and mudstone slope former that is approximately thick slope development will periodically undermine formations above and car to house sized blocks of that rock will cascade down onto tonto platform an unconformity marks top of this formation thumb alt indentations of roundish footprints with claw or toe marks in tan colored rock lizard like animals left their footprints in coconino sandstone coconino sandstone formed about 275 million years ago as area dried out and sand dunes made of quartz sand invaded a growing desert see 6b in figure 1 some coconino fills deep mudcracks in underlying hermit shale and desert that created coconino lasted for 5 to 10 million years today coconino is a thick golden white to cream colored cliff former near canyon s rim cross bedding patterns of frosted fine grained well sorted and rounded quartz grains seen in its cliffs is compatible with but does not substantiate conclusively an eolian environment also fossilized are tracks from lizard like creatures and what look like tracks from millipedes and scorpions an unconformity marks top of this formation thumb left alt dark mass in bluish gray rock with shells in it fossils such as this brachiopod and fragments of crinoids are common in toroweap and kaibab formations next in geologic column is thick toroweap formation see 6c in figure 1 it consists of red and yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum formation was deposited in a warm shallow sea as shoreline transgressed invaded and regressed retreated over land average age of rock is about 273 million years in modern times it is a ledge and slope former that contains fossils of brachiopods corals and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants toroweap is divided into following three members seligman is a slope forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone brady canyon is a cliff forming gray limestone with some chert wood ranch is a slope forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone an unconformity marks top of this formation one of highest and therefore youngest formations seen in grand canyon area is kaibab limestone see 6d in figure 1 it erodes into cliffs that are thick and was laid down in latest early permian time about 270 million years ago by an advancing warm shallow sea formation is typically made of sandy limestone sitting on top of a layer of sandstone this is cream to grayish white rock that park visitors stand on while viewing canyon from both rims it is also surface rock covering much of kaibab plateau just north of canyon and coconino plateau immediately south shark teeth have been found in this formation as well as abundant fossils of marine invertebrates such as brachiopods corals mollusks sea lilies and worms an unconformity marks top of this formation mesozoic deposition thumb alt a large mound of rock and dirt with reddish and grayish soil and mostly covered with vegetation reddish moenkopi outcrop below volcanic rubble on red butte uplift marked start of mesozoic and streams started to newly dry land streams flowing through broad low valleys in triassic time deposited sediment eroded from nearby uplands creating once thick moenkopi formation formation is made from sandstone and shale with gypsum layers in between moenkopi outcrops are found along colorado river in marble canyon on cedar mountain a mesa near southeastern park border and in red butte located south of grand canyon village remnants of conglomerate itself a member of chinle formation are above moenkopi formation near top of red butte but below a much younger lava flow formations totaling over in thickness were deposited in region in mesozoic and cenozoic but were almost entirely removed from grand canyon sequence by subsequent erosion geology of zion and kolob canyons area and geology of bryce canyon area records some of these formations all these rock units together form a super sequence of rock known as grand staircase cenozoic regional uplift and erosion of canyon uplift and nearby extension laramide orogeny affected all of western north america by helping to build american cordillera kaibab uplift monument uinta mountains san rafael swell and rocky mountains were uplifted at least in part by laramide orogeny this major mountain building event started near end of mesozoic around 75 million years ago and continued into eocene period of cenozoic it was caused by subduction off western coast of north america major faults that trend north south and cross canyon area were reactivated by this uplift many of these faults are precambrian in age and are still active today streams draining rocky mountains in early miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in utah arizona and nevada but there is no evidence for a major river frame left uplift of colorado plateaus forced rivers to cut down faster alt relief map of roughly oval shape of colorado plateau surrounding point where u s states of utah colorado new mexico and arizona meet around 18 million years ago tensional forces started to thin and drop region to west creating basin and range province basins grabens dropped down and mountain ranges horsts rose up between old and new north south trending faults however for reasons poorly understood beds of colorado plateaus remained mostly horizontal through both events even as they were uplifted about in two pulses an exception is slight effect that uplifts and swells created by earlier phases of laramide orogeny have for example formations exposed on south rim are lower than same formations on north rim because north rim is closer to highest part of kaibab uplift extreme western part of canyon ends at one of basin and range faults grand wash which also marks boundary between two provinces uplift from laramide orogeny and creation of basin and range province worked together to steepen gradient of streams flowing west on colorado plateau these streams cut deep eastward growing channels into western edge of colorado plateau and deposited their sediment in widening basin and range region according to a 2012 study there is evidence that western grand canyon could be as old as 70 million years colorado river origin and development rifting started to create gulf of california far to south 6 to 10 million years ago around same time western edge of colorado plateau may have sagged slightly both events changed direction of many streams toward sagging region and increased gradient caused them to much faster from 5 5 million to 5 million years ago headward erosion to north and east consolidated these streams into one major river and associated tributary channels this river ancestral lower colorado river started to fill northern arm of gulf which extended nearly to site of hoover dam with estuary deposits left thumb colorado river had cut down to nearly current depth of grand canyon by 1 2 million years ago alt a grayish colored river with some green vegetation on its banks but small compared to high reddish and tan walls of canyon it is in at same time streams flowed from highlands in central arizona north and across what is today western grand canyon possibly feeding a larger river mechanism by which ancestral lower colorado river captured this drainage and drainage from much of rest of colorado plateau is not known possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river whatever cause lower colorado probably captured landlocked upper colorado somewhere west of kaibab uplift much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting ice ages during pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate to region starting 2 to 3 million years ago added precipitation increased runoff and erosive ability of streams especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer increased precipitation also allowed evergreen forests in modern times limited to an elevation of to extend well into canyon with a greatly increased flow volume colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate grand canyon 2 million years before present almost reaching modern depth by 1 2 million years ago resulting grand canyon of colorado river trends roughly east to west for between lake powell and lake mead in that distance colorado river drops and has excavated an estimated of sediment to form canyon this part of river bisects high kaibab uplift and passes seven plateaus kaibab and plateaus bound northern part of canyon and coconino bounds southern part each of these plateaus are bounded by north south trending faults and created or reactivated during laramide orogeny streams flowing into colorado river have since exploited these faults to excavate their own tributary canyons such as bright angel canyon grand canyon region gently slopes southward so water on north rim flows into canyon and water on south rim tends to flow away tributary canyons are therefore larger north of grand canyon and smaller south of it grand canyon village on south rim is located from colorado river and above it while bright angel point on north rim is located from river and is above it volcanic activity in western canyon thumb vulcan s throne volcano above lava falls lava flows such as this heavily eroded remnant once dammed colorado river alt dark colored mass of rock draped over side of a canyon volcanic activity started in uinkaret volcanic field in western grand canyon about 3 million years ago over 150 flows of basaltic lava dammed colorado river at least 13 times from 725 000 to 100 000 years ago dams typically formed in weeks were long high thicker upstream and thinner downstream and had volumes of longevity of dams and their ability to hold colorado river water in large lakes has been debated in one hypothesis water from colorado river backed up behind dams in large lakes that extended as far as moab utah dams were overtopped in short time those that were high were overtopped by their lakes in 2 to 17 days at same time sediment filled lakes behind dams sediment would fill a lake behind a high dam in 10 33 months filled a lake behind an high dam in 345 years and filled lake behind tallest dam in 3000 years cascades of water flowed over a dam while waterfalls migrated up river along it most lava dams lasted for around 10 000 to 20 000 years however others have proposed that lava dams were much more ephemeral and failed catastrophically before overtopping in this model dams would fail due to fluid flow through fractures in dams and around dam abutments through permeable river deposits and alluvium since demise of these dams colorado river has carved a maximum of about into rocks of colorado plateau ongoing geology and human impact thumb historic rockfall on north rim end of pleistocene ice ages and start of holocene began to change area s climate from a cool wet pluvial one to dryer semi arid conditions similar to that of today with less water to cut erosive ability of colorado was greatly reduced mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before steeper cliffs and further widening grand canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred an average of two debris flows per year reach colorado river from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids this type of mass wasting is main way smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also plays a major role in excavating larger canyons thumb left glen canyon dam has greatly reduced amount of sediment transported by colorado river through grand canyon alt an almost white dam stretches to red colored rock on each side an arching steel bridge crosses in front of dam in 1963 glen canyon dam and other dams farther upstream started to regulate flow of colorado river through grand canyon pre dam but still historic flows of colorado through grand canyon ranged from per second with at least one late 19th century flood of per second discharge from glen canyon dam exceeds per second only when there is danger of overtopping dam or when level of lake powell otherwise needs to be lowered an interim conservation measure since 1991 has held maximum flows at per second even though dam s power plant can handle per second more flow controlling river flow by use of dams has diminished river s ability to scour rocks by substantially reducing amount of sediment it carries dams on colorado river have also changed character of river water once both muddy and warm river is now clear and averages a temperature year round experimental floods approaching per second level mentioned above have been carried out in 1996 and 2004 to study effects on sediment erosion and deposition grand canyon lies on southern end of intermountain west seismic belt at least 35 earthquakes larger than 3 0 on richter scale occurred in grand canyon region in 20th century of these five registered over 5 0 on richter scale and largest was a 6 2 quake that occurred in january 1906 major roughly north south trending faults that cross canyon are from west to east grand wash hurricane and toroweap major northeast trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect canyon include west kaibab and bright angel while northwest trending systems include grandview phantom most earthquakes in region occur in a narrow northwest trending band between mesa butte and west kaibab fracture systems these events are probably result of eastward migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past grand canyon area
