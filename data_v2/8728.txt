called for a boycott and requested publisher issue an apology globe and mail published a review from two uk based writers in its 16 july edition and posted canadian writer s review on its website at 9 00 that morning commentary was also provided on raincoast website style and themes some reviewers noted that half blood prince contained a darker tone than previous potter novels christian science monitor reviewer yvonne zipp argued first half contained a lighter tone to soften unhappy ending boston globe reviewer liz rosenberg wrote lightness is slimmer than ever in this darkening series there is a new charge of gloom and darkness i felt depressed by time i was two thirds of way through she also compared setting to charles dickens s depictions of london as it was brooding broken gold lit as living a character as any other christopher paolini called darker tone disquieting because it was so different from earlier books liesl schillinger a contributor to new york times book review also noted that half blood prince was far darker but leavened with humor romance and snappy dialogue she suggested a connection to 11 september attacks as later darker novels were written after that event david kipen a critic of san francisco chronicle considered darkness as a sign of our paranoid times and singled out curfews and searches that were part of tightened security at hogwarts as resemblances to our world julia keller a critic for chicago tribune highlighted humour found in novel and claimed it to be success of harry potter saga she acknowledged that books are dark and scary in places but no darkness in half blood prince is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk she considered that rowling was suggesting difficult times can be worked through with imagination hope and humour and compared this concept to works such as madeleine l engle s a wrinkle in time and kenneth grahame s wind in willows rosenberg wrote that two main themes of half blood prince were love and death and praised rowling s affirmation of their central position in human lives she considered love to be represented in several forms love of parent to child teacher to student and romances that developed between main characters zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising to continue in final book which she thought would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it deepti hajela also pointed out harry s character development that he was no longer a boy wizard he s a young man determined to seek out and face a young man s challenges paolini had similar views claiming children have changed they act like real teenagers publication and reception critical reception harry potter and half blood prince was met with positive reviews liesl schillinger of new york times praised novel s various themes and suspenseful ending however she considered rowling s gift not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting kirkus reviews said it will leave readers pleased amused excited scared infuriated delighted sad surprised thoughtful and likely wondering where voldemort has got to since he appears only in flashbacks they considered rowling s wry wit to turn into outright merriment but called climax tragic but not uncomfortably shocking yvonne zipp of christian science monitor praised way rowling evolved harry into a teenager and how plot threads found as far back as chamber of secrets came into play on other hand she noted it gets a little exposition heavy in spots and older readers may have seen ending coming boston globe correspondent liz rosenberg wrote book bears mark of genius on every page and praised imagery and darker tone of book considering that series could be crossing over from fantasy to horror associated press writer deepti hajela praised newfound emotional tones and ageing harry to point at which younger fans may find series has grown up too much emily green a staff writer for los angeles times was generally positive about book but was concerned whether young children could handle material cultural critic julia keller of chicago tribune called it most eloquent and substantial addition to series thus far and considered key to success of potter novels to be humour awards and honours harry potter and half blood prince won several awards including 2006 british book of year award and 2006 royal mail award for scottish children s books for ages 8 12 in its native united kingdom in united states american library association listed it among its 2006 best books
