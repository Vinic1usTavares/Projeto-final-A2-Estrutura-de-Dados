lange after whom party was named anders lange s party for a strong reduction in taxes duties and public intervention commonly known as anders lange s party and abbreviated alp lange had some political experience from interwar era fatherland league and was part of norwegian resistance movement during second world war since end of war he had worked as an independent right wing political editor and public speaker lange held his first public speech as chairman of alp at youngstorget in oslo on 16 may same year alp was to a large extent inspired by danish progress party which was founded by mogens glistrup glistrup also spoke at event which gathered around 4 000 attendees originally anders lange wanted party to be an anti tax protest movement rather than a common political party party had a brief political platform on a single sheet of paper that on one side listed ten things party was tired of and on other side ten things that they were in favour of protest was directed against what lange claimed to be an unacceptable high level of taxes and subsidies in 1973 parliamentary election party won 5 percent of vote and gained four seats in norwegian parliament main reasons for success has later been seen by scholars as a mixture of tax protests charisma of anders lange role of television aftermath of 1972 ec membership referendum and political development in denmark first party conference was held in hjelmeland in 1974 where party established its first political conventions progress party and carl i hagen in early 1974 kristofer almas deputy member of parliament carl i hagen along with some others broke away and formed short lived reform party background for this was a criticism of alps undemocratic organisation and lack of a real party program however in same year anders lange died consequently hagen stepped in as a regular member of parliament in lange s place as a result reform party merged back into alp already following year party adopted its current name progress party on 29 january 1977 inspired by great success of danish progress party progress party performed poorly in 1977 parliamentary election and was left without parliamentary representation in 1978 party convention carl i hagen was elected as party chairman hagen soon started to expand political program of party and built a conventional party organisation a step which lange and some of his followers had opposed party s youth organisation progress party s youth was also established in 1978 hagen succeeded in sharpening image of party as an anti tax movement his criticism of wisdom of hoarding billions of dollars in oil fund hit a nerve owing to perceived declines in infrastructure schools and social services and long queues at hospitals 1980s establishing party thumb right 160px carl i hagen party leader for nearly three decades from 1978 to 2006 while progress party dropped out of parliament altogether in 1977 it returned in following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives in this election political right in general had a great upturn which garnered progress party increased support ideology of party was sharpened in 1980s and party officially declared that it was a libertarian party at its national convention in sandefjord in 1983 until then party had not had a clearly defined ideology in campaign for 1985 parliamentary election party attacked many aspects of norwegian welfare state and campaigned for privatization of medical care education and government owned enterprises as well as steep cuts in income tax in election party lost two of its four members of parliament but was left with some power as they became kingmaker in may 1986 party used this position to effectively throw governing conservative led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes a minority labour government was established as a result first real breakthrough for party in norwegian politics came in 1987 local elections when party nearly doubled its support from 6 3 to 12 3 county results this was largely as immigration was for first time seriously taken up as an issue by party although hagen had already in late 1970s called for a strongly restrictive immigration policy successfully putting issue on national agenda its campaign had mainly been focused on issue of asylum seekers but was additionally helped by infamous mustafa letter a letter read out by hagen during electoral campaign that portrayed future islamisation of norway in april 1988 party was for first time second largest party in norway in an opinion poll with 23 5 in september 1988 party further proposed in parliament for a referendum on immigration policy which was regarded by political scientists as start of party s 1989 election campaign in 1989 party made its breakthrough in national politics in 1989 parliamentary election party obtained 13 up from 3 7 in 1985 and became third largest party in norway it started to gain power in some local administrations first mayors from party were hakon rege in sola 1988 1989 bjorn brathen in rade 1990 1991 and peter n myhre in oslo 1990 1991 1990s libertarian schism consolidation 1993 parliamentary election halved party s support to 6 3 and ten members of parliament this drop in support can be seen as result of an internal conflict within party that came to a head in 1992 between more radical libertarian minority and majority led by carl i hagen libertarians had removed party s focus on immigration declaring it a non issue in early 1990s which was heavily punished by voters in 1993 as well as 1991 det nye kampen 26 january 2010 norwegian broadcasting corporation television social conservative policy platforms had also been liberalised and caused controversy such as accepting homosexual partnership party s unclear stance on norwegian membership of european union also contributed greatly to setback by moving focus away from party s stronger issues see also 1994 norwegian european union membership referendum while many of libertarians including pal atle and tor mikkel wara had left party before 1993 election or had been rejected by voters conflict finally culminated in 1994 following party conference at hotell in telemark in april of that year four mps of libertarian wing in party broke off as independents this was because hagen had given them an ultimatum to adhere to political line of party majority and parliamentary group or else to leave this incident was later nicknamed a pun on name of hotel with meaning to lit stab in back betray these events have been seen by political scientists as a turning point for party subsequently libertarians founded a libertarian organisation called free democrats which tried to establish a political party but without success parts of younger management of party and more libertarian youth organisation of party also broke away and even tried to entire youth organisation youth organisation was however soon running again this time with more loyal members although it remained more libertarian than its mother organisation after this progress party had a more right wing populist profile which resulted in it gaining electoral support in 1995 local elections progress party regained level of support seen at 1987 elections this was said largely to have been as a result of a focus on progress party core issues in electoral campaign especially immigration as well as party dominating media picture as a result of controversy around 1995 norwegian association meeting at godlia kino latter particularly gained party many sympathy votes as a result of harsh media storm targeted against hagen in 1997 parliamentary election party obtained 15 3 of vote and for first time became second largest political party in norway 1999 local elections resulted in party s first mayor as a direct result of an election terje soviknes in os 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from progress party 2000 01 turmoil expulsion of populists while progress party had witnessed close to 35 support in opinion polls in late 2000 its support fell back to 1997 levels in upcoming election in 2001 this was largely a result of turmoil surrounding party party s deputy leader terje soviknes became involved in a sex scandal and internal political conflicts came to surface hagen had already in 1999 tried to quiet most controversial immigration opponents in parliamentary party who had gained influence since 1994 national convention in late 2000 and early 2001 opposition to this locally in oslo hordaland and vest agder sometimes resulted in expulsions of local representatives eventually hagen also in various ways got rid of so called gang of seven which consisted of seven members of parliament in january 2001 hagen claimed that he had seen a pattern where these had cooperated on several issues and postulated that they were behind a conspiracy to eventually get oystein hedstrom elected as party chairman seven were eventually suspended excluded from or voluntarily left party starting in early 2001 they most notably included vidar kleppe alleged leader dag fridtjof frank gundersen as well as jan simonsen only hedstrom remained in party but was subsequently kept away from publicly discussing immigration issues this again caused turmoil within party supporters of excluded members criticized their treatment some resigned from party and some of party s local chapters were closed some of outcasts ran for office in 2001 election in several new county lists and later some formed a new party called democrats with kleppe as chairman and simonsen as deputy chairman though gang of seven took controversial positions on immigration actions taken against them were also based on internal issues it remains unclear to what degree settlement was based primarily on political disagreements or tactical considerations hagen s main goal with purge was an attempt to make it possible for non socialist parties to cooperate in an eventual government together with progress party in 2007 he revealed that he had received clear signals from politicians in among other christian democratic party that government negotiations were out of question so long as certain specific progress party politicians including kleppe and simonsen but not hedstrom remained in party more moderate libertarian minority in oslo including henning kristiansen and siv jensen now improved their hold in party 2001 05 bondevik ii years in 2001 parliamentary election party lost gains it had made according to opinion polling but maintained its position from 1997 election it got 14 6 and 26 members in parliament election result allowed them to unseat labour party government of jens stoltenberg and replace it with a three party coalition led by christian democrat kjell bondevik however coalition continued to decline to govern together with progress party as they considered political differences too large progress party eventually decided to tolerate coalition as it promised to invest more in defence open more private hospitals and open for more competition in public sector in 2002 progress party again advanced in opinion polls and for a while became largest party local elections of 2003 were a success for party in 36 municipalities party gained more votes than any other it succeeded in electing mayor in only 13 of these but also secured 40 deputy mayor positions progress party had participated in local elections since 1975 but until 2003 had only secured a mayoral position four times all on separate occasions progress party vote in os only municipality that elected a progress party mayor in 1999 increased from 36 6 in 1999 to 45 7 in 2003 party also became single largest in counties of vestfold and rogaland in 2005 parliamentary elections party again became second largest party in norwegian parliament with 22 1 of votes and 38 seats a major increase from 2001 although centre right government of bondevik which progress party had tolerated since 2001 was beaten by leftist red green coalition hagen had before election said that his party would no longer accept bondevik as prime minister following his consistent refusal to formally include progress party in government for first time party was also successful in getting members of parliament elected from all counties of norway and even became largest party in three vest agder rogaland and more og romsdal after parliamentary elections in 2005 party also became largest party in many opinion polls progress party led november 2006

was chosen as his successor with hope that she could increase party s appeal to voters build bridges to centre right parties and head or participate in a future government of norway following local elections of 2007 progress party candidates became mayor in 17 municipalities seven of these continuing on from 2003 deputy mayors for party however decreased to 33 party in general strongly increased its support in municipalities where mayor had been elected from progress party in 2003 in months before 2009 parliamentary elections party had as in 2001 election rated very highly in opinion poll results which however declined towards actual election earlier in year progress party had achieved above 30 in some polls which made it largest party by several percentage points with such high gains election result was in this case relatively disappointing before election gains continued to decrease with most of these losses going to conservative party which had a surprisingly successful campaign decline in support over a longer period of time can also be seen as labour party was since 2008 accused of stealing policies from progress party progress party did regardless achieve a slight gain from 2005 election with 22 9 best election result in party s history it also for first time got represented in sami parliament of norway in 2009 with three representatives this made it fourth largest party in sami parliament and second largest of nationwide parties in 2009 informal school elections it became largest party in norway with 24 of votes while other parties before had refused progress

to be a bridge between progress party and centre position arose as progress party vowed to not support any government coalition that it itself was not a part of while centrist parties rejected participating in a government coalition together with party since early 2010 opinion polls regularly showed a majority support for progress party and conservative party together progress party however saw a strong setback for 2011 local elections party lost 6 in vote share while conservative party gained 9 according to political scientists most of setback could be explained by a low turnout of progress party supporters in coalition with conservative party party won 2013 parliamentary election and helped form its first ever government solberg s cabinet although progress party itself lost seats and is now third largest party instead of second largest parties won renewed support for government in 2017 parliamentary election which was expanded to include centrist liberal party and
