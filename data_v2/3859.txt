battle of savo island also known as first battle of savo island and in japanese sources as and colloquially among allied guadalcanal veterans as battle of five sitting ducks leckie robert strong men armed united states marines against japan da capo press 2011 originally published new york random house 1962 p 35 johnson william bruce pacific campaign in world war ii from pearl harbor to guadalcanal london new york routledge 2006 p 188 was a naval battle of pacific campaign of world war ii between imperial japanese navy and allied naval forces battle took place on august 8 9 1942 and was first major naval engagement of guadalcanal campaign and first of several naval battles in straits later named ironbottom sound near island of guadalcanal imperial japanese navy in response to allied amphibious landings in eastern solomon islands mobilized a task force of seven cruisers and one destroyer under command of vice admiral gunichi mikawa task forces sailed from japanese bases in new britain and new ireland down new georgia sound also known as slot with intention of interrupting allied landings by attacking supporting amphibious fleet and its screening force allied screen consisted of eight cruisers and fifteen destroyers under british rear admiral victor crutchley vc but only five cruisers and seven destroyers were involved in battle in a night action mikawa thoroughly surprised and routed allied force sinking one australian and three american cruisers while suffering only light damage in return battle has often been cited as worst defeat in a fair fight in history of united states navy after initial engagement mikawa fearing allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak decided to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to locate and destroy allied invasion transports japanese attacks prompted remaining allied warships and amphibious force to withdraw earlier than planned prior to unloading of all supplies temporarily ceding control of seas around guadalcanal to japanese this early withdrawal of fleet left allied ground forces primarily united states marines which had landed on guadalcanal and nearby islands only two days before in a precarious situation with limited supplies equipment and food to hold their beachhead mikawa s decision to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to destroy allied invasion transports was primarily founded on high risk of allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak in reality allied carrier fleet similarly fearing japanese attack had already withdrawn beyond operational range this missed opportunity to cripple rather than interrupt supply of allied forces on guadalcanal contributed to japan s inability to later recapture island at this early critical stage of campaign it allowed allied forces to entrench and fortify themselves in sufficient strength to successfully defend area around henderson field until additional allied reinforcements arrived later in year john toland rising sun page 374 battle was first of five costly large scale sea and air sea actions fought in support of ground battles on guadalcanal itself as japanese sought to counter american offensive in pacific these sea battles took place every few days with increasing delays on each side to regroup and refit until november 30 1942 battle of tassafaronga sometimes referred to as fourth battle of savo island or in japanese sources as after which japanese eschewing costly losses attempted resupplying by submarine and barges final naval battle battle of rennell island japanese chong hai zhan took place months later on january 29 30 1943 by which time japanese were preparing to evacuate their remaining land forces and withdraw background operations at guadalcanal on august 7 1942 allied forces primarily u s marines landed on guadalcanal tulagi and florida island in eastern solomon islands landings were meant to deny their use to japanese as bases especially nearly completed airfield at henderson field that was being constructed on guadalcanal if japanese air and sea forces were allowed to establish forward operating bases in eastern solomons they would be in a position to threaten supply shipping routes between u s and australia allies also wanted to use islands as launching points for a campaign to recapture solomons isolate or capture major japanese base at rabaul and support allied new guinea campaign which was then building strength under general douglas macarthur landings initiated six month long guadalcanal campaign hogue pearl harbor to guadalcanal pp 235 36 overall commander of allied naval forces in guadalcanal and tulagi operation was u s vice admiral frank jack fletcher he also commanded carrier task groups providing air cover u s rear admiral richmond k turner commanded amphibious fleet that delivered 16 000 allied troops to guadalcanal and tulagi also under turner was british admiral victor crutchley s screening force of eight cruisers fifteen destroyers and five minesweepers this force was to protect turner s ships and provide gunfire support for landings crutchley commanded his force of mostly american ships from his flagship australian heavy cruiser allied landings took japanese by surprise allies secured tulagi nearby islets gavutu and tanambogo and airfield under construction on guadalcanal by nightfall on august 8 on august 7 and august 8 japanese aircraft based at rabaul attacked allied amphibious forces several times setting afire u s transport ship which sank later and heavily damaging

about his ships fuel levels fletcher announced that he would be withdrawing his carrier task forces on evening of august 8 hammel carrier clash p 99 some historians contend that fletcher s fuel situation was not at all critical but that fletcher used it to justify his withdrawal from battle area fletcher s biographer notes that fletcher concluded that landing was a success and that no important targets for close air support were at hand being concerned over loss of 21 of his carrier fighters he assessed that his carriers were threatened by torpedo bomber strikes and wanting to refuel before japanese naval forces arrived withdrew as he had previously forewarned turner and vandegrift turner however believed that fletcher understood that he was to provide air cover until all transports were unloaded on august 9 lundstrom black shoe carrier admiral pp 368 85 even though unloading was going slower than planned turner decided that without carrier air cover he would have to withdraw his ships from guadalcanal he planned to unload as much as possible during night and depart next day japanese response unprepared for allied operation at guadalcanal initial japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement mikawa commander of newly formed japanese eighth fleet headquartered at rabaul loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards guadalcanal on august 7 however when japanese learned that allied forces at guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported transports were recalled eighth fleet was also known as outer south seas force and included cruiser divisions 6 and 18 mikawa also assembled all available warships in area to attack allied forces at guadalcanal at rabaul were heavy cruiser mikawa s flagship light cruisers and and destroyer en route from kavieng were four heavy cruisers of cruiser division 6 under rear admiral aritomo goto and after two transports were recalled one of them maru was sunk near cape st george bougainville at 21 25 on august 8 by submarine with loss of 373 personnel this loss is usually regarded as a separate action from battle of savo island dull imperial japanese navy pp 193 94 coombe derailing tokyo express p 21 japanese navy had trained extensively in night fighting tactics before war a fact of which allies were unaware japanese night battle preparations included use of lookouts intensively trained for night operations specially designed optical devices for nighttime observation long range type 93 torpedo use of battleship and cruiser carried floatplanes to drop flares and frequent and realistic fleet night training exercises loxton shame of savo pp 43 44 mikawa hoped to engage allied naval forces off guadalcanal and tulagi on night of august 8 and august 9 when he could employ his night battle expertise while avoiding attacks from allied aircraft which could not operate effectively at night mikawa s warships rendezvoused at sea near cape st george in evening of august 7 and then headed east southeast battle prelude thumb right approach route of mikawa s force from rabaul and kavieng upper left pausing off east coast of bougainville center and then traveling down slot to attack allied naval forces off guadalcanal and tulagi lower right mikawa decided to take his fleet north of buka island and then down east coast of bougainville fleet would pause east of kieta for six hours on morning of august 8 this would avoid daytime air attacks during their final approach to guadalcanal they would then proceed along dangerous channel known as slot hoping that no allied plane would see them in fading light japanese fleet was in fact sighted in st george channel where their column almost ran into lying in ambush she was too close to fire torpedoes but her captain lieutenant commander h g munson radioed two destroyers and three larger ships of unknown type heading one four zero true at high speed eight miles west of cape st george warnings however were considered vague and size of force reported did not suggest an attack was pending once at bougainville mikawa spread his ships out over a wide area to mask composition of his force and launched four floatplanes from his cruisers to scout for allied ships in southern solomons at 10 20 and 11 10 his ships were spotted by royal australian air force hudson reconnaissance aircraft based at milne bay in new guinea floatplanes launched by mikawa included three aichi e13a jakes and one kawanishi e7k2 alf one jake was shot down by aircraft from and its crew was killed loxton shame of savo p 129 first hudson misidentified them as three cruisers three destroyers and two seaplane tenders note some accounts state that first hudson s crew identified enemy ships correctly but composition of enemy forces was changed from aircraft crews report by intelligence officers in milne bay hudson s crew tried to report sighting to allied radio station at fall river new guinea receiving no acknowledgment they returned to milne bay at 12 42 to ensure that report was received as soon as possible second hudson also failed to report its sighting by radio but completed its patrol and landed at milne bay at 15 00 it reported sighting two heavy cruisers two light cruisers and one unknown type for unknown reasons these reports were not relayed to allied fleet off guadalcanal until 18 45 and 21 30 respectively on august 8 misidentification of two of mikawa s cruisers as seaplane tenders by first hudson may have been because of wide dispersal of japanese warships also hudson s crew sighted a floatplane returning first hudson s report was not received by radio because fall river station was shut down at that time for an air raid alert when second hudson tried to radio its sighting of mikawa s force fall river refused to receive report and rebuked hudson s crew for breaking radio silence loxton calls claims by morison dull richard newcomb and other historians that first hudson crew made no attempt to radio their sighting report routinely and leisurely completed their patrol and then had tea before submitting their report at milne bay an outrageous rumor and calumny that is at odds with what he found in his research u s official historian samuel morison wrote in his 1949 account that raaf hudson s crew failed to report sighting until after they had landed and even had tea this claim made international headlines and was repeated by many subsequent historians later research has discredited this version of events and in 2014 u s navy s naval history and heritage command acknowledged in a letter to hudson s radio operator who had lobbied for decades to clear his crewmates name that morison s criticisms were unwarranted abc television australian broadcasting corporation 7 30 report 27 october 2014 mikawa s floatplanes returned by 12 00 and reported two groups of allied ships one off guadalcanal and other off tulagi he reassembled his warships and began his run towards guadalcanal entering slot near choiseul by 16 00 on august 8 mikawa communicated following battle plan to his warships on rush in we will go from s south of savo island and torpedo enemy main force in front of guadalcanal anchorage after which we will turn toward tulagi forward area to shell and torpedo enemy we will then withdraw north of savo island mikawa s run down slot was not detected by allied forces turner had requested that u s admiral john s mccain sr commander of allied air forces for south pacific area conduct extra reconnaissance missions over slot in afternoon of august 8 but for unexplained reasons mccain did not order missions nor did he tell turner that they were not carried out thus turner mistakenly believed that slot was under allied observation throughout day thumb left chart of disposition of ships night of august 8 to protect unloading transports during night crutchley divided allied warship forces into three groups a southern group consisting of australian cruisers hmas australia and cruiser and destroyers and patrolled between lunga point and savo island to block entrance between savo island and cape esperance on guadalcanal a northern group consisting of cruisers and and destroyers and conducted a box shaped patrol between tulagi anchorage and savo island to defend passage between savo and florida islands an eastern group consisting of cruisers and and two u s destroyers guarded eastern entrances to sound between florida and guadalcanal islands crutchley placed two radar equipped u s destroyers to west of savo island to provide early warning for any approaching japanese ships destroyer patrolled northern passage and destroyer patrolled southern passage with a gap of 12 30 kilometres 8 20 mi between their uncoordinated patrol patterns at this time allies were unaware of all of limitations of their primitive ship borne radars such as effectiveness of radar could be greatly degraded by presence of nearby landmasses chicagos captain bode ordered his ship s radar to be turned off in mistaken belief it would reveal his position he allowed a single sweep every half hour with fire control radar but timing of last pre engagement sweep was too early to detect approaching japanese cruisers wary of potential threat from japanese submarines to transport ships crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close in protection around two transport anchorages crews of allied ships were fatigued after two days of constant alert and action in supporting landings also weather was extremely hot and humid inducing further fatigue and in morison s words inviting weary sailors to slackness in response most of crutchley s warships went to condition ii night of august 8 which meant that half crews were on duty while other half rested either in their bunks or near their battle stations in evening turner called a conference on his command ship off guadalcanal with crutchley and marine commander major general alexander a vandegrift to discuss departure of fletcher s carriers and resulting withdrawal schedule for transport ships at 20 55 crutchley left southern group in australia to attend conference leaving captain howard d bode of chicago in charge of southern group crutchley did not inform commanders of other cruiser groups of his absence contributing further to dissolution of command arrangements bode awakened from sleep in his cabin decided not to place his ship in lead of southern group of ships customary place for senior ship and went back to sleep at conference turner crutchley and vandegrift discussed reports of seaplane tender force reported by australian hudson crew earlier that day they decided it would not be a threat that night because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action vandegrift said that he would need to inspect transport unloading situation at tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for transport ships and he departed at midnight to conduct inspection crutchley elected not to return with australia to southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside guadalcanal transport anchorage without informing other allied ship commanders of his intentions or location thumb chart of approach and departure of mikawa s ships from battle area as mikawa s force neared guadalcanal area japanese ships launched three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of allied ships and to provide illumination by dropping flares during upcoming battle although several of allied ships heard and or observed one or more of these floatplanes starting at 23 45 on august 8 none of them interpreted presence of unknown aircraft in area as an actionable threat and no one reported sightings to crutchley or turner mikawa s force approached in a single column led by chokai with aoba kako kinugasa furutaka tenryu yubari and yunagi following sometime between 00 44 and 00 54 on august 9 lookouts in mikawa s ships spotted blue about ahead of japanese column dull says time was 00 44 loxton 00 53 shame of savo p 171 morison 00 54 struggle for guadalcanal p 35 and frank says 00 50 guadalcanal p 103 action south of savo to avoid blue mikawa changed course to pass north of savo island he also ordered his ships to slow to to reduce wakes that might make his ships more visible four minutes later mikawa s lookouts spied either ralph talbot about 16 kilometres 10 mi away or a small schooner of unknown nationality morison claims that blue later sighted a japanese auxiliary schooner in that same area but gives no supporting evidence for why he or blue believed that schooner was of japanese nationality struggle for guadalcanal p 55 loxton states that blue found schooner to be harmless loxton shame of savo p 216 japanese ships held their course while pointing more than 50 guns at blue ready to open fire at first indication that blue had sighted them when blue was less than 2 kilometres 1 mi away from mikawa s force she suddenly reversed course having reached end of her patrol track and steamed away apparently oblivious to long column of large japanese ships sailing by her seeing that his ships were still undetected mikawa turned back to a course south of savo island and increased speed first to and then to at 01 25 mikawa released his ships to operate independently of his flagship and at 01 31 he ordered every ship attack at about this time yunagi detached from japanese column and reversed direction perhaps because she lost sight of other japanese ships ahead of her or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for mikawa s force one minute later japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port this ship was destroyer heavily damaged day before and now departing guadalcanal independently for repairs in australia whether jarvis sighted japanese ships is unknown since her radios had been destroyed furutaka launched torpedoes at jarvis which all missed japanese ships passed as close to jarvis as 1 100 meters close enough for officers on tenryu to look down onto destroyer s decks without seeing any of her crew moving about if jarvis was aware of japanese ships passing by she did not respond in any noticeable way two minutes after sighting jarvis japanese lookouts sighted allied destroyers and cruisers of southern force about 12 500 metres away silhouetted by glow from burning george f elliott several minutes later at about 01 38 japanese cruisers began launching salvos of torpedoes at allied southern force ships at this same time lookouts on chokai spotted ships of allied northern force at a range of 16 kilometres 10 mi chokai turned to face this new threat and rest of japanese column followed while still preparing to engage allied southern force ships with gunfire pattersons crew was alert because destroyer s captain had taken seriously earlier daytime sightings of japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft and told his crew to be ready for action at 01 43 patterson spotted a ship probably kinugasa 5 000 meters dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp warning warning strange ships entering harbor patterson increased speed to full and fired star shells towards japanese column her captain ordered a torpedo attack but his order was not heard over noise from destroyer s guns at about same moment that patterson sighted japanese ships and went into action japanese floatplanes overhead on orders from mikawa dropped aerial flares directly over canberra and chicago canberra responded immediately with captain frank getting ordering an increase in speed a reversal of an initial turn to port which kept canberra between japanese and allied transports and for her guns to train out and fire at any targets that could be sighted less than one minute later as canberras guns took aim at japanese chokai and furutaka opened fire on her scoring numerous hits within a few seconds aoba and kako joined in with gunfire and within next three minutes canberra took up to 24 large caliber hits early hits killed her gunnery officer mortally wounded getting and destroyed both boiler rooms knocking out power to entire ship before canberra could fire any of her guns or communicate a warning to other allied ships cruiser glided to a stop on fire with a 5 to 10 degree list to starboard and unable to fight fires or pump out flooded compartments because of lack of power since all of japanese ships were on port side of canberra damage to ship s starboard side occurred either from shells entering low on port side and exiting below waterline on starboard side or from one or two torpedo hits on starboard side frank does not believe that japanese torpedoes hit canberra and does not discuss possibility that allied torpedoes hit ship if torpedoes did hit canberra on starboard side then they may have come from a nearby allied ship and at this time u s destroyer bagley was only ship on that side of australian cruiser and had fired torpedoes moments earlier loxton firmly believes that canberra was hit by a torpedo from bagley citing survivor accounts ship s records and damage assessments morrison struggle for guadalcanal pp 37 38 states that canberra was hit by two torpedoes on starboard side but believes they were of japanese origin thumb view from japanese cruiser chokai during battle as aerial flares illuminate allied southern force crew of chicago observing illumination of their ship by air dropped flares and sudden turn by canberra in front of them came alert and awakened captain bode from a sound sleep bode ordered his guns to fire star shells towards japanese column but shells did not function at 01 47 a torpedo probably from kako hit chicagos bow sending a shock wave throughout ship that damaged main battery director a second torpedo hit but failed to explode and a shell hit cruiser s mainmast killing two crewmen chicago steamed west for 40 minutes leaving behind transports she was assigned to protect cruiser fired her secondary batteries at trailing ships in japanese column and may have hit tenryu causing slight damage bode did not try to assert control over any of other allied ships in southern force of which he was still technically in command more significantly bode made no attempt to warn any of other allied ships or personnel in guadalcanal area as his ship headed away from battle area during this time patterson engaged in a gun duel with japanese column patterson received a shell hit aft causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members patterson continued to pursue and fire at japanese ships and may have hit kinugasa causing moderate damage patterson then lost sight of japanese column as it headed northeast along eastern shore of savo island bagley whose crew sighted japanese shortly after patterson and canberra circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in general direction of rapidly disappearing japanese column one or two of which may have hit canberra bagley played no further role in battle yunagi exchanged non damaging gunfire with jarvis before exiting battle area to west with intention of eventually rejoining japanese column north and west of savo island chicagos crew witnessed gun battle between jarvis and yunagi loxton shame of savo p 208 at 01 44 as mikawa s ships headed towards allied northern force tenryu and yubari split from rest of japanese column and took a more westward course furutaka either because of a steering problem or to avoid a possible collision with canberra followed yubari and tenryu thus allied northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides action north of savo thumb right map of action northeast of savo when mikawa s ships attacked allied southern force captains of all three u s northern force cruisers were asleep with their ships steaming quietly at although crewmen on all three ships observed flares or gunfire from battle south of savo or else received pattersons warning of threatening ships entering area it took some time for crews to go from condition ii to full alert at 01 44 japanese cruisers began firing torpedoes at northern force at 01 50 they aimed powerful searchlights at three northern cruisers and opened fire with their guns astorias bridge crew called general quarters upon sighting flares south of savo around 01 49 at 01 52 shortly after japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around ship astorias main gun director crews spotted japanese cruisers and opened fire astorias captain awakened to find his ship in action rushed to bridge and ordered a ceasefire fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces as shells continued to cascade around his ship captain ordered firing resumed less than a minute later chokai however had found range and astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire astorias captain s exact words upon arriving on bridge were topper i think we are firing on our own ships let s not get excited and act too hasty cease firing astorias gunnery officer replied to this command with for god s sake give word to commence firing captain after witnessing chokais fourth salvo straddle his ship declared whether our ships or not we will have to stop them commence firing loxton shame of savo pp 226 27 between 02 00 and 02 15 aoba kinugasa and kako joined chokai in pounding astoria destroying cruiser s engine room and bringing flaming ship to a halt at 02 16 one of astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at searchlight but missed and hit chokais forward turret putting turret out of action and causing moderate damage to ship quincy had also seen aircraft flares over southern ships received pattersons warning and had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when searchlights from japanese column came on quincys captain gave order to commence firing but gun crews were not ready within a few minutes quincy was caught in a crossfire between aoba furutaka and tenryu and was hit heavily and set afire quincys captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards eastern japanese column but as she turned to do so quincy was hit by two torpedoes from tenryu causing severe damage quincy managed to fire a few main gun salvos one of which hit chokais chart room 6 meters 20 ft from admiral mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men although mikawa was not injured at 02 10 incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of quincys bridge crew including captain at 02 16 cruiser was hit by a torpedo from aoba and ship s remaining guns were silenced quincys assistant gunnery officer sent to bridge to ask for instructions reported on what he found quincy sank bow first at 02 38 thumb right japanese cruiser yubari shines searchlights towards northern force of allied warships during battle like quincy and astoria vincennes also sighted aerial flares to south and furthermore actually sighted gunfire from southern engagement at 01 50 when u s cruisers were illuminated by japanese searchlights vincennes hesitated to open fire believing that searchlight s source might be friendly ships shortly thereafter kako opened fire on vincennes which responded with her own gunfire at 01 53 as vincennes began to receive damaging shell hits her commander u s captain frederick l riefkohl ordered an increase of speed to but shortly thereafter at 01 55 two torpedoes from chokai hit causing heavy damage kinugasa now joined kako in pounding vincennes vincennes scored one hit on kinugasa causing moderate damage to her steering engines rest of japanese ships also fired and hit vincennes up to 74 times and at 02 03 another torpedo hit her this time from yubari with all boiler rooms destroyed vincennes came to a halt burning everywhere and listing to port at 02 16 riefkohl ordered crew to abandon ship and vincennes sank at 02 50 during engagement u s destroyers helm and wilson struggled to see japanese ships both destroyers briefly fired at mikawa s cruisers but caused no damage and received no damage to themselves at 02 16 japanese columns ceased fire on northern allied force as they moved out of range around north side of savo island ralph talbot encountered furutaka tenryu and yubari as they cleared savo island japanese ships fixed u s destroyer with searchlights and hit her several times with gunfire causing heavy damage but ralph talbot escaped into a nearby rain squall and japanese ships left her behind mikawa s decision at 02 16 mikawa conferred with his staff about whether they should turn to continue battle with surviving allied warships and try to sink allied transports in two anchorages several factors influenced his ultimate decision his ships were scattered and would take some time to regroup his ships would need to reload their torpedo tubes a labor intensive task that would take some time mikawa also did not know number and locations of any remaining allied warships and his ships had expended much of their ammunition more importantly mikawa had no air cover and believed that u s aircraft carriers were in area mikawa was probably aware that japanese navy had no more heavy cruisers in production and thus would be unable to replace any he might lose to air attack next day if he remained near guadalcanal he was unaware that u s carriers had withdrawn from battle area and would not be a threat next day although several of mikawa s staff urged an attack on allied transports consensus was to withdraw from battle area therefore at 02 20 mikawa ordered his ships to retire aftermath thumb right u s destroyers blue and patterson evacuate crew from burning canberra allied at 04 00 on august 9 patterson came alongside canberra to assist cruiser in fighting her fires by 05 00 it appeared that fires were almost under control but turner who at this time intended to withdraw all allied ships by 06 30 ordered ship to be scuttled if she was not able to accompany fleet after survivors were removed destroyers and sank canberra which took some 300 shells and five torpedoes later in morning of august 9 general vandegrift advised admiral turner that he needed more supplies unloaded from transports before they withdrew therefore turner postponed withdrawal of his ships until mid afternoon in meantime astorias crew tried to save their sinking ship astorias fires however eventually became completely out of control and ship sank at 12 15 on morning of august 9 an australian coastwatcher on bougainville radioed a warning of a japanese airstrike on way from rabaul allied transport crews ceased unloading for a time but were puzzled when airstrike did not materialize allied forces did not discover until after war was over that this japanese airstrike instead concentrated on south of guadalcanal sinking her with all hands allied transports and warships all departed guadalcanal area by nightfall on august 9 japanese in late evening of august 9 mikawa on chokai released four cruisers of cruiser division 6 to return to their home base at kavieng at 08 10 on august 10 kako was torpedoed and sunk by submarine 110 kilometers 70 mi from her destination other three japanese cruisers picked up all but 71 of her crew and went on to kavieng admiral yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to mikawa on his victory stating appreciate courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization i expect you to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support land forces of imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle later on though when it became apparent that mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy allied transports he was intensely criticised by his comrades tactical result from time of battle until several months later almost all allied supplies and reinforcements sent to guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys mainly during daylight hours while allied aircraft from new hebrides and henderson field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions during this time allied forces on guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand several japanese drives to retake islands murray war to be won pp 211 15 despite their defeat in this battle allies eventually won battle for guadalcanal an important step in eventual defeat of japan in hindsight if mikawa had elected to risk his ships to go after allied transports on morning of august 9 he could have improved chances of japanese victory in guadalcanal campaign at its inception and course of war in southern pacific could have gone much differently although allied warships at guadalcanal that night were completely routed transports were unaffected many of these same transports were used many times to bring crucial supplies and reinforcements to allied forces on guadalcanal over succeeding months mikawa s decision not to destroy allied transport ships when he had opportunity would prove to be a crucial strategic mistake for japanese thumb left japanese artwork from during war depicts destruction of three u s cruisers by japanese warships at savo island u s naval inquiry a formal united states navy board of inquiry known as hepburn investigation prepared a report of battle board interviewed most of major allied officers involved over several months beginning in december 1942 report recommended official censure for only one officer captain howard d bode of chicago for failing to broadcast a warning to fleet of encroaching enemy ships report stopped short of recommending formal action against other allied officers including admirals fletcher turner mccain and crutchley and captain riefkohl careers of turner crutchley and mccain do not appear to have been affected by defeat or mistakes they made in contributing to it riefkohl however never commanded ships again captain

lethargy of mind would not be completely shaken off without some more hard blows to u s navy pride around guadalcanal but after savo united states picked itself up off deck and prepared for most savage combat in its history daniel h galvin jr a survivor of sinking of uss quincy writes that for nearly 40 years sailors of quincy held their grief for loss of 389 shipmates and an underserved shame for this overwhelming loss however because of freedom of information act historians were able to discover truth concerning battle of savo island galvin writes that what precipitated defeat was
