electron is a subatomic particle symbol or whose electric charge is negative one elementary charge electrons belong to first generation of lepton particle family and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure electron has a mass that is approximately 1 1836 that of proton quantum mechanical properties of electron include an intrinsic angular momentum spin of a half integer value expressed in units of reduced planck constant h being fermions no two electrons can occupy same quantum state in accordance with pauli exclusion principle like all elementary particles electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves they can collide with other particles and can be like light wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de broglie wavelength for a given energy electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena such as electricity magnetism chemistry and thermal conductivity and they also participate in gravitational electromagnetic and weak interactions since an electron has charge it has a surrounding electric field and if that electron is moving relative to an observer said observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect motion of an electron according to lorentz force law electrons radiate or absorb energy in form of photons when they are accelerated laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by use of electromagnetic fields special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics welding cathode ray tubes electron microscopes radiation therapy lasers gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics coulomb force interaction between positive protons within atomic nuclei and negative electrons without allows composition of two known as atoms ionization or differences in proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes binding energy of an atomic system exchange or sharing of electrons between two or more atoms is main cause of chemical bonding in 1838 british natural philosopher richard laming first hypothesized concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain chemical properties of atoms irish physicist george johnstone stoney named this charge electron in 1891 and j j thomson and his team of british physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions such as nucleosynthesis in stars where they are known as beta particles electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high energy collisions for instance when cosmic rays enter atmosphere antiparticle of electron is called positron it is identical to electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of opposite sign when an electron collides with a positron both particles can be annihilated producing gamma ray photons history discovery of effect of electric force ancient greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed with fur along with lightning this phenomenon is one of humanity s earliest recorded experiences with electricity in his 1600 treatise english scientist william gilbert coined new latin term to refer to those substances with property similar to that of amber which attract small objects after being rubbed both electric and electricity are derived from latin also root of alloy of same name which came from greek word for amber discovery of two kinds of charges in early 1700s french chemist charles francois du fay found that if a charged gold leaf is repulsed by glass rubbed with silk then same charged gold leaf is attracted by amber rubbed with wool from this and other results of similar types of experiments du fay concluded that electricity consists of two electrical fluids vitreous fluid from glass rubbed with silk and resinous fluid from amber rubbed with wool these two fluids can neutralize each other when combined american scientist ebenezer kinnersley later also independently reached same conclusion a decade later benjamin franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid but a single electrical fluid showing an excess or deficit he gave them modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively franklin thought of charge carrier as being positive but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of charge carrier and which situation was a deficit between 1838 and 1851 british natural philosopher richard laming developed idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges beginning in 1846 german physicist william weber theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids and their interaction was governed by inverse square law after studying phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874 irish physicist george johnstone stoney suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity charge of a monovalent ion he was able to estimate value of this elementary charge e by means of faraday s laws of electrolysis however stoney believed these charges were permanently attached to atoms and could not be removed in 1881 german physicist hermann von helmholtz argued that both positive and negative charges were divided into elementary parts each of which behaves like atoms of electricity stoney initially coined term in 1881 ten years later he switched to electron to describe these elementary charges writing in 1894 an estimate was made of actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity for which i have since ventured to suggest name electron a 1906 proposal to change to failed because hendrik lorentz preferred to keep electron word electron is a combination of words electric and ion electron n 2 oed online march 2013 oxford university press accessed 12 april 2013 suffix on which is now used to designate other subatomic particles such as a proton or neutron is in turn derived from electron discovery of free electrons outside matter right thumb alt a round glass vacuum tube with a glowing circular beam inside a beam of electrons deflected in a circle by a magnetic field discovery of electron by joseph thomson was closely tied with experimental and theoretical research of cathode rays for decades by many physicists while studying electrical conductivity in rarefied gases in 1859 german physicist julius plucker observed that phosphorescent light which was caused by radiation emitted from cathode appeared at tube wall near cathode and region of phosphorescent light could be moved by application of a magnetic field in 1869 plucker s student johann wilhelm hittorf found that a solid body placed in between cathode and phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon phosphorescent region of tube hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from cathode and that phosphorescence was caused by rays striking tube walls in 1876 german physicist eugen goldstein showed that rays were emitted perpendicular to cathode surface which distinguished between rays that were emitted from cathode and incandescent light goldstein dubbed rays cathode rays during 1870s english chemist and physicist sir william crookes developed first cathode ray tube to have a high vacuum inside he then showed in 1874 that cathode rays can turn a small paddle wheel when placed in their path therefore he concluded that rays carried momentum furthermore by applying a magnetic field he was able to deflect rays thereby demonstrating that beam behaved as though it were negatively charged in 1879 he proposed that these properties could be explained by regarding cathode rays as composed of negatively charged gaseous molecules in fourth state of matter in which mean free path of particles is so long that collisions may be ignored german born british physicist arthur schuster expanded upon crookes experiments by placing metal plates parallel to cathode rays and applying an electric potential between plates field deflected rays toward positively charged plate providing further evidence that rays carried negative charge by measuring amount of deflection for a given level of current in 1890 schuster was able to estimate charge to mass ratio of ray components however this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected so little credence was given to his calculations at time in 1892 hendrik lorentz suggested that mass of these particles electrons could be a consequence of their electric charge frank wilczek happy birthday electron scientific american june 2012 thumb upright j j thomson while studying naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896 french physicist henri becquerel discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source these radioactive materials became subject of much interest by scientists including new zealand physicist ernest rutherford who discovered they emitted particles he designated these particles alpha and beta on basis of their ability to penetrate matter in 1900 becquerel showed that beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field and that their mass to charge ratio was same as for cathode rays this evidence strengthened view that electrons existed as components of atoms buchwald and warwick 2001 90 91 in 1897 british physicist j j thomson with his colleagues john s townsend and h a wilson performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles rather than waves atoms or molecules as was believed earlier thomson made good estimates of both charge e and mass m finding that cathode ray particles which he called corpuscles had perhaps one thousandth of mass of least massive ion known hydrogen he showed that their charge to mass ratio e m was independent of cathode material he further showed that negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials by heated materials and by illuminated materials were universal name electron was adopted for these particles by scientific community mainly due to advocation by g f fitzgerald j larmor and h a lorenz thumb upright robert millikan electron s charge was more carefully measured by american physicists robert millikan and harvey fletcher in their oil drop experiment of 1909 results of which were published in 1911 this experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity this device could measure electric charge from as few as 1 150 ions with an error margin of less than 0 3 comparable experiments had been done earlier by thomson s team using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis and in 1911 by abram ioffe who independently obtained same result as millikan using charged microparticles of metals then published his results in 1913 original publication in russian however oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time around beginning of twentieth century it was found that under certain conditions a fast moving charged particle caused a condensation of water vapor along its path in 1911 charles wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph tracks of charged particles such as fast moving electrons atomic theory right thumb alt three concentric circles about a nucleus with an electron moving from second to first circle and releasing a photon bohr model of atom showing states of electron with energy quantized by number n an electron dropping to a lower orbit emits a photon equal to energy difference between orbits by 1914 experiments by physicists ernest rutherford henry moseley james franck and gustav hertz had largely established structure of an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower mass electrons in 1913 danish physicist niels bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states with their energies determined by angular momentum of electron s orbit about nucleus electrons could move between those states or orbits by emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies by means of these quantized orbits he accurately explained spectral lines of hydrogen atom however bohr s model failed to account for relative intensities of spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining spectra of more complex atoms chemical bonds between atoms were explained by gilbert newton lewis who in 1916 proposed that a covalent bond between two atoms is maintained by a pair of electrons shared between them later in 1927 walter and fritz london gave full explanation of electron pair formation and chemical bonding in terms of quantum mechanics in 1919 american chemist irving langmuir elaborated on lewis static model of atom and suggested that all electrons were distributed in successive concentric nearly spherical shells all of equal thickness in turn he divided shells into a number of cells each of which contained one pair of electrons with this model langmuir was able to qualitatively explain chemical properties of all elements in periodic table which were known to largely repeat themselves according to periodic law in 1924 austrian physicist wolfgang pauli observed that shell like structure of atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state as long as each state was occupied by no more than a single electron this prohibition against more than one electron occupying same quantum energy state became known as pauli exclusion principle physical mechanism to explain fourth parameter which had two distinct possible values was provided by dutch physicists samuel goudsmit and george uhlenbeck in 1925 they suggested that an electron in addition to angular momentum of its orbit possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment this is analogous to rotation of earth on its axis as it orbits sun intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin and explained previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high resolution spectrograph this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting quantum mechanics in his 1924 dissertation research on quantum theory french physicist louis de broglie hypothesized that all matter can be represented as a de broglie wave in manner of light that is under appropriate conditions electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment wave like nature of light is displayed for example when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns in 1927 george paget thomson discovered interference effect was produced when a beam of electrons was passed through thin metal foils and by american physicists clinton davisson and lester germer by reflection of electrons from a crystal of nickel right thumb alt a symmetrical blue cloud that decreases in intensity from center outward in quantum mechanics behavior of an electron in an atom is described by an orbital which is a probability distribution rather than an orbit in figure shading indicates relative probability to find electron having energy corresponding to given quantum numbers at that point de broglie s prediction of a wave nature for electrons led erwin schrodinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under influence of nucleus in atom in 1926 this equation schrodinger equation successfully described how electron waves propagated rather than yielding a solution that determined location of an electron over time this wave equation also could be used to predict probability of finding an electron near a position especially a position near where electron was bound in space for which electron wave equations did not change in time this approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics first by heisenberg in 1925 and solutions of schrodinger s equation like heisenberg s provided derivations of energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by bohr in 1913 and that were known to reproduce hydrogen spectrum once spin and interaction between multiple electrons were describable quantum mechanics made it possible to predict configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen in 1928 building on wolfgang pauli s work paul dirac produced a model of electron dirac equation consistent with relativity theory by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics of electro magnetic field in order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation dirac developed in 1930 a model of vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy later dubbed dirac sea this led him to predict existence of a positron antimatter counterpart of electron this particle was discovered in 1932 by carl anderson who proposed calling standard electrons and using electron as a generic term to describe both positively and negatively charged variants in 1947 willis lamb working in collaboration with graduate student robert retherford found that certain quantum states of hydrogen atom which should have same energy were shifted in relation to each other difference came to be called lamb shift about same time polykarp kusch working with henry m foley discovered magnetic moment of electron is slightly larger than predicted by dirac s theory this small difference was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of electron this difference was later explained by theory of quantum electrodynamics developed by sin itiro tomonaga julian schwinger and richard feynman in late 1940s particle accelerators with development of particle accelerator during first half of twentieth century physicists began to delve deeper into properties of subatomic particles first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by donald kerst his initial reached energies of 2 3 mev while subsequent achieved 300 mev in 1947 synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 mev electron synchrotron at general electric this radiation was caused by acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near speed of light with a beam energy of 1 5 gev first high energy particle collider was adone which began operations in 1968 this device accelerated electrons and positrons in opposite directions effectively doubling energy of their collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron large electron positron collider at cern which was operational from 1989 to 2000 achieved collision energies of 209 gev and made important measurements for standard model of particle physics confinement of individual electrons individual electrons can now be easily confined in ultra small cmos transistors operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of 269 degc 4 k to about 258 degc 15 k electron wavefunction spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with valence band electrons so it can be treated in single particle formalism by replacing its mass with effective mass tensor characteristics classification right thumb

particle physics electrons belong to group of subatomic particles called leptons which are believed to be fundamental or elementary particles electrons have lowest mass of any charged lepton or electrically charged particle of any type and belong to first generation of fundamental particles second and third generation contain charged leptons muon and tau which are identical to electron in charge spin and interactions but are more massive leptons differ from other basic constituent of matter quarks by their lack of strong interaction all members of lepton group are fermions because they all have half odd integer spin electron has spin fundamental properties invariant mass of an electron is approximately kilograms or atomic mass units on basis of einstein s principle of mass energy equivalence this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0 511 mev ratio between mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836 astronomical measurements show that proton to electron mass ratio has held same value as is predicted by standard model for at least half age of universe electrons have an electric charge of original source for codata is individual physical constants from codata are available at which is used as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles and is also called elementary charge this elementary charge has a relative standard uncertainty of within limits of experimental accuracy electron charge is identical to charge of a proton but with opposite sign as symbol e is used for elementary charge electron is commonly symbolized by where minus sign indicates negative charge positron is symbolized by because it has same properties as electron but with a positive rather than negative charge electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of this property is usually stated by referring to electron as a spin particle for such particles spin magnitude is this magnitude is obtained from spin quantum number as for quantum number s see while result of measurement of a projection of spin on any axis can only be in addition to spin electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment along its spin axis it is approximately equal to one bohr magneton which is a physical constant equal to orientation of spin with respect to momentum of electron defines property of elementary particles known as helicity electron has no known substructure and it is assumed to be a point particle with a point charge and no spatial extent issue of radius of electron is a challenging problem of modern theoretical physics admission of hypothesis of a finite radius of electron is incompatible to premises of theory of relativity on other hand a point like electron zero radius generates serious mathematical difficulties due to self energy of electron tending to infinity eduard atomic physics second edition 1951 observation of a single electron in a penning trap suggests upper limit of particle s radius to be 10 22 meters upper bound of electron radius of 10 18 webpage at harvard university can be derived using uncertainty relation in energy there is also a physical constant called classical electron radius with much larger value of greater than radius of proton however terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores effects of quantum mechanics in reality so called classical electron radius has little to do with true fundamental structure of electron classical electron radius is derived as follows assume that electron s charge is spread uniformly throughout a spherical volume since one part of sphere would repel other parts sphere contains electrostatic potential energy this energy is assumed to equal electron s rest energy defined by special relativity e mc2 from electrostatics theory potential energy of a sphere with radius r and charge e is given by where e0 is vacuum permittivity for an electron with rest mass m0 rest energy is equal to where c is speed of light in a vacuum setting them equal and solving for r gives classical electron radius see there are elementary particles that spontaneously decay into less massive particles an example is muon with a mean lifetime of seconds which decays into an electron a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino electron on other hand is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds electron is least massive particle with non zero electric charge so its decay would violate charge conservation experimental lower bound for electron s mean lifetime is years at a 90 confidence level quantum properties as with all particles electrons can act as waves this is called wave particle duality and can be demonstrated using double slit experiment wave like nature of electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously rather than just one slit as would be case for a classical particle in quantum mechanics wave like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex valued function wave function commonly denoted by greek letter psi ps when absolute value of this function is squared it gives probability that a particle will be observed near a location a probability density ref name cite ref right thumb alt a three dimensional projection of a two dimensional plot there are symmetric hills along one axis and symmetric valleys along other roughly giving a saddle shape example of an antisymmetric wave function for a quantum state of two identical fermions in a 1 dimensional box if particles swap position wave function inverts its sign electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties in quantum mechanics this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to state of system wave function of fermions including electrons is antisymmetric meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped that is where variables r1 and r2 correspond to first and second electrons respectively since absolute value is not changed by a sign swap this corresponds to equal probabilities bosons such as photon have symmetric wave functions instead in case of solutions of wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy same location or state this is responsible for pauli exclusion principle which precludes any two electrons from occupying same quantum state this principle explains many of properties of electrons for example it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom rather than all overlapping each other in same orbit virtual particles in a simplified picture every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle virtual positron which rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter combination of energy variation needed to create these particles and time during which they exist fall under threshold of detectability expressed by heisenberg uncertainty relation de dt h in effect energy needed to create these virtual particles de can be borrowed from vacuum for a period of time dt so that their product is no more than reduced planck constant thus for a virtual electron dt is at most right thumb alt a sphere with a minus sign at lower left symbolizes electron while pairs of spheres with plus and minus signs show virtual particles a schematic depiction of virtual electron positron pairs appearing at random near an electron at lower left while an electron positron virtual pair is in existence coulomb force from ambient electric field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to original electron while a created electron experiences a repulsion this causes what is called vacuum polarization in effect vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity thus effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value and charge decreases with increasing distance from electron this polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using japanese tristan particle accelerator virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for mass of electron lists a 9 mass difference for an electron that is size of planck distance interaction with virtual particles also explains small about 0 1 deviation of intrinsic magnetic moment of electron from bohr magneton anomalous magnetic moment extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with experimentally determined value is viewed as one of great achievements of quantum electrodynamics apparent paradox in classical physics of a point particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment can be explained by formation of virtual photons in electric field generated by electron these photons cause electron to shift about in a jittery fashion known as which results in a net circular motion with precession this motion produces both spin and magnetic moment of electron in atoms this creation of virtual photons explains lamb shift observed in spectral lines compton wavelength shows that near elementary particles such as electron uncertainty of energy allows for creation of virtual particles near electron this wavelength explains static of virtual particles around elementary particles at a close distance interaction an electron generates an electric field that exerts an attractive force on a particle with a positive charge such as proton and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge strength of this force in approximation is determined by coulomb s inverse square law when an electron is in motion it generates a magnetic field ampere maxwell law relates magnetic field to mass motion of electrons current with respect to an observer this property of induction supplies magnetic field that drives an electric motor electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by lienard potentials which are valid even when particle s

that is oriented toward viewer for an electron q is negative so it follows a curved trajectory toward top when an electron is moving through a magnetic field it is subject to lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to plane defined by magnetic field and electron velocity this centripetal force causes electron to follow a helical trajectory through field at a radius called acceleration from this curving motion induces electron to radiate energy in form of synchrotron radiation radiation from non relativistic electrons is sometimes termed cyclotron radiation energy emission in turn causes a recoil of electron known as abraham lorentz dirac force which creates a friction that slows electron this force is caused by a back reaction of electron s own field upon itself thumb left upright alt

change e2 e1 determines frequency f of emitted photon photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum electrodynamics an isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum instead virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles this exchange of virtual photons for example generates coulomb force energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle such as a proton acceleration of electron results in emission of bremsstrahlung radiation an inelastic collision between a photon light and a solitary free electron is called compton scattering this collision results in a transfer of momentum and energy between particles which modifies wavelength of photon by an amount called compton shift change in wavelength dl depends on angle of recoil th as follows where c is speed of light in a vacuum and me is electron mass see 2007 393 396 maximum magnitude of this wavelength shift is h mec which is known as compton wavelength for an electron it has a value of when wavelength of light is long for instance wavelength of visible light is 0 4 0 7 mm wavelength shift becomes negligible such interaction between light and free electrons is called thomson scattering or linear thomson scattering relative strength of electromagnetic interaction between two charged particles such as an electron and a proton is given by fine structure constant this value is a dimensionless quantity formed by ratio of two energies electrostatic energy of attraction or repulsion at a separation of one compton wavelength and rest energy of charge it is given by a which is approximately equal to when electrons and positrons collide they annihilate each other giving rise to two or more gamma ray photons if electron and positron have negligible momentum a atom can form before annihilation results in two or three gamma ray photons totalling 1 022 mev on other hand a high energy photon can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production but only in presence of a nearby charged particle such as a nucleus in theory of electroweak interaction left handed component of electron s wavefunction forms a weak doublet with electron neutrino this means that during weak interactions electron neutrinos behave like electrons either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a and be converted into other member charge is conserved during this reaction because w boson also carries a charge canceling out any net change during transmutation charged current interactions are responsible for phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom both electron and electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a exchange and this is responsible for neutrino electron elastic scattering atoms and molecules right thumb upright 1 25 alt a table of five rows and five columns with each cell portraying a color coded probability density probability densities for first few hydrogen atom orbitals seen in cross section energy level of a bound electron determines orbital it occupies and color reflects probability of finding electron at a given position an electron can be bound to nucleus of an atom by attractive coulomb force a system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom if number of electrons is different from nucleus electrical charge such an atom is called an ion wave like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy angular momentum and projection of angular momentum and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around nucleus according to pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons which must differ in their spin quantum number electrons can transfer between different orbitals by emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches difference in potential other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles such as electrons and auger effect to escape atom energy of electron must be increased above its binding energy to atom this occurs for example with photoelectric effect where an incident photon exceeding atom s ionization energy is absorbed by electron orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized because electron is charged it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to angular momentum net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and nucleus magnetic moment of nucleus is negligible compared with that of electrons magnetic moments of electrons that occupy same orbital so called paired electrons cancel each other out chemical bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic interactions as described by laws of quantum mechanics strongest bonds are formed by sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms allowing formation of molecules within a molecule electrons move under influence of several nuclei and occupy molecular orbitals much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms a fundamental factor in these molecular structures is existence of electron pairs these are electrons with opposed spins allowing them to occupy same molecular orbital without violating pauli exclusion principle much like in atoms different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of electron density for instance in bonded pairs i e in pairs that actually bind atoms together electrons can be found with maximal probability in a relatively small volume between nuclei by contrast in non bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei conductivity right thumb alt four bolts of lightning strike ground a lightning discharge consists primarily of a flow of electrons electric potential needed for lightning can be generated by a triboelectric effect if a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance positive charge of nuclei then that object has a net electric charge when there is an excess of electrons object is said to be negatively charged when there are fewer electrons than number of protons in nuclei object is said to be positively charged when number of electrons and number of protons are equal their charges cancel each other and object is said to be electrically neutral a macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing by triboelectric effect independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons electrons in metals also behave as if they were free in reality particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi electrons quasiparticles which have same electrical charge spin and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass when free electrons both in vacuum and metals move they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current which generates a magnetic field likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field these interactions are described mathematically by maxwell s equations at a given temperature each material has an electrical conductivity that determines value of electric current when an electric potential is applied examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold whereas glass and teflon are poor conductors in any dielectric material electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and material behaves as an insulator most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between extremes of conduction and insulation on other hand metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if they were free or delocalized electrons these electrons are not associated with specific atoms so when an electric field is applied they are free to move like a gas called fermi gas through material much like free electrons because of collisions between electrons and atoms drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is on order of millimeters per second however speed at which a change of current at one point in material causes changes in currents in other parts of material velocity of propagation is typically about 75 of light speed this occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave with velocity dependent on dielectric constant of material metals make relatively good conductors of heat primarily because delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms however unlike electrical conductivity thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature this is expressed mathematically by wiedemann franz law which states that ratio of thermal conductivity to electrical conductivity is proportional to temperature thermal disorder in metallic lattice increases electrical resistivity of material producing a temperature dependence for electric current when cooled below a point called critical temperature materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current in a process known as superconductivity in bcs theory pairs of electrons called cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons thereby avoiding collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm so they can overlap each other however mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain electrons inside conducting solids which are quasi particles themselves when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero behave as though they had split into three other quasiparticles and former carries spin and magnetic moment next carries its orbital location while latter electrical charge motion and energy according to einstein s theory of special relativity as an electron s speed approaches speed of light from an observer s point of view its relativistic mass increases thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within observer s frame of reference speed of an electron can approach but never reach speed of light in a vacuum c however when relativistic electrons that is electrons moving at a speed close to c are injected into a dielectric medium such as water where local speed of light is significantly less than c electrons temporarily travel faster than light in medium as they interact with medium they generate a faint light called cherenkov radiation thumb right alt plot starts at zero and curves sharply upward toward

bang temperatures were over 10 billion kelvins and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts these photons were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of electrons and positrons likewise positron electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons an equilibrium between electrons positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of evolution of universe after 15 seconds had passed however temperature of universe dropped below threshold where electron positron formation could occur most of surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated universe for reasons that remain uncertain during annihilation process there was an excess in number of particles over antiparticles hence about one electron for every billion electron positron pairs survived this excess matched excess of protons over antiprotons in a condition known as asymmetry resulting in a net charge of zero for universe surviving protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions with each other in process known as nucleosynthesis forming isotopes of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of lithium this process peaked after about five minutes any leftover neutrons underwent negative beta decay with a half life of about a thousand seconds releasing a proton and electron in process for about next excess electrons remained too energetic to bind with atomic nuclei what followed is a period known as recombination when neutral atoms were formed and expanding universe became transparent to radiation roughly one million years after big bang first generation of stars began to form within a star stellar nucleosynthesis results in production of positrons from fusion of atomic nuclei these antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons releasing gamma rays net result is a steady reduction in number of electrons and a matching increase in number of neutrons however process of stellar evolution can result in synthesis of radioactive isotopes selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay emitting an electron and antineutrino from nucleus an example is cobalt 60 isotope which decays to form nickel 60 left thumb alt a branching tree representing particle production an extended air shower generated by an energetic cosmic ray striking earth s atmosphere at end of its lifetime a star with more than about 20 solar masses can undergo gravitational collapse to form a black hole according to classical physics these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything even electromagnetic radiation from escaping past schwarzschild radius however quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow emission of hawking radiation at this distance electrons and positrons are thought to be created at event horizon of these stellar remnants when a pair of virtual particles such as an electron and positron is created in vicinity of event horizon random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on exterior this process is called quantum tunnelling gravitational potential of black hole can then supply energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle allowing it to radiate away into space in exchange other member of pair is given negative energy which results in a net loss of mass energy by black hole rate of hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass eventually causing black hole to evaporate away until finally it explodes cosmic rays are particles traveling through space with high energies energy events as high as have been recorded when these particles collide with nucleons in earth s atmosphere a shower of particles is generated including pions more than half of cosmic radiation observed from earth s surface consists of muons particle called a muon is a lepton produced in upper atmosphere by decay of a pion a muon in turn can decay to form an electron or positron observation right thumb alt a swirling green glow in night sky above snow covered ground aurorae are mostly caused by energetic electrons precipitating into atmosphere remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy for example in high energy environments such as corona of a star free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to bremsstrahlung radiation electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy as a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies for instance when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum distinct absorption lines appear in spectrum of transmitted radiation each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines such as hydrogen spectral series spectroscopic measurements of strength and width of these lines allow composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined in laboratory conditions interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy spin and charge development of paul trap and penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations this enables precise measurements of particle properties for example in one instance a penning trap was used to contain a single electron for a period of 10 months magnetic moment of electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits which in 1980 was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant first video images of an electron s energy distribution were captured by a team at lund university in sweden february 2008 scientists used extremely short flashes of light called pulses which allowed an electron s motion to be observed for first time distribution of electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle resolved spectroscopy arpes this technique employs photoelectric effect to measure reciprocal space a mathematical representation of periodic structures that is used to infer original structure arpes can be used to determine direction speed and scattering of electrons within material plasma applications particle beams right thumb alt a violet beam from above produces a blue glow about a space shuttle model during a nasa wind tunnel test a model of space shuttle is targeted by a beam of electrons simulating effect of ionizing gases during re entry electron beams are used in welding they allow energy densities up to across a narrow focus diameter of and usually require no filler material this welding technique must be performed in a vacuum to prevent electrons from interacting with gas before reaching their target and it can be used to join conductive materials that would otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding electron beam lithography ebl is a method of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer this technique is limited by high costs slow performance need to operate beam in vacuum and tendency of electrons to scatter in solids last problem limits resolution to about 10 nm for this reason ebl is primarily used for production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits electron beam processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products electron beams or quasi melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation e g intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy linear particle accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of superficial tumors in radiation therapy electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in range 5 20 mev an electron beam can be used to supplement treatment of areas that have been irradiated by x rays particle accelerators use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies these particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields dependency of intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes electron beam a process known as sokolov effect polarized electron beams can be useful for various experiments synchrotron radiation can also cool electron beams to reduce momentum spread of particles electron and positron beams are collided upon particles accelerating to required energies particle detectors observe resulting energy emissions which particle physics studies imaging low energy electron diffraction leed is a method of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing resulting diffraction patterns to determine structure of material required energy of electrons is typically in range 20 200 ev reflection high energy electron diffraction rheed technique uses reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize surface of crystalline materials beam energy is typically in range 8 20 kev and angle of incidence is 1 4deg electron microscope directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen some electrons change their properties such as movement direction angle and relative phase and energy as beam interacts with material microscopists can record these changes in electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of material in blue light conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction limited resolution of about 200 nm by comparison electron microscopes are limited by de broglie wavelength of electron this wavelength for example is equal to 0 nm for electrons accelerated across a 100 000 volt potential transmission electron aberration corrected microscope is capable of sub 0 05 nm resolution which is more than enough to resolve individual atoms this capability makes electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging however electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain two main types of electron microscopes exist transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge coupled device scanning electron microscopes a finely focused electron beam as in a tv set across studied sample to produce image magnifications range from to 1 000 000x or higher for both microscope types scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface other applications in free electron laser fel a relativistic electron beam passes through a pair of that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with same electrons to strongly amplify radiation field at resonance frequency fel can emit a coherent high brilliance electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies from microwaves to soft x rays these devices are used in manufacturing communication and in medical applications such as soft tissue surgery electrons are important in cathode ray tubes which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments computer monitors and television sets in a photomultiplier tube every photon striking initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse vacuum tubes use flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals and they played a critical role in development of electronics technology however they have been largely supplanted by solid state
