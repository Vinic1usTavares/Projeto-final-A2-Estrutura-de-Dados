bronx whitestone bridge colloquially referred to as whitestone bridge or simply whitestone is a suspension bridge in new york city carrying six lanes of interstate 678 over east river bridge connects throggs neck and ferry point park in bronx on east river s northern shore with whitestone neighborhood of queens on southern shore although bronx whitestone bridge s construction was proposed as early as 1905 it was not approved until 1936 bridge was designed by swiss american architect othmar ammann and opened to traffic with four lanes on april 29 1939 bridge s design was similar to that of tacoma narrows bridge which collapsed in 1940 as a result extra stiffening trusses were added to bronx whitestone bridge in early 1940s and it was widened to six lanes during same project bronx whitestone bridge was also renovated in 1988 1991 to repair anchorages roadways and drainage stiffening trusses were removed during a renovation in mid 2000s and bridge s deck and approach viaducts were replaced soon afterward bronx whitestone bridge is owned by new york city and operated by mta bridges and tunnels an affiliate agency of metropolitan transportation authority with a center span of bronx whitestone bridge once had fourth largest center span of any suspension bridge in world bridge has a total length of and its towers reach above water level description bronx whitestone bridge has a main span between its two suspension towers with span rising above mean high water side spans between suspension towers and anchorages at each end are thus overall length from anchorage to anchorage is as originally designed bridge approach on queens side descended to ground level via a long plate girder viaduct then another on a concrete ramp bronx side s approach descended on a plate girder viaduct then another on a concrete ramp a toll booth was located on bronx side immediately after end of concrete ramp span is supported by two main cables which suspend deck and are held up by suspension towers each cable is long and contains 9 862 wires amounting to around of cable length each of suspension towers has a height of above mean high water at each end of suspension span are two anchorages that hold main cables both of which are freestanding concrete structures measuring width of bridge deck between cables is unlike other suspension bridges bronx whitestone bridge originally did not have a stiffening truss system instead i beam girders gave bridge an art deco streamlined appearance after 1940 collapse of tacoma narrows bridge a bridge of similar design trusses were added on bronx whitestone bridge to minimize span s oscillations further modifications to bridge were made in 1988 1991 and in 2003 2005 highway connections bronx whitestone bridge carries interstate 678 i 678 in queens whitestone expressway i 678 extends south to an interchange with cross island parkway located just past end of bridge s approach ramps there is an exit from bridge to southbound whitestone expressway service road and an entrance and exit from northbound whitestone expressway to northbound service road in bronx bridge leads to hutchinson river expressway i 678 expressway has exits and entrances in both directions to hutchinson river expressway service roads which in turn connect to lafayette avenue expressway continues north to bruckner interchange where i 678 ends and becomes hutchinson river parkway there are also connections to cross bronx expressway i 95 and to bruckner expressway i 278 and i 95 as most trucks carrying over have been prohibited from using throgs neck bridge approximately east since 2005 bronx whitestone bridge is suggested as an alternative route for heavy trucks tractor trailers exceeding and traveling between central queens and bronx as well as all heavy trucks over 53 feet that are banned from throgs neck bridge are required to use bronx whitestone bridge history thumb roadway on bronx whitestone bridge predecessors idea for a crossing between ferry point at clason point bronx and whitestone point at whitestone queens was first proposed in 1905 by real estate speculators who wanted to develop whitestone at time residents around proposed area of bridge protested construction in fear of losing then rural character of community plans for bridge were submitted to whitestone improvement association in 1909 but they were not acted upon queens public administrator alfred j kennedy later recalled that in 1911 while he was in new york state assembly he had proposed such a bridge but that his plan was ridiculed in 1907 clason point college point and malba ferry company proposed a ferry route between clason point bronx and malba queens close to site of planned bridge company was incorporated in 1909 and two years later it started constructing ferry terminals ferry operations between clason point and malba began on july 2 1914 planning in 1929 regional plan association rpa proposed a bridge from bronx to northern queens to allow motorists from upstate new york and new england to reach queens and long island without having to first travel through traffic congestion in western queens rpa believed that it was necessary to connect proposed belt parkway now cross island parkway on queens side with hutchinson river parkway and bruckner boulevard on bronx side next year urban planner robert moses formally proposed a clason point to whitestone bridge as part of belt parkway around brooklyn and queens at time it was expected that bridge would cost 25 million to construct in 1932 new york city board of estimate started soliciting applications from private companies to build and operate crossing as a toll bridge one such application was made by charles v bossert who submitted his plan to board of estimate in 1933 bossert s plan went as far as u s congress where in 1935 a bill to approve construction of bossert s plan was introduced in house of representatives however idea of a private company operating a publicly used toll bridge was unpopular so it was dropped at same time queens topological bureau long island state park commission and triborough bridge authority tba later triborough bridge and tunnel authority or tbta was conducting a study on proposed bronx whitestone bridge in 1935 agencies jointly released a report on connecting roads to be built as part of bridge plans and projected that bridge would cost 20 million bridge would directly link bronx and other points on mainland to 1939 new york world s fair and to laguardia airport then known as north beach airport both located in queens on long island in addition whitestone bridge was to provide congestion relief to triborough bridge further to west which also connected queens to bronx real estate speculators predicted that new bridge would also spur a wave of industrial development in bronx new residential units in bronx were being planned before construction on bridge itself even started rpa had also recommended that whitestone bridge should have rail connections or at least be able to accommodate them in future but moses ultimately did not include any provisions for rail connections on bridge construction in 1936 governor herbert h lehman signed a bill that authorized construction of bronx whitestone bridge which would connect queens and bronx tba began preliminary studies for bridge and in february 1937 tba chief engineer othmar ammann announced that bridge was both practical and necessary same month approval of a suspension span between ferry point and whitestone was given by harry hines woodring united states secretary of war around same time state started issuing bonds to fund construction of bronx whitestone bridge tba was to construct bridge moses argued that tba and city should each be responsible for half of bridge s 17 5 million cost bridge s construction was expedited and in april 1937 tba started selling bonds to fund bridge s construction a 1 13 million contract for construction of bronx whitestone bridge s towers was awarded in june 1937 to american bridge company which had beaten only other competitor bethlehem steel same month city started buying property that was in right of way for whitestone bridge and parkway and shortly afterward rights of way for bridge and parkway were legally designated by late august city had started evicting residents in path of bridge s approaches and notified seventeen households in whitestone that they had ten days to find new housing this raised controversy because of short notice given but moses argued that such measures were necessary to complete bridge on schedule in addition land in ferry point was taken for construction of bridge this land would become ferry point park upon completion of bridge thumb construction progress looking southward from bronx a groundbreaking ceremony was held that november when mayor of new york city fiorello h la guardia laid cornerstone for bridge s bronx anchorage construction on bronx whitestone bridge along with several other road improvement projects was sped up so that regional road network would be ready in time for 1939 world s fair moses anticipated that bridge and connecting roads would need to be complete by june 1 1939 project also included construction of flushing river lift bridge a drawbridge over flushing river a few miles south of bronx whitestone bridge four sections of each of two suspension towers were assembled in only 18 days tower on bronx side was finished first and in late may 1938 work began on queens tower at time it was expected that spinning of suspension cables would begin that september by first week of july 1938 tba reported that both of bronx whitestone bridge s towers were completed and that bridge was on schedule to open on april 30 1939 ahead of schedule in addition construction of connecting roadways on queens and bronx sides of bridge was being sped up bronx side of bridge would connect to hutchinson river parkway while queens side would connect to whitestone and cross island parkways process of spinning bridge s cables commenced in september 1938 first cable which contained 266 strands was completed within a week suspender cables were completed within 41 days that october work started on cross island parkway approach to bridge in queens by february 1939 bridge was nearly complete and construction of approach roads were being sped up in anticipation of 1939 world s fair during construction one worker died when he fell off bridge deck there was another incident in august 1938 in which a 35 ton steel girder dropped from side of whitestone bridge though no one was severely injured opening bronx whitestone bridge opened on april 29 1939 with a ceremony led by la guardia bridge featured pedestrian walkways as well as four lanes of vehicular traffic and initially charged passenger vehicles a toll of 25 cents center span was fourth longest in world at opening behind george washington bridge and double spans of san francisco oakland bay bridge bridge s opening two months earlier than originally scheduled coincided with first day of 1939 world s fair at its north end bronx whitestone bridge was to connect with eastern boulevard later known as bruckner boulevard via hutchinson river parkway at its south end bridge was to connect with new whitestone parkway which led southwest off bridge to northern boulevard connection between bronx whitestone bridge and whitestone parkway opened in november 1940 extension of hutchinson river parkway between pelham bay park and bridge opened in october 1941 a specialized set of lampposts whitestone or type 41 lamppost was made for bridge lamppost design was later used in many other projects though it was no longer being actively installed by 1960s and only a few such lamps remained in preparation for 1939 world s fair amber street lights were installed on bridge s approach roads as well as other key corridors around city these lamps were distinctly colored so motorists headed to fair could follow them while driving within first two months of bronx whitestone bridge s opening it had carried just over a million vehicles and bridge was collecting an average of 4 232 a day in tolls in 1940 american institute of steel construction recognized bronx whitestone bridge for being most beautiful monumental steel bridge completed during last year additionally two parks were opened following bridge s completion a park under queens side of bronx whitestone bridge named for declaration of independence signatory francis lewis was opened in 1940 on bronx side blueprint for ferry point park had been developed in conjunction with bridge s construction and additional facilities were added in early 1940s truss installation thumb view of roadway and a tower showing stiffening trusses original tacoma narrows bridge in tacoma washington collapsed during heavy winds in november 1940 it had employed an deep girder system much like i beam girders of bronx whitestone bridge however whitestone bridge was shorter and wider than tacoma narrows bridge bronx whitestone bridge s deck was also thicker than that of tacoma narrows bridge which was only thick to bronx whitestone bridge s overall bronx whitestone bridge was less prone to oscillation and critical failure as it was not as flimsy as tacoma narrows bridge after performing a series of experiments on bridge s design ammann concluded that additional measures to stiffen whitestone bridge were unnecessary even so public was scared by fact that two bridges were similar in design and this led to a belief that whitestone bridge might be unstable as moses later related shortly after tacoma narrows bridge collapse moses announced that steel cable stays would be installed on bridge s towers to reduce oscillation to mitigate risk of failure from high winds eight stay cables two on each side of both suspension towers were proposed for installation although 1 million was initially allocated for bridge stiffening project construction was deferred due to material and labor shortages during world war ii planning for project resumed in september 1945 at end of war and a low bidder for project was announced that november project s primary goal was to reinforce bridge with trusses thus ensuring bridge s stability four lanes of roadway traffic were widened to six lanes with two additional lanes replacing pedestrian walkways on each side on both sides of deck high steel trusses were installed to weigh down and stiffen bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation stiffening project was completed in 1947 increases in traffic in late 1950s whitestone parkway and portion of hutchinson river parkway between bridge and bruckner interchange were converted to interstate highway standards whitestone parkway became whitestone expressway and upgraded part of hutchinson river parkway became hutchinson river expressway in addition van wyck expressway between john f kennedy international airport and kew gardens was extended northward to connect with whitestone expressway and bronx whitestone bridge by 1965 bronx whitestone bridge and whitestone van wyck and hutchinson river expressways had been designated as part of interstate 678 these highway upgrades were performed in preparation for 1964 new york world s fair which was also held in flushing meadows corona park around this time bronx whitestone bridge was nearing its traffic capacity because it was easternmost crossing of east river between bronx and queens in 1957 to alleviate traffic loads on bronx whitestone bridge construction started on throgs neck bridge to east after throgs neck bridge opened in 1961 bronx whitestone bridge recorded a corresponding 40 decline in traffic according to a tbta executive traffic on bridge ultimately decreased by more than half soon afterward 1964 world s fair resulted in an increase in traffic on bronx whitestone bridge in long run use of bridge continued to grow and by 1978 there were about 31 million vehicles using bridge annually by 1985 bronx whitestone bridge carried 35 million vehicles annually more than 33 million recorded in 1960 before throgs neck bridge had opened as an alternate route there had been several plans to build a long island sound bridge east of bronx whitestone and throgs neck bridges to relieve traffic on these crossings although such a bridge remains unbuilt on november 11 1968 a heavy storm with winds of up to caused bronx whitestone bridge s deck to bounce causing about 30 motorists to abandon their cars no one was injured and abandoned cars were towed away officials later stated that bridge was not in danger of collapsing during storm major repairs in march 1990 tbta announced that bronx whitestone bridge would undergo a 20 3 million refurbishment anchorages roadways and drainage were to be repaired during off peak hours for two years actual work took place between december 1989 and december 1991 as throgs neck bridge was being repaired simultaneously this caused major traffic jams at both bridges during renovation bridge s expansion joints were replaced by american bridge company which had originally built suspension towers however in 1993 sealant around joints was observed to be deteriorating necessitating additional repairs thumb seen from under bronx suspension tower by 2001 metropolitan transportation authority mta tbta s successor planned to spend 286 million in bridge renovations in 2003 mta restored classic lines of bridge by removing stiffening trusses and installing fiberglass fairing along both sides of road deck lightweight fiberglass fairing is triangular in shape giving it an aerodynamic profile that allows crosswinds to flow through bridge rather than hit trusses removal of trusses and other changes to decking reduced bridge s weight by 6 000 tons accounting for some 25 of mass suspended by cables in addition with truss removals bronx whitestone bridge was able to withstand crosswinds of up to whereas trusses could resist crosswinds of no more than truss removal project also involved upgrading lighting systems including bridge s lightbulbs and beacons atop suspension towers as well as replacing sprinkler and electrical systems in 2005 it was announced that bridge s deck had to be replaced with a new steel orthotropic deck composed of prefabricated panels one lane at a time needed to be closed and replaced so as to minimize traffic disruptions during deck replacement five lanes were kept open at all times using a movable barrier with three bronx bound lanes during morning rush hour and three queens bound lanes during evening rush other renovations included adding mass dampers to stabilize bridge deck repainting two towers and bridge deck and installing variable message signs deck replacement was completed by 2007 however cracks were soon observed in some of new panels and by 2014 cracks had been observed in 66 of 408 panels necessitating approximately of rib welds renovations were intended to extend bronx whitestone bridge s lifespan indefinitely these improvements also accommodated bridge s high traffic volumes by 2008 bridge was being used by an average of 120 000 vehicles a day amounting to 43 million crossings that year queens and bronx approaches were replaced in a project that started in 2008 as part of project each of approaches lanes was widened to replacement of bridge s approaches involved replacing 15 supporting piers and of roadway on bronx side as well as of viaduct on queens side which helped support wider lanes contract for bronx viaduct replacement was awarded in 2008 and it was completed in late 2012 at a cost of 212 million replacement of queens approach which cost 109 million was completed in may 2015 during renovation of that approach exit from northbound i 678 to third avenue was closed and rehabilitated tolls drivers pay 9 50 per car or 4
