millipedes are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments they are known scientifically as class diplopoda name being derived from this feature each double legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a ball although name millipede derives from latin for thousand feet no known species has 1 000 record of 750 legs belongs to illacme plenipes there are approximately 12 000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families making diplopoda largest class of myriapods an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi legged creatures most millipedes are slow moving detritivores eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter some eat fungi or suck plant fluids and a small minority are predatory millipedes are generally harmless to humans although some can become household or garden pests millipedes can be unwanted especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings most millipedes defend themselves with a variety of chemicals secreted from pores along body although tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods which transfer packets of sperm to females first appearing in silurian period millipedes are some of oldest known land animals some members of prehistoric groups grew to over largest modern species reach maximum lengths of longest extant species is giant african millipede archispirostreptus gigas among myriapods millipedes have traditionally been considered most closely related to tiny pauropods although some molecular studies challenge this relationship millipedes can be distinguished from somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes class chilopoda which move rapidly are venomous carnivorous and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology and a scientist who studies them is called a etymology and names term millipede is widespread in popular and scientific literature but among north american scientists term without terminal e is also used other vernacular names include thousand or simply science of millipede biology and taxonomy is called diplopodology study of classification thumb left alt diversity approximate relative diversity of extant millipede orders ranging from ca 3 500 species of polydesmida to 2 species of siphoniulida approximately 12 000 millipede species have been described estimates of true number of species on earth range from 15 000 to as high as 80 000 few species of millipede are at all widespread they have very poor dispersal abilities depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats these factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation producing many lineages with restricted ranges living members of diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two subclasses basal subclass penicillata contains a single order polyxenida bristle millipedes all other millipedes belong to subclass chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses pentazonia containing short bodied pill millipedes and helminthomorpha worm like millipedes containing great majority of species outline of classification higher level classification of millipedes is presented below based on shear 2011 and shear

period early forms probably ate mosses and primitive vascular plants there are two major groups of millipedes whose members are all extinct archipolypoda ancient many legged ones which contain oldest known terrestrial animals and arthropleuridea which contain largest known land invertebrates earliest known land creature was a long that lived 428 million years ago in upper silurian and has clear evidence of spiracles breathing holes attesting to its air breathing habits during upper carboniferous arthropleura became largest known land dwelling invertebrate on record reaching lengths of at least millipedes also exhibit earliest evidence of chemical defence as some devonian fossils have defensive gland openings called ozopores millipedes centipedes and other terrestrial arthropods attained very large sizes in comparison to modern species in oxygen rich environments of devonian and carboniferous periods and some could grow larger than one metre as oxygen levels lowered through

systema naturae 1758 named seven species of as insecta wingless insects in 1802 french zoologist pierre andre latreille proposed name chilognatha as first group of what are now diplopoda and in 1840 german naturalist johann friedrich von brandt produced first detailed classification name diplopoda itself was coined in 1844 by french zoologist henri marie ducrotay de blainville from 1890 to 1940 millipede taxonomy was driven by relatively few researchers at any given time with major contributions by carl attems karl wilhelm verhoeff and ralph vary chamberlin who each described over 1 000 species as well as orator f cook filippo silvestri r i pocock and henry w this was a period when science of diplopodology flourished rates of species descriptions were on average highest in history sometimes exceeding 300 per year in 1971 dutch biologist c a w published a comprehensive listing of all known millipede genera and families described between 1758 and 1957 in his nomenclator generum et a work credited as launching modern era of millipede taxonomy in 1980 american biologist richard l hoffman published a classification of millipedes which recognized penicillata pentazonia and helminthomorpha and first phylogenetic analysis of millipede orders using modern cladistic methods was published in 1984 by henrik of denmark a 2003 classification by american rowland shelley is similar to one originally proposed by verhoeff and remains currently accepted classification scheme shown below despite more recent molecular studies proposing conflicting relationships a 2011 summary of millipede family diversity by william a shear placed order siphoniulida within larger group nematophora fossil record in addition to 16 living orders there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial extinct arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class although work in early 21st century established group as a subclass of millipedes several living orders also appear in fossil record below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups extinct groups are indicated with a dagger extinct order zosterogrammida a of uncertain position is not shown relation to other myriapods thumb alt pauropods are thought to be closest relative of millipedes although relationships of millipede orders are still subject of debate class diplopoda as a whole is considered a monophyletic group of arthropods all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods diplopoda is a class within of arthropod subphylum myriapods which includes centipedes class chilopoda as well as lesser known pauropods class and class within myriapods closest relatives or sister group of millipedes has long been considered pauropods which also have a collum and diplosegments distinction from centipedes differences between millipedes and centipedes are a common question from general public both groups of myriapods share similarities such as long multi segmented bodies many legs a single pair of antennae and presence of organs but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories as most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in silurian head alone exemplifies differences millipedes have

around in length and can have as few as eleven to over a hundred segments they are generally black or brown in colour although there are a few brightly coloured species and some have aposematic colouring to warn that they are toxic species of produce cyanide as a chemical defence and are bioluminescent body styles vary greatly between major millipede groups in basal subclass penicillata consisting of tiny bristle millipedes exoskeleton is soft and uncalcified and is covered in prominent setae or bristles all other millipedes belonging to subclass chilognatha have a hardened exoskeleton are in turn divided into two infraclasses pentazonia containing relatively short bodied groups such as pill millipedes and helminthomorpha worm like millipedes which contains vast majority of species with long many segmented bodies head head of a millipede is typically rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles in front of a plate like structure called a jaw lip head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at tip many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as organs shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral to base of antennae their function is unknown but they also occur in some centipedes and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in surrounding environment millipede eyes consist of several simple flat lensed ocelli arranged in a group or patch on each side of head these patches are also called ocular fields or many species of millipedes including entire order polydesmida and cave dwelling millipedes such as and had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind body thumb 200px right alt segmentation and paranota paranota of left and millipedes millipede bodies may be flattened or cylindrical and are composed of numerous segments each with an exoskeleton consisting of four chitinous plates a single plate above tergite one at each side and a plate on underside where legs attach in many millipedes these plates are fused to varying degrees sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring plates are typically hard being impregnated with calcium salts because they lack a waxy cuticle and can t close their permanently open spiracles millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must spend most of their time in moist or humid environments http com biotech diplopoda html millipedes first segment behind head is legless and known as a collum from latin for neck or collar second third and fourth body segments bear a single pair of legs each and are known as haplosegments three haplosegments are sometimes referred to as a thorax remaining segments from fifth to posterior are properly known as diplosegments or double segments formed by fusion of two embryonic segments each bears two pairs of legs rather than just one as in centipedes in some millipedes last few segments may be legless terms segment or body ring are often used interchangeably to refer to both and diplosegments final segment is known as telson and consists of a legless ring a pair of anal valves plates around anus and a small scale below anus millipedes in several orders have keel like extensions of body wall known as paranota which can vary widely in shape size and texture modifications include lobes papillae ridges crests spines and notches paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices protect legs or make millipede more difficult for predators to swallow legs are composed of seven segments and attach on underside of body legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other although often longer in males than females and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction discussed below despite common name no millipede has been discovered with 1 000 legs common species have between 34 and 400

polyxenida bristle millipedes mating is indirect males deposit spermatophores onto webs they secrete with special glands and spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females in all other millipede groups males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called gonopods which are used to transfer sperm to female during copulation location of gonopods differs between groups in males of pentazonia they are located at rear of body and known as and may also function in grasping females while in helminthomorpha vast majority of species they are located on seventh body segment a few species are parthenogenetic having few if any males gonopods occur in a diversity of shapes and sizes and in range from closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all in some groups gonopods are kept retracted within body in others they project forward parallel to body gonopod morphology is predominant means of determining species among millipedes structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity thumb right 200px alt growth stages growth stages of which reaches reproductive maturity in stage v genital openings gonopores of both sexes are located on underside of third body segment near second pair of legs and may be accompanied in male by one or two penes which deposit sperm packets onto gonopods in female genital pores open into paired small sacs called or vulvae which are covered by small hood like lids and are used to store sperm after copulation morphology can also be used to identify species millipede sperm lack flagella a unique trait among myriapods in all except bristle millipedes copulation occurs with two individuals facing one another copulation may be preceded by male behaviours such as tapping with antennae running along back of female offering edible glandular secretions or in case of some pill millipedes stridulation or chirping during copulation in most millipedes male positions his seventh segment in front of female s third segment and may insert his gonopods to extrude vulvae before bending his body to deposit sperm onto his gonopods and reinserting charged gonopods into female females lay from ten to three hundred eggs at a time depending on species fertilising them with stored sperm as they do so many species deposit eggs on moist soil or organic detritus but some construct nests lined with dried faeces and may protect eggs within silk cocoons in most species female abandons eggs after they are laid but some species in orders platydesmida and stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young young hatch after a few weeks and typically have only three pairs of legs followed by up to four legless segments as they grow they continually moult adding further segments and legs as they do so some species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk and may also shelter in these during wet weather and most species eat discarded exoskeleton after moulting adult stage when individuals become reproductively mature is generally reached in final moult stage which varies between species and orders although some species continue to moult after adulthood furthermore some species alternate between reproductive and non reproductive stages after maturity a phenomenon known as in which reproductive structures regress during non reproductive stages millipedes may live from one to ten years depending on species ecology habitat and distribution millipedes occur on all continents except antarctica and occupy almost all terrestrial habitats ranging as far north as arctic circle in iceland norway and central russia and as far south as santa cruz province argentina typically forest floor dwellers they live in leaf litter dead wood or soil with a preference for humid conditions in temperate zones millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests and may reach densities of over 1 000 individuals per square metre other habitats include coniferous forests deserts caves and alpine ecosystems some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months a few species occur near seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions burrowing diplosegments of millipedes have evolved in conjunction with their burrowing habits and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle they use three main methods of burrowing bulldozing wedging and boring members of orders julida spirobolida and spirostreptida lower their heads and barge their way into substrate collum being portion of their exoskeleton that leads way flat backed millipedes in order polydesmida tend to insert their front end like a wedge into a horizontal crevice and then widen crack by pushing upwards with their legs paranota in this instance constituting main lifting surface boring is used by members of order polyzoniida these have smaller segments at front and increasingly large ones further back they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs wedge shaped body widening gap as they go some millipedes have adopted an above ground lifestyle and lost burrowing habit this may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow or because they are too large to make effort worthwhile or in some cases because they move relatively fast for a millipede and are active predators diet most millipedes are detritivores and feed on decomposing vegetation feces or organic matter mixed with soil they often play important roles in breakdown and decomposition of plant litter estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter depending on species and region and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all leaf litter in a region leaf litter is fragmented in millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments algae fungi and bacteria which facilitates decomposition by microorganisms where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests millipedes play an important role in facilitating microbial decomposition of leaf litter some millipedes are herbivorous feeding on living plants and some species can become serious pests of crops millipedes in order polyxenida graze algae from bark and platydesmida feed on fungi a few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous feeding on insects centipedes earthworms or snails some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices predators and parasites thumb 200px alt beetle with millipede prey a sceliages beetle transporting a millipede carcass millipedes are preyed on by a wide range of animals including various reptiles amphibians birds mammals and insects mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured millipedes on ground to deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes including larval glowworm beetles ants slugs and predaceous dung beetles of genera sceliages and a large subfamily of assassin bugs with over 600 species has specialized in preying upon millipedes parasites of millipedes include nematodes flies and acanthocephalans nearly 30 fungal species of order laboulbeniales have been found growing externally on millipedes but some species may be commensal rather than parasitic defence mechanisms thumb 170px left alt defensive coil from guinea west africa curled in a defensive coil due to their lack of speed and their inability to bite or sting millipedes primary defence mechanism is to curl into a tight coil protecting their delicate legs inside an armoured exoskeleton many species also emit various foul smelling liquid secretions through microscopic holes called ozopores openings of odoriferous or glands along sides of their bodies as a secondary defence among many irritant and toxic chemicals found in these secretions are alkaloids phenols and hydrogen cyanide some of these substances are caustic and can burn exoskeleton of ants and other insect predators and skin and eyes of larger predators primates such as capuchin monkeys and lemurs have been observed intentionally irritating millipedes in order to rub chemicals on themselves to repel mosquitoes some of these defensive compounds also show antifungal activity bristly millipedes order polyxenida lack both an armoured exoskeleton and glands and instead are covered in numerous bristles that in at least one species detach and entangle ants other inter species interactions thumb right 180px alt camouflaged with moss psammodesmus bryophorus camouflaged with symbiotic mosses some millipedes form mutualistic relationships with organisms of other species in which both species benefit from interaction or commensal relationships in which only one species benefits while other is unaffected several species form close relationships with ants a relationship known as especially within family polydesmida which contains obligate myrmecophiles species which have only been found in ant colonies more species are facultative myrmecophiles being non exclusively associated with ants including many species of polyxenida that have been found in ant nests around world many millipede species have commensal relationships with mites of orders and astigmata many of these mites are believed to be rather than parasitic which means that they use millipede host as a means of dispersal a novel interaction between millipedes and mosses was described in 2011 in which individuals of newly discovered psammodesmus bryophorus was found to have up to ten species living on its dorsal surface in what may provide camouflage for millipede and increased dispersal for mosses interactions with humans thumb giant fire millipede aphistogoniulus madagascar millipedes generally have little impact on human economic or social well being especially in comparison with insects although locally they can be a nuisance or agricultural pest millipedes do not bite and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans usually causing only minor discolouration on skin but secretions of some tropical species may cause pain itching local erythema edema blisters eczema and occasionally cracked skin eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis this is called millipede burn first aid consists of flushing area thoroughly with water further treatment is aimed at relieving local effects thumb alt spotted snake millipede spotted snake millipedes can be agricultural pests some millipedes are considered household pests including carnifex which can infest thatched roofs in india and which periodically invades homes in australia other species exhibit periodical swarming behaviour which can result in home invasions crop damage and train delays when tracks become slippery

of few millipedes with a common name some of larger millipedes in orders spirobolida spirostreptida and sphaerotheriida are popular as pets some species commonly sold or kept include species of archispirostreptus aphistogoniulus and millipedes appear in folklore and traditional medicine around world some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains in zambia smashed millipede pulp

millipede secretions in poison tipped arrows secretions of have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from bobo people of burkina faso who consume boiled dried millipedes in tomato sauce millipedes have also inspired and played roles in scientific research in 1963 a walking vehicle with 36 legs was designed said to have been inspired by a study of millipede locomotion experimental robots have had same inspiration in particular when heavy loads are needed to be carried in tight areas involving turns and curves in
