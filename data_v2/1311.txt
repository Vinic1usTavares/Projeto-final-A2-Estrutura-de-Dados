of gaza syria lebanon campaign thumb upright 1 3 french mandate for syria and lebanon was governed by vichy forces in mid june battalion was committed to syria lebanon campaign against vichy french in french mandate for syria and lebanon due to involvement of vichy french and free french troops on opposite sides campaign was politically sensitive and as a result of heavy censorship not widely reported in australia at time nature of fighting where it was reported was also downplayed as vichy forces outnumbered allies and were also better equipped allied plan involved four axes of attack with 7th division committed mainly to coastal drive on beirut in lebanon and central thrusts towards damascus in syria blackburn initially divided his time between divisional headquarters in palestine and front while three companies of 2 3rd along with a battery of anti tank guns were only divisional reserve 2 3rd were fully committed on 15 june when commander of i corps australian major general john lavarack committed divisional reserve to secure a bridge across jordan river and thwart a major vichy french counter stroke that threatened to derail campaign this involved a blacked out night time drive of at relatively high speed over rough and treacherous roads to bridge blackburn drove in advance of his force on arrival he was ordered to detach one of his companies north to block road from metulla blackburn then led a company on another drive before returning to check on dispositions of his remaining troops at bridge near which he established his headquarters also from 15th d company was detached from battalion to support coastal advance and remained so throughout campaign during day a british staff officer arrived and directed blackburn to send a company two anti tank guns and two armoured cars loaded with ammunition to quneitra which blackburn understood to have surrendered to vichy french blackburn baulked at this further splitting of his force but when order was confirmed by higher headquarters early on 16 june he sent scratch force of around 200 men north force took up positions on a ridge overlooking town but soon gathered intelligence that 1 500 vichy french were holding town supported by a large number of tanks and armoured cars blackburn very concerned about his vanguard decided to go forward to ridge himself to check on dispositions in meantime company commander in that location tried to coax vichy french tanks to within range of his anti tank guns to no avail prior to blackburn s arrival a british battery of ordnance qf 25 pounder field guns arrived in a further effort to draw out vichy french blackburn personally drove his staff car forward and round in circles in an exposed position but again vichy french did not take bait late in day a battalion of british infantry arrived and under covering fire from machine gunners attacked and captured town 25 pounders knocked out three vichy french armoured cars blackburn s advance force had made a significant contribution to stopping vichy french counter stroke blackburn s area of responsibility was briefly expanded to include all routes east of jordan as far as quneitra to cover this he was allocated squadrons of light tanks and bren carriers as well as a british dressing station to handle casualties on 19 june his force was ordered forward towards damascus this involved a drive to sheikh then a journey north which took nearly two days due to state of roads meanwhile blackburn was recalled back to rosh pinna in palestine to receive orders from commander of damascus front major general john fullerton evetts of british 6th infantry division who directed him to assist weary and disheartened free french forward to damascus to achieve this task his force was trimmed

appeared were engaged with boys anti tank rifles senegalese free french troops then came forward to australian held trench blackburn then ordered rest of his men forward this process of australian machine gunners advancing and free french following was repeated by blackburn until forward troops had advanced a total of and reached outskirts of damascus in latter stages vichy french began to respond with small arms and artillery and their tanks and snipers forced a halt for night in meantime 2 3rd infantry battalion had captured vichy french positions to west of damascus and cut road to beirut in morning of 21 june free french began to advance blackburn s machine gunners supported them and protected their right flank in case of a vichy french counter attack from east about 11 00 a vichy french column emerged from damascus led by a car bearing a white flag after some discussions blackburn accompanied vichy french and free french back into city where blackburn as senior allied commander present accepted surrender meanwhile vichy french thrust towards metulla had not reached a company and on 16 june it was ordered forward into support positions for an attack by 2 2nd pioneer

displaying a disdainful attitude to incoming artillery fire which amazed his men with french stymied in centre and allies unable to press forward from damascus overall commander now lieutenant general lavarack decided to put his main effort into coastal push towards beirut d company of 2 3rd split up among various infantry battalions pushing up coast road fought at damour in early july before vichy french requested an armistice in mid july battalion suffered 43 casualties during campaign nine dead and 34 wounded at end of july blackburn left battalion to join allied control commission for syria in beirut responsible among other functions for repatriation of french prisoners of war pow he seconded several officers from 2 3rd to help him and travelled widely around syria and even managed a brief crossing into turkey he became involved in trying to arbitrate in fractious relationship between captured vichy french and free french who wanted to recruit them but free french were largely unsuccessful in this endeavour with only 5 700 vichy soldiers joining their cause in aftermath of campaign 2 3rd stayed on as part of allied occupation force established in syria and lebanon to defend against a possible drive south by axis forces through caucasus battalion defended a position northeast of beirut around bikfaya initially but was moved around to various locations including aleppo on turkish border throughout remainder of 1941 they endured a bitter cold and snowy winter at fih near tripoli which was punctuated by leave drafts to tel aviv by this time blackburn had returned to

at oosthaven on sumatra in dutch east indies to help defend an airfield near palembang about north of port this was in accordance with a plan that involved 6th and 7th divisions defending java and sumatra respectively due to a lack of small arms some of troops were equipped with weapons from orcades armoury including outdated and unfamiliar springfield ross and martini henry rifles some soldiers did not have a firearm at all and 2 3rd not only lacked its vickers guns it also did not have any bren light machine guns either blackburn was to lead objective of which he labelled a suicide mission especially given japanese had landed paratroops on sumatra on 14 february orcades dropped anchor about offshore despite receiving a report that japanese were already at palembang blackburn was ordered to disembark his force and they were ferried ashore by a small dutch tanker around dusk on 15 february they were only just disembarking when orders were received to return to orcades as japanese were only away from oosthaven they were transported back to ship in dark and they weighed anchor in early hours of following day while they had been on their abortive mission singapore had fallen orcades was escorted across sunda strait and about 14 00 on 16 february it anchored in outer harbour of tanjung priok port of batavia capital of dutch east indies at noon following day orcades entered port which was gripped by considerable confusion australian looters and deserters from singapore pelted orcades with tins and other objects blackburn sent a party of pioneers ashore to round them up he gave them choice of either joining his force or being charged with desertion many joined but their commitment to force was questionable majority of troops aboard orcades remained on ship throughout rest of day and all of next on 19 february blackburn received orders to disembark about 2 000 men and after several false starts they went ashore in early evening thumb left upright 1 3

engineers a platoon of over age headquarters guards 105th general transport company 2 3rd reserve motor transport company 2 2nd casualty clearing station about 165 stragglers and 73 reinforcements about half of troops were support rather than combat troops blackburn organised his soldiers into three infantry battalions based on machine gunners pioneers and engineers respectively created a headquarters and formed a supporting transport and supply unit from 2 3rd reserve motor transport company blackforce was instructed to fight alongside local dutch forces under overall command of dutch luitenant generaal hein ter poorten but was subordinate to local dutch divisional commander generaal majoor w schilling and to general officer commanding british troops in dutch east indies major general hervey sitwell blackforce was essentially deployed to achieve political purpose of strengthening resolve of dutch who according to australian chief of general staff lieutenant general vernon sturdee were entirely immobile inexperienced and probably not highly trained based on lessons learnt from fighting in malaya and singapore that highlighted futility of static defence blackburn adopted mobility counter flanking movements and defence in depth as his maxims for blackforce blackforce was able to re equip itself to a significant extent from tanjung priok wharves where it obtained hundreds of bren machine guns and thompson submachine guns grenades ammunition and vehicles from stocks originally intended to re supply singapore heavy weapons remained in short supply although a few mortars and light armoured vehicles were available blackburn s dutch commanders directed him to disperse his force to protect five airfields from paratroop drops orders which blackburn only grudgingly obeyed as he was concerned about splitting blackforce on 20 february it divided itself between various airfields where its members established defensive positions blackburn set up his headquarters in batavia on 23 february blackburn went to schilling and asked that he be permitted to concentrate his force for training but this was refused following day blackburn was summoned to general sir archibald wavell s american british dutch australian command headquarters in bandung where he met with wavell he was directed to use his force in offensive operations against japanese on 25 february sitwell and schilling permitted blackforce to be concentrated for this purpose and sitwell attached a united states artillery unit a british signals section and a squadron of 16 obsolescent light tanks to blackburn s command by 27 february blackburn had established his headquarters in buitenzorg on road between batavia and bandung blackforce was to be kept as a mobile reserve to strike japanese once they landed with dutch conducting delaying actions on following night japanese landed a division in merak area on northwestern tip of java and a regiment east of batavia at eretanwetan both landings were unopposed and regimental one was guided in by fifth column elements among population another division and additional regiment landed further east along java coast japanese forces that landed on java numbered 25 000 against it was arrayed a dutch force of same strength but with a ratio of one dutch to 40 locally recruited troops and many of local troops viewed japanese as liberators from dutch colonialism rather than an enemy to be resisted japanese advance from merak progressed swiftly covering by noon on 1 march with dutch putting up little resistance japanese force quickly captured then split into two with one column pushing east along north coast towards batavia and other driving southeast to and djasinga and preparing to cross tjianten river at leuwiliang to capture buitenzorg initially blackburn planned a counter attack against southern advance for 2 march with dutch to hold japanese at djasinga but this was cancelled when dutch withdrew to bandung area east of leuwiliang as part of withdrawal dutch blew up bridge over tjianten river at leuwiliang early on 2 march severely restricting blackburn s freedom of manoeuvre against southern force he was then ordered by schilling to move most of his force approximately east to counter attack against regimental sized force that had landed at eretanwetan and was advancing south towards bandung this order was withdrawn after blackburn opposed it on grounds that japanese position was not known attack would be ill prepared and his efforts would be better spent preparing a rearguard defence at leuwiliang sitwell supported blackburn now able to consolidate a position against southern force blackburn disposed two companies of his strongest fighting unit 2 2nd pioneers in depth along road just east of leuwiliang and kept remainder of blackforce in reserve ready to conduct counter encirclement operations about 12 00 on 2 march five japanese light tanks arrived at destroyed bridge and were promptly engaged by pioneers two tanks were quickly disabled and remainder withdrew blackburn realising that japanese would begin to probe his defences and try to outflank them ordered his reserves to fan out to north and south of main blocking position at leuwiliang japanese soon tried to cross river about south of bridge but were met with a hail of fire and withdrew with heavy casualties over next three days japanese tried to outflank and encircle australian positions mainly to south but blackburn deployed his forces to flanks to check them on one occasion he withdrew one of his units slightly drew a significant number of japanese across river into a killing ground and caused them serious casualties blackburn deployed his last reserves on afternoon of 4 march and was finally outflanked to south that afternoon he ordered his men to break contact and withdraw closer to buitenzorg for loss of around 100 casualties blackforce had held up a divisional sized japanese force for three days and killed around 500 japanese and wounded another 500 japanese later stated that they believed that blackforce was of divisional strength despite it being only a weak brigade blackburn conducted a fighting withdrawal through a series of fall back positions to a point just southeast of buitenzorg then disengaged and moved back to about southeast of buitenzorg blackburn was then given orders to deploy blackforce into bandung perimeter as a mobile reserve it soon became clear that dutch were about to capitulate and commonwealth commanders decided to leave dutch and make a stand south of bandung poorten surrendered java on 8 march but blackburn was reluctant to do so and sought medical advice on idea of continuing resistance in hills he was advised against this course of action due to likelihood of many soldiers becoming sick with tropical and other diseases and surrendered his force on 11 march during fighting on java 36 australians were killed and 60 were wounded in his last order to his commanders blackburn wrote captivity until end of march blackforce was held in towns including in market square which had been surrounded by barbed wire it was then split up with troops dispersed to different camps blackburn was initially told that a significant number of his troops would be sent to batavia and that they would have to march at a rate of a day camping beside road without shelter during wet season many of troops already had dysentery and or malaria and some were unaccustomed to marching long distances blackburn wrote a letter signed by other allied commanders protesting this order letter said that men would die if order was carried out and that he would hold japanese responsible for their deaths japanese rescinded order and troops travelled by

barracks designed for 1 000 during his first month at camp blackburn began a diary using an old ledger which he maintained for much of his internment against explicit orders of japanese at one point he removed covers from ledger and hid pages inside lining of his raincoat food rations at bicycle camp were poor and because japanese would not follow geneva convention relative to treatment of prisoners of war it was difficult to maintain discipline as all but blackburn had to work regardless of rank blackburn arranged activities to alleviate boredom and consistently stood up to japanese he was interrogated and was struck by a guard on at least one occasion but was spared any torture more junior officers were subjected to torture beatings and other abuse japanese tried to persuade blackburn and others to participate in propaganda radio broadcasts but blackburn gave orders against it and refused to do so himself in june japanese ordered all prisoners to sign a form stating that they would comply with all orders and would not resist their captors blackburn only signed after appending except where contrary to my oath of allegiance to his majesty king when another form was produced requiring an oath to be sworn blackburn refused privileges were withdrawn dozens of officers and men were beaten and blackburn was placed in solitary confinement in end when americans decided to sign blackburn agreed in interests of unity and ordered all troops to sign by end of july blackburn was conscious that he had lost about in weight due to poor rations blackburn was promoted to substantive colonel on 1 september 1942 but retained his temporary rank of brigadier whilst in captivity in same month he began to suffer from depression and fell ill with dengue fever japanese commandant was replaced with a stricter man and guards were replaced with koreans who quickly earned a reputation for cruelty beatings were conducted for minor infractions such as failing to stand to attention quickly enough in early october 1 500 pows left camp including almost all of 2 2nd pioneers destined for thailand burma railway another group of 84 left a few days later but losses were soon made up by arrival of several thousand dutch and 113 royal air force personnel from a camp in bandung by this stage every couple of days a pow was dying in camp mainly due to dysentery by christmas conditions had improved somewhat and blackburn was able to gather enough funds to purchase food for a christmas dinner on 28 december he was driven out of bicycle camp to continue his internment elsewhere unit historian of 2 2nd pioneers later wrote of blackburn s time at bicycle camp his quiet dignity masking an unquenchable spirit of protest against japanese injustices earned him admiration of officers and men who shared with him humiliation of captivity changi japan and formosa blackburn and some other senior officers were transferred from java to singapore by ship arriving on 1 january 1943 and blackburn was briefly held at changi pow camp his time there was much more relaxed than on java and he enjoyed freedom of movement and ability to catch up with friends including his world war i platoon sergeant there were no beatings and few japanese were seen as guards were mainly sikh defectors from british indian army on 7 january a party of 900 pows arrived from java including a large number of 2 3rd men led by surgeon lieutenant colonel ernest weary dunlop this group soon ended up on thailand burma railway with 2 2nd pioneers blackburn s stay ended on 10 january but not before

japan by sea arriving in moji on 19 january after a short stay in a camp which held american and indian pows party of senior officers left japan by ship on 25 january and four days later disembarked in southwestern formosa now taiwan on arrival at karenko camp party were paraded before commandant and ordered to make an oath that they would not try to escape blackburn said that he would only sign under protest and duress and asked what penalty was for not signing he was beaten and placed in solitary confinement and japanese subjected him to sleep deprivation two days later he signed oath and was released into main camp karenko camp held 400 men including most senior allied officers japanese had captured many of them generals food was scarce everyone was required to work and seven weeks after arriving blackburn s weight was down to lighter than he had been when he had enlisted in 1914 blackburn was beaten several times while held at karenko camp as were other senior officers often for most minor of supposed infractions blackburn s closest friends were sitwell and searle on 2 april all prisoners above rank of colonel were sent to a new camp at about south of karenko searle was left behind and sitwell was allocated to a different barracks from blackburn he found some of his fellow pows difficult to get on with particularly australian brigadiers harold burfield taylor and duncan maxwell with arrival of red cross food parcels in april blackburn put on almost reduced work routine compared to karenko contributed to this boredom and depression dogged blackburn during this period and lack of letters from home exacerbated both also in april blackburn s family finally received confirmation he was alive having heard nothing since his capture in early june he and 89 other pows were returned to karenko but this stay was brief as they were soon transported to another camp in shirakawa in central formosa arriving there on 8 june food was again poor malaria was rife and pows were again required to work by late august blackburn had lost a total of since his capture in march 1942 blackburn s eyesight which had been deteriorating for some time became so bad that he

conditions were in some respects better than in previous camps blackburn stopped keeping a diary soon after arrival as he had run out of ledger paper and was in deep depression due to cold there were few activities and most of prisoners refused to volunteer to work growing vegetables as they did not trust japanese to give them a fair share of produce in may 1945 party was transferred to pow camp on outskirts of mukden blackburn considered this camp best of all those he had been held in during war with showers and hot baths although latrines were always overflowing and food was poor blackburn had received no letters since arriving in manchuria and this contributed to his depression on 15 august pows were told that war was over and a few days later a soviet red army tank drove through camp
