try second set of charges no charges were laid against him for alleged previous war crimes in poland or ukraine canadian court was constituted to deal only with crimes committed against canadian nationals proceedings court first major canadian war crimes trial faced a number of problems before it could be convened chief among them was fact that since accused was a general he had to be tried by soldiers of equal rank finding enough available canadian generals was difficult court as eventually constituted had four brigadiers one ian johnston was a lawyer in civilian life and was presided over by major general h w foster who had commanded 7th canadian infantry brigade in normandy in accordance with eyewitness statements by german and canadian soldiers and french civilians meyer was found guilty of first fourth and fifth charges and acquitted of second and third he was deemed responsible for inciting his troops to give no quarter to enemy and for his troops killing of eighteen

meyer s closing statement before sentencing he did not ask for clemency but defended record of his unit and innocence of his soldiers by canadian army i was treated as a soldier and proceedings were fairly conducted sentence although most observers expected a long imprisonment court had not found him guilty of directly ordering murders but tacitly condoning them court sentenced meyer to death one of judges brigadier bell irving later said that he believed a guilty sentence required death penalty and that no lesser sentence was permissible sentence was subject to confirmation by higher command meyer was originally willing to accept it but was persuaded by his wife and his defence counsel to appeal appeal was reviewed by canadian headquarters and dismissed by major general christopher vokes official convening authority for court who said that he could not see a clear way to mitigate sentence imposed by court shortly before sentence was to be carried out however prosecutor realised that trial regulations contained a section requiring a final review by senior combatant officer in theatre and no one had completed such a review execution was postponed until it could be carried out senior officer was commander of canadian forces in europe christopher vokes who had dismissed meyer s appeal vokes had second thoughts and began a series of meetings with senior officials to discuss how to proceed vokes main concern was degree to which a commander should be held responsible for actions of his men consensus which emerged from discussions was that death was an appropriate sentence only when offence was conclusively shown to have resulted from direct act of commander or by his omission to act vokes said there isn t a general or colonel on allied side that i know of who hasn t said well this time we don t want any prisoners and had ordered shooting of two prisoners in 1943 before his divisional commander intervened vokes commuted sentence to life imprisonment saying that he felt that meyer s level of responsibility for crimes did not warrant death penalty after reprieve a communist run german newspaper reported that soviet union was considering putting meyer on trial for war crimes allegedly committed at kharkov nothing came of this however and meyer was transported to canada to begin his sentence in april 1946 he served five years at dorchester penitentiary in new brunswick where he worked in library and learned english how 1995 p 366 meyer petitioned for clemency in late 1950 including a surprising offer to serve in a canadian or united nations military force if released government was willing to let him return to a german prison but not release him outright he was transferred to a british military prison in werl west germany in 1951 meyer was released from prison on 7september 1954 after german government reduced his sentence to fourteen years and shortened it further for good behaviour when he returned to germany in 1951 he told a reporter that nationalism was past and that a united europe is now only answer hiag activities and death meyer became active in hiag waffen ss lobby group formed in 1951 by former high ranking waffen ss men including paul hausser felix steiner and herbert gille when he was released from prison he was a leading waffen ss apologist meyer announced at a 1957 hiag rally that although he stood behind his old commanders hitler made many mistakes and it was time to look to future rather than past he said to about 8 000 ex ss men at 1957 hiag convention in bavaria ss troops committed no crimes except massacre at oradour and that was action of a single man according to meyer waffen ss was as much a regular army outfit as any other in wehrmacht meyer s memoirs grenadiere 1957 were published as part of this campaign and were a glorification of ss s part in war and his role in it book detailing meyer s exploits at front was an element of waffen ss rehabilitation efforts he condemned inhuman suffering to which waffen ss personnel had been subjected for crimes which they neither committed nor were able to prevent historian charles w sydnor called grenadiere perhaps boldest and most truculent of apologist works book was part of hiag s campaign to promote perception of waffen ss in popular culture as apolitical recklessly brave fighters who were not involved in war crimes of nazi regime a perception which has since been refuted by historians in july 1958 meyer shook hands with spd politician ulrich lohmar at a hiag meeting event was widely discussed with hiag regarding it as good publicity many spd members criticised lohmar saying that meyer remained unapologetic about ss crimes and was an enemy of democracy despite his claims to contrary thumb upright right alt grave of

capacity as pragmatic and loyal to west german state and hiag as an apolitical group even though elements of hiag increasingly aligned with extreme right wing groups such as deutsche reichspartei drp meyer continued to push for a more moderate image in public in a television interview with canadian broadcasting corporation in january 1960 he even claimed that he would order waffen ss veterans to protect jewish synagogues and graveyards if he could do so this statement was met with severe criticism by many openly antisemitic members of hiag resulting in growing tensions in organization meyer responded by dissolving most extreme chapters of hiag and restructuring group to solidify control of its central leadership over basis his tactics met with some success and he met with numerous politicians to advocate for better treatment of former waffen ss members convincing some that he and hiag had distanced themselves from far right extremism he had less success in his 1959 1961 meetings with prominent spd politician and former concentration camp inmate fritz erler latter was supposed to gauge meyer s supposed conversion to democracy as spd was prepared to support a moderate wing of hiag to counteract more extreme elements of group erler repeatedly confronted meyer with extreme right wing rhetoric of many hiag members and outlets prompting spokesman to shift all blame to his rivals in lobby group meyer never fully convinced erler of his position but his meetings with him and other politicians still enabled hiag to become more respected in public and better spread its message regardless of his claims meyer always remained a covert steadfast adherent of nazism meyer experienced poor health later in life with heart and kidney disease and requiring use of a cane after
