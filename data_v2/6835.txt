1890 91 season was sheffield united s second and their first and only season playing in newly formed midland counties league as club sought to establish itself as a major footballing force team was selected by club s football committee and coached by a trainer but day to day affairs were overseen by club secretary joseph wostinholm club saw a large influx of players during season as it continued to bolster its numbers with amateurs loaned or signed from other teams in local area a policy that resulted in an unsettled side indifferent league results and a mid table finish united nicknamed blades entered fa cup once more but were lucky to reach first round proper losing to burton swifts during qualifying only to see staffordshire club disqualified they also competed in wharncliffe charity cup and sheffield challenge cup in which they were beaten finalists for second year in succession development of playing squad continued with signings of john drummond and billy hendry from preston north end who brought experience and a solid professionalism harry lilley was recruited in early part of season and became a regular in united s defence for several seasons background after a first season of mixed fortunes on field football committee recognised appetite amongst sheffield public for game as attendances at bramall lane had steadily increased they recognised that league football was essential to grow that interest and offer a better standard of opposition and had therefore joined recently created midland counties league although still insisting on organising numerous friendly fixtures committee continued to select team although j b wostinholm oversaw day to day running of club kit although united s jersey remained predominantly white thin red vertical stripes were introduced for first time which evolved into solid red and white stripes that team still plays in today team retained blue shorts and socks worn in previous season season overview midland counties

stones assist secretary front unknown unknown arthur watson previous season had been considered reasonably successful but united still looked to improve quality of players in squad players recruited from scotland during previous summer had failed to live up to expectations and majority of them were released only calder and robertson were retained billy bridgewater and edward cross were signed from nearby rotherham town and harry lilley arrived from staveley during close season but blades persisted with their policy of utilising guest amateur players from local area united were now playing in midland counties league but results were indifferent with blades winning only twice in their opening eight fixtures their fortunes began to improve in november and december however as they registered a series of victories including an impressive 4 0 win over kidderminster at bramall lane and a 5 2 victory at derby midland despite relative failure of their previous recruitment in scotland by end of year united had signed gavin crawford and harry munro from north of border as blades entered 1891 in more positive form following a league fixture break during january 1891 united resumed their campaign in february but form they had shown in run up to christmas deserted them and results were inconsistent in midst of congested fixture list blades finished season fifth in league out of ten sides and once again resolved to improve quality of players by recruiting established professionals ahead of next season they duly negotiated transfers of john drummond billy hendry and samuel dobson from preston north end then one of top sides in country and they arrived over a number of weeks through february and march to bolster united s first team options most significant signing during season was that of a young ernest needham from staveley in february 1891 although he did not play for united in 1890 91 season he went on to become one of club s greatest players making more than 500 appearances thumb left alt gavin crawford upright 0 7 gavin crawford arrived from rangers in scotland in november 1890 to bolster attack fa cup having had relative success during their first fa cup campaign previous season united struggled to replicate that form and were fortunate to make it past qualifying rounds in 1890 having narrowly defeated derby junction they lost 2 1 to burton swifts in next game but staffordshire club was subsequently disqualified for fielding an ineligible player matlock and loughborough were then easily despatched as united reached first round proper of cup for second time this was as far as blades would progress however as they met notts county at bramall lane in mid january only to be trounced 9 1 by visitors a result that remains club s worst in competition local cups united once again entered sheffield challenge cup and reached final for second season in succession after a straightforward 7 1 victory over in round one blades made their way past in semi final at second time of asking on 21 march they met near neighbours doncaster rovers in final but despite having home advantage with game being played at bramall lane united lost 2 1 team entered wharncliffe charity cup at semi final stage but were drawn against established cross city rivals wednesday despite increasing rivalry between clubs a relatively small crowd of just over 3 000 spectators were present at wednesday s olive grove ground to watch them beat united 2 1 friendlies despite now playing competitive league football united continued to fill fixture list with numerous friendlies which ultimately led to them playing 64 first team games over course of eight months there was a noticeable improvement in quality of opposition however as a number of more established professional teams visited bramall lane during first half of season drawing reasonable crowds in process although there were early season losses to everton and preston north end united secured victories against bolton wanderers and derby county both at time members of football league first division second half of season saw a continued run of exhibition games but quality of opposition was at times not as high despite lesser opposition results tailed off as fixture congestion these games created began to take its toll on squad most notably at point when united s involvement in sheffield challenge cup meant that they had two first team games scheduled for same day rather than cancelling pre arranged friendlies blades went ahead with both fixtures splitting first team between them highlight of fixture calendar did result from a friendly match however as a then record 14 000 sheffielders were present at bramall lane in january to watch united beat local rivals wednesday for first time running out 3 2 victors january also saw united take on their first ever non english team when they played scottish side although match was limited to only 35 minutes each way owing to poor
