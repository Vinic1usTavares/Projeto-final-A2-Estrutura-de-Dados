hearts timeline gameplay kingdom hearts games contain elements of action role playing video games with hack and slash elements games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to next usually shown in form of a cutscene though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to characters in most games player primarily controls principal protagonist of series sora sora is usually accompanied by donald duck and goofy who are artificial intelligence controlled non playable characters that aid sora in battle in first and third game their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives games feature real time combat that incorporates physical attacks magic and summonings though each game handles battles differently game also allows for items to be used on field of battle to heal oneself or one s party members gummi ships are another common element of series which serve as main mode of transportation between worlds in games gameplay for gummi ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter because it received negative criticism in first game it was modified in third title most games also feature a journal which is accessible from main menu this journal keeps track of information regarding story characters enemies and locations in first three games journal is kept by jiminy cricket who was appointed by queen minnie as royal chronicler minnie oh and to chronicle your travels he will accompany you jiminy over here cricket s name jiminy cricket at your service in 358 2 days birth by sleep and dream drop distance main characters write their own journal entries thumb a battle in first kingdom hearts game games are influenced by their parent franchise final fantasy and carry its gameplay elements over into their own action based hack and slash system like many traditional role playing games kingdom hearts features an experience point system which determines character development as enemies are defeated player gains experience which culminates in a level up where characters grow stronger and gain access to new abilities amount of experience is shared with all party members and each character grows stronger

philharmonic orchestra and tokyo philharmonic orchestra soundtracks were released for first and third installments following release of their respective games a compilation soundtrack was later released that included soundtracks for entire series including reworked tracks for re released kingdom hearts re chain of memories while themes for some of disney based worlds are taken directly from their disney film counterparts most of them are given entirely original musical scores in addition to each world having unique background music each is given its own battle theme rather than having a common theme to cover all fights several of main characters have themes and final boss of each game has several themes played in various phases of those fights fights with sephiroth feature a modified version of nobuo uematsu s one winged angel from final fantasy vii main theme songs for kingdom hearts games were written and performed by japanese pop star hikaru utada three main themes are hikari originally from kingdom hearts passion from kingdom hearts ii and oath from kingdom hearts iii each song has an english counterpart simple and clean sanctuary and don t think twice respectively for north american and european releases utada was only singer tetsuya nomura had in mind for first kingdom hearts theme song this marked first time utada had produced a song for a video game both of first two theme songs reached notable popularity on weekly oricon charts hikari reached no 1 in 2002 and passion reached no 4 in 2005 development history initial idea for kingdom hearts began with a discussion between shinji hashimoto and hironobu sakaguchi about super mario 64 they were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like super mario 64 but lamented that only characters as popular as disney s could rival a mario game tetsuya nomura overhearing their conversation volunteered to lead project and two producers agreed to let him direct a chance meeting between hashimoto and a disney executive in an elevator square and disney had previously worked in same building in japan allowed hashimoto to pitch idea directly to disney development began in february 2000 with nomura as director and hashimoto as producer while nomura had done previous work in final fantasy series as monster designer and graphic director he did not gain widespread recognition until he was lead character designer for final fantasy vii kingdom hearts marked his transition into a directorial position though he also served as game s character designer scenarios were provided by kazushige nojima who was a scenario writer for square from final fantasy vii until he left in 2003 originally development focused on gameplay with a simple story to appeal to disney s target age range after kingdom hearts executive producer hironobu sakaguchi told nomura game would be a failure if it did not aim for same level as final fantasy series he began to develop story further in june 2013 nomura stated name of game came from him thinking about disney theme parks especially animal kingdom however nomura could not get ip with just kingdom so development team began to think about heart as a core part of story so they decided to combine two to form kingdom hearts nomura placed a secret trailer in kingdom hearts in hopes that fans would want a sequel he was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt that if they did not then it would be best to leave certain events in first game unexplained after kingdom hearts final mix was completed development for kingdom hearts ii began there were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel one was development team s desire to showcase mickey mouse more mickey s inclusion in first game was restricted to a very small role nomura had planned for sequel to take place a year after first and originally intended for events of that year to be left unexplained to bridge gap between two games kingdom hearts chain of memories was developed nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on game boy advance because he felt 3d graphics of original game would not translate well into 2d he changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play kingdom hearts on handheld system creation and design though disney gave nomura freedom in characters and worlds used for games he and his staff tried to stay within established roles of characters and boundaries of worlds nomura has stated that though many of disney characters are not normally dark and serious there were not many challenges making them so for story and despite this their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics he also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic when deciding which worlds to include in game development staff tried to take into account worlds with disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in overall look and feel of each world inclusion of specific final fantasy characters was based on opinions of both fans and staff another criterion for inclusion was whether staff felt characters would fit into storyline and in kingdom hearts universe initially nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design because he was unfamiliar with backstory of such characters for kingdom hearts ii he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff throughout development of games nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until release of future games nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination he has stated that with speculation even though a game gets old people can still be happy with it promotion first kingdom hearts was announced at e3 in may 2001 initial details were that it would be a collaboration between square and disney interactive and would feature worlds developed by both companies

osment david gallagher and hayden panettiere as three new characters introduced into game it was also announced that many of disney characters would be voiced by official voice actors from their respective disney films a secret trailer in first kingdom hearts and kingdom hearts final mix hinted at possibility of a sequel rumors for a sequel on playstation 2 were spurred in japan when a japanese video game site stated that an internal and anonymous source at square japan confirmed that development of kingdom hearts ii had begun it was not until kingdom hearts ii was announced along with kingdom hearts chain of memories at tokyo game show in september 2003 that rumors were confirmed initial details were that it would take place some time after kingdom hearts chain of memories
