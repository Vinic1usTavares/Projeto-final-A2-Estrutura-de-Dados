thumb right upright a 1961 letter from u s immigration and naturalization service reporting beys afroyim s loss of citizenship afroyim v rusk 387 u s 253 1967 is a major united states supreme court case in which court ruled that citizens of united states may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily dionisopoulos 1970 71 p 235 in afroyim v rusk court declared that american citizenship is an absolute constitutional right therefore government of united states may not forcibly deprive an american of his nationality u s government had attempted to revoke citizenship of beys afroyim a man born in poland because he had cast a vote in an israeli election after becoming a naturalized u s citizen supreme court decided that afroyim s right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by citizenship clause of fourteenth amendment to constitution in so doing court struck down a federal law mandating loss of u s citizenship for voting in a foreign election thereby overruling one of its own precedents perez v brownell 1958 in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier afroyim decision opened way for a wider acceptance of dual or multiple citizenship in united states law spiro 2005 p 147 plural citizenship may come to be mark of globalization as state based allegiances today diminish in importance relative to other affiliations supreme court s 1967 decision in afroyim v rusk supplies an early glimpse of transition afroyim opened door to maintenance of multiple active national ties it is to afroyim that one can trace genesis of late modern edition of american citizenship a version less jealous of alternative attachments bancroft treaties a series of agreements between united states and other nations which had sought to limit dual citizenship following naturalization were eventually abandoned after carter administration concluded that afroyim and other supreme court decisions had rendered them unenforceable impact of afroyim v rusk was narrowed by a later case rogers v bellei 1971 in which court determined that fourteenth amendment safeguarded citizenship only when a person was born or naturalized in united states and that congress retained authority to regulate citizenship status of a person who was born outside united states to an american parent however specific law at issue in rogers v bellei a requirement for a minimum period of u s residence that bellei had failed to satisfy was repealed by congress in 1978 as a consequence of revised policies adopted in 1990 by united states department of state it is now in words of one expert virtually impossible to lose american citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it background early history of united states

for term of two years may be admitted to become a citizen thereof in 1857 supreme court held in dred scott v scott v sandford that african slaves former slaves and their descendants were not eligible to be citizens after civil war 1861 65 and resulting abolition of slavery in united states steps were taken to grant citizenship to freed slaves congress first enacted civil rights act of 1866 which included a clause declaring all persons born in united states and not subject to any foreign power to be citizens civil rights act of 1866 even as civil rights act was being debated in congress its opponents argued that citizenship provision was unconstitutional in light of this concern as well as to protect new grant of citizenship for former slaves from being repealed by a later congress united states v wong kim ark same congress shortly afterwards evidently thinking it unwise and perhaps unsafe to leave so important a declaration of rights to depend upon an ordinary act of legislation which might be repealed by any subsequent congress framed fourteenth amendment of constitution drafters of fourteenth amendment to constitution included a citizenship clause which would entrench in constitution and thereby set beyond future reach of congress or courts a guarantee of citizenship stating that all persons born or naturalized in united states and subject to jurisdiction thereof are citizens of united states fourteenth amendment including citizenship clause was ratified by state legislatures and became a part of constitution in 1868 loss of united states citizenship constitution does not specifically deal with loss of citizenship an amendment proposed by congress in 1810 titles of nobility amendment would if ratified have provided that any citizen who accepted any present pension office or emolument from a foreign country without consent of congress would cease to be a citizen of united states however this amendment was never ratified by a sufficient number of state legislatures and as a result never became a part of constitution thumb left official record of beys afroyim s u s naturalization in 1926 ever since affirmation by congress in expatriation act

accepted that certain actions could result in loss of citizenship this possibility was noted by supreme court in united states v wong kim ark an 1898 case involving a man born in united states to

states in order to evade military service during wartime or voting in a foreign election spiro 2005 p 150 provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by supreme court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary in a 1958 case nishikawa v dulles nishikawa v dulles and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case trop v dulles trop v dulles however in yet another 1958 case perez v brownell perez v brownell supreme court affirmed provision revoking citizenship of any american who had voted in an election in a foreign country as a legitimate exercise under constitution s necessary and proper clause of congress authority to regulate foreign affairs and avoid potentially embarrassing diplomatic situations spiro 2005 p 151 dionisopoulos 1970 71 p 238 associate justice felix frankfurter author of opinion of court supported by a 5 4 majority wrote that in a dissenting opinion chief justice earl warren argued that citizenship is man s basic right for it is nothing less than right to have rights and that a government of people cannot take away their citizenship simply because one branch of that government can be said to have a conceivably rational basis for wanting to do so perez 356 u s at 64 65 while warren was willing to allow for loss of citizenship as a result of foreign naturalization or other actions by which an american manifests allegiance to a foreign state which may be so inconsistent with retention of u s citizenship as to result in loss of that status perez 356 u s at 68 he wrote that in specifying that any act of voting in a foreign political election results in loss of citizenship congress has employed a classification so broad that it encompasses conduct that fails to show a voluntary abandonment of american citizenship perez 356 u s at 76 spiro 2005 pp 151 152 two supreme court decisions after perez

breakdown of his marriage afroyim decided to return to united states spiro 2005 p 154 but state department refused to renew his u s passport ruling that because afroyim had voted in 1951 israeli legislative election he had lost his citizenship under provisions of nationality act of 1940 afroyim 387 u s at 254 in 1960 when afroyim applied for renewal of his united states passport department of state refused to grant it on sole ground that he had lost his american citizenship by virtue of ss 401 e of nationality act of 1940 which provides that a united states citizen shall lose his citizenship if he votes in a political election in a foreign state a letter certifying afroyim s loss of citizenship was issued by immigration and naturalization service ins on january 13 1961 afroyim challenged revocation of his citizenship initially he claimed that he had not in fact voted in israel s 1951 election but had entered polling place solely in order to draw sketches of voters casting their ballots afroyim s initial challenge was rejected in administrative proceedings in 1965 he then sued in federal district court with his lawyer agreeing to a stipulation that afroyim had in fact voted in israel but arguing that statute under which this action had resulted in his losing his citizenship was unconstitutional afroyim v rusk 250 f supp 686 687 s d n y 1966 throughout

however it is stipulated that on july 30 1951 plaintiff voted in elections for second knesset parliament of state of israel and it is agreed that he did so voluntarily a federal judge of united states district court for southern district of new york rejected afroyim s claim on february 25 1966 concluding that in opinion of congress voting in a foreign political election could import allegiance to another country in some measure inconsistent with american citizenship and that question of this law s validity had been settled by supreme court s 1958 perez decision afroyim 387 u s at 253 afroyim 250 f supp at 690 in my view authority of perez v brownell still stands and is controlling here this conclusion is in full accord with decisions of second circuit in which vitality of perez was at least challenged afroyim appealed district court s ruling against him to second circuit court of appeals which upheld lower court s reasoning and decision on may 24 1966 two of three judges who heard afroyim s appeal found district court s analysis and affirmation of perez to be exhaustive and most penetrating we affirm judgment of district court on authority of perez v brownell exposition by district court of present posture of issues that were decided by supreme court in perez was exhaustive and most penetrating third judge expressed serious reservations regarding viability of perez and suggested that afroyim might have obtained a different result if he had framed his case differently but decided to concur albeit reluctantly in majority s ruling afroyim 361 f 2d at 105 106 i see no reason why an individual who performed act of voting in a foreign election after full disclosure of his american ties should be visited with such severe consequences as loss of citizenship and deportation which will inevitably follow without a showing that his voting somehow impeded or interfered with conduct of this country s foreign affairs however i concur reluctantly as i have already indicated in result reached in majority opinion arguments before supreme court after losing his appeal to second circuit spiro 2005 p 155 afroyim asked supreme court to overrule precedent it had established in perez strike down foreign voting provision of nationality act as unconstitutional and decide that he was still a united states citizen afroyim s counsel argued that since neither fourteenth amendment nor any other provision of constitution expressly grants congress power to take away u s citizenship once it has been acquired only way afroyim could lose his citizenship was by his own voluntary renunciation of it supreme court agreed to consider afroyim s case on october 24 v rusk 385 u s 917 1966 certiorari granted and held oral arguments on february 20 1967 thumb left

through courts before heading aclu ennis had served as general counsel for ins in his oral argument supporting afroyim ennis asserted that congress lacked power to prescribe forfeiture of citizenship and he sharply criticized foreign relations argument under which perez court had upheld loss of citizenship for voting in a foreign election pointing out for example that when a referendum was held in 1935 on status of saar a region of germany occupied after world war i by united kingdom and france americans had participated in voting without raising any concerns within state department at time gordon did not make a good showing in afroyim oral arguments despite his skill and experience in field of immigration law according to a 2005 article on afroyim case by law professor peter j spiro gordon mentioned israeli elections in 1955 and 1959 in which afroyim had voted facts which had not previously been presented to supreme court in attorneys briefs or written record of case and much of remaining questioning from justices involved criticism of gordon for confusing matters through last minute introduction of this new material afroyim s earlier stipulation that he had voted in 1951 israeli election together with an accompanying concession by government that this was sole ground upon which it had acted to revoke afroyim s citizenship allowed potential issue of diluted allegiance through dual citizenship to be sidestepped indeed in 1951 there was no israeli nationality law eligibility to vote in election that year had been based on residence rather than any concept of citizenship although afroyim had later acquired israeli citizenship and voted in at least two other elections in his new country his lawyers were able to avoid discussing this matter and instead focus entirely on whether foreign voting was a sufficient cause for loss of one s u s citizenship opinion of court supreme court ruled in afroyim s favor in a 5 4 decision issued on may 29 1967 opinion of court written by associate justice hugo black and joined by chief justice warren and associate justices william o douglas and abe fortas as well as associate justice brennan who had been part of majority in perez was grounded in reasoning warren had used nine years earlier in his perez dissent dionisopoulos 1970 71 p 249 by narrow margin of five to four court in afroyim had repudiated precedent of perez denied to congress any power to expatriate an american and subscribed to a principle espoused by warren in his dissenting opinion almost a decade earlier matteo 1997 p 41 nine years after perez chief justice warren s dissent in that case became basis of majority opinion in judicial milestone afroyim v rusk court s majority now held that congress has no power under constitution to divest a person of his united states citizenship absent his voluntary renunciation thereof specifically repudiating perez majority of justices rejected claim that congress had any power to revoke 1997 p 41 justice black rejected perez holding that sovereignty carried with it implied power of involuntary expatriation and said that no such power can be sustained as an implied attribute of sovereignty instead quoting from citizenship clause black wrote all persons born or naturalized in united states are citizens of united states there is no indication in these words of a fleeting citizenship good at moment it is acquired but subject to destruction by government at any time rather amendment can most reasonably be read as defining a citizenship which a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it once acquired this fourteenth amendment citizenship was not to be shifted canceled or diluted at will of federal government states or any other governmental unit afroyim 387 u s at 262 court found support for its position in history of unratified titles of nobility amendment fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment rather than an ordinary act of congress was seen by majority as showing that even before passage of fourteenth amendment congress did not believe that it had power to revoke anyone s citizenship afroyim 387 u s at 259 court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship but opponents had argued that congress had no authority to provide for expatriation afroyim s counsel had addressed only foreign voting question and had carefully avoided any direct challenge to idea that foreign naturalization might legitimately lead to loss of citizenship a concept which warren had been willing to accept in his perez dissent nevertheless court s afroyim ruling went beyond even warren s earlier position holding instead that very nature of our government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship spiro 2005 pp 158 159 afroyim 387 u s at 268 dissent thumb right upright john marshall harlan ii wrote dissent in afroyim case minority in a dissent written by associate justice john marshall harlan ii and joined by associate justices tom c clark potter stewart and byron white argued that perez had been correctly decided afroyim 387 u s at 270 t he available historical evidence is not only inadequate to support court s abandonment of perez but even seems to confirm perez soundness that nothing in constitution deprived congress of power to revoke a person s citizenship for good cause afroyim 387 u s at 292 to contrary citizenship clause was expected and should now be understood to leave congress at liberty to expatriate a citizen if expatriation is an appropriate exercise of a power otherwise given to congress by constitution and if methods and terms of expatriation adopted by congress are consistent with constitution s other relevant commands and that congress was within its rights to decide that allowing americans to vote in foreign elections ran contrary to foreign policy interests of nation and ought to result in loss of citizenship afroyim 387 u s at 270 there is no need here to rehearse mr justice frankfurter s opinion for court in perez it then proved and still proves to our satisfaction that ss 401 e is within power of congress harlan wrote responding to assertion that congress did not have power to revoke a person s citizenship without his or her assent harlan predicted that until court indicates with greater precision what it means by assent today s opinion will surely cause still greater confusion in this area of law spiro 2005 p 159 afroyim 387 u s at 269 n 1 subsequent developments afroyim decision stated that no one with united states citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship nevertheless court distinguished a 1971 case rogers v bellei rogers v bellei holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis through birth outside united states to an american parent or parents could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways since their citizenship unlike afroyim s citizenship was result of federal statutes rather than citizenship clause matteo 1997 p 44 court took a step back in 1971 when in rogers v bellei it undercut afroyim by holding that congress had power to children born abroad of an american parent such children court concluded were not fourteenth amendment citizens statutory provision whereby bellei lost his citizenship a u s residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth was repealed by congress in 1978 foreign voting provision already without effect since afroyim was repealed at same time a bill to repeal certain sections of title iii of immigration and nationality act and for other purposes public law 95 432 92 stat 1046 october 10 1978 although afroyim appeared to rule out any involuntary revocation of a person s citizenship government continued for most part to pursue loss of citizenship cases when an american had acted in a way believed to imply an intent to give up citizenship especially when an american had become a naturalized citizen of another country spiro 2005 pp 159 160 in a 1980 case however vance v v terrazas supreme court ruled that intent to relinquish citizenship needed to be proved by itself and not simply inferred from an individual s having voluntarily performed an action designated by congress as being incompatible with an intent to keep one s citizenship spiro 2005 pp 161 162 immigration and

impossible to lose american citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it spiro 2005 p 163 while acknowledging that american citizenship enjoys strong protection against loss under afroyim and terrazas retired journalist henry s matteo suggested it would have been more equitable had supreme court relied on eighth amendment which adds a moral tone as well as a firmer constitutional basis than fourteenth matteo also said under afroyim there is a lack of balance between rights and protections on one hand and obligations and responsibilities on other all four elements of which have been an integral part of concept of citizenship as history shows matteo 1997 p 111 political scientist p allan dionisopoulos wrote that it is doubtful that any supreme court decision created a more complex problem for united states than afroyim v rusk a decision which he believed had since become a source of embarrassment for united states in its relationships with arab world because of way it
