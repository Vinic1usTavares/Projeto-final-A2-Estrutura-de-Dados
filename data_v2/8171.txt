malcolm scott carpenter may 1 1925 october 10 2013 was an american naval officer and aviator test pilot aeronautical engineer astronaut and aquanaut he was one of mercury seven astronauts selected for nasa s project mercury in april 1959 carpenter was second american after john glenn to orbit earth and fourth american in space after alan shepard gus grissom and glenn commissioned into u s navy in 1949 carpenter became a naval aviator flying a lockheed p 2 neptune with patrol squadron 6 vp 6 on reconnaissance and anti submarine warfare missions along coasts of russia and china during korean war and cold war in 1954 he attended u s naval test pilot school at nas patuxent river maryland in 1954 and became a test pilot in 1958 he was named air intelligence officer of which was then in dry dock at bremerton navy yard following year carpenter was selected as one of mercury seven astronauts he was backup to glenn during latter s mercury atlas 6 orbital mission carpenter flew next mission mercury atlas 7 in spacecraft he named aurora 7 due to a series of malfunctions spacecraft landed downrange from its intended splashdown point but both pilot and spacecraft were retrieved carpenter obtained permission from nasa to take a leave of absence to join u s navy sealab project as an aquanaut during training he suffered injuries which grounded him making him unavailable for further spaceflights in 1965 he spent 28 days living on ocean floor off coast of california as part of sealab ii he returned to nasa as executive assistant to director of manned spacecraft center then joined navy s deep submergence systems project in 1967 as director of aquanaut operations for sealab iii he retired from nasa in 1967 and from navy in 1969 early life malcolm scott carpenter was born on may 1 1925 in boulder colorado son of marion scott carpenter a research chemist and florence kelso noxon known in her family as toye carpenter known in his childhood as bud or buddy moved with his parents to new york city where his father had been awarded a postdoctoral research post at columbia university in 1925 in summer of 1927 carpenter s mother who was ill with tuberculosis returned to boulder with him mountain air was then believed to aid recovery her condition deteriorated and she entered mesa vista sanatorium in 1930 she recovered sufficiently to become chief medical librarian at boulder community hospital in 1945 his father remained in new york and he seldom saw him he found it hard to find work during great depression but eventually secured a good position at givaudan his parents divorced in 1945 and his father remarried carpenter lived with his maternal grandparents in family home at corner of aurora avenue and seventh street he later denied naming his spacecraft aurora 7 after aurora avenue he was educated at university hill elementary school in boulder and boulder high school where he played clarinet was a cheerleader and served on editorial board of student newspaper he was a boy scout and earned rank of second class scout naval service like many people in boulder carpenter was deeply affected by japanese attack on pearl harbor which brought united states into world war ii and he resolved to become a naval aviator on february 12 1943 he enlisted at u s navy s recruiting officer at lowry field near denver he then travelled to headquarters of 12th naval district in san francisco where he was accepted into navy s v 5 aviation cadet training program navy had recruited plenty of potential aviators at this time so to retain young men like carpenter v 12 navy college training program was created whereby cadets attended college until their service was required when carpenter graduated from high school he became a v 12a aviation cadet at colorado college in colorado springs three semesters there were followed by six months of preflight training at saint mary s college of california in moraga california and primary flight training at ottumwa iowa in a stearman n2s for four months world war ii ended before he finished training so navy released him from active duty in september 1945 after visiting his father and stepmother in new york carpenter returned to boulder in november 1945 to study aeronautical engineering at university of colorado at boulder he was given credit for his previous study and entered as a junior while there he joined delta tau delta international fraternity he was severely injured in a car accident on september 14 1946 after he fell asleep at wheel of his 1934 ford car went over a cliff and overturned at end of his senior year he missed his final examination in heat transfer a washed out bridge prevented him from getting to class this left him one requirement short of a degree on may 29 1962 after his mercury flight university granted him his bachelor of science degree because his subsequent training as an astronaut more than made up for deficiency in subject of heat transfer carpenter met rene louise price a fellow student at university of colorado where she studied history and music she was a member of delta delta delta sorority her parents had also separated when she was young and her mother too suffered from tuberculosis they were married at st john s episcopal church in boulder in september 1948 on october 31 1949 carpenter was recruited by navy s direct procurement program dpp as its 500th candidate he reported to naval air station pensacola florida for pre flight training from which he graduated on march 6 1950 he then commenced primary flight training at naval air station whiting field learning to fly in an snj trainer he then went to naval air station corpus christi for advanced training most newly trained naval aviators including carpenter aspired to fly jet fighters but in view of his responsibilities as a husband and father he elected less dangerous option of flying multi engine patrol aircraft and his advanced training was in consolidated pb4y 2 privateer a single tail version of consolidated b 24 liberator rene pinned his aviator wings on him on april 19 1951 after three months at fleet airborne electronics training school in san diego california carpenter went to a lockheed p 2 neptune transitional training unit at whidbey island washington after which he was assigned to patrol squadron 6 vp 6 based at naval air station barbers point hawaii in november 1951 on his first deployment carpenter flew on reconnaissance and anti submarine warfare missions from naval air station atsugi in japan during korean war on his second deployment forward based at naval air facility adak alaska he flew surveillance missions along russian and chinese coasts for his third and final deployment he was based on guam flying missions off coast of china he was designated as patrol plane commander only one in vp 6 with rank of lieutenant junior grade all rest held higher rank impressed with his performance skipper of vp 6 commander guy howard recommended carpenter s appointment to u s naval test pilot school carpenter was part of class 13 at nas patuxent river maryland in 1954 he flew aircraft such as ad skyraider and martin p4m mercator for first time he flew jets including f9f panther tiger and a3d skywarrior he remained at patuxent river until 1957 working as a test pilot in electronics test division carpenter attended navy line school in monterey california in 1957 and then naval air intelligence school at nas anacostia in washington d c in 1958 he was named air intelligence officer of which was in dry dock at bremerton navy yard nasa career mercury seven thumb right mercury seven astronauts front row left to right wally schirra deke slayton john glenn and carpenter back row alan shepard gus grissom and gordon cooper on october 4 1957 soviet union launched sputnik 1 first artificial satellite this shattered americans confidence in their technological superiority creating a wave of anxiety known as sputnik crisis among his responses president dwight d eisenhower launched space race national aeronautics and space administration nasa was established on october 1 1958 as a civilian agency to develop space technology one of its first initiatives was project mercury which aimed to launch a man into earth orbit evaluate his capabilities in space and return him safely to earth first astronauts intake was drawn from ranks of military test pilots service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from united states department of defense from these 110 were found that matched minimum standards candidates had to be younger than 40 possess a bachelor s degree or equivalent and to be or less while these were not all strictly enforced height requirement was firm owing to size of project mercury spacecraft dpp was restricted to those with bachelor s degrees so it was assumed that carpenter had one number of candidates was then reduced to 32 which seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly project mercury missions it was therefore decided to halve number of astronauts thumb left carpenter and his family visit white house left to right rene president john f kennedy kristen carpenter scott candace and jay then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at lovelace clinic and wright aerospace medical laboratory carpenter was considered most physically fit by his peers he had lowest body fat scored highest on treadmill and cycling tests and was able to hold his breath longest this was despite fact that he had smoked a pack of cigarettes a day since joining navy in 1943 and did not quit smoking until 1985 nasa s charles j donlan called carpenter s home on april 3 1959 to inform him that he had been one of seven men selected rene answered carpenter was on hornet but she could reach him carpenter called donlan from a wharfside pay phone to accept offer hornet skipper captain marshall w white refused to release carpenter until chief of naval operations admiral arleigh burke was able to persuade him identities of seven were announced at a press conference at dolley madison house in washington d c on april 9 1959 carpenter gordon cooper john glenn gus grissom wally schirra alan shepard and deke slayton magnitude of challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later on night of may 18 1959 when seven astronauts gathered at cape canaveral to watch their first rocket launch of an sm atlas which was similar to one that was to carry them into orbit a few minutes after liftoff it spectacularly exploded lighting up night sky astronauts were stunned shepard turned to glenn and said well i m glad they got that out of way mercury atlas 7 thumb right upright carpenter is assisted into his pressure suit in crew quarters of hangar s at cape canaveral air force station on morning of flight of mercury atlas 7 carpenter along with other six mercury astronauts oversaw development of mercury spacecraft each had a specialty carpenter s was onboard navigational equipment he served as backup pilot on mercury atlas 6 for glenn who flew first u s orbital mission aboard friendship 7 in february 1962 carpenter serving as capsule communicator on this flight can be heard saying godspeed john glenn on recording of glenn s liftoff next mission was a second manned orbital flight to be flown by slayton in a capsule he would have named delta 7 but he was suddenly grounded for an atrial fibrillation carpenter was assigned to replace him instead of slayton s backup schirra as carpenter had more training time in simulators in contrast to glenn s flight mercury atlas 7 was planned as a scientific mission rather than an engineering one after most trouble free countdown of project mercury to date carpenter flew into space on may 24 1962 watched by 40 million television viewers he performed five onboard experiments per flight plan and became first american astronaut to eat solid food in space he also identified mysterious fireflies observed by glenn during friendship 7 as particles of frozen liquid loosened from outside of spacecraft which he could produce by rapping on wall near window he renamed them carpenter s performance in space was subject of criticism and controversy nasa s 1989 official history of project mercury says that until third pass over hawaii christopher c kraft jr who directed flight from cape canaveral considered this mission most successful to date everything had gone perfectly except for some overexpenditure of hydrogen peroxide fuel however then problems occurred and kraft wrote in his 2001 memoir he was completely ignoring our request to check his instruments i swore an oath that scott carpenter would never again fly in space thumb left upright carpenter is helped into his aurora 7 spacecraft on may 24 1962 unnoticed by ground control or pilot however overexpenditure of fuel was caused by an intermittently malfunctioning pitch horizon scanner phs that later malfunctioned at reentry still nasa later reported that carpenter had at retrofire event phs malfunctioned once more forcing carpenter to manually control his reentry this caused him to overshoot planned splashdown point by malfunction of pitch horizon scanner circuit a component of automatic control system dictated that pilot manually control spacecraft attitudes during this event thumb left upright launch of mercury atlas 7 phs malfunction yawed spacecraft 25 degrees to right accounting for of overshoot delay caused by automatic sequencer required carpenter to fire retrorockets manually this effort took two pushes of override button and accounted for another 15 to of overshoot thrusters had a set sequence of ignition and that sequence was delayed by carpenter manually firing them this added another producing a overshoot flight lasted 4 hours and 56 minutes during which aurora 7 had attained a maximum altitude of and an orbital velocity of during reentry there was a great deal of public concern over whether carpenter had survived broadcasting from a cbs news van in florida walter cronkite painted a grim picture yet aurora 7s search and rescue and homing sarah beacon broadcast its precise location and recovery vessels aircraft carrier and destroyer were on their way but nasa did not pass this information along to news media knowing that recovery vessels might take some time to get to him and aware of danger of aurora 7 foundering as had happened to grissom s liberty bell 7 carpenter made his way out through neck of spacecraft something less agile glenn had been unable to do he inflated his liferaft climbed into it and awaited rescue sea around him was stained with green dye about 36 minutes after splashdown carpenter spotted two aircraft a p2v neptune from patrol squadron 18 flying out of naval station roosevelt roads was first to sight and mark carpenter s position it was followed by a piper apache which circled and photographed carpenter then knew he had been located they were followed by sc 54 skymaster aircraft from one of which parachuted two frogmen while another dropped a flotation collar which frogmen attached to aurora 7 an air force sa 16 albatross arrived to collect them but nasa mission control forbade it for fear that seaplane might break up although crew did not consider swell dangerous after three hours carpenter was picked up by a hss 2 sea king helicopter which took him to intrepid while aurora 7 was recovered by john r pierce thumb right upright carpenter is plucked from water postflight analysis described phs malfunction as mission critical but noted that pilot adequately compensated for this anomaly in subsequent inflight procedures confirming that backup systems human pilots could succeed when automatic systems fail some memoirs such as that of gene cernan have revived simmering controversy over who or what exactly was to blame for overshoot suggesting for example that carpenter was distracted by science and engineering experiments dictated by flight plan and by well reported fireflies phenomenon yet fuel consumption and other aspects of vehicle operation were during project mercury as much if not more responsibility of ground controllers moreover hardware malfunctions went unidentified while organizational tensions between astronaut office and flight controller office tensions that nasa did not resolve until later gemini and apollo programs may account for much of latter day criticism of carpenter s performance during his flight one might argue wrote tom wolfe that carpenter had mishandled reentry but to accuse him of panic made no sense in light of data concerning his heart rate and his respiratory rate schirra would later experience problems with override button on his flight ocean research carpenter met jacques cousteau who was giving a public lecture at massachusetts institute of technology in 1963 when carpenter expressed interest in underwater research cousteau suggested that he might consider u s navy s sealab project carpenter sought out captain george f bond from sealab and obtained permission from nasa to take a leave of absence to join project in july 1964 he went as part of sealab team to bermuda where they held training exercises at plantagenet bank in of water while in bermuda carpenter sustained a grounding injury from a motorcycle accident when he crashed into a coral wall thumb carpenter in sealab ii in 1965 for sealab ii carpenter spent 28 days living on ocean floor off coast of california he suffered another injury when his right index finger was wounded by toxic spines of a scorpion fish sealab ii coincided with cooper s gemini 5 mission and he and carpenter held first conversation between a craft in outer space and one on ocean floor carpenter returned to nasa as executive assistant to director of manned spacecraft center then joined navy s deep submergence systems project based in bethesda maryland as a director of aquanaut operations for sealab iii in 1967 in aftermath of aquanaut berry l cannon s death while attempting to repair a leak in sealab iii carpenter volunteered to dive down to sealab and help return it to surface although sealab was ultimately salvaged in a less hazardous way after failing to regain mobility in his arm after two surgical interventions in 1964 and 1967 carpenter suffering from avascular necrosis was ruled ineligible for spaceflight and further deep sea missions he spent last part of his nasa career developing underwater training to help astronauts with future spacewalks he resigned from nasa in august 1967 and retired from navy with rank of commander in 1969 after which he founded sea sciences inc a corporation for developing programs for utilizing ocean resources and improving environmental health personal life thumb left upright carpenter in 2011 carpenter was married four times divorced three times and had a total of eight children by three wives seven of whom survived to adulthood he married his first wife rene in september 1948 they had five children marc scott kristen elaine candace noxon robyn jay and timothy kit who died in infancy by 1968 carpenter and his wife
