street was named for a sibling of whitehead his brother john became interested in island after a shipwreck left him stranded in 1819 street and some of its surrounding area have been subject to long term improvement and beautification efforts beginning chiefly in 1996 route description at its point caroline street begins on whitehead street at presidential gates to truman annex site of a former

commercialized zone bull and whistle bar and fogarty s restaurant and flying monkeys bar are situated at this intersection however upon leaving duval caroline street returns almost immediately to a chiefly residential road homes along this stretch of caroline are noted for their architectural significance representing a late 19th century conch style that incorporates elements of several more prominent styles including victorian and colonial although many of these houses were constructed quickly and cheaply their builders employed same techniques that were used at time to craft boats lending them resistance to extreme weather described as stately their lots are heavily landscaped leaving several secluded only interruption of this residential stretch is a minor junction with one way ann street which terminates at caroline with little fanfare further northeast caroline intersects street to a less commercial degree than duval another block of shaded residences follows before an intersection with elizabeth street about midway between caroline s termini elizabeth serves as a sort of transition point for caroline which becomes lined with small shops as it meets peacon lane peacon is a one way street that approaches from south as caroline continues toward northeast it crosses william street and offers an obscured view of gulf of mexico side of island and vessels at port here road s homely marine practicality becomes evident according to a florida travel writer between william and margaret street caroline passes numerous restaurants and parking for key west bight which remains visible and can also be accessed by bearing left on margaret at junction of two roads are several stores and starting point of conch tour train key west bight is recognizable by large mural on entrance of key west waterfront brewery final several hundred feet of caroline street are uneventful limited to backdrop of a few houses and businesses paralleling bight caroline comes to an end at grinnell street having traveled almost exactly history and culture left thumb original office of pan american world airways at caroline and whitehead caroline street is situated along northwestern side of island in a historic district known as old town key west part of district roughly defined as area between caroline street and angela streets which run parallel about four blocks

key west after a shipwreck and took note of island s strategic geography whitehead s brother william surveyed city of key west in 1829 original map from william whitehead s survey shows northwestern corner of island bounded by present day angela street designated as town plot this plot was only part of island which had a grid like pattern of streets five running southwest to northeast including path of caroline street at least a dozen oriented from southeast to northwest and front street which borders extreme northwestern coast of island therefore caroline was cleared by 1829 at latest making it among oldest streets in either city or island of key west when it received its name however is unclear currently caroline never reaches water at either ends 1829 map however shows it accessing gulf of mexico at both termini whereas road now starts at whitehead it once continued past both whitehead and front to shore this is confirmed by a map of island from early 1900s which depicts caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end eventually street was excluded from lot of truman annex and disconnected from water at its northeastern terminus by construction of
