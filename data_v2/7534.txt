on may 18 1980 a major volcanic eruption occurred at mount st helens a volcano located in skamania county in u s state of washington eruption a vei 5 event was most significant volcanic eruption to occur in contiguous 48 u s states since much smaller 1915 eruption of lassen peak in california it has often been declared most disastrous volcanic eruption in u s history eruption was preceded by a two month series of earthquakes and steam venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on mountain s north slope an earthquake at 8 32 17 a m pdt utc 7 on sunday may 18 1980 caused entire weakened north face to slide away creating largest landslide ever recorded this allowed partly molten high pressure gas and steam rich rock in volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward spirit lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock overtaking face an eruption column rose into atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 u s states and significant ash in two canadian provinces at same time snow ice and several entire glaciers on volcano melted forming a series of large lahars volcanic mudslides that reached as far as columbia river nearly to southwest less severe outbursts continued into next day only to be followed by other large but not as destructive eruptions later that year thermal energy released during eruption was equal to 26 megatons approximately 57 people were killed directly including innkeeper harry r truman photographers reid blackburn and robert landsburg and geologist david a johnston hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland causing over 1 billion in damage equivalent to billion today thousands of animals were killed and mount st helens was left with a crater on its north side at time of eruption summit of volcano was owned by burlington northern railroad but afterward land passed to united states forest service area was later preserved as it was in mount st helens

of eruption but small earthquake induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations at 12 36 p m on march 27 phreatic eruptions explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater ejected and smashed rock from within old summit crater excavating a new crater and sending an ash column about into air by this date a eastward trending fracture system had also developed across summit area harris fire mountains of west 1988 p 204 this was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash above their vent most of this ash fell

usgs team determined in last week of april that a section of st helens north face was displaced outward by at least for rest of april and early may this bulge grew by per day and by mid may it extended more than north as bulge moved northward summit area behind it progressively sank forming a complex down dropped block called a graben geologists announced on april 30 that sliding of bulge area was greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption these changes in volcano s shape were related to overall deformation that increased volume of volcano by by mid may this volume increase presumably corresponded to volume of magma that pushed into volcano and deformed its surface because intruding magma remained below ground and was not directly visible it was called a cryptodome in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at surface on may 7 eruptions similar to those in march and april resumed and over next days bulge approached its maximum size all activity had been confined to 350 year old summit dome and did not involve any new magma a total of about 10 000 earthquakes were recorded before may 18 event with most concentrated in a small zone less than directly below bulge visible eruptions ceased on may 16 reducing public interest and consequently number of spectators in area mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter danger zone on saturday may 17 to gather whatever property they could carry another trip was scheduled for 10 a m next day and because that was sunday more than 300 loggers who would normally be working in area were not there by time of climactic eruption dacite magma intruding into volcano had forced north flank outward nearly and heated volcano s groundwater system

approximately 7 20 seconds after shock landslide largest in recorded history travelled at and moved across spirit lake s west arm part of it hit a ridge about north some of slide spilled over ridge but most of it moved down north fork toutle river filling its valley up to deep with avalanche debris an area of about was covered and total volume of deposit was about scientists were able to reconstruct motion of landslide from a series of rapid photographs by gary rosenquist who was camping away from blast rosenquist his party and his photographs survived because blast was deflected by local topography short of his location most of st helens former north side became a rubble deposit long averaging thick slide was thickest at below spirit lake and thinnest at its western margin landslide temporarily displaced waters of spirit lake to ridge north of lake in a giant wave approximately high this in turn created a avalanche of debris consisting of returning waters and thousands of uprooted trees and stumps some of these remained intact with roots but most had been sheared off at stump seconds earlier by blast of super heated volcanic gas and ash that had immediately followed and overtook initial landslide debris was transported along with water as it returned to its basin raising surface level of spirit lake by about more than three decades after eruption floating log mats persist on spirit lake and nearby st helens lake changing position with wind rest of trees especially those that were not completely detached from their roots were turned upright by their own weight and became waterlogged sinking into muddy sediments at bottom where they have become petrified in anaerobic and mineral rich waters this provides insight into other sites with a similar fossil

example did not hear blast this so called quiet zone extended radially a few tens of miles from volcano and was created by complex response of eruption s sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of atmospheric layers and to a lesser extent local topography later studies indicated that one third of of material in flow was new lava and rest was fragmented older rock lateral blast

far as from volcano area affected by blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones direct blast zone innermost zone averaged about in radius an area in which virtually everything natural or artificial was obliterated or carried away for this reason this zone also has been called tree removal zone flow of material carried by blast was not deflected by topographic features in this zone blast released energy equal to 24 megatons of tnt channelized blast zone an intermediate zone extended out to distances as far as from volcano an area in which flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography in this zone force and direction of blast are strikingly demonstrated by parallel alignment of toppled large trees broken off at base of trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a scythe this zone was also known as tree down zone channeling and deflection of blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades where blast struck open land directly it scoured it breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil thereby delaying revegetation for many years where blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres it left topsoil and seeds it contained permitting faster revegetation with scrub and herbaceous plants and later with saplings trees in path of such higher level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long term harm seared zone also called standing dead zone outermost fringe of impacted area a zone in which trees remained standing but were singed brown by hot gases of blast thumb left volcanologist david a johnston photographed on april

mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks resulting deposits formed a fan like pattern of overlapping sheets tongues and lobes at least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during may 18 eruption and their aggregate volume was about flow deposits were still at about two weeks after they erupted secondary steam blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on northern margin of pyroclastic flow deposits at south shore of spirit lake and along upper part of north fork toutle river these steam blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after emplacement of pyroclastic flows and at least one occurred a year later on may 16 1981 ash column thumb ash cloud produced by eruption as seen from village of toledo washington 35 miles 56 km away northwest from mount st helens cloud was roughly wide and high thumb left alt satellite photo ash cloud from mt st helens as captured by goes 3 weather satellite at 15 45 utc as avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing a huge ash column grew to a height of above expanding crater in less than 10 minutes and spread tephra into stratosphere for 10 straight hours near volcano swirling ash particles in atmosphere generated lightning which in turn started many forest fires during this time parts of mushroom shaped ash cloud column collapsed and fell back upon earth this fallout mixed with magma mud and steam sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down st helens flanks later slower flows came directly from new north facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot ash some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam creating craters up to in diameter and sending ash as much as into strong high altitude wind carried much of this material east northeasterly from volcano at an average speed of about by 9 45 a m it had reached yakima washington away and by 11 45 a m it was over spokane washington a total of of ash fell on yakima and areas as far east as spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to and of ash fell continuing st helens ash fell in western part of yellowstone national park by 10 15 p m and was seen on ground in denver colorado next day in time ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as minnesota and oklahoma and some of ash drifted around globe within about during nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity about 540 000 000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than total volume of ash before its compaction by rainfall was about volume of uncompacted ash is equivalent to about of solid rock or about 7 of amount of material that slid off in debris avalanche by around 5 30 p m on may 18 vertical ash column declined in stature but less severe outbursts continued through next ash properties thumb residual lateral blast effects in channelized blast zone some thirty years after eruption damage ranged from scorched earth through tree trunks snapped at various heights to more superficial effects generally given that way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by meteorological conditions a certain variation of ash type will occur as a function of distance to volcano or time elapsed from eruption ash from mount st helens is no exception and hence ash properties have large variations chemical composition bulk chemical composition of ash has been found to be approximately 65 silicon dioxide 18 aluminium oxide 5 ferric oxide 4 each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2 magnesium oxide trace chemicals were also detected their concentrations varying as shown 0 05 0 09 chlorine 0 02 0 03 fluorine and 0 09 0 3 sulfur index of refraction index of refraction a number used in physics to describe how light propagates through a particular substance is an important property of volcanic ash this number is complex having both real and imaginary parts real part indicating how light disperses and imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by substance it is known that silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1 5 and 1 6 for visible light however there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash from very light to dark gray this makes for variations in measured imaginary refractive index under visible light in case of mount st helens ash settled in three main layers on ground bottom layer was dark gray and was found to be abundant in older rocks and crystal fragments middle layer consisted of a mixture of glass shards and pumice top layer was ash consisting of very fine particles for example when comparing imaginary part of refractive index k of stratospheric ash from from volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700 nm around 0 009 while they differ significantly around 300 nm here sample k was found to be around 0 009 was much more absorbent than sample k was found to be around 0 002 mudslides flow downstream alt trees covered in muddy ash thumb next to muddy river from 1980 lahars hot exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of mountain s glaciers along with most of overlying snow as in many previous st helens eruptions this created huge lahars volcanic mudflows and muddy floods that affected three of four stream drainage systems on mountain and which started to move as early as 8 50 a m harris fire mountains of west 1988 p 209 lahars travelled as fast as while still high on volcano but progressively slowed to about on flatter and wider parts of rivers mudflows from southern and eastern flanks had consistency of wet concrete as they raced down muddy river pine creek and smith creek to their confluence at lewis river bridges were taken out at mouth of pine creek and head of swift reservoir which rose by noon to accommodate nearly of additional water mud and debris glacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on volcano s northeast slope to create much larger lahars these mudflows traveled down north and south forks of toutle river and joined at confluence of toutle forks and cowlitz river near castle rock washington at 1 00 p m ninety minutes after eruption first mudflow had moved upstream where observers at weyerhaeuser s camp baker saw a wall of muddy water and debris pass near confluence of toutle s north and south forks at silver lake a record flood stage of was recorded a large but slower moving mudflow with a mortar like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at head of toutle river north fork by 2 30 p m massive mudflow had

in total mount st helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy seven of which were a direct result of blast this is equivalent to 1 600 times size of atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima disputed death toll there is a minor controversy in regard to exact death toll figure most commonly cited is fifty seven however there are two points of dispute first point regards two officially listed victims paul hiatt and dale thayer they were reported missing after explosion in aftermath investigators were able to locate individuals named paul hiatt and dale thayer who were alive and well however they were unable to determine who reported hiatt missing and person who was listed as reporting thayer missing claimed she wasn t one who had done so since investigators could not thus verify that they were same hiatt and thayer who were reported missing names remain listed among presumed dead second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims robert ruffle steven whitsett and mark melanson cowlitz county emergency services management lists them as possibly missing not on official list according to melanson s brother in october 1983 cowlitz county officials told his family that melanson is believed a victim of may 18 1980 eruption and that after years of searching family eventually decided he s buried in ash taking these two points of dispute into consideration direct death toll could be as low as fifty five or as high as sixty when combined with four indirect victims mentioned earlier those numbers range from fifty nine to sixty four ash damage and removal

weeks as several airports in eastern washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures fine grained gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters and scratched moving surfaces

federal agencies estimated that over of ash equivalent to about 900 000 tons in weight were removed from highways and airports in washington ash removal cost 2 2 million and took 10 weeks in yakima need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated selection of some disposal sites some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills others created dump sites
