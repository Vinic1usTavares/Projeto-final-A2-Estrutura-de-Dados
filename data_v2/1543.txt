carrier during construction due to threat of american submarines and aircraft carriers both yamato and musashi spent majority of their careers in naval bases at brunei truk and kure deploying on several occasions in response to american raids on japanese bases before participating in battle of leyte gulf in october 1944 as part of admiral kurita s centre force musashi was sunk during battle by american carrier aircraft shinano was sunk ten days after her commissioning in november 1944 by submarine while yamato was sunk in april 1945 during operation ten go background design of yamato class battleships was shaped by expansionist movements within japanese government japanese industrial power and need for a fleet powerful enough to intimidate likely adversaries thumb left musashi august 1942 taken from bow after end of first world war many navies including those of united states united kingdom and imperial japan continued and expanded construction programs that had begun during conflict enormous costs associated with these programs pressured their government leaders to begin a disarmament conference on 8 july 1921 united states secretary of state charles evans hughes invited delegations from other major maritime powers france italy japan and united kingdom to come to washington d c and discuss a possible end to naval arms race subsequent washington naval conference resulted in washington naval treaty along with many other provisions it limited all future battleships to a standard displacement of and a maximum gun caliber of it also agreed that five countries would not construct more capital ships for ten years and would not replace any ship that survived treaty until it was at least twenty years old friedman p and dulin pp 4 5 in 1930s japanese government began a shift towards ultranationalist militancy willmott p 32 this movement called for expansion of japanese empire to include much of pacific ocean and southeast asia maintenance of such an empire spanning from china to midway island required a sizable fleet capable of sustained control of territory schom p 42 although all of japan s battleships built prior to yamato class had been completed before 1921 as washington treaty had prevented any more from being completed all had been either reconstructed or significantly modernized or both in 1930s willmott p 34 gardiner and gray p 229 this modernization included among other things additional speed and firepower which japanese intended to use to conquer and defend their aspired to empire gardiner and gray pp 229 231 234 when japan withdrew from league of nations in 1934 over mukden incident it also renounced all treaty obligations garzke and dulin p 44 japan would no longer design battleships within treaty limitations and was free to build warships larger than those of other major maritime powers willmott p 35 japan s intention to acquire resource producing colonies in pacific and southeast asia would likely lead to confrontation with united states schom p 43 thus u s became japan s primary potential enemy u s possessed significantly greater industrial power than japan with 32 2 of worldwide industrial production compared to japan s 3 5 willmott p 22 furthermore several leading members of united states congress had pledged to outbuild japan three to one in a naval race consequently as japanese industrial output could not compete with american industrial power japanese ship designers developed plans for new battleships individually superior to their counterparts in united states navy garzke and dulin p 45 each of these battleships would be capable of engaging multiple enemy capital ships simultaneously eliminating need to expend as much industrial effort as u s on battleship construction design thumb left 200px bridge of musashi preliminary studies for a new class of battleships began after japan s departure from league of nations and its renunciation of washington and london naval treaties from 1934 to 1936 24 initial designs were put forth these early plans varied greatly in armament propulsion endurance and armor main batteries fluctuated between and guns while secondary armaments were composed of differing numbers of and guns propulsion in most of designs was a hybrid diesel turbine combination though one relied solely on diesel and another planned for only turbines endurance in designs had at a low of in design a 140 j2 to a high of in designs a and a 140 b2 armor varied between providing protection from fire of 406 mm guns to enough protection against 460 mm guns garzke and dulin pp 45 51 after these had been reviewed two of original twenty four were finalized as possibilities a 140 f3 and a 140 f4 differing primarily in their range versus at they were used in formation of final preliminary study which was finished on 20 july 1936 tweaks to that design resulted in definitive design of march 1937 garzke and dulin pp 49 50 which was put forth by rear admiral fukuda keiji an endurance of 7 200 nmi was finally decided upon and hybrid diesel turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of turbines diesels were removed from design because of problems with engines aboard submarine tender their engines which were similar to ones that were going to be mounted in new battleships required a major repair and maintenance effort garzke and dulin p 49 to keep them running due to a fundamental design defect in addition if engines failed entirely armored citadel deck roof that protected proposed diesel engine rooms and attendant machinery spaces would severely hamper any attempt to remove and replace them garzke and dulin p 50 final design called for a standard displacement of and a full load displacement of garzke and dulin p 53 making ships of class largest battleships yet designed and largest battleships ever constructed design called for a main armament of nine 460 mm naval guns mounted in three triple gun turrets each of which weighed more than a 1930s era destroyer designs were quickly approved by japanese naval high command johnston and mcauley p 122 over objections of naval aviators who argued for construction of aircraft carriers rather than battleships reynolds pp 5 as far back as 1933 imperial japanese navy aviators including admiral isoroku yamamoto argued that best defense against u s carrier attacks would be a carrier fleet of their own not a battleship fleet however when controversy broke into open older conservative admirals held firm to their traditional faith in battleship as capital ship of fleet by supporting construction of yamato class see reynolds pp 5 6 in all five yamato class battleships were planned ships thumb right yamato and musashi anchored in waters off of truk islands in 1943 although five yamato class vessels had been planned in 1937 only three two battleships and a converted aircraft carrier were completed all three vessels were built in extreme secrecy to prevent american intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications indeed united states office of naval intelligence only became aware of yamato and musashi by name in late 1942 at this early time their assumptions on class s specifications were quite far off while they were correct on their length class was given as having a beam of in actuality it was about and a displacement of 40 000 57 000 tons actually 69 000 tons in addition main armament of yamato class was given as nine guns as late as july 1945 four months after yamato was sunk friedman p and mcauley p 128 both jane s fighting ships and western media also misreported specifications of ships in september 1944 jane s fighting ships listed displacement of both yamato and musashi as 45 000 tons similarly both new york times and associated press reported that two ships displaced 45 000 tons with a speed of 30 knots and even after sinking of yamato in april 1945 times of london continued to give 45 000 tons as ship s displacement nevertheless existence of ships and their supposed violation of naval treaties heavily influenced american naval engineers in design of 60 500 ton s though they were not

most of original armor values were slightly reduced including belt deck and turrets savings in weight this entailed meant that improvements could be made in other areas including added protection for fire control and lookout positions in addition secondary armament on first two yamatos was to have been replaced by 65 caliber type 98 gun although smaller this gun was superior to 127 mm possessing a significantly greater muzzle velocity maximum range anti aircraft ceiling and rate of fire garzke and dulin pp 74 75 in june 1942 following japanese defeat at midway construction of shinano was suspended and hull was gradually rebuilt as an aircraft carrier she was designed as a 64 800 ton support vessel that would be capable of ferrying repairing and replenishing of other carriers reynolds p p 91 although she was originally scheduled for commissioning in early 1945 reynolds p 219 construction of ship was accelerated after battle of philippine sea reynolds p 284 this resulted in shinano being launched on 5 october 1944 and commissioned a little more than a month later on 19 november shinano departed yokosuka for kure nine days later in early morning on 29 november shinano was hit by four torpedoes from although damage seemed manageable poor flooding control caused vessel to list to starboard shortly before midday she capsized and sank taking 1 435 of her 2 400 man crew with her to this day shinano is largest naval vessel to have been sunk by a submarine wheeler p and dulin p 99 warships number 111 and 797 warship number 111 never named was planned as fourth member of yamato class and second ship to incorporate improvements of shinano ship s keel was laid after yamatos launch in august 1940 and construction continued until december 1941 when japanese began to question their ambitious capital ship building program with coming of war resources essential in constructing ship would become much harder to obtain as a result hull of fourth vessel only about 30 complete was taken apart and scrapped in 1942 materials from this were used in conversions of and to hybrid battleship aircraft carriers garzke and dulin p and mcauley p hull was scrapped double bottom was not later construction of four large submarines took place on top of it see garzke and dulin p 84 available sources do not report when double bottom was scrapped fifth vessel warship number 797 was planned as an improved shinano but was never laid down in addition to modifications made to that ship 797 would have removed two wing turrets in favor of additional 100 mm guns authors william garzke and robert dulin estimate that this would have allowed for 24 of these weapons yamato was eventually modified in 1944 to something akin to this garzke and dulin p 85 specifications armaments primary armament thumb yamatos port side anti aircraft armament as depicted in model of ship at yamato museum in kure yamato class battleships had primary armaments consisting of three triple mounted 46 cm 45 caliber type 94 naval guns largest guns ever fitted to a warship johnston and mcauley p 123 although they were officially designated as 40 cm 45 caliber 15 9 in type 94 each of which weighed 2 774 tonnes for complete mount jackson p 75 each gun was long and weighed johnston and mcauley p 123 each of three main turrets weighed more than a good sized destroyer and could fire armour piercing shells and high explosive shells out to at a rate of 1 1 2 to 2 shells per minute main guns were also capable of firing 3 shiki tsujodan common type 3 anti aircraft shells these shells may have been nicknamed beehive while in service see a time fuze was used to set how far away shells would explode although they were commonly set to go off away upon detonation each of these shells would release 900 incendiary filled tubes in a 20deg cone facing towards incoming aircraft a bursting charge was then used to explode shell itself so that more steel splinters were created and then tubes would ignite tubes would burn for five seconds at about and would start a flame that was around long even though they comprised 40 of total main ammunition load by 1944 3 shiki tsujodan were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to severe damage firing of these shells inflicted on barrels of main guns indeed one of shells may have exploded early and disabled one of guns during battle of sibuyan sea shells were intended to put up a barrage of flame that any aircraft attempting to attack would have to navigate through however u s pilots considered these shells to be more of a pyrotechnics display than a competent anti aircraft weapon thumb musashi as she appeared in 1942 compare to 1944 and 1945 configurations of class with removal of amidship 15 5 cm turrets to make way for addition anti aircraft guns of 12 7 cm 40 type 89 and 25 mm type 96 varieties thumb musashi as she appeared in mid 1944 secondary armament thumb yamato depicting her appearance specific configuration from 7 april 1945 in original design yamato class secondary armament comprised twelve 15 5 cm 60 type 3 guns mounted in four triple turrets one forward two amidships one aft and twelve

maximum range of at an elevation of 45 degrees their rate of fire was five rounds per minute campbell pp 187 88 two midships turrets were removed in 1944 in favor of additional heavy and light anti aircraft guns initially heavy anti aircraft defence was provided by a dozen 40 calibre 127 millimetre type 89 dual purpose guns in six twin turrets three on each side of superstructure in 1944 two amidship 15 5 cm turrets were removed to make room for three additional 127 millimetre mounts on each side bringing total number of these gun to twenty four chesneau p 178 when firing at surface targets guns had a range of they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute campbell pp 192 93 anti aircraft armament yamato class originally carried twenty four 25 mm type 96 anti aircraft guns primarily mounted amidships in 1944 both yamato and musashi underwent significant anti aircraft upgrades in preparation for operations in leyte gulf using space freed up by removal of both midships secondary battery turrets johnston and mcauley p 180 and ended up with a complement of twenty four guns and one hundred and sixty two antiaircraft guns 25 mm anti aircraft guns could tilt at 90 degree angles to aim at planes directly overhead but their mountings lack of protection made their gunnery crews extremely vulnerable to direct enemy fire these guns had an effective range of and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of frequent need to change fifteen round magazines campbell p 200 this was standard japanese light aa gun during world war ii it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon according to historian mark stille twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation gun sights were unable to handle fast targets gun exhibited excessive vibration magazine was too small and gun produced excessive muzzle blast stille p 11 class was also provided with two twin mounts for licence built 13 2 mm type 93 anti aircraft machine guns one on each side of bridge maximum range of these guns was but effective range against aircraft was only cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute need to change 30 round magazines reduced effective rate to 250 rounds per minute campbell p 202 armament on shinano was quite different from that of her sister vessels due to her conversion as carrier was designed for a support role significant anti aircraft weaponry was installed on vessel sixteen guns one hundred and twenty five anti aircraft guns and three hundred and thirty six anti aircraft rocket launchers in twelve twenty eight barrel turrets preston p 84 none of these guns were ever used against an enemy vessel or aircraft armour thumb upright 0 6 protection schematics of class at rear turret here is another cut amidships designed to engage multiple enemy battleships simultaneously schom p 270 yamatos were fitted with heavy armour plating described by naval historian mark stille as providing an unparalleled degree of protection in surface combat stille p 37 main belt of armour along side of vessel was up to thick with transverse bulkheads of armoured citadel up to thick furthermore top hull shape was very advanced peculiar sideways curving effectively maximizing armour protection and structural rigidity while optimizing weight armour on main turrets surpassed even that of main belt with turret face plating thick armour plates in both main belt and main turrets was made of vickers hardened which was a face hardened steel armour garzke and dulin p 65 main armoured deck thick was composed of a nickel chromium molybdenum alloy ballistics tests at proving ground at demonstrated deck alloy to be superior to homogeneous vickers plates by 10 15 additional plating was designed by manipulating chromium and nickel composition of alloy higher contents of nickel allowed plate to be rolled and bent without developing fracture properties for torpedo protection a multi layered side protection system was used which consists of several bulkheads as well as lower armour belt system depth was and was designed to withstand tnt charge u s naval technical mission to japan relatively new procedure of arc welding was used extensively throughout ship strengthening durability of armour plating fitzsimons volume 24 p 2609 through this technique lower side belt armour included in ships as a response to gunnery experiments upon and new japanese type 91 shell which could travel great lengths underwater garzke and dulin p 94 was used to strengthen hull structure of entire vessel in total vessels of yamato class contained 1 147 watertight compartments of which 1 065 were beneath armoured deck ships were also designed with a very large amount of reserve buoyancy to mitigate effects of flooding however protection scheme of yamato class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings structural weaknesses existed near bow of vessels where armour plating was generally thinner as demonstrated by musashi s damage from a torpedo hit in 1943 steinberg p 54 hull of shinano was subject to even greater structural weaknesses being hastily constructed near end of war and having been equipped with incomplete armour and unsealed watertight compartments at time of her sinking torpedo defense system performed substantially worse than designed in particular very poor jointing between upper belt and lower belt armour created a rupture prone seam just below waterline which when combined with relatively shallow system depth caused class to be susceptible to torpedoes joint failure has been attributed to considerable damage inflicted upon yamato from a single impact in 1943 and to sinking of shinano from four hits in 1944 propulsion yamato class was fitted with 12 kampon boilers which powered quadruple steam turbines jackson p 74 with an indicated horsepower of 147 948 these in turn drove four propellers this powerplant enabled yamato class to achieve a top speed of with this speed yamato class ability to function alongside fast carriers was limited in addition fuel consumption rate of both battleships was very high jackson p 128 as a result neither battleship was used in combat during solomon islands campaign or minor battles during island hopping period of 1943 and early 1944 propulsion system of shinano was slightly improved allowing carrier to achieve a top speed of super yamato class battleships two battleships of an entirely new and larger design were planned as a part of 1942 fleet replenishment program designated as design a 150 and initially named warship number 178 and warship number 179 plans for ships began soon after design of yamato class was finished probably in 1938 39 everything was essentially completed sometime in 1941 but with war on horizon work on battleships was halted to fill a need for additional warships such as aircraft carriers and cruisers to replace war losses of those vital ships japanese loss in battle of midway where four carriers were sunk out of ten to date in entire navy made it certain that work on ships would never begin in third volume of their battleships series axis and neutral battleships in world war ii authors william h garzke and robert o dulin asserted that these ships would have been most powerful battleships in history because of their massive main battery and extensive anti aircraft weaponry gardiner and chesneau p and dulin pp 85 86 similar to fate of papers relating to yamato class most papers and all plans relating to class were destroyed to prevent capture at end of war it is known that final design of ships would have had an even greater firepower and size than yamato class a main battery of six guns in three twin turrets and secondary dual purpose armament consisting of twenty four dual mounted guns similar to s displacement was to be bigger than yamatos and a side armor belt of was planned destruction of records on eve of allies occupation of japan special service officers of imperial japanese navy destroyed virtually all records drawings and photographs of or relating to yamato class battleships leaving only fragmentary records of design characteristics and other technical matters destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 only known images of yamato and musashi were those taken by united states navy aircraft involved in attacks on two battleships although some additional photographs and information from documents that were not destroyed have come to light over years loss of majority of written records for class has made extensive research into yamato class somewhat difficult skulski p 8 because of lack of written records information on class largely came from interviews of japanese officers following japan s surrender however in october 1942 based upon a special request from adolf hitler german admiral paul wenneker attached to german naval attache in japan was allowed to inspect a yamato class battleship while it was undergoing maintenance in a dockyard at which time admiral wenneker cabled a detailed description of warship to berlin on 22 august 1943 erich groner a german naval historian and author of book die deutschen 1815 1945 was shown report while at fuhrer headquarters and was directed to make an interpretation and then prepare a design sketch drawing of japanese battleship material was preserved by erich groner s wife mrs h groner and submitted to publishers in 1950s jentschura p 8

until present day yamato and musashi have carried a notable presence in japanese culture yamato in particular upon completion battleships represented epitome of imperial japanese naval engineering in addition two ships due to their size speed and power visibly embodied japan s determination and readiness to defend its interests against western powers especially united states shigeru fukudome chief of operations section of imperial japanese navy general staff described two ships as symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy evans and peattie pp 298 378 yamato and especially story of her sinking has appeared often in japanese popular culture such as anime space battleship yamato and 2005 film yamato appearances in popular culture usually portray ship s last mission as a brave selfless but futile symbolic effort by participating japanese sailors to defend their homeland one of reasons that warship may have such significance in japanese culture is that word yamato was often used as a poetic name for japan thus end of battleship yamato could serve as a metaphor for end of japanese empire yoshida and minear p
