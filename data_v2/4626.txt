mostly about mark and kate show s script producer emma gordon agreed that real time episode was best way to do justice to character and his exit mcgregor explained that while producers were planning his character s exit they took inspiration from us drama 24 gordon admitted to tiffany fox from west australian that technique was a real challenge for neighbours she said it is a bit different and a bit out of our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly feeling we wanted to create when you have half an hour to make a decision that will affect rest of your life every excruciating minute counts filming episode sees mark reveal that he only has 30 minutes before he has to leave for witness protection he then tries to convince kate to come with him storyline takes place between 6 30pm and 7 00pm which is when neighbours airs in australia episode was filmed over two nights and gordon told fox that extra effort went into ensuring continuity was perfect every minute had to be accounted for including commercial breaks and time taken up by actors walking from one house to another gordon commented that clocks and watches are used throughout episode to keep tension high during an interview with a channel 5 website reporter brewer said that filming episode was similar to filming a regular episode of soap as scenes were still shot out of order she thought it was nice working in a short time period that did not jump from day to day during filming of final scenes on location weather took a turn for worse and it began to rain however gordon added that it looked spectacular and adds such an atmosphere brewer told a channel 5 website writer that rain was biggest challenge of night shoot as it was beyond freezing she also revealed that she ran in shoes that she had not broken in and they made her feet bleed actress added it was incredibly stressful but i guess it was stress in a good way there were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork so i guess it was stressful in sense emotional stakes were heightened for a two week period it was exhausting and i think we can all say we were happy once it was over but final result was worth it mcgregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at melbourne studios he explained that they had already shot mark s last scene on location then went back inside to do studio shots he revealed final thing i filmed was a conversation between mark and kyle where they re saying goodbye it was a bit sad but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other with cast and crew watching reception real time episode was broadcast on 22 june 2011 in australia and on 20 july in uk it was watched by 408 000 australian viewers upon its first airing making

stars while paper s television critic andrew murfett commented clock is omnipresent in tonight s real time neighbours episode gimmick of formatting episode unfolds in real time over an action packed 30 minutes on ramsay street means clock appears almost every minute to remind us of what is a pressing deadline it s a clever device for fans who have perhaps fallen out of touch with folks at
