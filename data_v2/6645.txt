tropical storm alberto was a deadly pre season tropical cyclone that caused 125 million in damage to gulf coast in late may 2018 first storm of 2018 atlantic hurricane season alberto developed on may 25 near yucatan peninsula as a subtropical cyclone as it entered gulf of mexico alberto intensified and transitioned into a tropical cyclone early on may 28 alberto reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar hpa 29 23 inhg afterward however dry air caused alberto to weaken before it made landfall near laguna beach florida with winds of 45 mph 75 km h alberto maintained a compact area of thunderstorms as it progressed through central united states entering southern michigan as a tropical depression on may 31 that day alberto weakened further and dissipated over ontario along its path alberto dropped heavy rainfall mainly to east of its storm path in cuba storm flooding killed ten people and also damaged houses roads and crops floodwaters caused an oil spill in cienfuegos bay in united states alberto caused about 125 million 2018 usd in damage as well as eight deaths five fatalities occurred in north carolina three of which were a result of landslides and other two from fallen trees flooding was responsible for deaths of three people in virginia storm caused coastal flooding along united states gulf coast most significantly in florida where it moved ashore meteorological history on may 12 a trough moved eastward from mexico and stalled over gulf of mexico and caribbean sea by may 20 trough had rotated into a northwest southeast orientation which increased diffluence and contributed to formation of a broad low pressure area over northwest caribbean early on may 21 national hurricane center nhc first indicated potential for low to undergo future cyclonic development on may 23 low moved over eastern yucatan peninsula where its development was impeded due to strong wind shear and dry air on may 25 low moved back over caribbean sea and developed a well defined circulation that day nhc designated system as a subtropical depression while it was located about 80 mi 130 km east northeast of chetumal quintana roo subtropical designation was due to depression s interaction with an upper level low as well as its broad wind field with multiple low level circulations evident with most of convection located east of center subtropical depression remained disorganized as it moved northward on may 26 center redeveloped under primary area of convection in gulf of mexico northeast of previous weak circulation in caribbean soon after this structural improvement depression intensified into a subtropical storm off northwest tip of cuba and was named alberto operationally nhc considered alberto a subtropical storm from its first advisory in caribbean as alberto moved parallel to florida s west coast a large band of thunderstorms persisted to east of storm s center extending from florida to cuba thunderstorms concentrated near center and became more symmetrical a sign that storm was transitioning into a tropical cyclone alberto became fully tropical by 00 00 utc on may 28 while nearing florida panhandle around that time hurricane hunters observed maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h which would be storm s peak intensity while near its maximum intensity alberto moved slowly around northern side of an upper level low and intrusion of drier air into circulation caused thunderstorms to weaken tropical storm alberto made landfall near laguna beach florida at 21 00 utc on may 29 with sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h operationally nhc maintained system as a subtropical storm although agency noted ambiguity with storm s structure alberto quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it moved inland although it maintained an area of thunderstorms over a well defined center system maintained its structure and intensity over land due to a phenomenon known as brown ocean effect in which sufficient ground moisture negates otherwise deleterious effects that tracking inland has on a tropical cyclone on may 30 an approaching trough turned system northeastward and alberto entered southern michigan as a tropical depression following day soon thereafter however system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area low crossed lake huron and dissipated over western ontario by 12 00 utc that day preparations thumb initial rain forecast from nws showing significant rain in pink areas upon classification of alberto as a subtropical storm government of mexico issued
