enjoyably comic it is not nearly as well written as his later autobiographical book love and war in apennines 1971 a judgement in which newby concurred travel writer john pilkington stated that book had been an early inspiration in his life and wrote of newby that he had an understated self deprecating sense of humour which was very british perfect travel writing michael shapiro interviewing newby for travelers tales called book a classic piece of old school british exploration and established newby s trademark self deprecating wry humor and included it in s list of favourite travel books boyd tonkin writing in independent called book a classic trek and commented that while it is told light heartedly newby despite his comic gift always retained his capacity for wonderment thumb upright left newby meets explorer and travel writer wilfred thesiger at end of book painting by anthony devas 1944 kari herbert noted in guardian s list of travel writer s favourite travel books that she had inherited a well loved copy of book from her father english polar explorer wally herbert like newby i was in a soulless job desperate for change and adventure reading a short walk was a revelation superbly crafted eccentric and evocative story of his afghan travels was like a call to arms outside magazine includes a short walk among its 25 essential books for well read explorer while salon com has book in its list of top 10 travel books of 20th century daily telegraph too enjoyed english humour of book including it in a list of favourite travel books and describing newby and carless s meeting with explorer wilfred thesiger as a hilarious segment it quotes we started to blow up our air beds god you must be a couple of pansies said thesiger swedish journalist and travel writer noted that meeting with thesiger represented in newby s exaggerated account a collision between two generations of travel writers who travelled wrote and related to strangers quite differently margalit fox writing newby s obituary in new york times noted that trip was one that made him famous and states that as in all his work narrative was marked by genial self effacement and overwhelming understatement she cites a 1959 review in same publication by william o douglas later a supreme court judge who called book a chatty humorous and perceptive account adding that even unsanitary hotel accommodations infected drinking water unpalatable food inevitable dysentery are lively amusing laughable episodes american novelist rick skwiot enjoyed blithely confident brit s narrative style finding echoes of its concept structure and humour in bill bryson s a walk in woods skwiot notes hazards of journey as crevasses precipices thieves bears disease thirst hunger somehow they blunder on toward their whimsical destination he remarks seductive and tickling narrative told with understatement self effacement savage wit honed irony and unrelenting honesty reader is drawn in by his endearingly flawed humanity in varieties of nostalgia in contemporary travel writing patrick holland and graham observed that travel writing like travel itself is generated by nostalgia but anachronistic gentleman can only exist they note quoting simon raven in circumstances that are manifestly contrived or unreal resulting atmosphere of enhanced affectation is exploited to maximum comic effect in books like a short walk which they called an acclaimed post byronic escapade in which gentlemanly theatrics come to assume proportions of full blown farce essayist and professor of english samuel pickering called a short walk and his later book slowly down ganges vastly entertaining reminiscent of earlier british travellers like robert byron road to oxiana 1937 but also episodic each day cluttered with odd occurrences that are striking because they occur in exotic lands pickering noted that newby s combination of whimsy with close observation fitted in to british travel writing tradition in his view newby s writing has aged but like old wine it goes down smoothly and remains invigorating legacy austrian alpinist adolf wrote in a 1966 report that in mountaineering terms newby and carless s reconnaissance of central hindu kush was a negligible effort admitting however that they almost climbed it climb was more warmly described in same year as first serious attempt at mountaineering in that country afghan hindu kush by polish mountaineer boleslaw in january 2012 an expedition under auspices of british mountaineering council citing popular adventure book attempted
