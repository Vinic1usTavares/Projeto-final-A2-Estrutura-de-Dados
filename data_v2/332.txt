lorraine and count leopold joseph von daun victory ensured prussia control of silesia during third silesian war part of seven years war battle was fought at silesian town of leuthen northwest of breslau by exploiting training of his troops and his superior knowledge of terrain frederick created a diversion at one end of battlefield and moved most of his small army behind a series of low

hours prussians destroyed austrian force erasing any advantage austrians had gained throughout campaigning in preceding summer and autumn within 48 hours frederick had laid siege to breslau which resulted in that city s surrender on 19 20 december leuthen was last battle at which prince charles commanded austrian army before his sister in law empress maria theresa appointed him as governor of habsburg netherlands and placed leopold joseph von daun in command of army battle also established beyond doubt frederick s military reputation in european circles it was arguably his greatest

austrian succession 1740 1748 between prussia and maria theresa s allies awarded silesia to prussia empress maria theresa had signed treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new

france and her chief ministers negotiated a military and political pact advantageous to both parties that drove britain to align herself with george ii s nephew king of prussia their alliance also

distraction screened frederick s intent which was to execute an oblique maneuver similar to what he had used to win only weeks earlier at battle of rossbach prince charles watching from his vantage

prussians really intended frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered truth cavalry he had left demonstrating in front of northernmost position of austrian line was simply a screen a diversion to hide his real movements second austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of leuthen nadasdy s omission of outposts on his open flank south of leuthen was a surprising failure for a man with his long years of experience against prussians he should have considered possibility of an attack from an unexpected direction because this was

reclamation of silesia redman p 166 battle also demonstrated 18th century linear tactics at their best furthermore frederick had learned some valuable lessons at battles of prague and of kolin where his infantry had run out of ammunition and lost initiative at leuthen ammunition wagons moved with advancing lines of grenadiers and infantry battalions troops could be resupplied quickly without losing their momentum consequently although some infantrymen fired as many as 180 rounds advance never bogged down for lack of ammunition prussian cavalry successfully protected flanks especially important with nadasdy s assault on prussian grenadiers at village church and provided tactically important charges which eventually turned defeat into a rout finally frederick s redoubtable horse artillery sometimes called flying artillery for its ability to move rapidly maintained its fire and kept pace with army artillery deployed and redeployed its guns as needed distinctive bellow of 12 pounders sometimes called heightened prussian morale and wrought havoc on austrians victory also changed attitude of frederick s enemies before battle he was often referred to in unflattering even demeaning ways after leuthen he was widely called king of prussia in both polite and general popular circles this victory plus one at rossbach earned for frederick some respect and fear that even his most bitter of enemies held for rest of war and subsequent peace furthermore leuthen combined with earlier rossbach in all probability saved prussia from extinction a half century later napoleon
