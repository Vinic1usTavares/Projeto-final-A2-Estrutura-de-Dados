francis tresham 1567 23 december 1605 eldest son of thomas tresham and throckmorton was a member of group of english provincial catholics who planned failed gunpowder plot of 1605 a conspiracy to assassinate king james i of england tresham joined earl of essex s failed rebellion against government in 1601 for which he was imprisoned only his family s intervention and his father s money saved him from attainder despite this he became involved in two missions to catholic spain to seek support for english catholics then heavily persecuted and finally with gunpowder plotters according to his confession tresham joined plot in october 1605 its leader robert catesby asked him to provide a large sum of money and use of rushton hall but tresham apparently provided neither instead giving a much smaller amount of money to fellow plotter thomas wintour tresham also expressed concern that if plot was successful two of his brothers in law would be killed an anonymous letter delivered to one of them william parker 4th baron monteagle found its way to english secretary of state robert cecil an event which eventually proved decisive in conspiracy s failure historians have long suspected that tresham wrote letter a hypothesis that remains unproven catesby and wintour shared same suspicion and threatened to kill him but he was able to convince them otherwise he was arrested on 12 november and confined to tower of london in his confession he sought to allay his involvement in plot but never mentioned letter he died of natural causes on 23 december 1605 family and life before 1605 born in about 1567 francis tresham was eldest son of sir thomas tresham of rushton hall in northamptonshire and meriel throckmorton daughter of sir robert throckmorton of coughton in warwickshire according to antiquary anthony wood tresham was educated in oxford at either st john s college or gloucester hall or both although biographer mark nicholls mentions that there appears to be no other evidence to corroborate that claim francis is said to have been a fellow prisoner with robert catesby held in wisbech castle at time of spanish armada he married anne tufton daughter of sir john tufton of hothfield in kent in 1593 couple had three children twins lucy and thomas b 1598 and elizabeth thomas died in infancy lucy became a nun in brussels and elizabeth married sir george heneage of lincolnshire tresham s father born near end of henry viii s reign was regarded by catholic community as one of its leaders thomas was received into catholic church in 1580 and in same year he allowed jesuit edmund campion to stay at his house in hoxton for latter following campion s capture in 1581 he was tried in star chamber thomas s refusal to fully comply with his interrogators was beginning of years of fines and spells in prison he proclaimed accession of james i to english throne but king s promises to thomas of forestry commissions and an end to recusancy fines were not kept his finances were seriously depleted by fines of ps7 720 for recusancy and spending of ps12 200 on marriages of six daughters meant that when he died in 1605 his estate was ps11 500 in debt author antonia fraser suggests that as a young man francis became resentful of his father s authority and profligate with his father s money authors peter marshall and geoffrey scott describe him as possessing a somewhat hot headed nature while another source calls him a wild man jesuit priest oswald tesimond wrote that he was a man of sound judgement he knew how to look after himself but was not much to be trusted while still young he assaulted a man and his pregnant daughter claiming that their family owed his father money tresham spent time in prison for this offence on 8 february 1601 he joined earl of essex in open rebellion against government essex s aim was to secure his own ambitions but jesuit henry garnet described young men who accompanied him as being interested mostly in furthering catholic cause captured and imprisoned tresham appealed to katherine howard but was rebuked his sister lady alerted his cousin john throckmorton who turned to three most honorable parsons and one instrument for help identity of these individuals is unclear but tresham was promised freedom on condition that over next three months his father pay ps2 100 to william to save his attainder in he was released on 21 june experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in missions to catholic spain made by thomas wintour anthony dutton possibly an alias of christopher wright and guy fawkes later dubbed by english government as spanish treason however upon james s accession to throne he told thomas wintour secretary to tresham s brother in law william parker 4th baron monteagle that he would stand wholly for king and to have no speech with him of spain introduction right thumb rushton hall english catholics had hoped that persecution of their faith would end when james succeeded elizabeth i as he appeared to hold more moderate views toward catholics than his predecessor but robert catesby a religious zealot also imprisoned for his involvement in essex rebellion had grown tired of james s supposed perfidy and planned to kill king he hoped to achieve this by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt to install james s daughter princess elizabeth as titular queen catesby had recruited 11 fellow catholics to his cause but was running out of money even with his debts with an annual income of over ps3 000 tresham was one of wealthiest people known to plotters and catesby s mother was anne throckmorton an aunt of tresham s two cousins had been raised together and shared a close relationship despite their shared upbringing and involvement in spanish treason conspirators chose not to reveal plot to him until 14 october 1605 shortly after his father died and just weeks before planned explosion according to his confession meeting took place at home of tresham s brother in law lord stourton in clerkenwell tresham claimed to have questioned catesby on morality of plot asking if it was spiritually damnable catesby replied that it was not at which point tresham highlighted danger that all catholics would face should plot succeed catesby replied necessity of catholics was such that it must needs be done he wanted two things from tresham ps2 000 and use of rushton hall catesby received neither tresham had no money to spare his father s debts having reduced his inheritance although he paid a small sum to thomas wintour on understanding that latter was to travel to low countries following meeting he hurried back to rushton hall and closed his household taking care to hide family papers not discovered until 1838 he then returned to london with his mother and sisters and on 2 november acquired a licence to travel abroad with his servants and horses monteagle letter thumb alt a damaged and aged piece of paper or parchment with multiple lines of handwritten english text an anonymous letter sent to william parker was instrumental in revealing existence of plot identity of its author has never been reliably established later in october during a meeting at which tresham was present conspirators discussed fates of several notable catholic peers foremost in tresham s thoughts were lives of two brothers in law william parker 4th baron monteagle and edward stourton 10th baron stourton but catesby proclaimed that innocent must perish with guilty sooner than ruin chances of success as last few details were being finalised that month on saturday 26 october monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in hoxton it contained following message uncertain of its meaning monteagle delivered it to english secretary of state robert cecil tresham has long been suspected as letter s author mark nicholls states that he almost certainly wrote it pointing to fact that once catesby was made aware of its existence he immediately suspected tresham and went with thomas wintour to confront him two threatened to hang him but with such oaths and emphatic assertions tresham managed to convince pair of his innocence next day urging them by letter to abandon plot antonia fraser suggests that catesby and wintour s decision to believe him should not be disregarded while making his deathbed confession in tower of london tresham failed to mention letter an omission which in her opinion makes no sense if he is to be regarded as its author especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as country s saviour author alan haynes views tresham as most likely culprit but raises possibility that cecil penned letter himself to protect a source revealed although he was already aware of certain stirrings even before he received letter cecil did not yet know exact nature of plot or who was involved and had elected to watch to see what would happen when monteagle s letter was shown to king on friday 1 november james felt that it hinted at some strategem of fire and powder perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence one that killed his father lord darnley in 1567 following day members of privy council visited james to inform him that a search would be made of houses of parliament both above and below meanwhile tresham again urged catesby and wintour to abandon scheme but his attempts were in vain fellow plotter thomas percy said he was ready to abide uttermost trial and subsequently on 4 november catesby and several others left london for midlands to prepare for planned uprising fawkes was arrested while guarding explosives shortly after midnight on 5 november 1605 calling himself john johnson he was at first interrogated by members of king s privy chamber but on 6 november james ordered that john johnson be tortured his will finally broken he revealed his true identity on 7 november and on 8 november he began to name some of those with whom he was associated tresham s complicity was not revealed until following day although he was attributed with only a minor role but while his compatriots had fled london moment they discovered that fawkes had been captured tresham had stayed in city he was arrested on 12 november and transferred to tower three days later catesby and several other plotters were killed on 8 november during an armed siege at holbeche house in staffordshire death right thumb tresham died in tower of london from natural causes although at first he was uncooperative on 13 november tresham confessed to being involved in plot outlining his version of events to his interrogators moving his family from safety of rushton was he pointed out not action of a man who believed he was taking them into very mouth and fury of plot he admitted to government that he was guilty only of plot s concealment denying that he had ever been an active member of conspiracy although by end of month he had also admitted his involvement in spanish treason of 1602 1603 he claimed to have persuaded thomas wintour and thomas percy to postpone explosion and that he had planned to inform king s secretary thomas lake of a puritan conspiracy fraser views much of his confession as highly partial not only for his own sake but for that of his wife and children and important in serving to highlight his unreliability tresham suffered from a strangury caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract and in december 1605 his health began to decline lieutenant of tower william waad wondering if tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course described his condition as worse and worse tresham preferred services of a dr richard foster over those of tower s regular doctor matthew apparently foster understood his case indicating that it was not first occasion on which he had treated him during his last days he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse along with william vavasour a rumoured illegitimate child of thomas tresham and possibly francis s half brother as tresham s wife anne was apparently too upset vavasour wrote tresham s deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours tresham apologised to jesuit priest henry garnet for implicating him in spanish treason and used rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence anne and william read prayers at his bedside he died at 2 00 am on 23 december despite not being tried his head joined those of catesby and percy on display at northampton while his body was thrown into a hole at tower hill his estates passed to his brother lewis tresham s apology never reached its intended target and his letter along with discovery of garnet s of equivocation found among heretical treasonable and damnable books at tresham s chamber in inner temple was used to great effect by sir edward coke in garnet s trial priest was executed in may 1606 references footnotes
