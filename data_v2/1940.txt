tropical storm felice was a modest tropical cyclone that lightly affected parts of gulf coast of united states in mid september 1970 spawned by an upper level trough over bahamas system crossed florida keys and entered gulf of mexico where it gradually began to strengthen felice was a disorganized storm for its entire duration plagued by dry air a lack of deep thunderstorm activity and an ill defined center of circulation but nevertheless managed to peak as a high end tropical storm with winds just below category 1 hurricane strength tracking northwestward storm brushed southern louisiana on september 15 before making landfall northeast of galveston texas late that same day once ashore felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into central united states while over southeastern oklahoma however its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone in advance of cyclone officials prompted residents in vulnerable communities to leave their homes and temporary storm shelters were established however effects from felice were generally light beneficial rains fell over parts of southern florida while sections of coastal louisiana experienced minimal gale force winds and above normal tides winds gusting to at galveston and estimated near 70 mph 110 km h elsewhere caused scattered power outages and minor tree damage while heavy rainfall totaling over triggered some street flooding felice delayed local rice harvest and damaged some hay that had been cut before storm significant precipitation and gusty winds accompanied system into northern texas and oklahoma overall storm left no fatalities or widespread property damage anywhere along its path meteorological history developing as a tropical depression near nassau in bahamas on september 12 felice had its origins in a persistent upper level trough over area nascent depression tracked slowly toward west southwest without much intensification ultimately passing just north of key west florida as it entered gulf of mexico over open waters of gulf system accelerated toward west northwest along southern periphery of a large ridge of high pressure to north while reconnaissance aircraft data on storm suggested that depression strengthened into a tropical storm midday on september 14 official atlantic tropical cyclone database known as hurdat indicates disturbance attained tropical storm status at 0000 utc on september 15 despite continued gradual intensification felice remained disorganized as it approached northern gulf coast at forward speeds of up to storm s center came within range of weather radar site at new orleans louisiana resulting in close observation of storm s progress felice suffered from restricted outflow and a nebulous circulation marked by appearance of two centers near daybreak on september 15 a more distinct center had apparently formed to west northwest of storm s initial core which reportedly dissipated operationally forecasters at national hurricane center believed a surge of southerly inflow transported a significant amount of atmospheric vorticity away from old center of low pressure allowing for a new surface based circulation to form indeed a special off hour advisory was issued to identify storm s new location however post season analysis of felice determined that due to cyclone s disheveled nature as well as technical problems at time of observation center relocation could not be conclusively proven as a result official storm path does not reflect any significant jogs felice moved nearly parallel to southern coast of louisiana as it began to show signs of improved structure it reached its peak intensity as a high end tropical storm with winds of at 0000 utc on september 16 while located about 100 mi south of lafayette dry continental air from north likely prevented felice from reaching category 1 hurricane strength even as a strong tropical storm felice lacked deep convection typical of mature tropical cyclones shortly after peaking felice moved ashore at high island texas about to northeast of galveston during evening hours of september 15 local time storm rapidly deteriorated once over land and slowed in forward speed curving toward northwest felice passed near houston and weakened into a tropical depression diminishing system turned northward through north central texas late on september 16 and entered southeastern oklahoma by september 17 left thumb 300px wsr 57 radar image of remnants of felice over southeastern oklahoma early on september 17 although felice officially dissipated as a tropical cyclone at 1200 utc on september 17 its remnants exhibited a structure very similar to that of a healthy tropical cyclone as depicted by radar imagery from national severe storms laboratory in norman curved rainbands surrounded a distinct eye feature which passed about southeast of norman two aircraft flew into area to collect data on unique storm notably they discovered that system retained a deep warm core relative to its environment throughout day on september 17 remnants of felice continued to weaken residual surface low recurved toward east northeast over oklahoma and arkansas before fully dissipating after september 19 preparations and impact as felice neared coast gale warnings were hoisted from morgan city louisiana to galveston while a hurricane watch extended from morgan city to port o connor texas small craft advisories were also posted cautioning light vessels to remain in port all coastal advisories were discontinued by early hours of september 16 residents in path of storm generally evacuated in a timely manner over 3 000 fled storm in cameron parish louisiana around half of residents in low lying southern part of parish had already left before mandatory evacuation was ordered farther west one of two evacuation routes out of sabine pass texas had been rendered unusable a few days before storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident as remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding officials quickly worked to evacuate 1 300 people in sabine pass before storm s approach american red cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around beaumont shelters were also set up in houston and baton rouge louisiana though they went mostly unused post offices in sabine pass gilchrist and port bolivar transferred money orders first class parcels and postage stamps to beaumont office as a safety precaution right thumb 300px rainfall from tropical storm felice while crossing florida keys on september 13 depression dropped modest but beneficial rainfall of around 1 to 3 in 25 to 75 mm over southern florida peninsula highest tides associated with felice ran above normal at cameron louisiana rainfall in louisiana was light peaking near 2 5 in 65 mm in areas closest to storm s path coastal locations experienced gusty winds occasionally blowing gale force an anemometer at grand chenier recorded northeasterly gusts up to on evening of september 15 though winds may have affected quality of sugar cane crops in extreme southern areas of state no flooding or property damage was reported storm s landfall was accompanied by significant rainfall gusty winds and heightened tides at crystal beach near where felice crossed coast a distinct lull in wind and rain coincided with passage of storm s poorly defined eye weather observers in gilchrist and humble estimated gusts at from east and southwest respectively galveston endured sustained winds of and gusts as high as storm uprooted some newly planted palm trees one of which landed on a parked car isolated power outages affected parts of area including east side of galveston after a transformer was hit by lightning elsewhere felice brought down numerous tree limbs and power lines in washington county to north storm damaged vegetation and winds gusted to in houston heavy rains accumulating to triggered minor urban flooding in downtown galveston moderate to heavy rainfall affected a broad area along storm s path with multiple reports of or more precipitation resulted in a few instances of inconsequential flooding but more commonly proved beneficial as it helped to relieve dry conditions throughout eastern texas rice and hay crops sustained minor damage with harvest of former delayed by about a week along coast storm tides peaked at above normal as weakening storm progressed inland it continued to drop heavy rainfall over of rain fell over denton county in northern texas in southeastern oklahoma remnants of felice produced rainfall rates up to 2 in 50 mm per hour contributing to totals over relatively strong winds peaking around occurred near remnant center of circulation system continued to
