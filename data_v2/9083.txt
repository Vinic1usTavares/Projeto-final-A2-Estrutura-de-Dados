thumb 2011 nissan leaf was first electric car equipped with nissan s vehicle sound for pedestrians electric vehicle warning sounds are sounds designed to alert pedestrians to presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles hevs plug in hybrid electric vehicles and all electric vehicles evs travelling at low speeds warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can make it more difficult for pedestrians blind cyclists and others to be aware of their presence warning sounds may be driver triggered as in a horn but less urgent or automatic at low speeds in type they vary from clearly artificial beeps chimes to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in january 2010 and u s approved legislation in december 2010 u s national highway traffic safety administration issued its final ruling in february 2018 and requires device to emit warning sounds at speeds less than with compliance by september 2020 but 50 of quiet vehicles must have warning sounds by september 2019 in april 2014 european parliament approved legislation that requires mandatory use of acoustic vehicle alerting systems avas manufacturers must install an avas system in four wheeled electric and hybrid electric vehicles that are approved from july 1 2019 and to all new quiet electric and hybrid vehicles registered from july 2021 vehicle must make a continuous noise level of at least 56 dba within 2 meters if car is going 20 km h 12 mph or slower and a maximum of 75 dba several automakers have developed electric warning sound devices and since december 2011 advanced technology cars available in market with manually activated electric warning sounds include nissan leaf chevrolet volt honda clarity nissan fuga hybrid infiniti m35 hyundai sonata hybrid and toyota prius japan only models equipped with automatically activated systems include 2014 bmw i3 option not available in us 2012 model year toyota camry hybrid 2012 lexus ct200h all ev versions of honda fit and all prius family cars recently introduced in united states including standard 2012 model year prius toyota prius v prius c and toyota prius plug in hybrid 2013 smart electric drive optionally comes with automatically activated sounds in u s and japan and manually activated in europe tesla motors and volkswagen do not currently include warning sounds in their electric drive vehicles as both of them decided to add artificial sounds only when required by regulation background as a result of increased sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries some members of blind community have raised concerns about noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all electric mode as blind people or visually impaired consider noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and think quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc at slow speeds technical report dot hs 811 204 this problem is not exclusive to electric vehicles in 2007 research at technical university munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance researchers measured distance at which vehicles approaching pedestrians became audible with minimal background noise these distances were then compared to stopping distances of respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking research conducted at university of california riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode ev mode that they may pose a risk to blind small children elderly runners cyclists and other pedestrians as they may have only one or two seconds depending on context to audibly detect location of approaching hybrid cars when vehicles operate at very slow speeds this research project was funded by national federation of blind experiment consisted of making audio recordings of a toyota prius and combustion engine honda accord approaching from two directions at to ensure that hybrid car operated only with its electric motor then test subjects in a laboratory listened to recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction cars approached subjects could locate hum of internal combustion engine car at away but could not identify hybrid running in electric mode until it came within leaving just less than two seconds to react before vehicle reached their position in a second trial background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to recordings to simulate noise of a parking lot under this condition hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than conventional car before subjects could hear from which direction cars approached subjects could correctly judge approach of combustion car when it was about away this result means that under closer to normal environmental noise a pedestrian would not be able to correctly determine hybrid s approach until it was one second away a separate 2008 study from western michigan university found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling more than about because tire and wind noise generate most of audible cues at those speeds hybrid cars were also tested safe when moving off at traffic lights and it was found that under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians all prius models used in study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected a 2009 study conducted by u s national highway traffic safety administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine ice vehicles in low speed vehicle manoeuvres such as reversing or leaving a parking zone these accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits during daytime and in clear weather study found that a was two times more likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ice vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping backing up or entering or leaving a parking space vehicle manoeuvres were grouped in one category considering those manoeuvres that might have occurred at very low speeds where difference between sound levels produced by hybrid versus ice vehicle is greatest also study found that incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for hevs when compared to ice vehicles similarly nhtsa study also concluded that incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving hevs for same kind of manoeuvres was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles in september 2010 volvo cars and vattenfall a swedish energy company issued a report regarding results of first phase of volvo plug in hybrid demonstration program pp 3 4 among other findings before trial drivers participating in field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to quietness of electric drive vehicle after test several of them changed their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than they expected nevertheless some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue regulations since 2009 japanese government u s congress and european commission are exploring legislation to establish a minimum level of sound for plug in electric and hybrid electric vehicles when operating in electric mode so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching tests have shown that vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below european union in 2011 european commission drafted a guideline for acoustic vehicle alerting systems avas goal is to present recommendations to manufacturers for a system to be installed in vehicles to provide an audible signal to pedestrians and vulnerable road users this interim guideline is intended to provide guidance until completion of on going research activities and development of globally harmonised device performance specifications guidelines are intended for hybrid electric and pure electric highway capable vehicles guideline recommends that avas should automatically generate a continuous sound in minimum range of vehicle speed from start up to approximately and during reversing if applicable for that vehicle category and lists types of sounds that are not acceptable it also states that avas may have a pause switch to stop its operation temporarily on 6 february 2013 european parliament approved a draft law to tighten noise limits for cars to protect public health and also to add alerting sounds to ensure audibility of hybrid and electric vehicles to improve safety of vulnerable road users in urban areas such as blind visually and challenged pedestrians cyclists and children draft legislation states a number of tests standards and measures that must first be developed for an acoustic vehicle alerting systems avas to be compulsory in future now an agreement has to be negotiated with european union countries see amendments 16 20 58 and 59 approved amendment establishes that sound to be generated by avas should be a continuous sound that provides information to pedestrians and vulnerable road users of a vehicle in operation sound should be easily indicative of vehicle behaviour and should sound similar to sound of a vehicle of same category equipped with an internal combustion engine in april 2014 european parliament approved legislation regulation eu no 540 2014 that requires acoustic vehicle alerting systems which is mandatory for all new electric and hybrid electric vehicles new rule established a transitional period of 5 years after publication of final approval of april 2014 proposal to comply with regulation japan beginning in july 2009 japanese government began assessing possible countermeasures through committee for consideration of countermeasures regarding quiet hybrid and other vehicles and in january 2010 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism issued guidelines for hybrid and other near silent vehicles united kingdom department for transport dft commissioned research to gather statistics on accidents involving electric vehicles with pedestrians who are blind or vision impaired to determine whether perceived accident risk is real and whether electric and hybrid cars are more difficult to detect audibly than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles dft goal was to use findings to establish what sort of sound should be fitted to electric vehicles research was conducted by transport research laboratory and findings were published in 2011 study found little correlation between pedestrian vehicle involvement density and noise level for majority of vehicles in addition analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on or slower roads or where pedestrian was disabled a previous study did not find an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts which raised question as to whether added sound is necessarily required study also noted that some modern conventional cars are as quiet as their electric counterparts even at low speeds client project report uk organisation guide dogs for blind association lobbied members of european parliament to vote in favour of legislation to make installation of artificial sound generators mandatory on quiet electric and hybrid vehicles https www org uk campaigns safe and sound what have we done about it www co uk news local noisy campaign gets backing from blind 1 united states pedestrian safety enhancement act of 2010 was approved by u s senate by unanimous consent on december 9 2010 and passed by house of representatives by 379 to 30 on december 16 2010 act does not stipulate a specific speed for simulated noise but requires u s department of transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby electric or hybrid vehicle and ruling must be finalised within eighteen months bill was signed into law by president barack obama on january 4 2011 a proposed rule was published for comment by national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa in january 2013 it would require hybrids and electric vehicles travelling at less than to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must be able to hear over background noises agency selected 30 km h as limit because according to nhtsa measurements this is speed at which sound levels of hybrid and electric vehicles approximated sound levels produced by similar internal combustion vehicles download file notice of proposed according to nhtsa proposal car manufacturers would be able to pick sounds vehicles make from a range of choices and similar vehicles would have to make same sounds rules were scheduled to go into effect in september 2014 nhtsa estimates that new warning noises would prevent 2 800 pedestrian and cyclist injuries during life of each model year electric and hybrid vehicle in february 2013 association of global automakers and alliance of automobile manufacturers which submitted a joint comment to nhtsa announced their support to rule but asked nhtsa to find a noise level that effectively alerts pedestrians without being excessively loud to others inside and outside of vehicle they also commented that rule is too complicated unnecessarily prescriptive and it will cost more than necessary some automakers also said there is no need for electric drive vehicles to play sounds while not in motion since it is not clear that it helps pedestrians to hear cars that are stopped in traffic or parked in addition vehicle manufacturers requested nhtsa to make new sound system required by 2018 instead of 2014 in january 2015 nhtsa rescheduled date for a final ruling to end of 2015 since regulation comes into force three years after being rendered as a final rule compliance was delayed to 2018 in november 2015 nhtsa rescheduled one more time because additional coordination was necessary a final ruling was delayed at least until mid march 2016 after several additional delays national highway traffic safety administration issued its final ruling in february 2018 it requires hybrids and electric vehicles travelling at less than to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must be able to hear over background noises regulation requires full compliance in september 2020 but 50 of quiet vehicles must have warning sounds by september 2019 specific systems enhanced vehicle acoustics enhanced vehicle acoustics eva a company based in silicon valley california and founded by two stanford students with help of seed money from national federation of blind developed an after market technology called vehicular operations sound emitting systems voses device makes hybrid electric vehicles sound more like conventional internal combustion engine cars when vehicle goes into silent electric mode ev mode but at a fraction of sound level of most vehicles at speeds higher than between to sound system shuts off system also shuts off when hybrid combustion engine is active voses uses miniature all weather audio speakers that are placed on hybrid s wheel wells and emit specific sounds based on direction car is moving in order to minimize noise pollution and to maximize acoustic information for pedestrians if car is moving forward sounds are only projected in forward direction and if car is turning left or right sound changes on left or right appropriately company argues that chirps beeps and alarms are more distracting than useful and that best sounds for alerting pedestrians are car like such as soft purr of an engine or slow roll of tires across pavement one of eva s external sound systems was designed specifically for toyota prius thumb electric citroen c1 with ectunes external sound system ectunes ectunes is developing a system that utilises directional sound equipment to emit noise when and where it is needed according to company its technology sends audible signals only in direction of travel thus allowing vehicle to be heard by those who may be in car s path without disturbing others with unwelcome noise horsens a danish venture company has provided a significant investment to help ectunes fully develop its technology ectunes system and most others so far disclosed use a control box with software digital amplifiers and weather friendly external speakers ectunes system connects to car and reads speed and acceleration shutting down when car reaches cross over speed as set by existing regulation as well as regulation under development such as quiet road transport vehicles at which point tires and wind are making noise of their own company is currently selling products to oems mainly small series production and to after market and has also a new mass production unit in prototype stage company ceased operations in 2016 soundracer evs soundracer ab is a swedish manufacturer of electronic engine sound devices established in 2008 to develop sound technology for internal combustion engine ice cars in 2012 company released their first version of an electric vehicle electronic engine sound system based on same technology soundracer evs uses real engine sound recordings as base for sounds following legislation guidelines that sound should sound similar to sound of a vehicle of same category equipped with an internal combustion engine as a result sounds will also be less likely to cause disturbance compared to adding new types of synthetic sounds into traffic environment sound modules are developed to give a realistic ice sound impression indicating if vehicle is idling accelerating decelerating or cruising different sound characters and sound volume is determined from information about actual speed of vehicle and rate of speed change company targets two different applications with products to make electric vehicles meet upcoming legislations and to increase driving experience to make electric vehicles more popular among customer groups that enjoy real engine sounds many manufacturers of electric vehicles like cars trucks and buses are now in process of evaluating sound systems for their products to assist them in prototyping process soundracer evs modules have functions that will give ev manufacturers tools to test different sounds and settings several files with sounds and parameter settings such as speed for muting sound sound levels and simulated gear changing can be created with a computer program and stored on a microsd card changing sounds and settings during test drives is then performed with a touch of a button soundracer ab

fisker karma has an automatic warning sound generator thumb 2011 chevrolet volt includes a manually activated warning sound fisker automotive developed a sound generator that was incorporated in its fisker karma luxury plug in hybrid electric vehicle released in 2011 according to car manufacturer sound is designed to both alert pedestrians and enhance driver experience and warning noise will be emitted automatically fisker karma emits a sound through a pair of external speakers embedded in bumper according to a company spokesman sound is a mix between a formula one car and a starship developing process took between nine months to a year and three sound companies sent in synthesised wav file samples that were evaluated by fisker employees and executives prospective sounds were studied in an audio chamber to allow engineers to evaluate sounds without other noise interfering after testing candidate sounds in different locations relative to vehicle fisker fine tuned final sound with its own equipment warning sound is activated when car is travelling at less than ford 2012 ford focus electric was planned to include warning sounds for pedestrians ford motor company developed four alternative sounds and in june 2011 involved electric car fans by asking them to pick their favorite from four potential warning sounds through focus electric facebook page however ultimately ford decided to hold off including warning sounds unless federal legislation required it and no such system was implemented on production vehicle general motors general motors first commercially available plug in hybrid electric vehicle chevrolet volt introduced in december 2010 includes warning sounds for pedestrians gm s system is called pedestrian friendly alert system and it is manually activated by driver but future generations will probably include an active system automaker conducted a test with a group of visually challenged at milford proving grounds in order to evaluate audible warning systems on volt when a pedestrian is in car s proximity system uses car s horn to emit a series of warning chirps like a low tone of a horn enough to provide an alert but not to startle according to gm engineers biggest challenge is developing an active system that can distinguish a pedestrian from another vehicle otherwise sound will go off frequently producing noise pollution instead hyundai hyundai developed a warning noise for called virtual engine sound system vess system which was introduced in september 2010 on its test fleet of electric provides synthetic audio feedback mimicking sound of an idling internal combustion engine 2011 hyundai sonata hybrid is first mass production car manufactured by hyundai to include warning sound system in 2010 car manufacturer decided to have a button on sonata hybrid s instrument panel to turn vess on and off but after enactment of pedestrian safety enhancement act of 2010 signed into law by president obama in early 2011 and learning that u s national highway traffic safety administration would not allow such switches to avoid noise device to be turned off hyundai decided not to install button and first sonata hybrids destined for u s market had to be altered to remove switch lotus engineering lotus engineering a consultancy group of british sports car manufacturer lotus cars partnered in 2009 with harman becker a producer of audio systems to develop and commercialise a synthetic automotive audio systems lotus has worked on a number of hybrid and electric vehicles and its engineers thought they would be safer if these vehicles made a noise while moving around factory originally developed to cancel out intrusive noises inside a car noise cancelling system was adapted so that it could also simulate engine sounds that change with speed and use of throttle providing audible feedback to drivers of vehicles with a silent engine at same time and through addition of external speakers sound system allows pedestrians to hear noise too but optionally there can be a different sound within car from one that is emitted for outside lotus used a toyota prius to demonstrate device but did not indicate if it intended to bring this technology to market lotus synthetic sound system was incorporated in lotus hybrid a concept plug in hybrid unveiled at 2010 geneva motor show system called halosonic internal and external electronic sound synthesis is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from lotus and harman international audio system generates engine sounds inside

vehicle sound for pedestrians or vsp is a nissan developed warning sound system in electric vehicles nissan leaf was first car manufactured by nissan to include vsp and electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse article includes a sample of two sounds vsp was also used in nissan fuga hybrid launched in 2011 system developed makes a noise easy to hear for pedestrians to be aware of vehicle approaching but warning sounds do not distract car occupants inside nissan explained that during development of sound they studied behavioural research of visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists including national federation of blind detroit institute of ophthalmology experts from vanderbilt university medical center and a hollywood sound design studio article has a video with leaf warning sounds nissan s vehicle sound for pedestrians is a sine wave sound system that sweeps from 2 5 khz at high end to a low of 600 hz a range that is easily audible across age groups depending on speed and whether leaf is accelerating or decelerating sound system will make sweeping high low sounds for example when leaf is started sound will be louder and when car is in reverse system will generate an intermittent sound sound system ceases operation when nissan leaf reaches and engages again as car slows to under for 2011 leaf driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside vehicle but system automatically reset to on at next ignition cycle system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in dash panel and sound is delivered through a speaker in front driver s side wheel well nissan said that there were six or seven finalist sounds and that sound testing included driving cars emitting various sounds past testers standing on street corners who indicated when they first heard approaching car nissan removed ability to disable pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of u s ruling to be issued by national highway traffic safety administration leaf s electric warning sound had to be removed for cars delivered in u k as country s law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11 00 pm and 6 00 am and leaf s audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation for 2014 uk model of car vsp system is enabled by default though a button on dash permits drivers to disable system until next time car is switched on toyota thumb since august 2010 a warning device for retrofitting toyota prius is available for japanese consumers toyota motor company teamed up with fujitsu ten to develop an automatic warning system for hybrids and electric vehicles to alert pedestrians when car is propelled by its electric motor companies also studied development of a system that would change alarm s tune and volume with assistance of an obstacle detection radar on august 2010 toyota began sales of an onboard device designed to automatically emit a synthesised sound of an electric motor when prius is operating as an electric vehicle at speeds up to approximately device will be available in japan through authorised toyota dealers and toyota genuine parts accessories distributors for retrofitting on third generation prius at a price of including consumption tax alert sound rises and falls in pitch according to vehicle s speed thus helping indicate vehicle s proximity and movement to nearby pedestrians toyota is planning to use other versions of device for use in hybrid electric vehicles plug in hybrids electric

pedestrian warning sound up to 30 km h other manufacturers tesla motors and think global both manufactures of electric cars already in market are assessing this safety issue ford motor company is developing a system for emitting external sounds to future hybrids and electrics including its focus bev scheduled for 2011 and a next generation hybrid and plug in hybrid vehicle planned for 2012 nancy gioia ford s director for global electrification commented that car companies should consider tones from future hybrids and electrics to avoid a cacophony of confusion on streets criticism and controversy after nissan s new sounds were publicised u s national federation of blind issued a statement saying that while it was pleased that alert existed it was unhappy that driver was able to turn it off nfb approves nissan leaf s forward motion sound but it said forward noise should also be used for reversing because intermittent sound is not as effective as a continuous sound and that car should emit warning sounds when it is idling not only when it s moving slowly nevertheless their main complaint is that they don t think driver should be able to switch sound off several anti noise and electric car advocates have opposed introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians as they argue that proposed system will only increase noise pollution they also opposed u s pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for driver robert s wall emerson of western michigan university has argued that several high end gasoline powered luxury cars are already quieter than hybrids and according to his most recent studies hybrid suvs were noisier than many internal combustion vehicles he concludes that pedestrian safety is not a hybrid issue but rather a quiet car issue market availability most of hybrids and plug in electric and hybrids sold make warning noises using a speaker system tesla motors volkswagen and bmw do not
