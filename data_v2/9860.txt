and moon is cleft asunder but if they see a sign they turn away and say this is but transient magic early traditions and stories explain this verse as a miracle performed by muhammad following requests of some members of quraysh see for example bukhari 5 28 208 211 bukhari 4 56 830 832 bukhari 6 60 345 bukhari 6 60 bukhari 6 60 387 391 muslim 39 6721 muslim 39 muslim 39 most early and medieval muslim commentators accepted authenticity of those traditions which allude to moon splitting as a historical event following verse 54 2 but if they see a sign they turn away and say this is but transient magic is taken in support of this view post classical commentator ibn kathir provides a list of early traditions mentioning incident a tradition transmitted on authority of anas bin malik states that muhammad split moon after pagan meccans asked for a miracle another tradition from malik transmitted through other chains of narrations mentions that mount nur was visible between two parts of moon mount nur is located in hijaz muslims believe that muhammad received his first revelations from god in a cave on this mountain cave of hira a tradition narrated on authority of ibn mut im with a single chain of transmission says that two parts of moon stood on two mountains this tradition further states that meccan responded by saying muhammad has taken us by his magic if he was able to take us by magic he will not be able to do so with all people traditions transmitted on authority of ibn abbas briefly mention incident and do not provide much details ibn kathir tafsir ibn kathir sura qamar verses 54 1 2 traditions transmitted on authority of abdullah bin masud describe incident as follows sahih muslim book giving description of day of judgement paradise and hell book 039 number 6725 we were along with god s messenger at mina that moon was split up into two one of its parts was behind mountain and other one was on this side of mountain god s messenger said to us bear witness to this narrative was used by some later muslims to convince others of prophethood of muhammad annemarie schimmel for example quotes following from muslim scholar qadi iyad who worked in 12th century it has not been said of any people on earth that moon was observed that night such that it could be stated that it was not split even if this had been reported from many different places so that one would have to exclude possibility that all agreed upon a lie yet we would not accept this as proof to contrary for moon is not seen in same way by different people an eclipse is visible in one country but not in other one in one place it is total in other one only partial other perspectives al zamakhshari a commentator of qur an acknowledged splitting of moon as one of muhammad s miracles but he also suggested that splitting might take place only on day of judgment muslim scholar yusuf ali provides three different interpretations of verse he holds that perhaps all three are applicable to verse moon once appeared cleft asunder at time of muhammad in order to convince unbelievers it will split again when day of judgment approaches here prophetic past tense is taken to indicate future yusuf ali connects this incident with disruption of solar system mentioned in lastly he says that verses can be metaphorical meaning that matter has become clear as moon yusuf ali meaning of noble qur an sura 54 v 1 some dissenting commentators who do not accept miracle narration believe that verse only refers to splitting of moon at day of judgment tafsir al mizan verse 54 1 ul bayan likewise m a s abdel haleem writes arabic uses past tense as if that day were already here to help reader listener imagine how it will be some traditional commentators hold view that this describes an actual event at time of prophet but it clearly refers to end of world m a s abdel haleem qur an a new translation note to 54 1 some muslim scholars argue that an astronomical event must have happened at that time which made it appear as if moon had been split in two because phenomenon was seen at least in india as well http www org islamic html one such possible lunar event could be a large asteroid hitting moon and plume and debris from strike blocking enough lunar view to make it appear as if moon had split in two a second possibility could be a celestial body passing between earth and moon and blocking some part of lunar surface for short time moreover in light of verse that was revealed at that time word saa at also means spiritual revolution so event also symbolized end of pagan arab culture and religions which used moon as their symbol or worshipped moon gods western historians such as a j wensinck and denis gril reject historicity of miracle arguing that qur an

2007 denis gril miracles encyclopedia of qur an brill 2007 debate over inviolability of heavenly bodies quran was part of debate between medieval muslim theologians and muslims philosophers over issue of inviolability of heavenly bodies philosophers held that nature was composed of four fundamental elements earth air fire and water these philosophers however held that composition of heavenly bodies were different this belief was based on observation that motion of heavenly bodies unlike that of terrestrial bodies was circular and without any beginnings or ends this appearance of eternity in heavenly bodies led philosophers to conclude that heavens were inviolable theologians on other hand proposed their own conception of terrestrial matter nature was composed of uniform atoms that were re created at every instant by god latter idea was added to defend god s omnipotence against encroachment of independent secondary causes according to this conception heavenly bodies were essentially same as terrestrial bodies and thus could be pierced in order to deal with implication of traditional understanding of quranic verse some philosophers argued that verse should be interpreted metaphorically e g verse could have referred to a partial lunar eclipse in which then earth obscured part of moon robert g portrayal of nature in a medieval qur an commentary studia islamica 2002

like two crescent shaped n s arabic letter for n whose numerical value is 50 each this would mean that thanks for miracle value of moon had increased in another place rumi according to schimmel
