rock me instead of rock you and melody just came co producers lukasz dr luke gottwald and henry circut walter ended up with writing credits on finished recording too standard operating practice now

clapping riff has been noted as similar to that of queen s 1977 single we will rock you rock me is a mid tempo pop rock song chris payne of billboard noted that song deviates from one direction s signature bubblegum pop sound a notion shared by al fox for bbc music who dubbed it vaguely rockier song s clapping riff are similar to those of queen 1977 single we will rock you according to digital sheet music published at musicnotes com by sony atv music publishing one direction s vocal range in song span from note of f3 to c5 instrumentation includes guitar strings piano lines and vocals written in key of ab major beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 84 beats per minute it also incorporates a queen referencing chorus i want you to rock me yeah i want you to hit pedal heavy metal show me you care track s lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse in regard to its double entendre grigg noted but at same time there s a vulnerability in it that s like so sweet for girls it s a little self deprecating there s not a lot of overt machismo in song i approached it like high school said hollander on first record they were freshmen innocent and wide eyed now it s sophomore year there are parties and driver s licenses and world is theirs for taking that s what i wanted to capture
