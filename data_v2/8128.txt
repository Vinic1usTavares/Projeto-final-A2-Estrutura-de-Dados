from football league and secured promotion in each of its first three seasons twice as league champions bose pp 341 3 following takeover manchester united continued to thrive with 2005 06 season seeing old trafford s capacity being expanded and a lucrative new shirt sponsorship deal signed in april 2006 with american company aig which had a large stake in a hedge fund company that helped to fund glazer s takeover of club increased revenue from tv rights to each competition club participates in as well as its various sponsorship deals also boosted club s profitability this came despite fears among many supporters that debt incurred in buying club could lead to insolvency contrary to fears of many fans glazers took action to ensure that gill and veteran manager sir alex ferguson remained at manchester united citing duo s success with club in 2006 malcolm glazer s other two sons kevin and edward and his daughter darcie were appointed to manchester united board as non executive directors refinancing debt taken on by glazers to finance takeover was split between club and family between ps265 million and ps275 million was secured against manchester united s assets putting club into debt for first time since james gibson saved them in 1931 this loan was provided by three new york hedge funds citadel och ziff capital management and perry capital total amount was ps660 million on which interest payments came to ps62 million a year club stated value of manchester united has increased in last year which is why lenders want to invest in club this move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that sir alex ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in transfer market manchester united supporters trust responded amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge interest payment is one thing but what about actual ps660 million it is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices which as we always suspected means fans will effectively be paying for someone to borrow money to own their club under terms of glazers refinancing as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 august 2010 overall interest rate on loans rose from 14 25 to 16 25 resulting in annual payments of around ps38 million on 11 january 2010 shortly before an announcement that red football s debt had increased to ps716 5 million 1 17 billion manchester united announced their intention to refinance debt through a bond issue worth approximately ps500 million they managed to raise ps504 million in just under two weeks meaning that they were able to pay off almost all of ps509 million owed to international banks bonds were issued in two tranches one with a coupon rate of 8 75 worth ps250 million and other with a coupon rate of 8 375 worth 425 million annual interest payable on bond came to approximately ps45 million per annum with bond due to mature on 1 february 2017 contained within bond prospectus were covenants that would allow glazers to filter large sums of money out of club to repay piks by 2015 these include carving out of ps95 million in cash sale and lease back of trafford training centre at carrington and ability of glazers to pay themselves 50 of consolidated net income of club every year on 16 november 2010 it was revealed that glazers were to pay off remaining ps220 million contained within pik loans by 22 november 2010 loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16 25 as club s overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda by more than five times however club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards repayment raising questions as to how glazer family had raised funds suggested methods include sale of a minority stake in club to a third party sale of some or all of family s other businesses and most likely option refinancing of piks with another loan at a lower interest rate red knights takeover

dismissed these reports as absolute rubbish given amount of debt on manchester united s books at time some analysts estimated in 2010 that any takeover bid would have had to total more than ps2 billion of which around ps1 6 billion would be needed to match glazers valuation of club double what they paid for club in 2005 however red knights publicly stated that they would only pay a fair price when their takeover bid finally came on 11 march 2010 red knights appointed nomura securities co as their advisers for their takeover bid nomura previously advised manchester united board before glazers bid to buy club red knights later admitted that they would not make a bid for club before end of 2009 10 season but it was believed that their preferred bid option would have involved retaining ps500 million bond issued by glazers two thirds of a further ps700 million would be provided by 30 40 wealthy manchester united fans with remainder provided by fund raising from ordinary fans once club was secured shares would then be offered to fans allowing them to take ownership of club despite these plans red knights put their takeover bid on hold in june 2010 citing inflated valuation aspirations in media as reason having already stated that they would only pay a sensible amount for club group was thought to have baulked at suggestion that glazers valuation of club was significantly higher than amount they were willing to pay nyse listing and shareholders in 2011 rumours surfaced that glazers intended to list a number of shares in manchester united on an asian market such as hong kong or singapore in an attempt to raise a potential ps400 600 million singapore flotation looked to be gaining traction in august 2011 when it emerged that club had applied to list its shares on singapore exchange approval for listing was given in september 2011 in june 2012 after several months with no further developments on singapore front several sources reported that

both investors and manchester united supporters regarding details of share offering although share prospectus specified that proceeds from sale would go towards paying down club s debts it was revealed that much of money would go directly to glazers furthermore holders of class a shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend and structure of share issue meant that glazers class b shares had 10 times voting power of class a shares essentially denying a controlling interest in club to anyone but glazers these issues drove down interest and forced a drop in share price from planned 16 20 each to 14 each representing a potential total sale value of 233 million ps150 million shares debuted on nyse on 10 august 2012 and initially showed a slight rise to 14 05 per share but
