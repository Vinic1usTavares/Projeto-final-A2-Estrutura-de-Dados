hiatus when mccartney started another album chaos and creation in backyard with producer nigel godrich in website constructed for album mccartney stated i actually started this album memory almost full before my last album chaos and creation in backyard released september 2005 when i was just finishing up everything concerned with chaos and had just got grammy nominations 2006 i realised i had this album to go back to and finish off so i got it out to listen to it again wondering if i would enjoy it but actually i really loved it all i did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then i began to think ok i like that track now what is wrong with it and it might be something like a drum sound so then i would re drum and see where we would get to in places it s a very personal record and a lot of it is retrospective drawing from memory like memories from being a kid from liverpool and from summers gone album is evocative emotional rocking but i can t really sum it up in one sentence recording many songs from memory almost full were from a group of songs which also included songs from chaos and creation in backyard and some intended for former nearly ended up on latter any songs that were started but not finished for chaos and creation in backyard mccartney didn t want to re do for memory almost full as sessions for album progressed mccartney wrote some more songs something that mccartney used to do when he was in beatles an early version of ever present past was recorded at either one of three following studios rak studios air studios or ocean way studios

february 2007 at rak studios as last song recorded for album album was mixed by kahne and andy wallace songs in an interview with billboard magazine in may 2007 mccartney said that album s material was in some ways a little bit retrospective some of them are of now some of them hark back to past but all of them are songs i m very proud of mccartney played mandolin on song dance tonight he comments that in searching instrument to try and find chords which i did with guitar when i was 14 probably that freshness was brought back ever present past which mccartney called personal originally started out as a song called perfect lover this early version was more folk like similar to chaos and creation in backyards friends to go perfect lover went through a minor lyrical change bridge was changed and an overhaul of its musical arrangement before it finally became ever present past track also includes references to beatles in june 2007 mccartney revealed that see your sunshine is pretty much an out and out love song for heather a lot of album was done before during and after our separation i didn t go back and take out any songs to do with her you tell me is about mccartney s memories of his previous wife linda mr bellamy sixth song on album was thought by online fans to be about mccartney s then recent divorce mccartney invited radiohead frontman thom yorke to play piano on song but he declined press ran articles claiming that yorke had snubbed mccartney but yorke later revealed that he really liked song but felt he would be unable to perform to required standard gratitude is reportedly about divorce between heather mills and mccartney album features a five song medley which in an interview with billboard magazine mccartney said that it was previously something i wanted to revisit as nobody had been doing that for a while medley was a set of intentionally written material whereas medley that mccartney had worked on on beatles abbey road was actually made up of bits we had knocking around medley starts off with vintage clothes which mccartney sat down one day to write that was looking back and looking back about life it was followed by bass led that was me which is about his school days and teachers medley as mccartney stated then progressed from there next songs are feet in clouds about inactivity while one is growing up and house of wax about life of being a celebrity final song in medley end of end was written at mccartney s cavendish avenue home while playing on his father jim s piano album title and cd casing some people mentioned that album s title memory almost full is an anagram of for my soulmate llm initials of linda louise mccartney when asked if this was intentional mccartney replied some things are best left a mystery in an interview with pitchfork media mccartney clarified i must say someone told me there is an anagram and i think it s a complete mystery because it s so complete there does appear to be an anagram in title and it s a mystery it was not intentional album s title was actually inspired by a message that came up on his mobile phone he thought phrase summed up modern life a significant proportion of cd release of memory almost full incorporated a cover insert whose top right corner was intentionally folded down to center of insert leaving cd tray visible folded down white corner covers up corner of armchair image but has artist and album names printed so that text is complete despite fold upon opening and flattening out cover insert armchair is complete but portion of text which is printed on folded down corner is not printed on front of cover leaving text incomplete this was first time such an artistic intervention occurred within a standard jewel case and at first glance had possibility of being viewed as a mis manufactured copy mccartney on cd case album artwork i really wanted to make cd a desirable object something that i know i d want to pick up from shelf something that would make people curious release and promotion album was his first for starbucks hear music record label after previously having a 45 year old relationship with capitol emi recording
