for books which continued throughout his life he went on his first foreign trip in 1748 with elements of imperial russian army as it advanced into rhineland to aid maria theresia s troops during war of austrian succession which ended with treaty of aix la chapelle 1748 this enabled poniatowski both to visit city also known as aachen and to venture into netherlands on his return journey he stopped

parents wanted to keep him out of political furore surrounding ostrogski family s land inheritance see fee tail following year he received title of of lithuania poniatowski owed his rise and influence to his family connections with powerful czartoryski family and their political faction known as familia with whom he had grown close it was familia who sent him in 1755 to saint petersburg in service of williams who had been nominated british ambassador to russia thumb right upright grand duchess catherine 1745 by l in saint petersburg williams introduced poniatowski to 26 year old catherine future empress catherine great two became lovers whatever his feelings for catherine it is likely poniatowski also saw an opportunity to use relationship for his own benefit using her influence to bolster his career poniatowski had to leave st petersburg in july 1756 due to court intrigue through combined influence of catherine of russian empress elizabeth and of chancellor ryumin poniatowski was able to rejoin russian court now as ambassador of saxony following january still in st petersburg he appears to have been a source of intrigue between various european governments some supporting his appointment others demanding his withdrawal he eventually left russian capital on 14 august 1758 poniatowski attended sejms of 1758 1760 and 1762 he continued his involvement with familia and supported a pro russian and anti prussian stance in polish politics his father died in 1762 leaving him a modest inheritance in 1762 when catherine ascended russian throne she sent him several letters professing her support for his own ascension to polish throne but asking him to stay away from st petersburg nevertheless poniatowski hoped that catherine would consider his offer of marriage an idea seen as plausible by some international observers he participated in failed plot by familia to stage a coup d etat against king augustus iii in august 1763 however catherine advised him and familia that she would not support a coup as long as king augustus was alive kingship years of hope thumb upright stanislaw august s 1764 election as king depicted by bernardo bellotto upon death of poland s king augustus iii in october 1763 lobbying began for election of new king catherine threw her support behind poniatowski russians spent about 2 5m rubles in aid of his election poniatowski s supporters and opponents engaged in some military posturing and even minor clashes in end russian army was deployed only a few miles from election sejm which met at wola near warsaw in event there were no other serious contenders and during convocation sejm on 7 september 1764 32 year old poniatowski was elected king with 5 584 votes he swore pacta conventa on 13 november and a formal coronation took place in warsaw on 25 november new king s uncles in familia would have preferred another nephew on throne prince adam kazimierz czartoryski characterized by one of his contemporaries as sinon in french debauched if not depraved but czartoryski had declined to seek office thumb left upright stanislaw august in coronation robes stanislaw august as he now styled himself combining names of his two immediate royal predecessors began his rule with only mixed support within nation it was mainly small nobility who favoured his election in his first years on throne he attempted to introduce a number of reforms he founded knights school and began to form a diplomatic service with semi permanent diplomatic representatives throughout europe russia and ottoman empire on 7 may 1765 poniatowski established order of knights of saint stanislaus in honour of saint stanislaus of krakow bishop and martyr poland s and his own patron saint as country s second order of chivalry to reward poles and others for noteworthy service to king together with familia he tried to reform ineffective system of government by reducing powers of hetmans commonwealth s top military commanders and treasurers moving them to commissions elected by sejm and accountable to king in his memoirs poniatowski called this period years of hope familia which was interested in strengthening its own power base was dissatisfied with his conciliatory attitude as he reached out to many former opponents of their policies this uneasy alliance between poniatowski and familia continued for most of first decade of his rule one of points of contention between poniatowski and familia concerned rights of religious minorities in poland poniatowski reluctantly supported a policy of religious tolerance familia was opposed to it growing rift between poniatowski and familia was exploited by russians who used issue as a pretext to intervene in commonwealth s internal politics and to destabilize country catherine had no wish to see poniatowski s reform succeed she had supported his ascent to throne to ensure commonwealth remained a virtual puppet state under russian control so his attempts to reform commonwealth s ailing government structures were a threat to status quo bar confederation and first partition of poland matters came to a head in 1766 during sejm in october of that year poniatowski attempted to push through a radical reform restricting disastrous liberum veto provision he was opposed by conservatives such as michal wielhorski who were supported by prussian and russian ambassadors and who threatened war if reform was passed dissidents supported by russians formed radom confederation abandoned by familia poniatowski s reforms failed to pass at repnin sejm named after russian ambassador nicholas repnin who promised to guarantee with all might of russian empire golden liberties of polish nobility enshrined in cardinal laws although it had abandoned cause of poniatowski s reforms familia did not receive support it expected from russians who continued to press for conservatives rights meanwhile other factions now rallied under banner of bar confederation aimed against conservatives poniatowski and russians after an unsuccessful attempt to raise allies in western europe france england and austria poniatowski and familia had no choice but to rely more heavily on russian empire which treated poland as a protectorate in war of bar confederation 1768 1772 poniatowski supported russian army s repression of bar confederation in 1770 council of bar confederation proclaimed him dethroned following year he was kidnapped by bar confederates and was briefly held prisoner outside of warsaw but he managed to escape in view of continuing weakness of polish lithuanian state austria russia and prussia collaborated to threaten military intervention in exchange for substantial territorial concessions from commonwealth a decision they made without consulting poniatowski or any other polish parties thumb 300px left tadeusz rejtan s famous gesture of protest at partition sejm as depicted by matejko although poniatowski protested against first partition of commonwealth 1772 he was powerless to do anything about it he considered abdication but decided against it during partition sejm of 1773 1775 in which russia was represented by ambassador otto von stackelberg with no allied assistance forthcoming from abroad and with armies of partitioning powers occupying warsaw to compel sejm by force of arms no alternative was available save submission to their will eventually poniatowski and sejm acceded to partition treaty at same time several other reforms were passed cardinal laws were confirmed and guaranteed by partitioning powers royal prerogative was restricted so that king lost power to confer titular roles and military promotions to appoint ministers and senators territories and crown lands would be awarded by auction sejm also created two notable institutions permanent council a government body in continuous operation and commission of national education partitioning powers intended council to be easier to control than unruly sejms and indeed it remained under influence of russian empire nevertheless it was a significant improvement on earlier commonwealth governance new legislation was guaranteed by russian empire giving it licence to interfere in commonwealth politics when legislation it favoured was threatened aftermath of partition sejm saw rise of a conservative faction opposed to permanent council seeing it as a threat to their golden freedoms this faction was supported by czartoryski family but not by poniatowski who proved to be quite adept at making council follow his wishes this marked formation of new anti royal and pro royal factions in polish politics royal faction was made up primarily of people indebted to king who planned to build their careers on service to him few were privy to his plans for reforms which were kept hidden from conservative opposition and russia poniatowski scored a political victory during sejm of 1776 which further strengthened council chancellor andrzej zamoyski was tasked with codification of polish law a project that became known as zamoyski code russia supported some but not all of 1776 reforms and to prevent poniatowski from growing too powerful it supported opposition during sejm of 1778 this marked end of poniatowski s reforms as he found himself without sufficient support to carry them through great sejm and constitution of 3 may 1791 in 1780s catherine appeared to favour poniatowski marginally over opposition but she did not support any of his plans for significant reform despite repeated attempts poniatowski failed to confederate sejms which would have made them immune to liberum veto thus although he had a majority in sejms poniatowski was unable to pass even smallest reform zamoyski code was rejected by sejm of 1780 and opposition attacks on king dominated sejms of 1782 and 1786 thumb 425px constitution of 3 may 1791 by matejko 1891 reforms became possible again in late 1780s in context of wars being waged against ottoman empire by both austrian empire and russian empire poniatowski tried to draw poland into austro russian alliance seeing a war with ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen commonwealth catherine gave permission for next sejm to be called as she considered some form of limited military alliance with poland against ottomans might be useful polish russian alliance was not implemented as in end only acceptable compromise proved unattractive to both sides however in ensuing four year sejm of 1788 92 known as great sejm poniatowski threw his lot in with reformers associated with patriotic party of stanislaw malachowski ignacy potocki and hugo kollataj and co authored constitution of 3 may 1791 constitution introduced sweeping reforms according to jacek jedruch constitution despite its liberal provisions fell somewhere below french above canadian and left general state laws for prussian states in german allgemeines fur die preussischen far behind but was no match for american constitution george sanford notes that constitution gave poland a constitutional monarchy close to english model of time according to a contemporary account poniatowski himself described it as founded principally on those of england and united states of america but avoiding faults and errors of both and adapted as much as possible to local and particular circumstances of country constitution of 3 may remained to end a work in progress a new civil and criminal code provisionally called stanislaw augustus code was among proposals poniatowski also planned a reform to improve situation of polish jews in foreign policy spurned by russia poland turned to another potential ally triple alliance represented on polish diplomatic scene primarily by kingdom of prussia which led to formation of ultimately futile polish prussian alliance pro prussian shift was not supported by poniatowski who nevertheless acceded to decision of majority of sejm deputies passing of constitution of 3 may although officially applauded by frederick william ii of prussia who sent a congratulatory note to warsaw caused further worry in prussia contacts of polish reformers with revolutionary french national assembly were seen by poland s neighbors as evidence of a conspiracy and a threat to their absolute monarchies prussian statesman ewald von hertzberg expressed fears of european conservatives poles have given coup de grace to prussian monarchy by voting in a constitution elaborating that a strong commonwealth would likely demand return of lands prussia acquired in first partition a similar sentiment was later expressed by prussian foreign minister count friedrich wilhelm von der schulenburg russia s wars with ottomans and sweden having ended catherine was furious over adoption of constitution which threatened russian influence in poland one of russia s chief foreign policy authors alexander upon learning of constitution commented that worst possible news have arrived from warsaw polish king has become almost sovereign war in defence of constitution and fall of commonwealth thumb three partitions of poland lithuania russian partition red austrian partition green and prussian partition blue shortly thereafter conservative polish nobility formed targowica confederation to overthrow constitution which they saw as a threat to traditional freedoms and privileges they enjoyed confederates aligned themselves with russia s catherine great and russian army entered poland marking start of polish russian war of 1792 also known as war in defence of constitution sejm voted to increase polish army to 100 000 men but due to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved poniatowski and reformers could field only a 37 000 man army many of them untested recruits this army under command of king s nephew jozef poniatowski and tadeusz kosciuszko managed to defeat russians or fight them to a draw on several occasions following victorious battle of zielence in which polish forces were commanded by his nephew king founded a new order order of virtuti militari to reward poles for exceptional military leadership and courage in combat despite polish requests prussia refused to honour its alliance obligations in end numerical superiority of russians was too great and defeat looked inevitable poniatowski s attempts at negotiations with russia proved futile in july 1792 when warsaw was threatened with siege by russians king came to believe that surrender was only alternative to total defeat having received assurances from russian ambassador yakov bulgakov that no territorial changes would occur a cabinet of ministers called guard of laws or guardians of law voted eight to four in favor of surrender on 24 july 1792 poniatowski joined targowica confederation polish army disintegrated many reform leaders believing their cause lost went into self exile although they hoped that poniatowski would be able to negotiate an acceptable compromise with russians as he had done in past poniatowski had not saved commonwealth however he and reformers had lost much of their influence both within country and with catherine neither were targowica confederates victorious to their surprise there ensued second partition of poland with new deputies bribed or intimidated by russian troops grodno sejm took place on 23 november 1793 it annulled all acts of great sejm including constitution faced with his powerlessness poniatowski once again considered abdication in meantime he tried to salvage whatever reforms he could final years thumb left upright portrait by elisabeth louise vigee le brun 1797 poniatowski s plans had been ruined by kosciuszko uprising king had not encouraged it but once it began he supported it seeing no other honourable option its defeat marked end of commonwealth poniatowski tried to govern country in brief period after fall of uprising but on 2 december 1794 catherine demanded he leave warsaw a request to which he acceded on 7 january 1795 leaving capital under russian military escort and settling briefly in grodno on 24 october 1795 act of final third partition of poland was signed one month and one day later on 25 november poniatowski signed his abdication reportedly his sister ludwika maria zamoyska and her daughter also his favourite niece urszula zamoyska who had been threatened with confiscation of their property had contributed to persuading him to sign abdication they feared that his refusal would lead to a russian confiscation of their properties and their ruin biogram

criticized or marginalized by authors such as szymon joachim jerzy lojek whom andrzej zahorski describes as poniatowski s most vocal critic among modern historians tadeusz karol and krystyna whereas more neutral or positive views have been expressed by pawel jasienica walerian kalinka wladyslaw konopczynski stanislaw mackiewicz emanuel rostworowski and stanislaw thumb right manuscript of constitution of 3rd may 1791 when elected to throne he was seen by many as simply an instrument for displacing saxons from throne of poland yet as british historian norman davies notes he turned out to be an ardent patriot and a convinced reformer still according to many his reforms did not go far enough leading to accusations that he was being overly cautious even indecisive a fault to which he himself admitted his decision to rely on russia has been often criticized poniatowski saw russia as a lesser evil willing to support notional independence of a weak poland within russian sphere of influence however in event russia imposed partitions of poland rather than choose to support internal reform he was accused by others of weakness and subservience even of treason especially in years following second partition during kosciuszko uprising there were rumours that polish jacobins had been planning a coup d etat and poniatowski s assassination another line of criticism alleged poor financial management on his part poniatowski actually had little personal wealth most of his income came from crown estates and monopolies his lavish patronage of arts and sciences was a major drain on royal treasury he also supported numerous public initiatives and attempted to use royal treasury to cover state s expenses when tax revenues were insufficient sejm promised several times to compensate his treasury to little practical effect nonetheless contemporary critics frequently accused him of being a spendthrift andrzej zahorski dedicated a book to a discussion of poniatowski dispute over stanislaw august spor o stanislawa augusta warsaw 1988 he notes that discourse concerning poniatowski is significantly coloured by fact that he was last king of poland king who failed to save country this failure and his prominent position rendered him a convenient scapegoat for many zahorski argues that poniatowski made error of joining targowica confederation although he wanted to preserve integrity of polish state it was far too late for that he succeeded instead in cementing damage to his own reputation for succeeding centuries remembrance thumb left poniatowski pencil
