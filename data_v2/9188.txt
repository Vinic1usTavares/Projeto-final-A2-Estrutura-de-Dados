a3 motorway is a major motorway in croatia spanning motorway connects zagreb nation s capital to slavonia region and a number of cities along sava river it represents a major east west transportation corridor in croatia and a significant part of pan european corridor x serving as a transit route between european union states and balkans apart from zagreb where a3 motorway comprises a considerable part of zagreb bypass motorway runs near a number of significant croatian cities motorway has a positive economic impact on cities and towns it connects and is an important route within croatia thumb left 250px alt six lane motorway running through rural area separated by noise barriers a3 motorway near slavonski brod motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation all intersections of a3 motorway are grade separated and motorway comprises several large stack and cloverleaf interchanges at junctions with four other motorways in croatia a1 a2 a4 and a5 there is a cloverleaf interchange is on a3 route where a11 motorway is scheduled to branch off route comprises a large number of bridges and culverts but has no tunnels because it runs through plains sava river bridge is most significant structure on a3 currently there are 21 exits and 18 rest areas operating along route a large part of motorway is tolled using a ticket system one section uses an open toll collection system zagreb bypass sections are not tolled toll is charged according to vehicle classification in croatia a3 motorway is operated by hrvatske autoceste construction of six lane motorway began in 1977 initially as zagreb bypass then continued in 1980s as an expansion of existing two lane road between zagreb and belgrade construction was suspended in first part of 1990s due to croatian war of independence and resumed in 1996 construction of entire route was completed in 2006 further development entails new exits new rest areas and reconstruction of existing motorway construction cost of a3 motorway is estimated at 7 billion croatian kuna approximately 958 9 million euro toc route description a3 motorway is a major east west motorway in croatia connecting capital of country zagreb to slavonia region where motorway follows a route parallel to sava river and further on to serbian and slovenian motorway networks as a part of road network of croatia it represents a part of european route e70 bordeaux turin ljubljana zagreb belgrade bucharest motorway has facilitated accelerated economic development in regions it connects motorway also connects to a number of other motorways in croatia from west to east a2 at jankomir interchange a1 at lucko interchange a11 at jakusevec a4 at ivanja reka and a5 at sredanci interchange thumb left 250px alt directional traffic signs placed on a gantry ahead of a motorway exit a3 motorway samobor exit motorway spans between bregana border crossing located near samobor to slovenia and bajakovo border crossing to serbia east of zupanja it represents shortest and most comfortable transit traffic route between slovenia northern italy austria switzerland and southern germany to west and serbia bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria macedonia greece and turkey to east route serves sisak via banja luka bosnia and herzegovina via d5 and stara gradiska border crossing osijek via a5 and vinkovci via a3 motorway route is complete since no extensions or alterations to route are planned by applicable legislation a3 motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length as of september 2010 motorway has 21 interchanges providing access to numerous towns and cities and croatian state road network almost all of existing interchanges are trumpet interchanges except for lucko which is a stack interchange and jankomir kosnica ivanja reka and sredanci which are cloverleaf interchanges motorway follows pan european corridor x and forms junctions with pan european corridors vb and vc within croatia an automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along motorway it consists of measuring control and signaling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary at interchanges near viaducts bridges and in zones where fog is known to occur system comprises variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions possible restrictions and other information to motorway users there are numerous rest areas along motorway providing various types of services ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations restaurants and motels a3 motorway is operated by hrvatske autoceste state owned company tasked with management construction and maintenance of croatian motorways zagreb suburban interchanges thumb right 250px alt five level stack interchange lucko interchange route between bobovica and ivanja reka interchanges inclusive serves as a part of zagreb bypass and it is therefore not tolled a3 section of bypass also comprises junctions to a number of other motorways a1 at lucko interchange a2 at jankomir interchange a11 motorway at jakusevec interchange and a4 at ivanja reka interchange two interchanges east of zagreb rugvica and kriz have recently been built to fill in gaps between ivanja reka ivanic grad and popovaca interchanges respectively even though sections east of rugvica are not parts of zagreb bypass proper they are tolled area has recently shown a rise in population as it comprises several zagreb suburbs and commuter towns consequent increase of commuter traffic volume overall increase of motorway transit traffic and plans for construction of a sava river port in rugvica warranted construction of additional interchanges a3 section of zagreb bypass is currently busiest section of croatian motorway network with annual average daily traffic aadt volume exceeding 40 000 vehicles leading to congestion of six lane bypass at peak hours especially during summer when tourist traffic adds to congestion mainline toll plazas at bobovica and ivanja reka can both become bottlenecks at such times alternative to bypass is going through city via ljubljanska and slavonska avenues despite being a shorter and a more direct route those avenues are much more congested than bypass at rush hours and they contain at grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions toll thumb left 250px alt toll plaza booths with variable traffic signs placed over toll gates kriz toll plaza a3 is a partially tolled motorway based on vehicle classification in croatia westernmost section of motorway spanning bobovica interchange and bregana border crossing is tolled at bregana toll plaza using an open toll collection system motorway sections east of ivanja reka interchange are tolled using a closed toll collection system integrated with a5 motorway as two connect at sredanci interchange forming a unified toll collection system as of october 2010 bregana toll plaza charges 5 00 kuna 0 68 euro to passenger cars and 20 00 kuna 2 74 euro to semi trailer trucks toll charged along a3 route between ivanja reka and lipovac varies depending on distance travelled and ranges from 3 00 kuna 0 41 euro to 105 00 kuna 14 38 euro for passenger cars and 10 00 kuna 1 37 euro to 350 00 kuna 47 95 euro for semi trailer trucks toll is payable in either croatian kuna or euros and by major credit cards debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by motorway operator and enc an electronic toll collection etc system which is shared at most motorways in croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas toll collected by hrvatske autoceste along a3 motorway from january to august 2009 was reported to comprise largest proportion of total toll revenue collected by company for period 889 8 million kuna approximately 121 9 million euro even though this figure is not further decomposed into individual sections of motorway it is clear from traffic volume data analysis that largest portion of toll revenue is collected on sections between zagreb and slavonski brod and especially on those sections closest to ivanja reka interchange summertime and holiday queues at ivanja reka mainline toll plaza can be considerable a problem exacerbated during usual weekend to weekend tourist stays at croatia s coastal resorts in such conditions motorway users are advised to use rugvica and ivanic grad exits ahead of ivanja reka interchange to avoid queues as of october 2010 westbound transit traffic approaching ivanja reka interchange must exit tolled motorway network since existing zagreb bypass is not tolled and then re enter another tolled motorway there are plans for outer zagreb bypass to be integrated into tolled motorway network as ultimate solution for congestion at ivanja reka toll plaza that will require reconstruction of ivanic grad interchange east of ivanja reka toll plaza history brotherhood and unity highway a modern highway connecting zagreb and belgrade was originally designed in late 1940s and construction began on april 1 1948 a substantial portion of work was carried out by youth from yugoslavia and abroad through youth work actions nearly 300 000 youth including yugoslav army soldiers took part in construction road spanning two cities called brotherhood and unity highway before 1990s was completed and officially opened on july 27 1950 despite being called a motorway it was a single carriageway two lane road with all of its intersections at grade due to a shortage of construction material wearing course was executed in various materials mostly concrete slabs with some asphalt concrete sections and even some cobblestone covered sections road was originally designed to carry approximately 9 000 vehicles per day and original construction plans provided for subsequent conversion of road into a four lane motorway in 1971 as road gradually became congested plans to build motorway on route were approved by parliament of socialist republic of croatia unlike other two motorway plans approved by croatian government zagreb split and zagreb rijeka which were cancelled after suppression of croatian spring zagreb belgrade motorway plans remained in place and an expansion of existing motorway into a dual carriageway six lane motorway with exclusively grade separated intersections proceeded additional carriageway was to be built south of existing road which was in turn to be widened to accommodate two traffic lanes and an emergency lane prewar construction and wartime use construction of a3 motorway in croatia in its present form started in 1977 when first six lane including emergency lanes sections were constructed as a part of zagreb bypass in 1979 section connecting jankomir and lucko interchanges was first to be completed section between lucko and ivanja reka interchanges was opened in 1981 marking completion of a3 section of zagreb bypass unlike remainder of motorway which was constructed by widening existing road and adding additional carriageway these two sections were built entirely from scratch first part of six lane motorway to be completed east of zagreb was section between ivanja reka and lipovljani immediately to east of present day lipovljani rest area this was done in 1980 in order to maintain flow of traffic on zagreb belgrade road during construction southern carriageway was completed first and then two way traffic was rerouted to new carriageway while old northern carriageway was widened and its pavement structure was replaced with a new one similarly as new carriageway extended further eastward at grade intersections were replaced by interchanges or flyovers in 1985 motorway was extended by to okucani and in 1986 by another to near nova gradiska two further extensions of motorway happened in 1988 and 1989 those were a extension to brodski stupnik and another one to slavonski brod and present day slavonski brod zapad west interchange in 1991 motorway reached beyond slavonski brod as it was extended once more by to slavonski brod istok east interchange further construction of motorway was suspended by onset of croatian war of independence in october 1991 a part of motorway between novska and nova gradiska became inaccessible to government of republic of croatia due to military occupation of area by forces of so called sao western slavonia consequently novska nova gradiska section was closed to all traffic on december 21 1994 negotiations led to reopening of that section for transit traffic however section remained unsafe for use as intermittent violence continued until may 1995 when area was overrun by croatian army inspection of motorway section carried out at time revealed damage to a viaduct carrying motorway over zagreb sisak vinkovci railroad and a local road near novska besides overall lack of maintenance during period pavement and a number of flyovers were damaged by artillery bombardments and flyover approach embankments were damaged where trenches were dug postwar reconstruction and completion after war construction and reconstruction work resumed on a3 motorway battle damage was first to be addressed along with removal of trenches excavated in flyover embankments similarly unexploded ordnance and minefields left around motorway had to be removed by minesweepers motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during four year wartime period unlike repairs made to viaducts and flyovers mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform in 1996 motorway was extended for first time after war this extension reached to west of present day sredanci interchange in 1999 another section was completed stretching to velika kopanica single westward extension of motorway came about in 2002 as a3 motorway was extended from jankomir westward to bregana border crossing into slovenia eastward advance of a3 motorway continued in 2002 as it was extended by to zupanja while easternmost section between zupanja and bajakovo border crossing into serbia was opened in 2006 thus completing six lane a3 motorway d4 state road was thus entirely replaced by a3 motorway total investment value of a3 motorway construction is estimated at 7 billion croatian kuna approximately 958 9 million euro making a3 least expensive motorway in croatia further construction thumb right 250px alt directional traffic signs placed on a gantry and next to a3 motorway approach to sredanci interchange since a3 motorway was completed in 2006 further construction on a3 only consists of addition of interchanges and rest areas kosnica interchange itself completed in may 2007 lacked access ramps to south to d31 state road which were in turn completed in november 2013 latest new a3 interchange jakusevec interchange on zagreb bypass is a cloverleaf interchange connecting a3 to a11 motorway and in future city of zagreb via sarajevska road interchange itself and access ramps to a11 were completed in november 2015 further construction towards sarajevska road is planned two additional a3 interchanges are in various stages of construction or planning sveta klara and ivanic grad sveta klara interchange is planned to provide another connection to city of zagreb via veceslava holjevca avenue interchange is designed as a trumpet when both jakusevec and sveta klara interchanges are completed buzin interchange was scheduled to be removed present ivanic grad interchange connects state road to a3 motorway near city of ivanic grad however interchange was scheduled to be reconstructed to accommodate a new motorway planned as an outer tolled zagreb bypass reconstruction is currently in planning stages two further interchanges are planned 1 to be located between existing nova gradiska and luzani interchanges connecting to pozega and 2 lipovljani located between existing kutina and novska interchanges these are included in applicable spatial planning documents and their designs are in development however funding is yet to be secured finally rest area is planned for a3 section of zagreb bypass between jakusevec and kosnica interchanges it is planned to be an
