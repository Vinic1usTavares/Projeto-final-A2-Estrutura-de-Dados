project rover was a united states project to develop a nuclear thermal rocket that ran from 1955 to 1973 at los alamos scientific laboratory lasl it began as a united states air force project to develop a nuclear powered upper stage for an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm project was transferred to nasa in 1958 after sputnik crisis triggered space race it was managed by space nuclear propulsion office snpo a joint agency of atomic energy commission aec and nasa project rover became part of nasa s nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application nerva project and henceforth dealt with research into nuclear rocket reactor design while nerva involved overall development and deployment of nuclear rocket engines and planning for space missions nuclear reactors for project rover were built at lasl technical area 18 ta 18 also known as pajarito canyon site they were tested there at very low power and then shipped to area 25 known as jackass flats at aec s nevada test site testing of fuel elements and other materials science was done by lasl n division at ta 46 using various ovens and later a custom test reactor nuclear furnace project rover resulted in development of three reactor types kiwi 1955 to 1964 phoebus 1964 to 1969 and pewee 1969 to 1972 kiwi and phoebus were large reactors while pewee was much smaller conforming to smaller budget available after 1968 reactors were fueled by highly enriched uranium with liquid hydrogen used as both a rocket propellant and reactor coolant nuclear graphite and beryllium were used as neutron moderators and neutron reflectors engines were controlled by drums with graphite or beryllium on one side and boron a nuclear poison on other and energy level adjusted by rotating drums because hydrogen also acts as a moderator increasing flow of propellant also increased reactor power without need to adjust drums project rover tests demonstrated that nuclear rocket engines could be shut down and restarted many times without difficulty and could be clustered if more thrust was desired their specific impulse efficiency was roughly double that of chemical rockets nuclear rocket enjoyed strong political support from influential chairman of united states congress joint committee on atomic energy senator clinton p anderson from new mexico where lasl was located and his allies senators howard cannon from nevada and margaret chase smith from maine this enabled it to survive multiple cancellation attempts that became ever more serious in cost cutting that prevailed as vietnam war escalated and after space race ended with apollo 11 moon landing projects rover and nerva were canceled over their objection in january 1973 and none of reactors developed ever flew beginnings early concepts during world war ii some scientists at manhattan project s los alamos laboratory including stan ulam frederick reines and frederic de hoffmann speculated about development of nuclear powered rockets in 1946 ulam and cornelius joseph c j everett wrote a paper in which they considered using atomic bombs as a means of rocket propulsion this would become basis for project orion in december 1945 theodore von karman and hsue shen tsien wrote a report for united states army air forces while they agreed that it was not yet practical tsien speculated that nuclear powered rockets might one day be powerful enough to launch satellites into orbit in 1947 north american aviation s laboratory published a large paper surveying many of problems involved in using nuclear reactors to power airplanes and rockets study was specifically aimed at an aircraft with a range of and a payload of and covered turbopumps structure tankage aerodynamics and nuclear reactor design they concluded that hydrogen was best as a propellant and that graphite would be best neutron moderator but assumed an operating temperature of which was beyond capabilities of available materials conclusion was that nuclear powered rockets were not yet practical public revelation of atomic energy at end of war generated a great deal of speculation and in united kingdom val cleaver chief engineer of rocket division at de havilland and leslie shepard a nuclear physicist at university of cambridge independently considered problem of nuclear rocket propulsion they became collaborators and in a series of papers published in journal of british interplanetary society in 1948 and 1949 they outlined design of a nuclear powered rocket with a solid core graphite heat exchanger they reluctantly concluded that nuclear rockets were essential for deep space exploration but not yet technically feasible bussard report in 1953 robert w bussard a physicist working on nuclear energy for propulsion of aircraft nepa project at oak ridge national laboratory wrote a detailed study he had read cleaver and shepard s work that of tsien and a february 1952 report by engineers at consolidated vultee he used data and analyses from existing chemical rockets along with specifications for existing components his calculations were based on state of art of nuclear reactors most importantly paper surveyed several ranges and payload sizes consolidated s pessimistic conclusions had partly been result of considering only a narrow range of possibilities result nuclear energy for rocket propulsion stated that use of nuclear propulsion in rockets is not limited by considerations of combustion energy and thus low molecular weight propellants such as pure hydrogen may be used while a conventional engine could produce an exhaust velocity of a hydrogen fueled nuclear engine could attain an exhaust velocity of under same conditions he proposed a graphite moderated reactor due to graphite s ability to withstand high temperatures and concluded that fuel elements would require protective cladding to withstand corrosion by hydrogen propellant bussard s study had little impact at first mainly because only 29 copies were printed and it was classified as restricted data and therefore could only be read by someone with required security clearance in december 1953 it was published in oak ridge s journal of reactor science and technology while still classified this gave it a wider circulation darol froman deputy director of los alamos scientific laboratory lasl and herbert york director of university of california radiation laboratory at livermore were interested and established committees to investigate nuclear rocket propulsion froman brought bussard out to los alamos to assist for one week per month approval robert bussard s study also attracted attention of john von neumann and he formed an ad hoc committee on nuclear propulsion of missiles mark mills assistant director at livermore was its chairman and its other members were norris bradbury from lasl edward teller and herbert york from livermore abe silverstein associate director of national advisory committee for aeronautics naca lewis flight propulsion laboratory and allen f donovan from ramo wooldridge after hearing input on various designs mills committee recommended that development proceed with aim of producing a nuclear upper stage for an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm york created a new division at livermore and bradbury created a new one called n division at los alamos under leadership of raemer schreiber to pursue it in march 1956 armed forces special weapons project afswp recommended allocating 100 million million in to nuclear rocket engine project over three years for two laboratories to conduct feasibility studies and construct of test facilities eger v murphree and herbert loper at atomic energy commission aec were more cautious atlas missile program was proceeding well and if successful would have sufficient range to hit targets in most of soviet union at same time nuclear warheads were becoming smaller lighter and more powerful case for a new technology that promised heavier payloads over longer distances seemed weak however nuclear rocket had acquired a powerful political patron in senator clinton p anderson from new mexico where lasl was located deputy chairman of united states congress joint committee on atomic energy jcae who was close to von neumann bradbury and ulam he managed to secure funding all work on nuclear rocket was consolidated at los alamos where it was given codename project rover livermore was assigned responsibility for development of nuclear ramjet which was codenamed project pluto project rover was directed by an active duty usaf officer on secondment to aec lieutenant colonel harold r schmidt he was answerable to another seconded usaf officer colonel jack l armstrong who was also in charge of pluto and systems for nuclear auxiliary power snap projects design concepts in principle design of a nuclear thermal rocket engine is quite simple a turbopump would force hydrogen through a nuclear reactor where hydrogen would be heated by reactor to very high temperatures and then exhausted through a rocket nozzle to produce thrust complicating factors were immediately apparent first was that a means had to be found of controlling reactor temperature and power output second was that a means had to be devised to hold propellant only practical means of storing hydrogen was in liquid form and this required a temperature below third was that hydrogen would be heated to a temperature of around and materials would be required that could both withstand such temperatures and resist corrosion by hydrogen thumb left cutaway diagram of kiwi rocket engine liquid hydrogen was theoretically best possible propellant but in early 1950s it was expensive and available only in small quantities in 1952 aec and national bureau of standards had opened a plant near boulder colorado to produce liquid hydrogen for thermonuclear weapons program before settling on liquid hydrogen lasl considered other propellants such as methane and ammonia ammonia was inexpensive easy to obtain liquid at and easy to pump and handle it was used in tests conducted from 1955 to 1957 however it is much heavier than liquid hydrogen which reduced engine s impulse it was also found to be even more corrosive and had undesirable neutronic properties for fuel they considered plutonium 239 uranium 235 and uranium 233 plutonium was rejected because while it forms compounds easily they could not reach temperatures as high as those of uranium uranium 233 was seriously considered as compared to uranium 235 it is slightly lighter has a higher number of neutrons per fission event and a high probability of fission it therefore held prospect of saving some weight in fuel but its radioactive properties make it more difficult to handle and in any case it was not readily available highly enriched uranium was therefore chosen for structural materials in reactor choice came down to graphite or metals of metals tungsten emerged as frontrunner but tungsten was expensive hard to fabricate and had undesirable neutronic properties to get around its neutronic properties it was proposed to use tungsten 184 which does not absorb neutrons on other hand graphite was cheap actually gets stronger at temperatures up to and sublimes rather than melts at graphite was therefore chosen to control reactor core was surrounded by control drums coated with graphite or beryllium a neutron moderator on one side and boron a neutron poison on other reactor s power output could be controlled by rotating drums to increase thrust it is sufficient to increase flow of propellant hydrogen whether in pure form or in a compound like ammonia is an efficient nuclear moderator and increasing flow also increases rate of reactions in core this increased reaction rate offsets cooling provided by hydrogen moreover as hydrogen heats up it expands so there is less in core to remove heat and temperature will level off these opposing effects stabilize reactivity and a nuclear rocket engine is therefore naturally very stable and thrust is easily controlled by varying hydrogen flow without changing control drums lasl produced a series of design concepts each with its own codename uncle tom uncle tung bloodhound and shish by 1955 it had settled on a 1 500 megawatt mw design called old black joe in 1956 this became basis of a 2 700 mw design intended to be upper stage of an icbm transfer to nasa thumb president john f kennedy right visits nuclear rocket development station to left of president are glenn seaborg chairman of us atomic energy commission senator howard cannon harold finger manager of space nuclear propulsion office and alvin c graves director of test activities at los alamos scientific laboratory by 1957 atlas missile project was proceeding well and with smaller and lighter warheads becoming available need for a nuclear upper stage had all but disappeared on 2 october 1957 aec proposed cutting project rover s budget but proposal was soon overtaken by events two days later soviet union launched sputnik 1 first artificial satellite this surprise space success fired fears and imaginations around world it demonstrated that soviet union had capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances and undermined cherished american notions of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated sputnik crisis and triggered space race a new area of competition in cold war anderson wanted to give responsibility for us space program to aec but us president dwight d eisenhower responded by creating national aeronautics and space administration nasa which absorbed naca donald a quarles deputy secretary of defense met with t keith glennan new administrator of nasa and hugh dryden his deputy on 20 august 1958 day after they were sworn into office at white house and rover was first item on agenda quarles was eager to transfer rover to nasa as project no longer had a military purpose silverstein whom glennan had brought to washington d c to organize nasa s spaceflight program had long had an interest in nuclear rocket technology he was first senior naca official to show interest in rocket research had initiated investigation into use of hydrogen as a rocket propellant was involved in aircraft nuclear propulsion anp project built nasa s plum brook reactor and had created a nuclear rocket propulsion group at lewis under harold finger responsibility for non nuclear components of project rover was officially transferred from united states air force usaf to nasa on 1 october 1958 day nasa officially became operational and assumed responsibility for us civilian space program project rover became a joint nasa aec project silverstein appointed finger from lewis to oversee nuclear rocket development on 29 august 1960 nasa created space nuclear propulsion office snpo to oversee nuclear rocket project finger was appointed as its manager with milton klein from aec as his deputy a formal agreement between nasa and aec on management of nuclear rocket engine contracts was signed by nasa deputy administrator robert seamans and aec general manager alvin luedecke on 1 february 1961 this was followed by an inter agency agreement on program for development of space nuclear rocket propulsion project rover which they signed on 28 july 1961 snpo also assumed responsibility for snap with armstrong becoming assistant to director of reactor development division at aec and lieutenant colonel g m anderson formerly snap project officer in disbanded aircraft nuclear propulsion office anpo became chief of snap branch in new division on 25 may 1961 president john f kennedy addressed a joint session of congress first he announced i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving goal before this decade is out of landing a man on moon and returning him safely to earth he then went on to say secondly an additional 23 million dollars together with 7 million dollars already available will accelerate development of rover nuclear rocket this gives promise of someday providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space perhaps beyond moon perhaps to very end of solar system itself test site thumb left upright 1 5 arrangement of facilities at nuclear rocket development station in jackass flats nuclear reactors for project rover were built at lasl technical area 18 ta 18 also known as pajarito site fuel and internal engine components were fabricated in sigma complex at los alamos testing of fuel elements and other materials science was done by lasl n division at ta 46 using various ovens and later a custom test reactor nuclear furnace staff from lasl test j and chemical metallurgy baker cmb divisions also participated in project rover two reactors were built for each engine one for zero power critical experiments at los alamos and another used for full power testing reactors were tested at very low power before being shipped to test site in 1956 aec allocated of an area known as jackass flats in area 25 of nevada test site for use by project rover work commenced on test facilities there in mid 1957 all materials and supplies had to be brought in from las vegas test cell a consisted of a farm of hydrogen gas bottles and a concrete wall thick to protect electronic instrumentation from radiation from reactor control room was located away plastic coating on control cables was chewed by burrowing rodents and had to be replaced reactor was test fired with its exhaust plume in air so that any radioactive fission products picked up from core could be safely dispersed reactor maintenance and disassembly building r mad was in most respects a typical hot cell used by nuclear industry with thick concrete walls lead glass viewing windows and remote manipulation arms it was exceptional only for its size long and high this allowed engine to be moved in and out on a railroad car jackass and western railroad as it was light heartedly described was said to be world s shortest and slowest railroad there were two locomotives electric l 1 which was remotely controlled and diesel electric l 2 which was manually controlled with radiation shielding around cab test cell c was supposed to be completed in 1960 but nasa and aec did not request funds for additional construction that year anderson provided them anyway then there were construction delays forcing him to personally intervene in august 1961 soviet union ended nuclear test moratorium that had been in place since november 1958 so kennedy resumed us testing in september with a second crash program at nevada test site labor became scarce and there was a strike thumb right test cell c with its giant cryogenic storage dewars when that ended workers had to come to grips with difficulties of dealing with hydrogen which could leak through microscopic holes too small to permit passage of other fluids on 7 november 1961 a minor accident caused a violent hydrogen release complex finally became operational in 1964 snpo envisaged construction of a 20 000 mw nuclear rocket engine so construction supervisor keith boyer had chicago bridge iron company construct two gigantic cryogenic storage dewars an engine maintenance and disassembly building e mad was added it was larger than a football field with thick concrete walls and shield bays where engines could be assembled and disassembled there was also an engine test stand ets 1 two more were planned there was also a radioactive material storage facility rmsf this was a site roughly equidistant from e mad test cell c and ets 1 it was enclosed by a cyclone wire fence with quartz perimeter lighting single track railroad that connected facilities carried one branch through a single main gate into storage area which then separated into seven spurs two spurs led into bunkers facility was used to store a wide variety of radioactively contaminated items in february 1962 nasa announced establishment of nuclear rocket development station nrds at jackass flats and in june an snpo branch was established at las vegas snpo n to manage it construction workers were housed in mercury nevada later thirty trailers were brought to jackass flats to create a village named boyerville after supervisor keith boyer kiwi first phase of project rover kiwi was named after flightless bird of same name from new zealand as kiwi rocket engines were not intended to fly either their function was to verify design and test behavior of materials used kiwi program developed a series of non flyable test nuclear engines with primary focus on improving technology of hydrogen cooled reactors between 1959 and 1964 a total of eight reactors were built and tested kiwi was considered to have served as a proof of concept for nuclear rocket engines kiwi a thumb left raemer schreiber with a project rover poster in 1959 first test of kiwi a first model of kiwi rocket engine was conducted at jackass flats on 1 july 1959 kiwi a had a cylindrical core high and in diameter a central island contained heavy water that acted both as a coolant and as a moderator to reduce amount of uranium oxide required control rods were located inside island which was surrounded by 960 graphite fuel plates loaded with uranium oxide fuel particles and a layer of 240 graphite plates core was surrounded by of graphite wool moderator and encased in an aluminum shell gaseous hydrogen was used as a propellant at a flow rate of intended to produce 100 mw engine ran at 70 mw for 5 minutes core temperature was much higher than expected up to due to cracking of graphite plates which was enough to cause some of fuel to melt a series of improvements were made for next test on 8 july 1960 to create an engine known as kiwi a prime fuel elements were extruded into cylinders and coated with niobium carbide to resist corrosion six were stacked end to end and then placed in seven holes in graphite modules to create long fuel modules this time reactor attained 88 mw for 307 seconds with an average core exit gas temperature of 2 178 k test was marred by three core module failures but majority suffered little or no damage test was observed by anderson and delegates to 1960 democratic national convention at convention anderson added support for nuclear rockets to democratic party platform third and final test of kiwi a series was conducted on 19 october 1960 kiwi a3 engine used long cylindrical fuel elements in niobium carbide liners test plan called for engine to be run at 50 mw half power for 106 seconds and then at 92 mw for 250 seconds 50 mw power level was achieved with a propellant flow of but exit gas temperature was 1 861 k which was over 300 k higher than expected after 159 seconds power was increased to 90 mw to stabilize exit gas temperature at 2 173 k fuel rate was increased to it was later discovered that neutronic power measuring system was incorrectly calibrated and engine was actually run at an average of 112 5 mw for 259 seconds well above its design capacity despite this core suffered less damage than in kiwi a prime test kiwi a was considered a success as a proof of concept for nuclear rocket engines it demonstrated that hydrogen could be heated in a nuclear reactor to temperatures required for space propulsion and that reactor could be controlled finger went ahead and called for bids from industry for development of nasa s nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application nerva based upon kiwi engine design rover henceforth became part of nerva while rover dealt with research into nuclear rocket reactor design nerva involved development and deployment of nuclear rocket engines and planning of space missions kiwi b thumb director of los alamos national laboratory norris bradbury left in front of kiwi b4 a reactor lasl s original objective had been a 10 000 mw nuclear rocket engine capable of launching into a orbit this engine was codenamed condor after large flying birds in contrast to small flightless kiwi however in october 1958 nasa had studied putting a nuclear upper stage on a titan i missile and concluded that in this configuration a 1 000 mw reactor upper stage could put into orbit this configuration was used in studies of nova and became goal of project rover lasl planned to conduct two tests with kiwi b an intermediate 1 000 mw design in 1961 and 1962 followed by two tests of kiwi c a prototype engine in 1963 and have a reactor in flight test rift of a production engine in 1964 for kiwi b lasl made several design changes to get required higher performance central core was eliminated number of coolant holes in each hexagonal fuel element was increased from four to seven and graphite reflector was replaced with a thick beryllium one although beryllium was more expensive more difficult to fabricate and highly toxic it was also much lighter resulting in a saving of due to delay in getting test cell c ready some features intended for kiwi c were also incorporated in kiwi b2 these included a nozzle cooled by liquid hydrogen instead of water a new rocketdyne turbopump and a bootstrap start in which reactor was started up under its own power only test of kiwi b1a last test to use gaseous hydrogen instead of liquid was initially scheduled for 7 november 1961 on morning of test a leaking valve resulted in a violent hydrogen explosion that blew out walls of shed and injured several workers many suffered ruptured eardrums and one fractured a heel bone reactor was undamaged but there was extensive damage to test car and instrumentation resulting in test being postponed for a month a second attempt on 6 december was aborted when it was discovered that many of diagnostic thermocouples had been installed backward finally on 7 december test got under way it was intended to run engine at 270 mw for 300 seconds but test was after only 36 seconds at 225 mw because hydrogen fires started to appear however all thermocouples performed correctly so a great deal of useful data was obtained average hydrogen mass flow during full power portion of experiment was lasl next intended to test kiwi b2 but structural flaws were found that required a redesign attention then switched to b4 a more radical design but when they tried to put fuel clusters into core clusters were found to have too many neutrons and it was feared that reactor might unexpectedly start up problem was traced to absorption of water from normally dry new mexico air during storage it was corrected by adding more neutron poison after this fuel elements were stored in an inert atmosphere n division then decided to test with backup b1 engine b1b despite grave doubts about it based on results of b1a test in order to obtain more data on performance and behavior of liquid hydrogen on startup on 1 september 1962 core shook but reached 880 mw flashes of light around nozzle indicated that fuel pellets were being ejected it was later determined that eleven had been rather than shut down testers rotated drums to compensate and were able to continue running at full power for a few minutes before a sensor blew and started a fire and engine was shut down most but not all of test objectives were met next test of series was of kiwi b4a on 30 november 1962 a flame flash was observed when reactor reached 120 mw power was increased to 210 mw and held there for 37 seconds power was then increased to 450 mw but flashes then became frequent and engine was shut down after 13 seconds after test it was discovered that 97 of fuel elements were broken difficulties of using liquid hydrogen were appreciated and cause of vibration and failures was diagnosed as hydrogen leaking into gap between core and pressure vessel unlike a chemical engine that would likely have blown up after suffering damage engine remained stable and controllable throughout tests demonstrated that a nuclear rocket engine would be rugged and reliable in space thumb left kiwi a prime is test fired kennedy visited los alamos on 7 december 1962 for a briefing on project rover it was first time a us president had visited a nuclear weapons laboratory he brought with him a large entourage that included lyndon johnson mcgeorge bundy jerome wiesner harold brown donald hornig glenn seaborg robert seamans harold finger and clinton anderson next day they flew to jackass flats making kennedy only president to ever visit a nuclear test site project rover had received 187 million in 1962 and aec and nasa were asking for another 360 million in 1963 kennedy drew attention to his administration s budgetary difficulties and his officials and advisors debated future of project rover and space program in general finger assembled a team of vibration specialists from other nasa centers and along with staff from lasl aerojet and westinghouse conducted a series of cold flow reactor tests using fuel elements without fissionable material nitrogen helium and hydrogen gas was pumped through engine to induce vibrations it was determined that they were caused by instability in way liquid flowed through clearance gaps between adjacent fuel elements a series of minor design changes were made to address vibration problem in kiwi b4d test on 13 may 1964 reactor was automatically started and briefly run at full power 990 mw with no vibration problems although test had to be terminated after 64 seconds when nozzle tubes ruptured and caused a hydrogen leak around nozzle that started a fire cooldown was performed with both hydrogen and of nitrogen gas on inspection after test no damaged fuel elements were found final test was kiwi b4e test on 28 august in which reactor was operated for twelve minutes eight of which were at full power 937 mw this was first test to use uranium carbide pellets instead of uranium oxide with a niobium carbide coating these were found to oxidize on heating causing a loss of carbon in form of carbon monoxide gas to minimize this particles were made larger in diameter and given a protective coating of pyrolytic graphite on 10 september kiwi b4e was restarted and run at 882 mw for two and a half minutes demonstrating ability of a nuclear rocket engine to be shut down and restarted in september 1964 tests were conducted with a kiwi b4 engine and parka a kiwi reactor used for testing at los alamos two reactors were run and apart and measurements taken of reactivity these tests showed that neutrons produced by one reactor did indeed cause fissions in another but that effect was negligible 3 12 and 24 cents respectively tests demonstrated that adjacent nuclear rocket engines would not interfere with each other and could therefore be clustered just as chemical ones often were phoebus thumb right phoebus nuclear rocket engine on jackass and western railroad next step in lasl s research program was to build a larger reactor size of core determines how much hydrogen which is necessary for cooling can be pushed through it and how much uranium fuel can be loaded into it in 1960 lasl began planning a 4 000 mw reactor with an core as a successor to kiwi lasl decided to name it phoebe after greek moon goddess another nuclear weapon project already had that name though so it was changed to phoebus an alternative name for apollo phoebus ran into opposition from snpo which wanted a 20 000 mw reactor lasl thought that difficulties of building and testing such a large reactor were being taken too lightly just to build 4 000 mw design required a new nozzle and improved turbopump from rocketdyne a prolonged bureaucratic conflict ensued in march 1963 snpo and marshall space flight center msfc commissioned space technology laboratories stl to produce a report on what kind of nuclear rocket engine would be required for possible missions between 1975 and 1990 these missions included early manned planetary interplanetary round trip expeditions empire planetary swingbys and flybys and a lunar shuttle conclusion of this nine volume report which was delivered in march 1965 and of a follow up study was that these missions could be carried out with a 4 100 mw engine with a specific impulse of this was considerably smaller than had originally been thought necessary from this emerged a specification for a 5 000 mw nuclear rocket engine which became known as nerva ii lasl and snpo came to an agreement that lasl would build two versions of phoebus small phoebus i with an core for testing advanced fuels materials and concepts and larger phoebus ii that would serve as a prototype for nerva ii both would be based on kiwi focus was placed on achieving more power than was possible with kiwi units and maintaining maximum power for a longer duration work on phoebus i was started in 1963 with a total of three engines being built called 1a 1b and 1c thumb left upright phoebus in national atomic testing museum in las vegas phoebus 1a was tested on 25 june 1965 and run at full power 1 090 mw for ten and a half minutes unfortunately intense radiation environment caused one of capacitance gauges to produce erroneous readings when confronted by one gauge that said that hydrogen propellant tank was nearly empty and another that said that it was quarter full and unsure which was correct technicians in control room chose to believe one that said it was quarter full this was wrong choice tank was indeed nearly empty and propellant ran dry without liquid hydrogen to cool it engine operating at quickly overheated and exploded about a fifth of fuel was ejected most of rest melted test area was left for six weeks to give highly radioactive fission products time to decay a grader with a rubber squeegee on its plow was used to pile up contaminated dirt so it could be scooped up when this did not work a vacuum cleaner was used to pick up dirt fragments on test pad were initially collected by a robot but this was too slow and men in protective suits were used picking up pieces with tongs and dropping then into paint cans surrounded by lead and mounted on small wheeled dollies that took care of main contamination rest was chipped swept scrubbed washed or painted away whole decontamination effort took four hundred people two months to complete and cost 50 000 average dose of radiation received by clean up workers was while maximum was lasl limited its employees to per annum next test was of phoebus 1b it was powered up on 10 february 1967 and run at 588 mw for two and a half minutes to avoid a repeat of mishap that had occurred to phoebus 1a a high pressure cryogenic storage dewar was installed to provide an emergency liquid hydrogen supply in event that there was a failure of primary propellant supply system a second test was conducted on 23 february 1967 when it was run for 46 minutes of which 30 minutes were above 1 250 mw and a maximum power of 1 450 mw and gas temperature of was achieved test was a success but some corrosion was found this was followed by a test of larger phoebus 2a a preliminary low power 2 000 mw run was conducted on 8 june 1968 then a full power run on 26 june engine was operated for 32 minutes 12 5 minutes of which was above 4 000 mw and a peak power of 4 082 mw was reached at this point chamber temperature was and total flow rate was maximum power level could not be reached because at this point temperatures of clamp band segments connecting core to pressure vessel reached their limit of a third run was conducted on 18 july reaching a power of 1 280 mw a fourth later that day with a power of around 3 500 mw a puzzling anomaly was that reactivity was lower than expected liquid hydrogen might have beryllium reflector causing it to somehow lose some of its moderating properties alternatively there are two spin isomers of hydrogen parahydrogen is a neutron moderator but orthohydrogen is a poison and perhaps high neutron flux had changed some of parahydrogen to orthohydrogen pewee pewee was third phase of project rover lasl reverted to bird names naming it after north american pewee it was small easy to test and a convenient size for uncrewed scientific interplanetary missions or small nuclear tugs its main purpose was to test advanced fuel elements without expense of a full sized engine pewee took only nineteen months to develop from when snpo authorized it in june 1967 to its first full scale test in december 1968 pewee had a core containing 402 fuel elements and 132 support elements of 402 fuel elements 267 were fabricated by lasl 124 by westinghouse laboratory and 11 at aec s y 12 national security complex most were coated with niobium carbide but some were coated with zirconium carbide instead most also had a protective molybdenum coating there were concerns that a reactor so small might not achieve criticality so zirconium hydride a good moderator was added and thickness of beryllium reflector was increased to there were nine control drums whole reactor including aluminum pressure vessel weighed pewee 1 was started up three times for check out on 15 november 1968 for a short duration test on 21 november and for a full power endurance test on 4 december full power test had two holds during which reactor was run at 503 mw 1 2 mw per fuel element average exit gas temperature was highest ever recorded by project rover chamber temperature was another record test showed that zircon carbide was more effective at preventing corrosion than niobium carbide no particular effort had been made to maximize specific impulse that not being reactor s purpose but pewee achieved a vacuum specific impulse of well above target for nerva so too was average power density of peak density reached this was 20 higher than phoebus 2a and conclusion was that it might be possible to build a lighter yet more powerful engine still lasl took a year to modify pewee design to solve problem of overheating in 1970 pewee 2 was readied in test cell c for a series of tests lasl planned to do twelve full power runs at each lasting for ten minutes with a cooldown to between each test snpo ordered lasl to return pewee to e mad problem was national environmental policy act nepa which president richard nixon had signed into law on 1 january 1970 snpo believed that radioactive emissions were well within guidelines and would have no adverse environmental effects but an environmental group claimed otherwise snpo prepared a full environmental impact study for upcoming nuclear furnace tests in meantime lasl planned a pewee 3 test this would be tested horizontally with a scrubber to remove fission products from exhaust plume it also planned a pewee 4 to test fuels and a pewee 5 to test afterburners none of these tests were ever carried out nuclear furnace thumb upright 1 75 two of fuel forms tested by project rover pyrolytic carbon coated uranium carbide fuel particles dispersed in a graphite substrate and composite which consisted of a uranium carbide zirconium carbide dispersion in graphite substrate nuclear furnace was a small reactor only a tenth of size of pewee that was intended to provide an inexpensive means of conducting tests originally it was to be used at los alamos but cost of creating a suitable test site was greater than that of using test cell c it had a tiny core long and in diameter that held 49 hexagonal fuel elements of these 47 were uranium carbide zirconium carbide composite fuel cells and two contained a seven element cluster of single hole pure uranium zirconium carbide fuel cells neither type had previously been tested in a nuclear rocket propulsion reactor in all this was about 5 kg of highly enriched 93 uranium 235 to achieve criticality with so little fuel beryllium reflector was over thick each fuel cell had its own cooling and moderating water jacket gaseous hydrogen was used instead of liquid to save money a scrubber was developed objectives of nuclear furnace tests were to verify design and test new composite fuels between 29 june and 27 july 1972 nf 1 was operated four times at full power 44 mw and a fuel exit gas temperature of for a total of 108 8 minutes nf 1 was operated 121 1 minutes with a fuel exit gas temperature above it also achieved an average power density with temperatures up to scrubber worked well although some krypton 85 leaked environmental protection agency was able to detect minute amounts but none outside test range tests indicated that composite fuel cells would be good for two to six hours operation at which carbide fuels would give similar performance at assuming that problems with cracking could be overcome with improved design for ten hours of operation graphite matrix would be limited to composite could go up to and pure carbide to thus test program ended with three viable forms of fuel cell safety tests in may 1961 kennedy gave his approval for reactor in flight tests rift in response lasl established a rover flight safety office and snpo created a rover flight safety panel which supported rift nasa s rift planning called for up to four reactors to fall into atlantic ocean lasl had to determine what would happen when a reactor hit water at several thousand kilometers per hour in particular it needed to know whether it would go critical or explode when flooded with seawater a neutron moderator there was also concern about what would happen when it sank down to bottom of atlantic where it would be under a crushing pressure possible impact on marine life and indeed what marine life was down there all had to be considered thumb left upright a modified kiwi nuclear reactor was deliberately destroyed in kiwi tnt test lasl started by immersing fuel elements in water it then went on to conduct a simulated water entry test swet during which a piston was used to force water into a reactor as fast as possible to simulate an impact a mock reactor was dropped onto concrete from a height of it bounced in air pressure vessel was dented and many fuel elements were cracked but calculations showed that it would neither go critical nor explode however rift involved nerva sitting atop a saturn v rocket high to find out what would happen if booster exploded on launch pad a mock reactor was slammed into a concrete wall using a rocket sled core was compressed by 5 and calculations showed that core would indeed go critical and explode with a force equivalent to about of high explosive which would likely be negligible compared to damage caused by an exploding booster disturbingly this was much lower than that was predicted theoretically indicating that mathematical modeling was deficient when it was determined that nerva was not required for apollo and would therefore not be needed until 1970s rift was postponed and then canceled entirely in december 1963 although its reinstatement was frequently discussed it never occurred this eliminated need for further swet but concerns remained about safety of nuclear rocket engines while an impact or an explosion could not cause a nuclear explosion lasl was concerned about what would happen if reactor overheated a test was devised to create most devastating catastrophe possible a special test was devised known as kiwi tnt normally control drums rotated at a maximum speed of 45deg per second to fully open position at 180deg this was too slow for devastating explosion sought so for kiwi tnt they were modified to rotate at 4 000deg per second test was carried out on 12 january 1965 kiwi tnt was mounted on a flatbed railroad car nicknamed toonerville trolley and parked from test cell c drums were rotated to maximum setting at 4 000deg per second and heat vaporized some of graphite resulting in a colorful explosion that sent fuel elements flying through air followed by a highly radioactive cloud with radioactivity estimated at most of radioactivity in cloud was in form of caesium 138 strontium 92 iodine 134 zirconium 97 and krypton 88 which have short half lives measured in minutes or hours cloud rose into air and drifted southwest eventually blowing over los angeles and out to sea it was tracked by two public health service phs aircraft which took samples phs had issued film badge dosimeters to people living on edge of test area and took milk samples from dairy farms in cloud s path they revealed that exposure to people living outside nevada test site was negligible radioactive fallout on ground also dissipated rapidly search teams scoured area collecting debris largest was a piece of pressure vessel weighing which was found away another weighing was found away thumb right e mad facility explosion was relatively small estimated as being equivalent of of black powder it was far less violent than an explosion of tnt and hence large pieces that were found test showed that reactor could not be destroyed in space by blowing it up into small pieces so another method had to be found for disposing of it at end of a space mission lasl decided to take advantage of engine s to dispose of a nuclear rocket by firing it into a high orbit so it either left solar system entirely or returned centuries later by which time most of radioactivity would have decayed away soviet union protested test claiming that it was a nuclear test in violation of partial nuclear test ban treaty but us replied that it was a subcritical test involving no explosion however state department was very unhappy with lasl s kiwi tnt designation as this implied an explosion and it made it harder to charge soviets with violating treaty there were three fatal accidents during project rover one worker was killed in a motor vehicle accident another died from burns after tipping gasoline on classified computer tapes and setting them alight to dispose of them a third entered a nitrogen tank and was asphyxiated cancellation rover was always a controversial project and defending it from critics required a series of bureaucratic and political battles in 1961 bureau of budget bob and president s science advisory committee psac mounted a challenge to rover on grounds of its cost but this push was defeated by jcae where rover enjoyed staunch support of anderson and howard cannon in senate and overton brooks and james g fulton in house psac and bob tried again in 1964 nasa s budget requests were cut but rover emerged intact in late 1960s rising cost of vietnam war put increased pressure on budgets newly elected members of house looked at rover and nerva with a critical eye seeing it as a gateway to an expensive open ended post apollo deep space exploration program but rover retained influential support from anderson cannon and margaret chase smith from maine in senate and fulton and george p miller who replaced brooks as chairman of united states house committee on science space and technology on latter s death in september 1961 in house congress defunded nerva ii in 1967 budget but johnson needed anderson s support for his medicare legislation and on 7 february 1967 agreed to provide money for nerva ii from his own contingency fund klein who had succeeded finger as head of snpo in 1967 faced two hours of questioning on nerva ii before house committee on science and astronautics which had cut nasa budget defunding nerva ii saved 400 million mainly in new facilities that would be required to test it aec and nasa acquiesced because it had been demonstrated that nerva i could perform missions expected of nerva ii thumb left upright us senator clinton p anderson with a kiwi rocket nerva had many potential missions nasa considered using saturn v and nerva on a grand tour of solar system a rare alignment of planets that happens every 174 years occurred between 1976 and 1980 allowing a spacecraft to visit jupiter saturn uranus and neptune with nerva that spacecraft could weigh up to this was assuming nerva had a specific impulse of only was more likely and with that it could place a space station size of skylab into orbit around moon repeat trips to moon could be made with nerva powering a nuclear shuttle there was also mission to mars which klein diplomatically avoided mentioning knowing that even in wake of apollo 11 moon landing idea was unpopular with congress and general public cost cutting pressure increased after nixon replaced johnson as president in 1969 nasa program funding was reduced in 1969 budget shutting down saturn v production line but nerva remained klein endorsed a plan whereby space shuttle lifted a nerva engine into orbit then returned for fuel and payload this could be repeated as nerva engine was restartable nerva retained steadfast support of anderson cannon and smith but anderson was aging and tiring and now delegated many of his duties to cannon nerva received 88 million in fiscal year fy 1970 and 85 million in fy 1971 with funds coming jointly from nasa and aec when nixon tried to cancel nerva in 1971 anderson s and smith s votes killed nixon s pet project boeing 2707 supersonic transport it was a stunning defeat for president in budget for fy 1972 funding for shuttle was cut but nerva survived although its budget request was just 17 4 million congress allocated 69 million nixon only spent 29 million of it in 1972 congress again supported nerva a bi partisan coalition headed by smith and cannon appropriated 100 million for it a nerva engine that would fit inside shuttle s cargo bay was estimated to cost about 250 million over a decade they added a stipulation that there would be no more reprogramming nerva funds to pay for other nasa activities nixon administration decided to cancel nerva anyway on 5 january 1973 nasa announced that nerva and therefore rover was terminated staff at lasl and snpo were stunned project to build a small nerva that could be carried on board space shuttle had been proceeding well layoffs began immediately and snpo was abolished in june after 17 years of research and development projects rover and nerva had spent about 1 4 billion but no nuclear powered rocket has ever flown legacy nuclear rocket propulsion in 1983 strategic defense initiative star wars identified missions that could benefit from rockets more powerful than chemical rockets and some that could only be undertaken by such rockets a nuclear propulsion project sp 100 was created in february 1983 with aim of developing a 100 kw nuclear rocket system concept incorporated a pebble bed reactor a concept developed by james r powell at brookhaven national laboratory which promised higher temperatures and improved performance over nerva from 1987 to 1991 it was funded as a secret project codenamed project timber wind proposed rocket was later expanded into a larger design after project was transferred to space nuclear thermal propulsion sntp program at air force phillips laboratory in october 1991 nasa conducted studies as part of its space exploration initiative sei but felt that sntp offered insufficient improvement over nuclear rockets developed by project rover and was not required by any sei missions sntp program was terminated in january 1994 after about 200 million was spent an engine for interplanetary travel from earth orbit to mars orbit and back was studied in 2013 at msfc with a focus on nuclear thermal rocket engines since they are at least twice as efficient as most advanced chemical engines they allow quicker transfer times and increased cargo capacity shorter flight duration estimated at 3 4 months with nuclear engines compared to 8 9 months using chemical engines would reduce crew exposure to potentially harmful and difficult to shield cosmic rays nuclear engines like pewee of project rover were selected in mars design reference architecture dra and on 22 may 2019 congress approved 125 million in funding for development of nuclear rockets site rehabilitation thumb right r mad demolition in december 2009 with closure of snpo nevada operations office of department of energy assumed responsibility for jackass flats a radiological survey was carried out in 1973 and 1974 followed by a cleanup of severe radioactive at rmsf r mad ets 1 and test cells a and c e mad was still in use and was not part of effort between 1978 and 1984 1 624 million was spent on clean up activities highly contaminated items removed included a phoebus nozzle and two and two reactor shields from r mad these were taken to radioactive waste management sites at area 3 and area 5 some of contaminated soil and of contaminated metal and concrete were also carted away for disposal another of clean metal and equipment were removed as salvage test cell a was demolished between december 2004 and july 2005 this involved removal of toxic and hazardous materials that included asbestos and foil surrounding electrical conduits that contained levels of cadmium above landfill limits paint was found to contain polychlorinated biphenyl pcb but not above landfill limits about of lead bricks were found in various places and removed there were also some traces of uranium and plutonium main challenge was demolition of concrete shield wall containing traces of europium 151 europium 153 and cobalt 59 which neutron absorption transforms into radioactive europium 152 europium 154 and cobalt 60 care had to be taken to avoid creating hazardous radioactive dust during demolition of wall which was carried out with explosives demolition of r mad facility commenced
