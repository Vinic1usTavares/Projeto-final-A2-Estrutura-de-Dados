few weeks before outbreak of second world war morgan was promoted to temporary rank of brigadier and assumed command of 1st support group of major general roger evans s 1st armoured division when 1st support group was shipped to france shortly after german invasion of france in mid may 1940 it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions as a result morgan s command included only a force of royal engineers and a territorial army ta battalion of royal welch fusiliers which was in process of converting to an anti aircraft anti tank regiment and armed only with anti tank guns his group was therefore in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting division s armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce 51st highland infantry division south of river somme during a confused retreat most of 1st support group was captured along with 51st division at saint valery en caux but remainder including morgan got away and were evacuated to

his american superior lieutenant general dwight d eisenhower on 12 november morgan s permanent rank was advanced from colonel to major general with seniority to 13 november 1941 morgan s i corps headquarters was later designated force 125 and was given command of walter clutterbuck s 1st and john hawkesworth s 4th divisions and task of dealing with a german thrust through spain to gibraltar this operation proved unnecessary and morgan s two divisions were sent to north africa while he was directed to plan invasion of sardinia in time this was abandoned in favour of allied invasion of sicily operation husky which took place in july 1943 i corps headquarters remained in united kingdom whole time located at 1 cumberland near marble arch with headquarters mess in lyons marble arch corner house however it gained considerable experience in operational planning morgan s rank of lieutenant general was made temporary on 14 may 1943 and he was appointed a commander of order of bath cb on 2 june cossac at casablanca conference in january 1943 combined chiefs of staff agreed to establish a staff to plan operations in north west europe in 1944 it was envisaged that supreme allied commander would be british and usual practice was for commander and chief of staff to be of same nationality so it was decided to appoint a british officer for role of chief of staff to supreme allied commander designate cossac with an american deputy in march 1943 morgan became cossac brigadier general ray barker became his american deputy initially morgan s staff consisted of an aide two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from i corps headquarters morgan established his headquarters in norfolk house at 31 st james s square however by october 1943 it was clearly too small for cossac needs which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks in november and december part of staff moved to south rotunda a structure that had originally been fitted up as an anti invasion base which was connected to various ministries by whitehall tunnel other staff were accommodated at 80 pall mall thumb 300px left senior allied officers at shaef headquarters in rheims

german forces pinned to coast operation rankin a plan for measures to be taken in case of a sudden german collapse and operation overlord a plan for a full scale assault on north western europe morgan and his staff worked on overlord plan throughout june and first half of july 1943 he presented it to chiefs of staff committee on 15 july plan set forth in detail conditions under which assault could be made area where a landing would be feasible and means by which a lodgement on continent would be developed on 28 july a group of cossac staff headed by barker travelled to washington d c to present overlord plan to u s joint chiefs of staff and to confer with u s war department about troop basis for operation and issues related to its civil affairs and logistics aspects missions were also exchanged with general dwight d eisenhower s allied force headquarters afhq in algiers to coordinate plans of offensive action in mediterranean and north western europe in 1944 in october and november morgan went to washington to discuss operation with combined chiefs of staff accompanied only by major general nevil brownjohn and an aide morgan met with general george marshall chief of staff of united states army who instructed him to proceed with planning on basis that marshall would be supreme allied commander and morgan his chief of staff morgan met with president franklin d roosevelt at white house roosevelt turned down morgan s request for services of anthony joseph drexel biddle jr to assist with civil affairs and also cast doubt on whether marshall could be spared to become supreme allied commander while in united states morgan visited gettysburg battlefield and training camps at camp carrabelle fort benning camp mackall and fort bragg combined chiefs of staff authorised morgan to issue orders in name of supreme allied commander to commanders in chief of air naval and land forces even though they outranked him in december 1943 when general sir bernard montgomery who had just arrived in england after commanding british eighth army on italian front was appointed c in c land forces for invasion he declared that morgan s original plans were unworkable they had originally been limited by availability of landing craft but montgomery insisted it would require more men attacking over a wider front ultimately more landing craft were obtained and invasion was scaled up to montgomery s satisfaction at cost of a month s delay and a reduction in southern france operation however all key features of morgan s plan remained choice of normandy as assault area use of mulberry harbours deployment of american forces on right and british on left use of airborne troops to cover flanks and some form of diversionary operation in southern france shaef when eisenhower was appointed supreme allied commander in january 1944 cossac team was absorbed into shaef eisenhower brought his chief of staff for afhq major general walter bedell smith and moved headquarters to bushey park morgan was offered command of xiii corps in italy but declined in favour of becoming one of smith s three deputies his responsibilities covered intelligence and operations morgan coordinated work of various shaef divisions and deputised for bedell smith when he was absent morgan was also called upon on occasion to deal with montgomery with whom his professional relationship as deputy chief of staff was similar to that before war when montgomery was a brigade commander on one occasion morgan was summoned to smith s office to find him white with rage at a telephone receiver that s your bloody marshal on other end of that smith explained i can t talk to him any more now you go on as campaign progressed morgan later wrote it became more difficult for us british at shaef to provide explanation as we were continually called upon to do for attitude and behaviour of british authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in field senior british officers at shaef notably morgan kenneth strong and jock whiteley remained loyal to eisenhower this cast a pall over their careers after war when montgomery became chief of imperial general staff cigs after war smith described morgan as his british alter ego a man i wouldn t willingly have dispensed with morgan served in this role until shaef was dissolved in june 1945 he was appointed knight commander of order of bath kcb in august 1944 in recognition of distinguished services in connection with invasion of normandy united states government awarded him legion of merit in april 1945 and army distinguished service medal in 1948 for his services post war career unrra in september 1945 morgan became chief of operations for united nations relief and rehabilitation administration unrra in germany he applied his energy and planning skills to problem of providing relief to millions of refugees and displaced persons in europe in wake of war however he became frustrated with inefficiency of united nations organisation events in british zionist conflict in british mandate for palestine made morgan feel conflicted between his role in assisting jewish refugees at unrra whom he regarded as special victims of nazis for being persecuted solely for their race and supporting british policy as a british army officer in january 1946 he created an uproar by claiming at a press conference that there was a secret zionist organisation that was attempting to facilitate an exodus of jewish people from europe to a new state in palestine with soviet encouragement morgan stated that he had witnessed an exodus of jews from poland on russian trains on a regular route from lodz to berlin all of them were well dressed well fed healthy and had pockets bulging with money all of them told same monotonous story of threats pogroms and atrocities in poland as a reason for their leaving general morgan s statement his doubts about polish pogroms by manchester guardian thursday january 3 1946 page 5 he later wrote one reporter quoted morgan as remarking that jews seem to have organised a plan enabling them to become a world power a weak force numerically but one which will have a generating power for getting what they want a correspondent reported that morgan made casual observations based on what he saw but controversial remarks were taken out of context and put together by correspondents unrra expected that morgan would offer his resignation but he did not do so an attempt to clarify his position off record failed and morgan s position in germany was eliminated by unrra director fiorello la guardia morgan s statements caused a furore in press which portrayed them as anti semitic and distasteful however morgan s comments were factual based on military intelligence it was reported at time in time magazine that observers here in berlin are positive of morgan s sincerity and know he had no intention of feeding fires of anti semitic propaganda archibald macleish a former assistant secretary of state for public affairs stated that when press had finished with sir frederick sum total effect was a lie and a disastrous and evil lie this brings up question of journalistic standards in a world as closely integrated as this one is question must be asked what is standard of truth in journalism when journalist is dealing with an inflammatory subject and so reports it that verbally his story is true but overall effect is false are standards of truth satisfied with his military background morgan was appalled at corruption inefficiency and political diversion of unrra a member of his staff said that to serve such an outfit is degradation beyond description in fact morgan wrote to have been rejected for such service i have always felt to have been a high honour atomic energy morgan was appointed colonel commandant of royal artillery from 24 june 1948 until 24 june 1958 in 1951 he succeeded lord portal as controller of atomic energy position had been created in january 1946 as controller of production atomic energy when ministry of supply had assumed responsibility for nuclear weapons job title of which was changed to controller atomic energy in 1950 had no written terms of reference but carried broad responsibility for coordination of all aspects of nuclear weapons production although located within ministry of supply controller had direct access to prime minister portal rarely exercised this however it was widely believed that morgan who was in words of margaret gowing amiable but not adequate to task had been appointed by mistake having been confused with his namesake general sir william morgan latter had greatly impressed prime minister clement attlee as army member of joint staff mission to united states from 1947 to 1950 morgan therefore relied heavily on his key subordinates sir john cockcroft william penney and christopher hinton in his role as controller of atomic energy morgan was present for operation hurricane first british atomic weapons tests at montebello islands in october 1952 his position was gradually reduced to a figurehead with his authority largely supplanted by atomic energy board which was chaired by lord cherwell and was abolished in 1954 with creation of united kingdom atomic energy authority morgan then became controller of nuclear weapons nonetheless he was still an important figure in push for higher yield weapons he pressed for testing of green bamboo boosted fission weapon during operation mosaic this resulted in mosaic becoming a two test series although green bamboo could not be made available in time a green bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to christmas island for operation grapple but was deleted from test series to save money morgan was also instrumental in putting case for development of h bomb on operational grounds morgan retired in 1956 although he remained colonel commandant of royal artillery until 1958 he published his memoirs entitled peace and war a soldier s life in 1961 he
