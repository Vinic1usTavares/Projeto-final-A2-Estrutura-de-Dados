in odense in 2016 city of odense denmark implemented a new form of technology to allow for more efficient bike travel often times when it s raining heavily cyclists have had to sit in rain for long periods of time at traffic lights and this disincentives them to cycle to work that day to fix this problem odense has placed rain sensors in traffic lights along their super bike highways these sensors interact with motion detectors which allow system to register when bikes are within 70 meters of intersection they then automatically prolong green light intersection includes a small sign that explains system to cyclists and when a light goes on they can see system is functioning this technology allows cyclists to experience up to 20 seconds longer of green light and makes their overall journey more efficient safer and dryer cycling embassy of denmark is organization spearheading this research and initiatives while there isn t a lot of criticism due to cyclist culture that is already fairly dominant in odense those who commute in cars would be naturally upset by longer red lights however embassy believes that there shouldn t be too much pushback because of equity issue involved with being exposed to rain versus being sheltered in a car it will also only be utilized up to 3 times a month this initiative does not only optimize corridor flow and speed for cyclists it reinforces green wave green wave is known as ability to cycle through several intersections without having to stop this is overall thought cycling embassy had in installing rain sensors as they hope to implement technology in other intersections of city creating an efficient city wide system of sustainable transit eventually riding a bike will be easier than riding a car healthcare thumb 250px
