shipbuilding and gun production at yokosuka shipyard no response was made by prime minister s office before proposal was revised to use all of allocated money to buy three ships one iron hulled armored warship and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by prominent british naval architect sir edward reed formerly chief constructor of royal navy reed would also

she first fired these weapons on 14 january 1886 although further testing revealed that torpedoes were often damaged by impact with water upon recommendation of prominent french naval architect louis emile bertin a spoon was added to ends of tubes to make torpedoes strike water horizontally which better distributed shock of impact modifications were made and successful tests were conducted before end of year lengerer pt ii pp 34 35 when ship was being refitted from 1891 94 her anti torpedo boat armament was reinforced by replacement of three 25 4 millimeter nordenfelt guns by a pair of 2 5
