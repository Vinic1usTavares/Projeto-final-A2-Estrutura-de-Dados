schoolin life as his favorite track on album swivel told sound on sound that he was adamant about mixing song i spent a lot of time after knowles left studio tightening up rough in fact i m sure she let me mix it just because i loved track so much i mixed this in fantastic penthouse room in jungle city this record was of course about vocals but a lot of it was about production elements too everything had to be audible there s some interesting percussion and hook had to feel nice and big around 100 tracks were used on schoolin life they were roughly split with 50 for music and 50 for vocals as stated by swivel musically aim of mix was to take a large number of tracks and create a perfect balance so he used waves on percussion and some of snares and spent some time eq ing swivel explained that there was much parallel processing on lead vocal lead vocal bus was muted to a second bus and one of them was entirely crushed on a 50 1 compression ratio which was totally limited and with a very low threshold he elaborated it creates a very gritty distorted sound in there really low to taste and it fills in lead vocal very nicely crushed vocal runs quietly underneath after completing lead vocals swivel decided to rework 1980s sound on snares as they were originally very tight he therefore added a gated reverb for snap sound which was long and drawn out snap sound he also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to bottom owing to work swivel had accomplished during production final mix took only a few hours he said there were a lot of tracks but i just enjoyed it to be honest i knew how i wanted it to sound and it was pretty much last song we cut a lot of mixing was nailed in production as well which helped dream did a great job producing this track bar one guitar track of schoolin life was entirely programmed similarly live drum section in hook was actually done with programmed drums once mixing was over swivel s impression were as follows schoolin life absolutely had to have its own space there are percussion elements and a few random sounds in there too plus nice guitar track but certainly main challenge was for all of these tracks to be well balanced and individually audible it really is very easy to overlook something like that which can potentially completely change sound of a record composition and lyrical interpretation schoolin life is an uptempo r b and funk song which contains elements of disco and dance pop built on a 1980s inspired beat song s instrumentation includes old school synthesizers 1980s sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars and horns music critics including jamie peck of mtv noted that schoolin life was inspired by prime work of prince particularly because of its lyrical content instruments used and knowles style of singing on it lyrically song finds knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up in first verse she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to 20 somethings 30 somethings 40 somethings and 50 somethings knowles warns them against some consequences affirming time really moves fast and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything mom and dad tried to hide world said world s just too big for a little girl eyes wide open can t you see i had my first heels by age of 13 in chorus knowles gives listeners a flashback to her days and admits that she is certified neither as a teacher a preacher nor a doctor but is willing to perform their various duties regardless she also sings i m great at writing physical love letters and i m a freak all day all night after asking who needs a degree when you re schoolin life knowles echoes oh oh oh oh oh oh woah oh oh in second verse she continues to sing about ins and outs of life to pretty somethings sexy somethings bitter somethings and little somethings living in a fastlane see you when you crash babe that body ain t always gonna get you out of everything and stop living in regret it s not over yet in bridge she commands make your life what you decide baby party till fire marshal shuts this sucker down song ends with knowles giving one her final lessons don t stop running until it s finished it s up to you rest is unwritten critical reception schoolin life received positive reviews jamie peck of mtv described schoolin life as a feisty lesson in fun it s perfect soundtrack for dancing on a fire escape or playing in a busted open fire hydrant whatever it s hot he concluded that prince would be proud of song s musical style and lyrical content john mitchell of same publication found song to be single worthy choosing schoolin life as one of three best tracks on 4 tyrone s reid of blogcritics commented that song offers a proper lesson in how to make old and new schools boogie together he also noted that it is reminiscent of prince s work ryan dombal of pitchfork media viewed song as an irresistible prince tribute which he considered to be much more motivational than i was here he called schoolin life as one among proper album s finest moments daniel koren of pma noted that song recalls some of dream s most prince esque tracks fast car and yamaha ian walker of absolutepunk wrote i miss you and bonus track schoolin life both showcase opposite sides of that magnificent decade s musical spectrum former is a stripped down track carried mostly by a hollow beat and dismal synthesizers allowing knowles and her morosely beautiful voice center stage latter picks up pace peppered liberally with old school horns and crashes knowles details her experiences growing up but parallels can be drawn to maturation she s going through on this very album more than any song schoolin life literally oozes confidence providing an endearing edge to an already catchy track becky bain of idolator wrote that schoolin life is one of catchier upbeat songs knowles has ever recorded and felt that it deserves to be a future single casey hamilton of boston website gather wrote that credit for song s retro radical nature goes to producer dream but it is knowles herself who truly delivers shock value managing to make a lightly introspective loosely insightful and largely entertaining tune before adding that it contains sexiest lyrical content she has ever attempted hamilton concluded that knowles vocals effectively match funky and fun vibe of schoolin life and concluded that latter showcases a side of singer that is nice to see and even nicer to hear duncan cooper of fader magazine wrote that song is lyrically inspired tough as hell and easily best thing on 4 danielle cheesman of msn music commented that schoolin life steals whole entire spotlight further noting that it channels trademark of prince he commended how knowles unleashes her inner and innate freak singing cheesman concluded how this isn t on original is beyond me before

placed song at number five on her list of 10 best pop songs of year writing that it is most excellent time defying look at beyonce s life so far he added that if viewed from a stylistic perspective
