watched by a forensic psychologist who advised police on state of men s minds and how to best manage ongoing negotiations background post second world war britain had a shortage of labour which led to official policies to attract workers from british empire and commonwealth countries these people were placed in low pay low skill employment which forced them to live in poor housing economic circumstances and what were seen by many in black communities as racist policies applied by british government led to a rise in militancy particularly among west indian community their feelings were exacerbated by police harassment and discrimination in education sector sivanandan director of institute of race relations in mid 1970s identifies that while first generation had become partly assimilated into british society second generation were increasingly rebellious ringleader of attempted robbery of a branch of spaghetti house restaurant was franklin davies a 28 year old nigerian

entered ground floor of restaurant davies and his colleagues forced staff into a rear storeroom measuring locked door barricaded it with beer kegs and shouted to police that they would shoot if they approached door police surrounded building and siege began siege 28 september 3 october 1975 in initial conversations hostage takers provided police with names of hostages they held and davies s identity and criminal record was established by 7 00 am police had sealed off area and put a cordon in place 400 police officers were involved including dog handlers and d11 metropolitan police s marksmen was deployed davies informed police that he was a captain in blf but in a subsequent message said that men were members of black liberation army a black panther splinter group davies made several demands to police he wanted two black prisoners released from prison although he did not know that they had already been released he also wanted home secretary to visit siege an aircraft made available to fly to west indies and a radio for them to listen to news broadcasts of situation only request for a radio was granted initially police considered that siege may have been a terrorist incident but were subsequently dismissive of any political motivation and insisted that it was only ever a criminal action sir robert mark commissioner of metropolitan police at time of siege later wrote from outset it was rightly assumed that this was a simple armed robbery that had gone wrong and any attempts by davies nigerian to represent it as a political act were received with derision they clearly deserved tony soares one of founders of blf told police he knew three men and offered to mediate but his offer was turned down he added that blf was a peaceful organisation and that it did not know of or support robbery jenny bourne co editor of race class knew all three men and thinks they probably had very different motives for robbery overall she considers three particularly wesley dick were driven by actualities of racism on ground in britain it was essentially words of angela davis george jackson bobby seale and malcolm x that honed resistance seize time off pigs fuck man were themes they transposed to britain on morning of 29 september fifteen hours after siege had begun one of hostages was released as a sign of good faith he was a 59 year old manager of one of outlets on second day another hostage was released after he fell ill during course of siege mario italian consul general attempted to liaise with men acting as a go between at one stage he offered to change places with one of hostages who was unwell but offer was declined lord pitt former chairman of greater london council who was west indian born also attempted to negotiate with men but had limited success dr peter scott a forensic psychologist at maudsley hospital gave advice about mental state of criminals throughout siege he told police that longer siege went on more an emotional transference would take place in which gunmen would be less likely to kill hostages on his advice main strategy of police was to wait as long as was needed keep situation calm and to talk to hostage takers as long as possible siege saw an early use of fibre optic camera technology by police as a live surveillance technique two cameras were used to observe what was happening in basement storeroom one was threaded through wall alongside a hot water pipe second way was through a vent after acid was dripped onto metal vent using an to make a small hole police were able to monitor movement and conversations of three hostage takers police persuaded media to assist them they asked daily mail not to publish a story about arrest of one of gang s associates using information and advice from scott police attempted to drive a wedge between davies and his two colleagues on fourth day police pushed a copy of daily express under door of storeroom it showed a photograph of davies on front page describing him as leader and providing background information from his associates making it look like gang s associates were selling information to newspapers across front page police wrote name of person suspected of providing arms following day when two of co conspirators were arrested police briefed media about arrests and stressed criminal not political aspects of case men heard news on radio that evening which lowered their spirits following morning men decided to surrender at 2 55 am gunmen turned out lights and began a discussion among themselves at 3 40 am they told police that they were giving up after hostages came out first all unharmed police told three men to come out one at a time first two threw their guns out and followed as police led them away there was a gunshot from room where davies had shot himself in stomach with a 22 rimfire revolver in his pocket police found a note he had written to his brother just before robbery today i set out on a mission for people if things go wrong i shall pass over to warrior s rest so if this note reaches you it would mean that i am dead you must accept what happens to me as it should be accepted with joy because it is most natural fate that awaits any of us blacks conscious enough to try and do something about our pathetic state of existence aftermath davies was taken to st george s hospital where he underwent an operation bullet was not removed during process hostages were also taken to same hospital for a check up but none needed treatment they then gave preliminary statements to police at cannon row police station while on remand davies went on hunger strike he was visited regularly by giovanni one of hostages from siege who had built up a relationship with davies during incident relationship was later identified as an example of stockholm syndrome trial opened on 8 june 1976 as well as davies dick and munroe three accomplices were present charged with different offences including assisting robbery getaway driver supplying firearms and conspiracy charges davies dick and munroe refused to accept legitimacy of court when asked how they pleaded to charges davies shouted we ve stopped pleading we ve been pleading for 500 years this isn t a trial it s a lynching party three men turned their backs on court and talked between themselves judge mervyn griffith jones ordered that three men be taken back to their cells and that a plea of not guilty be entered on their behalf one of accomplices lillo termaine pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to rob restaurant police said that

house restaurant re opened for business a week after siege ended in 2015 knightsbridge branch closed for business so block could be redeveloped in 1976 horace ove a trinidadian born writer and filmmaker wrote play a hole in babylon based on events at restaurant play was later broadcast on bbc s play for today series another fictionalised account of crime siege of babylon was written by farrukh in 1978 in 1982 spaghetti house an italian comedy film was produced which was loosely based on events of siege in early december 1975 an active service unit of provisional irish republican army ira were cornered in a flat on balcombe street london leading to a six day siege by police lessons learned from spaghetti house siege including use of live surveillance and forensic psychologists were put into use to bring siege to a successful conclusion for police peter waddington in his study of policing writes that police s reputation for restraint received dramatic vindication by way in which two highly publicised sieges were handled by metropolitan police police used same tactics at iranian embassy siege in 1980 until terrorists killed one of hostages which led to a change in tactics and use of special air service to storm building waddington considers if there was criticism it was that police showed an excessive disinclination to resort to force in such circumstances
