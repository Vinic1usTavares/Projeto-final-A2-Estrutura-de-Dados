tropical storm dean was a strong tropical storm that affected at least twelve islands along its path from tropical atlantic ocean to east of atlantic canada in august 2001 dean developed from a tropical wave on august 22 over lesser antilles and was initially predicted to intensify further to reach hurricane status however strong wind shear quickly weakened dean to cause it to dissipate on august 23 remnants turned northward and redeveloped on august 26 to north of bermuda located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions dean steadily strengthened while moving to northeast and peaked just below hurricane status on august 27 about 465 miles 750 km southwest of newfoundland storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters and became extratropical on august 28 precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall and produced moderate winds throughout lesser antilles though no serious damage was reported in puerto rico rainfall of up to 12 7 inches 322 mm produced widespread flooding across island thousands were left without power or water and two houses lost their roofs from storm passage of dean resulted in 7 7 million 2001 usd 9 4 million 2008 usd in damage in puerto rico storm produced light to moderate rainfall in bermuda and later in newfoundland though no damage was reported meteorological history a large tropical wave with minimal convection moved off coast of africa near dakar between august 14 and august 15 it moved westward and gradually developed thunderstorms across wave axis on august 21 while located about 450 miles 725 km east of lesser antilles convection increased further within system though unfavorable upper level wind shear prevented rapid development it continued to become better organized and though a reconnaissance flight into system reported strong winds it lacked a surface circulation late on august 21 wave passed through northern lesser antilles and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear system became much better organized on august 22 a surface circulation formed and system developed into tropical storm dean on august 22 near saint croix dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to presence of 50 mph 80 km h winds in storm reconnaissance aircraft and surface reports confirmed existence of a circulation dean moved northwestward at 22 mph 35 km h under influence of bermuda high to its northeast storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60 mph 95 km h later on august 22 though circulation was exposed on western edge of convection due to storm s quick forward motion and persistent wind shear initial forecasts predicted shear to decrease allowing dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80 mph 130 km h however an upper level trough produced an increase of shear over storm and by august 23 dean weakened to a tropical depression hours later circulation dissipated and dean degenerated into a tropical wave to east of bahamas regeneration was considered unlikely at time remnants of dean turned to north and became embedded within a large mid level trough off east coast of united states convection increased around system early on august 24 system became better organized with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400 miles 645 km west southwest of bermuda however a reconnaissance flight into remnants of dean reported a broad low pressure area with strongest winds and convection located far from area of minimum pressure indicating it had some non tropical characteristics weak disturbance passed to west of bermuda early on august 25 and subsequently began to drift to northeast remnants of dean produced convection near its developing circulation and on august 26 while located 220 miles 350 km north of bermuda system organized sufficiently enough to be re classified a tropical depression operationally national hurricane center did not re initiate advisories until fifteen hours later right thumb tropical storm dean at peak on august 27 depression continued to northeast and re strengthened into tropical storm dean early on august 27 while located 580 miles 930 km south of halifax nova scotia convection became better organized and dean steadily strengthened as it tracked northeastward a ship near center of dean confirmed storm re developed convection near center greatly organized and an eye feature began to develop remaining over warm waters dean continued to strengthen and reached peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h late on august 27 while located about 465 miles 750 km southwest of cape race newfoundland eye feature failed to develop further and after maintaining its peak intensity for 12 hours dean weakened over progressively cooler waters convection quickly diminished and on august 28 dean became extratropical while located 145 miles 235 km east southeast of cape race newfoundland extratropical storm continued northeastward until being absorbed by a frontal low on august 29 impact and preparations caribbean left thumb tropical storm dean shortly after formation on august 22 about a day before dean developed national hurricane center advised interests in northern and central lesser antilles to monitor progress of storm routine statements issued by national hurricane center warned for possibility of strong winds and heavy rains however because dean formed after it passed islands no tropical cyclone warnings or watches were issued precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall on saint martin of around 5 inches 129 mm precursor disturbance to tropical storm dean produced 1 07 inches 27 mm of rain in saint thomas where winds reached 40 mph 64 km h with gusts to 48 mph 77 km h on saint croix system produced 0 49 inches 12 mm of rain and peak wind gusts of 47 mph 76 km h there minor flooding was reported moderate wind gusts downed small trees and branches in saint croix and saint john and some roads were damaged in saint john as well heavy rains and gusty winds caused power outages throughout u s virgin islands passage of tropical storm dean resulted in minor damage totaling to 20 000 2001 usd 24 400 2008 usd tropical storm dean dropped heavy rainfall across puerto rico peaking at 12 7 inches 322 mm in salinas winds were generally light across island passage of dean resulted in widespread flooding in eastern and southern puerto rico collapsing two bridges and one road several highways were under water and one car was swept away by floodwaters four inside vehicle were later rescued and unharmed throughout island about 1 320 houses were flooded and two houses experienced collapsed roofs rains left various towns without power or water by night after storm passed island more than 16 000 were without power while almost 70 000 lacked potable water over 130 people were evacuated from low lying areas to hurricane shelters two people were injured in penuelas and three were injured in when ceiling of a day care center collapsed though no deaths occurred on island one airline canceled seventeen flights in and out of island and one cruise line was required to alter its path to both dean and earlier due to tropical storm chantal damage in puerto rico totaled to 7 7 million 2001 usd 9 4 million 2008 usd of which 2 1 million 2001 usd 2 6 million 2008 usd was from agricultural damage bahamas bermuda and canada shortly after dean formed government of bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for southeastern bahamas and turks and caicos islands when storm weakened and ultimately dissipated warnings were canceled remnants of dean produced unsettled conditions across bermuda including a wind gust of 41 mph 66 km h and light rainfall of 0 31 inches 8 mm passage of dean resulted in coldest day of august 2001 on island dean produced wind gusts peaking at 63 mph 103 km h in newfoundland along with rainfall up to 4 2 inches 107 mm in eastern newfoundland on land wave heights reached 30 feet 9 3 m while a buoy offshore reported a peak wave
