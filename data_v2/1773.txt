psilocybe makarorae is a species of psilocybin mushroom in family strophariaceae officially described as new to science in 1995 it is known only from new zealand where it grows on rotting wood and twigs of southern beeches fruit body mushroom has a brownish cap with lighter coloured margins measuring up to wide cap shape is either conical bell shaped or flat depending on age of mushroom and it features a prominent umbo although whitish stem does not form a true ring it retains remnants of partial veil that covers and protects gills of young fruit bodies p makarorae mushrooms can be distinguished from similar north american species psilocybe caerulipes by microscopic characteristics such as presence of cystidia on gill faces pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia found on gill edges with more elongated necks based on bluing reaction to injury p makarorae is presumed to contain psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin taxonomy species was first mentioned in literature in 1981 when pierre margot and roy watling described a specimen collected in 1969 by grace marie taylor near franz josef glacier as an unnamed psilocybe with affinities to north american species psilocybe caerulipes it was officially described as new to science in 1995 by mycologists peter r johnston and peter k buchanan in his 1996 book psilocybin mushrooms of world paul stamets noted that two authors are known to work with law enforcement officials to assist in prosecuting those who illegally collect psychoactive mushrooms stamets 1996 pp 126 7 type material was collected in 1990 near pass crossing river specific epithet makarorae refers to type locality p makarorae is classified in gaston guzman s section owing to spore shape and bluing reaction upon injury it is distinguished from other species in this section by size of caps presence of pleurocystidia and short necked cheilocystidia description cap is initially conical to bell shaped but as mushroom grows it expands to become convex with a prominent umbo and attains a diameter of cap surface is dry to slightly tacky its colour is yellow brown to orange brown often paler towards margin which has fine striations corresponding to gills on underside flesh is white gills have an adnexed attachment to stem and are pale greyish brown whitish stem is long by 2 4 mm wide it is cylindrical with a surface of pressed silky fibrils base of stem is often brownish with white rhizoids present veil of young fruit bodies is resembling cobweb like partial veil found in cortinarius species as mushroom grows its remnants often remain visible on stem but it never forms a complete ring both cap and stem stain greenish blue when damaged spore print is dark purplish brown spores typically measure 7 5 9 5 by 5 5 6 5 by 4 5 5 5 mm averaging 8 7 by 6 0 by 5 3 mm its shape in face view is ovate egg shaped to roughly rhomboid while viewed from side it appears elliptical spore wall is brown smooth about 0 8 1 mm thick and has a germ pore basidia spore bearing cells are four spored and somewhat club shaped tapering slightly to base they are clamped and measure 25 31 by 7 8 5 mm cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge have dimensions of 18 26 by 6 9 mm and a shape ranging from ventricose rostrate broad in middle and tapering to a beaklike neck to mucronate ending abruptly in a short sharp point they are hyaline translucent thin walled and clamped with necks that are 3 5 mm long pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face are similar in shape to cheilocystidia but narrower 4 8 mm wide and usually have a shorter neck measuring 2 5 4 mm cap cuticle is a cutis characterised by hyphae that run parallel to cap surface of long celled 2 3 mm diameter gelatinised hyphae hypodermium tissue layer under cap cuticle is filamentous comprising 4 6 mm diameter cells with pale brown walls clamps are common subhymenium tissue layer under hymenium is poorly developed containing 2 4 mm diameter cells with pale brown walls tissue comprising hymenophore is made of short cylindric 3 6 mm diameter hyaline cells px alt px alt px alt gills are adnexed and greyish brown cheilocystidia are translucent with necks up to 5 mm long spores are brown thick walled and have an apical pore small reticule divisions are 1 mm p makarorae contains psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin although potency is not known definitely stamets suggests that based on degree of bluing reaction they are probably moderately potent similar species psilocybe makarorae closely resembles north american species p caerulipes but former can be distinguished microscopically from latter by presence of pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia with longer necks there are several other psychoactive species of psilocybe found in new zealand p p cubensis p semilanceata p subaeruginosa p subcubensis and p tasmaniana p subaeruginosa is distinguished from p makarorae by having chocolate brown pleurocystidia stamets 1996 pp 154 5 closely related to p subaeruginosa is poorly known p tasmaniana some have considered two species synonymous it has been reported growing on dung and dung enriched woody debris in open areas of eucalyptus forests stamets 1996 p 160 p cubensis is a common dung loving species that can be readily recognized by its larger size cap diameter up to golden color and well formed membranous ring p subcubensis is nearly identical differing only in microscopic characteristics stamets 1996 pp 108 11 known only from auckland region p fruits in soil rich in woody debris near leptospermum and and in monterey pine pinus radiata plantations stamets 1996 p 89 p semilanceata one of most common psilocybe mushrooms is only found in high altitude grasslands in south island stamets 1996 p 144 habitat and distribution psilocybe makarorae is known only from new zealand reported collection locations have been on both north and south islands including bay of plenty westland district central otago and dunedin although stamets suggests that it is more widely distributed like all psilocybe species it is saprobic and feeds on decomposing organic matter fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups on fallen rotting wood of southern beeches genus nothofagus and are often encountered near lakes and picnic grounds see also legal status of psilocybin mushrooms list of psilocybin mushrooms list of psilocybe species
