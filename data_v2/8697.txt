royal gloucestershire hussars was a volunteer yeomanry regiment which in 20th century became part of british army reserve it traced its origins to first or cheltenham troop of gloucestershire gentleman and yeomanry raised in 1795 although a break in lineage means that its formation is dated to marshfield and dodington troop raised in 1830 six further troops officered by nobility and gentry and recruited largely from among landholders and tenant farmers were subsequently raised in gloucestershire and in 1834 they came together to form gloucestershire yeomanry cavalry in 1847 regiment adopted a hussar uniform and name royal gloucestershire hussars originally intended to counter insurrection and a french invasion that never materialised yeomanry s first deployments were ceremonial and as mounted police during times of civil unrest three gloucestershire troops were deployed to bristol on two separate occasions in 1830s in support of civil authorities from mid 19th century yeomanry s policing role diminished with establishment of a civilian police force and renewed fears of invasion turned its focus to national defence royal gloucestershire hussars first battle honour

volunteer troops of cavalry consisting of gentlemen and yeomanry each troop comprised 50 to 80 men commanded by person raising it commanders received a temporary rank ranging from captain to colonel depending on number of troops raised officers were generally appointed from among nobility and gentry and troops were largely recruited from landholders and tenant farmers members provided their own

order on composition of regiment at this time can be observed from an incident in 1847 it involved a disagreement between lord fitzhardinge lord lieutenant of gloucestershire and his brother berkeley

threatened some with loss of their farms if they did not wyndham quin pp 152 161 170 further insight into regiment s strong ties to farming community can be found in records of annual exercises in
