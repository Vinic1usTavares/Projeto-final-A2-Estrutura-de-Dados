nasr ibn sayyar al laythi al 663 748 was an arab general and last umayyad governor of khurasan in 738 748 nasr played a distinguished role in wars against turgesh although he failed to decisively confront rebellion of al harith ibn surayj in its early stages although respected as a soldier and a statesman he owed his appointment as governor more to his obscure tribal background which rendered him dependent on caliph his tenure was nevertheless successful as nasr introduced long overdue tax reforms that alleviated social tension and largely restored and stabilized umayyad control in transoxiana which had been greatly reduced under turgesh onslaught his last years were occupied by intertribal rivalries and uprisings however as caliphate itself descended into a period of civil war in 746 nasr was driven from his capital by ibn surayj and juday al kirmani but returned after latter fell out among themselves resulting in ibn surayj s death preoccupied with this conflict nasr was unable to stop outbreak and spread of abbasid revolution whose leader abu muslim exploited situation to his advantage evicted from his province in early 748 he fled to iran pursued by abbasid forces where he died on 9 december 748 early life and career thumb 300px alt old map of western eurasia and northern africa showing expansion of caliphate from arabia to cover most of middle east with

of arab empire nasr was a military leader with long service and experience in khurasan as early as 705 he participated in a campaign along upper oxus river led by salih brother of qutayba ibn muslim general who had been tasked with subduing transoxiana for his service during this campaign nasr was awarded an entire village in this region despite successes of qutayba much of central asia east of oxus remained outside effective arab control while garrisons had been established in places like samarkand balkh or bukhara caliphate largely relied on relationships with multitude of local rulers who became tributary to umayyads in addition clashes with chinese backed turgesh ambiguous policy followed regarding conversion of native population mass conversions would lessen taxable population and hence amount of tribute received and increasing inter arab tribal factionalism weakened umayyad control over region and necessitated increased military activity in 724 nasr is recorded as heading a mudari army sent against balkh where restive yemenite troops refused to participate in expedition against ferghana that resulted in disastrous day of thirst his troops reinforced by men from subject hephthalite principality of chaghaniyan clashed with yemenis at baruqan and prevailed over them this led to resentment towards his person among yemenis especially from those around balkh and during governorship of yemeni asad ibn abdallah al qasri along with other mudari leaders nasr fell into disfavour and was mistreated nasr was one of few muslim leaders to distinguish himself in disastrous battle of defile in july 731 in 734 he was appointed as governor of balkh after arresting previous governor there he faced rebellion of local khurasani troops under al harith ibn surayj who called for reforms in taxation and ending of discrimination towards native converts mawali ibn surayj marched on balkh and took city with only 4 000 followers even though nasr commanded 10 000 men it is unclear from sources whether town was seized from nasr or whether it was captured in his absence and then successfully held against him in any case nasr and his army remained passive for remainder of revolt they did not aid provincial capital merv when rebels attacked it and this stance encouraged several local tribes to join uprising eventually however rebels were defeated by juday al kirmani with ibn surayj fleeing across oxus to turgesh appointment as governor of khurasan thumb right 300px map of khurasan and transoxiana in 8th century in july 738 at age of 74 nasr was appointed as governor of khurasan despite his age he was widely respected both for his military record his knowledge of affairs of khurasan and his abilities as a statesman julius wellhausen wrote of him that his age did not affect freshness of his mind as is testified not only by his deeds but also by verses in which he gave expression to his feelings till very end of his life however in climate of times his nomination owed more to his appropriate tribal affiliation than his personal qualities from early days of muslim conquests arab armies were divided into regiments drawn from individual tribes or tribal confederations butun or asha ir despite fact that many of these groupings were recent creations created for reasons of military efficiency rather than any common ancestry they soon developed a strong and distinct identity eventually and certainly by beginning of umayyad period this system progressed to formation of ever larger super groupings culminating in two super groups northern arab mudaris or qaysis and south arabs or yemenis yaman dominated by azd and rabi ah tribes by 8th century this division had become firmly established across caliphate and was a source of constant internal instability as two groups formed in essence two rival political parties jockeying for power and separated by a fierce hatred for each other during hisham ibn abd al malik s reign umayyad government appointed mudaris as governors in khurasan except for asad ibn abdallah al qasri s tenure in 735 738 nasr s appointment came four months after asad s death in interim sources report variously that province was run either by syrian general ja far ibn hanzala al bahrani or by asad s lieutenant juday al kirmani at any rate sources agree that al kirmani stood at time as most prominent man in khurasan and should have been clear choice for governor his yemeni roots he was leader of azd in khurasan however made him unpalatable to caliph nasr on other hand in addition to his other qualities was a mudari and married to a tamimi wife he would therefore be acceptable to numerous mudari element of khurasani army which outnumbered yemenis but could also as a local help to reduce khurasani arabs discontent towards syria centric umayyad government nasr s own relatively obscure tribal background from a non noble family of layth tribe from kinanah also suited caliph s purposes as it meant that he lacked any local power base of his own indeed nasr s rule throughout his tenure was not fully accepted by many arab tribesmen aside from yemenis who favoured their own candidate al kirmani and resented shift in power back towards mudaris qays around nishapur refused to support him and even syrian contingent sided with his opponents nasr was hence mostly reliant on support of his wife s powerful tamim tribe living around marv as long as he was supported by a strong central government in damascus nasr was able to keep his internal enemies in check but in troubles that followed hisham s death in 743 that support vanished in event nasr would succeed in retaining his office for a decade despite turmoil that swept caliphate after 743 when yazid iii came to power in early 744 he initially ordered nasr replaced nasr refused to accept this and held on to post being eventually confirmed to it a few months later after marwan ii s rise to power in december 744 he likewise affirmed nasr s position reforms and campaigns nasr gave his province an unprecedented period of good government stability and prosperity so that in words of 9th century historian al mada ini khurasan was built up as it had never been before his major achievements during his tenure were reform of tax system and restoration of umayyad control over transoxiana khurasani tax system had been established at time of muslim conquest and remained unchanged since it relied on collection of a fixed tribute by local non muslim mostly zoroastrian gentry dihqans who often discriminated against muslim settlers and native converts this contributed to latter s increasing resentment of umayyad rule and demand for a tax reform had fuelled past revolts like that of ibn surayj consequently nasr streamlined tax system in 739 implementing a blanket imposition kharaj on all owners of agricultural land and forcing non muslims to pay an additional poll tax jizyah in this way chroniclers report 30 000 muslims were absolved of jizyah and 80 000 non muslims were forced to pay it instead attention was also paid to accurate collection of kharaj in accordance with treaties with local rulers as a result of which tax burden was generally eased this reform is traditionally held to have assisted in regaining loyalty of local populations and their princes who returned quickly to arab fold other modern scholars however consider effect of this belated reform on prevailing anti umayyad climate as minimal upon his appointment nasr also moved provincial capital back to merv from balkh where asad had established it additionally for first time in province s history he appointed sub governors they were drawn from among his allies and supporters in order to reward them and to improve his own control of province taking advantage of disintegration of turgesh khaganate after murder of khagan suluk nasr moved aggressively across oxus his first campaign immediately after his appointment was in area of chaghaniyan his second campaign in 740 recovered much territory in sogdia including samarkand with little apparent resistance aiming to recover all lands previously conquered under qutayba ibn muslim and to curtail activities of renegade ibn surayj who was based there nasr then launched an expedition targeting al shash tashkent principality of usrushana submitted peacefully but when muslim army reached jaxartes it was confronted by a 15 000 strong force from shash along with ibn surayj s men and some turgesh according to muslim tradition latter were led by suluk s murderer and successor kursul according to arab tradition nasr was able to drive off turgesh and scored a victory against one of their detachments killing its chief but apparently failed to subdue al shash for he was forced to content himself with an agreement with ruler of shash whereby ibn surayj was evicted to where latter was left unmolested to continue his opposition to umayyads nasr also launched two expeditions against ferghana which plundered and ravaged countryside and took many captives it seems however that muslim reconquest at this time did not extend much further than samarkand with occasional tribute being possibly levied from remoter principalities outwardly at least by 743 umayyad position in khurasan appeared stronger than ever reality beneath splendid facade however was different tension and mutual mistrust existed between khurasani arab levies muqatila and 20 000 syrian troops introduced into province as a security measure after disastrous battle of defile in 731 while tribal antagonism continued to create trouble apart from continued yemeni resentment at nasr there was strong dislike of umayyads syrian regime fanned by their unjust tax policies although nasr tried to remedy situation it was too late in addition khurasan was a major center of early and specifically of sect of hashimiyya which had gained wide acceptance in province especially among mawali in 742 743 nasr confronted and defeated a revolt led by yahya son of zayd ibn ali and leader of hashimiyya in khurasan yahya was captured and executed and resulting vacuum in hashimi leadership opened path for khurasani branch of movement to come under control of abbasid family it is however a testament to respect and even affection gibb with which nasr was regarded by native population in transoxiana that in contrast to khurasan no native city there welcomed hashimi missionaries and that they remained loyal to him even during later abbasid revolution civil wars and abbasid revolution in 743 after death of caliph hisham walid ii reconfirmed nasr in his post but influential governor of iraq yusuf ibn umar al thaqafi an opponent of nasr tried to lure him away from his province by calling him to iraq nasr delayed his departure stalling for time and was saved by murder of walid in april 744 however walid s successor yazid iii moved to install a regime dominated by yemeni kalbi tribe nasr s position was severely undermined and yemeni faction now hoped to see their leader juday al kirmani appointed governor in his stead indeed yazid appointed his favourite kalbi mansur ibn as governor of iraq and he in turn nominated his own brother as nasr s replacement nasr refused to accept this and was again fortunate in his persistence for mansur fell out of favour and was dismissed after only two months agitation among yemeni faction persisted amidst rumours that nasr had intercepted letters appointing al kirmani as governor and a dispute on payment of stipends to muqatila nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al kirmani from his leadership of azd as well as by trying to win over azd and rabi ah leaders this led to a general uprising by azd and rabi ah under al kirmani it is indicative of lingering intertribal antagonism of late umayyad world that rebellion was launched in name of revenge for muhallabids an azd family that had been purged after rebelling in 720 an act which had since become a symbol of yemeni resentment of umayyads and their northern arab dominated regime on 13 july 744 nasr captured and imprisoned al kirmani after barely a month latter escaped and his rebellion was joined not only by azd soldiers but also by many of arab settlers around marv a tentative truce was initially agreed upon during which fruitless negotiations were conducted but after yazid reconfirmed nasr in his post al kirmani and yemenis in reality al kirmani s followers included other tribes as well including most of syrians and even some mudaris but they were collectively called in sources resumed their revolt nasr in turn tried to strengthen his own position by enlisting services of al harith ibn surayj al kirmani s one time adversary who enjoyed considerable support among some arab tribes and especially his native when ibn surayj arrived at merv in july 745 he was enthusiastically received by town s inhabitants scorning nasr s proposals for cooperation ibn surayj soon withdrew to countryside and rose in rebellion as well ibn surayj was also able to exploit unpopularity of marwan ii among mudaris and nasr s followers even though nasr recognized him as legitimate caliph in exchange for his own confirmation to his post exploiting this resentment ibn surayj soon gathered around him an army of over 3 000 men in march 746 ibn surayj s army attacked marv but was repulsed with many casualties and he then made common cause with al kirmani of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known with marwan ii still trying to consolidate his own position in syria and mesopotamia nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement and allied armies of ibn surayj and al kirmani drove him out of merv towards end of 746 nasr retreated to nishapur but within days al kirmani and ibn surayj fell out among themselves and clashed resulting in death of ibn surayj al kirmani then destroyed tamimi quarters in city a shocking act as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in arab culture as a result mudari tribes hitherto reserved towards nasr now came over to him backed by them especially qaysis settled around nishapur nasr now resolved to take back capital during summer 747 nasr s and al kirmani s armies confronted each other before walls of marv occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months fighting stopped only when news came of start of hashimi uprising under abu muslim negotiations commenced but were almost broken off when a member of nasr s entourage an embittered son of ibn surayj attacked and killed al kirmani calmer heads prevailed for moment two sides were able to tentatively settle their differences and nasr re occupied his seat in marv tensions however remained and abu muslim soon managed to persuade al kirmani s son and successor ali that nasr had been involved in his father s murder as a result both ali al kirmani and nasr separately appealed for aid against each other to abu muslim who now held balance of power latter eventually chose to support al kirmani on 14 february 748 hashimi army occupied marv and nasr again had to flee city pursued by hashimi forces under qahtaba ibn shabib al ta i nasr was forced to abandon nishapur too after his son tamim was defeated at tus and retreat to region of qumis on western borderlands of khurasan at this point long awaited reinforcements from caliph arrived but their general and nasr failed to coordinate their movements and qahtaba was able to defeat caliph s army at rey and kill its commander nasr was now forced to abandon qumis and flee towards hamadan on way in town of sawa he fell ill and died on 9 december at age of 85 his grandson rafi ibn al layth led a large scale rebellion against misgovernment of abbasid governor ali ibn isa ibn mahan in 807 810 which spread across khurasan and transoxiana references sources category 663 births category 748 deaths category
