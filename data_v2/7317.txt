have admitted they were not computer literate and felt this was a detriment to their writing lovece p 63 gordon was disappointed in episode stating that it still qualifies as one of my biggest disappointments ranking it as worst episode of first season edwards p 47 glen morgan felt that parts of episode worked what maybe fell a little flat is that we were a little too afraid of doing hal and in a sense i think that s what building needed to have a scary personality james wong had mixed feelings saying that episode had some neat stuff at end although i think ending was a little unsatisfying to me visually as well as in terms of how mulder comes to dismember machine overall a fun episode chris carter was more supportive of episode stating that script addressed question of what made up an x file and that it doesn t always have to be paranormal he also felt positive about episode s action scenes edwards pp 47 48 broadcast and reception ghost in machine premiered on fox
