enron scandal publicized in october 2001 eventually led to bankruptcy of enron corporation an american energy company based in houston texas and de facto dissolution of arthur andersen which was one of five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in world in addition to being largest bankruptcy reorganization in american history at that time enron was cited as biggest audit failure enron was formed in 1985 by kenneth lay after merging houston natural gas and internorth several years later when jeffrey skilling was hired he developed a staff of executives that by use of accounting loopholes special purpose entities and poor financial reporting were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives not only misled enron s board of directors and audit committee on high risk accounting practices but also pressured arthur andersen to ignore issues enron shareholders filed a 40 billion lawsuit after company s stock price which achieved a high of us 90 75 per share in mid 2000 plummeted to less than 1 by end of november 2001 u s securities and exchange commission sec began an investigation and rival houston competitor dynegy offered to purchase company at a very low price deal failed and on december 2 2001 enron filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of united states bankruptcy code enron s 63 4 billion in assets made it largest corporate bankruptcy in u s history until worldcom s bankruptcy next year many executives at enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced to prison andersen was found guilty of illegally destroying documents relevant to sec investigation which voided its license to audit public companies and effectively closed firm by time ruling was overturned at u s supreme court company had lost majority of its customers and had ceased operating enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices as a consequence of scandal new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand accuracy of financial reporting for public companies one piece of legislation sarbanes oxley act increased penalties for destroying altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders act also increased accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients rise of enron thumb right 200px kenneth lay in a july 2004 mugshot in 1985 kenneth lay merged natural gas pipeline companies of houston natural gas and internorth to form enron in early 1990s he helped to initiate selling of electricity at market prices and soon after congress approved legislation deregulating sale of natural gas resulting markets made it possible for traders such as enron to sell energy at higher prices thereby significantly increasing its revenue after producers and local governments decried resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation strong lobbying on part of enron and others prevented such regulation as enron became largest seller of natural gas in north america by 1992 its trading of gas contracts earned 122 million before interest and taxes second largest contributor to company s net income november 1999 creation of trading website allowed company to better manage its contracts trading business in an attempt to achieve further growth enron pursued a diversification strategy company owned and operated a variety of assets including gas pipelines electricity plants pulp and paper plants water plants and broadband services across globe corporation also gained additional revenue by trading contracts for same array of products and services with which it was involved this included setting up power generation plants in developing countries and emerging markets including philippines subic bay indonesia and india dabhol enron s stock increased from start of 1990s until year end 1998 by 311 only modestly higher than average rate of growth in standard poor 500 index however stock increased by 56 in 1999 and a further 87 in 2000 compared to a 20 increase and a 10 decrease for index during same years by december 31 2000 enron s stock was priced at 83 13 and its market capitalization exceeded 60 billion 70 times earnings and six times book value an indication of stock market s high expectations about its future prospects in addition enron was rated most innovative large company in america in fortune magazine fortune lists fortune s most admired companies survey causes of downfall enron s complex financial statements were confusing to shareholders and analysts in addition its complex business model and unethical practices required that company use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify balance sheet to indicate favorable performance combination of these issues later resulted in bankruptcy of company and majority of them were perpetuated by indirect knowledge or direct actions of lay jeffrey skilling andrew fastow and other executives such as rebecca mark lay served as chairman of company in its last few years and approved of actions of skilling and fastow although he did not always inquire about details skilling constantly focused on meeting wall street expectations advocated use of mark to market accounting accounting based on market value which was then inflated and pressured enron executives to find new ways to hide its debt fastow and other executives created off balance sheet vehicles complex financing structures and deals so bewildering that few people could understand them revenue recognition enron and other energy suppliers earned profits by providing services such as wholesale trading and risk management in addition to building and maintaining electric power plants natural gas pipelines storage and processing facilities when accepting risk of buying and selling products merchants are allowed to report selling price as revenues and products costs as cost of goods sold in contrast an agent provides a service to customer but does not take same risks as merchants for buying and selling service providers when classified as agents may report trading and brokerage fees as revenue although not for full value of transaction although trading companies such as goldman sachs and merrill lynch used conventional agent model for reporting revenue where only trading or brokerage fee would be reported as revenue enron instead elected to report entire value of each of its trades as revenue this merchant model was considered much more aggressive in accounting interpretation than agent model enron s method of reporting inflated trading revenue was later adopted by other companies in energy trading industry in an attempt to stay competitive with company s large increase in revenue other energy companies such as duke energy reliant energy and dynegy joined enron in largest 50 of revenue based fortune 500 owing mainly to their adoption of same trading revenue accounting as enron between 1996 and 2000 enron s revenues increased by more than 750 rising from 13 3 billion in 1996 to 100 8 billion in 2000 this expansion of 65 per year was unprecedented in any industry including energy industry which typically considered growth of 2 3 per year to be respectable for just first nine months of 2001 enron reported 138 7 billion in revenues placing company at sixth position on fortune global 500 enron also used creative accounting tricks and purposefully mis classified loan transactions as sales close to quarterly reporting deadlines similar to lehman brothers repo 105 scheme in 2008 financial crisis or currency swap concealment of greek debt by goldman sachs in enron s case merrill lynch bought nigerian barges with a guarantee by enron shortly before earnings deadline enron mis reported bridge loan as a true sale then bought back barges a few months later merril lynch executives were later tried and convicted for aiding enron in its fraudulent accounting activities mark to market accounting in enron s natural gas business accounting had been fairly straightforward in each time period company listed actual costs of supplying gas and actual revenues received from selling it however when skilling joined company he demanded that trading business adopt mark to market accounting claiming that it would represent true economic value enron became first company to use method to account for its complex long term contracts mark to market accounting requires that once a long term contract has been signed income is estimated as present value of net future cash flow often viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate owing to large discrepancies between reported profits and cash investors were typically given false or misleading reports under this method income from projects could be recorded although firm might never have received money with this income increasing financial earnings on books however because in future years profits could not be included new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors as one enron competitor stated if you accelerate your income then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show same or rising income despite potential pitfalls u s securities and exchange commission sec approved accounting method for enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on january 30 1992 however enron later expanded its use to other areas in company to help it meet wall street projections for one contract in july 2000 enron and blockbuster video signed a 20 year agreement to introduce on demand entertainment to various u s cities by year s end after several pilot projects enron claimed estimated profits of more than 110 million from deal even though analysts questioned technical viability and market demand of service when network failed to work blockbuster withdrew from contract enron continued to claim future profits even though deal resulted in a loss special purpose entities enron used special purpose entities limited partnerships or companies created to fulfill a temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of special purpose entities these shell companies were created by a sponsor but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing for financial reporting purposes a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from sponsor in total by 2001 enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt enron used a number of special purpose entities such as partnerships in its thomas and condor tax shelters financial asset securitization investment trusts in apache deal real estate mortgage investment conduits remics in steele deal and remics and real estate investment trusts reits in cochise deal special purpose entities were schemes used for more than just circumventing accounting conventions as a result of one violation enron s balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity and its earnings were overstated enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities however investors were oblivious to fact that special purpose entities were actually using company s own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges this prevented enron from being protected from downside risk notable examples of special purpose entities that enron employed were jedi chewco whitewing and ljm jedi and chewco in 1993 enron established a joint venture in energy investments with calpers california state pension fund called joint energy development investments jedi in 1997 skilling serving as chief operating officer coo asked calpers to join enron in a separate investment calpers was interested in idea but only if it could be terminated as a partner in jedi however enron did not want to show any debt from assuming calpers stake in jedi on its balance sheet chief financial officer cfo fastow developed special purpose entity chewco investments limited partnership l p which raised debt guaranteed by enron and was used to acquire calpers s joint venture stake for 383 million because of fastow s organization of chewco jedi s losses were kept off of enron s balance sheet in autumn 2001 calpers and enron s arrangement was discovered which required discontinuation of enron s prior accounting method for chewco and jedi this disqualification revealed that enron s reported earnings from 1997 to mid 2001 would need to be reduced by 405 million and that company s indebtedness would increase by 628 million whitewing whitewing was name of a special purpose entity used as a financing method by enron in december 1997 with funding of 579 million provided by enron and 500 million by an outside investor whitewing associates l p was formed two years later entity s arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with enron and be counted on company s balance sheet whitewing was used to purchase enron assets including stakes in power plants pipelines stocks and other investments between 1999 and 2001 whitewing bought assets from enron worth 2 billion using enron stock as collateral although transactions were approved by enron board asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans ljm and raptors in 1999 fastow formulated two limited partnerships ljm cayman l p and ljm2 co investment l p ljm2 for purpose of buying enron s poorly performing stocks and stakes to improve its financial statements ljm 1 and 2 were created solely to serve as outside equity investor needed for special purpose entities that were being used by enron fastow had to go before board of directors to receive an exemption from enron s code of ethics as he had title of cfo in order to manage companies two partnerships were funded with around 390 million provided by wachovia j p morgan chase credit suisse first boston citigroup and other investors merrill lynch which marketed equity also contributed 22 million to fund entities enron transferred to raptor i iv four ljm related special purpose entities named after velociraptors in jurassic park more than 1 2 billion in assets including millions of shares of enron common stock and long term rights to purchase millions more shares plus 150 million of enron notes payable as disclosed in company s financial statement footnotes special purpose entities had been used to pay for all of this using entities debt instruments footnotes also declared that instruments face amount totaled 1 5 billion and entities notional amount of 2 1 billion had been used to enter into derivative contracts with enron enron capitalized raptors and in a manner similar to accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering then booked notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing shareholders equity for same amount this treatment later became an issue for enron and its auditor arthur andersen as removing it from balance sheet resulted in a 1 2 billion decrease in net shareholders equity eventually derivative contracts worth 2 1 billion lost significant value swaps were established at time stock price achieved its maximum during ensuing year value of portfolio under swaps fell by 1 1 billion as stock prices decreased loss of value meant that special purpose entities technically now owed enron 1 1 billion by contracts enron which used a mark to market accounting method claimed a 500 million gain on swap contracts in its 2000 annual report gain was responsible for offsetting its stock portfolio losses and was attributed to nearly a third of enron s earnings for 2000 before it was properly restated in 2001 corporate governance on paper enron had a model board of directors comprising predominantly outsiders with significant ownership stakes and a talented audit committee in its 2000 review of best corporate boards chief executive included enron among its five best boards even with its complex corporate governance and network of intermediaries enron was still able to attract large sums of capital to fund a questionable business model conceal its true performance through a series of accounting and financing maneuvers and hype its stock to unsustainable levels executive compensation although enron s compensation and performance management system was designed to retain and reward its most valuable employees system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short term earnings to maximize bonuses employees constantly tried to start deals often disregarding quality of cash flow or profits in order to get a better rating for their performance review additionally accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with company s stock price this practice helped ensure deal makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options company was constantly emphasizing its stock price management was compensated extensively using stock options similar to other u s companies this policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to give appearance of reported earnings to meet wall street s expectations stock ticker was located in lobbies elevators and on company computers at budget meetings skilling would develop target earnings by asking what earnings do you need to keep our stock price up and that number would be used even if it was not feasible on december 31 2000 enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans approximately 13 of common shares outstanding enron s proxy statement stated that within three years these awards were expected to be exercised using enron s january 2001 stock price of 83 13 and directors beneficial ownership reported in 2001 proxy value of director stock ownership was 659 million for lay and 174 million for skilling skilling believed that if employees were constantly worried about cost it would hinder original thinking as a result extravagant spending was rampant throughout company especially among executives employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes twice as much as competitors in 1998 top 200 highest paid employees received 193 million from salaries bonuses and stock two years later figure jumped to 1 4 billion risk management before its scandal enron was lauded for its sophisticated financial risk management tools risk management was crucial to enron not only because of its regulatory environment but also because of its business plan enron established long term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for invariable fluctuation of future energy prices enron s bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities by hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned enron retained risks associated with transactions this arrangement had enron implementing hedges with itself enron s aggressive accounting practices were not hidden from board of directors as later learned by a senate subcommittee board was informed of rationale for using whitewing ljm and raptor transactions and after approving them received status updates on entities operations although not all of enron s widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to board practices were dependent on board decisions even though enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business company s finance committee and board did not have enough experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how derivatives were organized board would have prevented their use financial audit enron s auditor firm arthur andersen was accused of applying reckless standards in its audits because of a conflict of interest over significant consulting fees generated by enron during 2000 arthur andersen earned 25 million in audit fees and 27 million in consulting fees this amount accounted for roughly 27 of audit fees of public clients for arthur andersen s houston office auditor s methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing enron s revenue recognition special entities derivatives and other accounting practices enron hired numerous certified public accountants as well as accountants who had worked on developing accounting rules with financial accounting standards board accountants searched for new ways to save company money including capitalizing on loopholes found in generally accepted accounting principles gaap accounting industry s standards one enron accountant revealed we tried to aggressively use literature gaap to our advantage all rules create all these opportunities we got to where we did because we exploited that weakness andersen s auditors were pressured by enron s management to defer recognizing charges from special purpose entities as its credit risks became known since entities would never return a profit accounting guidelines required that enron should take a write off where value of entity was removed from balance sheet at a loss to pressure andersen into meeting enron s earnings expectations enron would occasionally allow accounting companies ernst young or pricewaterhousecoopers to complete accounting tasks to create illusion of hiring a new company to replace andersen although andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners it failed to prevent conflict of interest in one case andersen s houston office which performed enron audit was able to overrule any critical reviews of enron s accounting decisions by andersen s chicago partner in addition after news of u s securities and exchange commission sec investigations of enron were made public andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30 000 e mails and computer files causing accusations of a cover up revelations concerning andersen s overall performance led to break up of firm and to following assessment by powers committee appointed by enron s board to look into firm s accounting in october 2001 evidence available to us suggests that andersen did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in connection with its audits of enron s financial statements or its obligation to bring to attention of enron s board or audit and compliance committee concerns about enron s internal contracts over related party transactions audit committee corporate audit committees usually meet just a few times during year and their members typically have only modest experience with accounting and finance enron s audit committee had more expertise than many it included robert of stanford university a widely respected accounting professor and former dean of stanford business school john mendelsohn president of university of texas m d anderson cancer center paulo pereira former president and ceo of state bank of rio de janeiro in brazil john former united kingdom secretary of state for energy and parliamentary secretary to treasury ronnie chan chairman of hong kong hang lung group wendy gramm former chair of u s commodity futures trading commission enron s audit committee was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover large amounts of material in one meeting on february 12 2001 committee met for an hour and a half enron s audit committee did not have technical knowledge to question auditors properly on accounting issues related to company s special purpose entities committee was also unable to question company s management due to pressures on committee united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations of committee on governmental affairs report accused board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring company s accounting practices when enron s scandal became public audit committee s conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion ethical and political analyses commentators attributed mismanagement behind enron s fall to a variety of ethical and political economic causes ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris a lack of corporate social responsibility situation ethics and get it done business pragmatism kristen hayes executives greed big factor in enron crash probe shows seattle times august 23 2002 bethany mclean why enron went bust start with arrogance fortune december 24 2001 duane windsor business ethics

bradley jr enron perils of interventionism library of economics and liberty other accounting issues enron made a habit of booking costs of cancelled projects as assets with rationale that no official letter had stated that project was cancelled this method was known as snowball and although it was initially dictated that such practices be used only for projects worth less than 90 million it was later increased to 200 million in 1998 when analysts were given a tour of enron energy services office they were impressed with how employees were working so vigorously in reality skilling had moved other employees to office from other departments instructing them to pretend to work hard to create appearance that division was larger than it was this ruse was used several times to fool analysts about progress of different areas of enron to help improve stock price timeline of downfall on september 20 2000 a reporter at wall street journal dallas bureau wrote a story about how mark to market accounting had become prevalent in energy industry he noted that outsiders had no real way of knowing assumptions on which companies that use mark to market base their earnings while it only appeared in texas journal texas regional edition of journal short seller jim chanos happened to read it and decided to check enron s 10 k report for himself he didn t think it made sense that enron s broadband unit appeared to far outpace a then troubled broadband industry he also noticed that company was burning through its invested capital and was alarmed by large chunks of stock being sold by insiders in november 2000 he decided to short enron s stock in february 2001 chief accounting officer rick causey told budget managers from an accounting standpoint this will be our easiest year ever we ve got 2001 in bag on march 5 bethany mclean s fortune article is enron overpriced questioned how enron could maintain its high stock value which was trading at 55 times its earnings she argued that analysts and investors did not know exactly how enron made money mclean was first drawn to company s financial situation after chanos suggested she view company s 10 k for herself in a post mortem interview with washington post mclean recalled finding strange transactions erratic cash flow and huge debt debt was biggest red flag to mclean she wondered how a supposedly profitable company could be adding debt at such a rapid rate later in her book smartest guys in room she recalled speaking off record with a number of people in investment community who were growing skeptical about enron mclean telephoned skilling to discuss her findings prior to publishing article but he called her unethical for not properly researching company fastow cited two fortune reporters that enron could not reveal earnings details as company had more than 1 200 trading books for assorted commodities and did not want anyone to know what s on those books we don t want to tell anyone where we re making money in a conference call on april 17 2001 then chief executive officer ceo skilling verbally attacked wall street analyst richard grubman who questioned enron s unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference call when grubman complained that enron was only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements skilling stammered well uh thank you very much we appreciate it asshole this became an inside joke among many enron employees mocking grubman for his perceived meddling rather than skilling s offensiveness with slogans such as ask why asshole a variation on enron s official slogan ask why however skilling s comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public as he had previously disdained criticism of enron coolly or humorously by late 1990s enron s stock was trading for 80 90 per share and few seemed to concern themselves with opacity of company s financial disclosures in mid july 2001 enron reported revenues of 50 1 billion almost triple year to date and beating analysts estimates by 3 cents a share despite this enron s profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2 1 and its share price had decreased by more than 30 since same quarter of 2000 as time passed a number of serious concerns confronted company enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit and losses from constructing dabhol power project a large gas powered power plant in india that had been mired in controversy since beginning in relation to its high pricing and bribery at highest level these were subsequently confirmed in 2002 senate investigation there was also increasing criticism of company for role that its subsidiary enron energy services had in california electricity crisis of 2000 2001 on august 14 skilling announced he was resigning his position as ceo after only six months skilling had long served as president and coo before being promoted to ceo skilling cited personal reasons for leaving company observers noted that in months before his exit skilling had sold at minimum 450 000 shares of enron at a value of around 33 million though he still owned over a million shares at date of his departure nevertheless lay who was serving as chairman at enron assured surprised market watchers that there would be no change in performance or outlook of company going forward from skilling s departure lay announced he himself would re assume position of chief executive officer next day however skilling admitted that a very significant reason for his departure was enron s faltering price in stock market economist paul krugman asserted in his new york times column that enron was an illustration of consequences that occur from deregulation and commodification of things such as energy a few days later in a letter to editor kenneth lay defended enron and philosophy of company on august 15 sherron watkins vice president for corporate development sent an anonymous letter to lay warning him about company s accounting practices one statement in letter said i am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals watkins contacted a friend who worked for arthur andersen and he drafted a memorandum to give to audit partners about points she raised on august 22 watkins met individually with lay and gave him a six page letter further explaining enron s accounting issues lay questioned her as to whether she had told anyone outside of company and then vowed to have company s law firm vinson elkins review issues although she argued that using law firm would present a conflict of interest lay consulted with other executives and although they wanted to dismiss watkins as texas law did not protect company whistleblowers they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit on october 15 vinson elkins announced that enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as andersen had approved each issue investors confidence declines by end of august 2001 his company s stock value still falling lay named greg whalley president and coo of enron wholesale services to succeed skilling as president and coo of entire company he also named mark frevert as vice chairman and appointed whalley and frevert to positions in chairman s office some observers suggested that enron s investors were in significant need of reassurance not only because company s business was difficult to understand even indecipherable but also because it was difficult to properly describe company in financial statements one analyst stated it s really hard for analysts to determine where enron are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money lay accepted that enron s business was very complex but asserted that analysts would never get all information they want to satisfy their curiosity he also explained that complexity of business was due largely to tax strategies and position hedging lay s efforts seemed to meet with limited success by september 9 one prominent hedge fund manager noted that enron stock is trading under a cloud sudden departure of skilling combined with opacity of enron s accounting books made proper assessment difficult for wall street in addition company admitted to repeatedly using related party transactions which some feared could be too easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on enron s own balance sheet a particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of related party entities had been or were being controlled by cfo fastow after september 11 attacks media attention shifted away from company and its troubles a little less than a month later enron announced its intention to begin process of selling its lower margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading this policy included selling portland general electric to another oregon utility northwest natural gas for about 1 9 billion in cash and stock and possibly selling its 65 stake in dabhol project in india restructuring losses and sec investigation on october 16 2001 enron announced that restatements to its financial statements for years 1997 to 2000 were necessary to correct accounting violations restatements for period reduced earnings by 613 million or 23 of reported profits during period increased liabilities at end of 2000 by 628 million 6 of reported liabilities and 5 5 of reported equity and reduced equity at end of 2000 by 1 2 billion 10 of reported equity additionally in january jeff skilling had asserted that broadband unit alone was worth 35 billion a claim also mistrusted an analyst at standard poor s said i don t think anyone knows what broadband operation is worth enron s management team claimed losses were mostly due to investment losses along with charges such as about 180 million in money spent restructuring company s troubled broadband trading unit in a statement lay said after a thorough review of our businesses we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses some analysts were unnerved david fleischer at goldman sachs an analyst termed previously one of company s strongest supporters asserted that enron management lost credibility and have to themselves they need to convince investors these earnings are real that company is for real and that growth will be realized fastow disclosed to enron s board of directors on october 22 that he earned 30 million from compensation arrangements when managing ljm limited partnerships that day share price of enron decreased to 20 65 down 5 40 in one day after announcement by sec that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by enron characterizing them as some of most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen attempting to explain billion dollar charge and calm investors enron s disclosures spoke of share settled collar arrangements derivative instruments which eliminated contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts and strategies that served to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how enron managed its business regarding sec investigation chairman and ceo lay said we will cooperate fully with sec and look forward to opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest two days later on october 25 fastow was removed as cfo despite lay s assurances as early as previous day that he and board had confidence in him in announcing fastow s ouster lay said in my continued discussions with financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo move came after several banks refused to issue loans to enron as long as fastow remained cfo however with skilling and fastow now both departed some analysts feared that revealing company s practices would be made all more difficult enron s stock was now trading at 16 41 having lost half its value in a little more than a week jeff mcmahon head of industrial markets succeeded fastow as cfo his first task was to deal with a cash crisis a day earlier enron discovered that it was unable to roll its commercial paper effectively losing access to several billion dollars in financing company had actually experienced difficulty selling its commercial paper for a week but was now unable to sell even overnight paper on october 27 company began buying back all its commercial paper valued at around 3 3 billion in an effort to calm investor fears about enron s supply of cash enron financed re purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks while company s debt rating was still considered investment grade its bonds were trading at levels slightly less making future sales problematic as month came to a close serious concerns were being raised by some observers regarding enron s possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules however analysis was claimed to be impossible based on incomplete information provided by enron industry analysts feared that enron was new long term capital management hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of international financial markets enron s tremendous presence worried some about consequences of company s possible bankruptcy enron executives accepted questions in written form only credit rating downgrade main short term danger to enron s survival at end of october 2001 seemed to be its credit rating it was reported at time that moody s and fitch two of three biggest credit rating agencies had slated enron for review for possible downgrade such a downgrade would force enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed which would decrease value of existing stock further additionally all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with enron especially in long term in event that enron s rating were lowered below investment grade a possible hindrance for future transactions analysts and observers continued their complaints regarding difficulty or impossibility of properly assessing a company whose financial statements were so cryptic some feared that no one at enron apart from skilling and fastow could completely explain years of mysterious transactions you re getting way over my head said lay during late august 2001 in response to detailed questions about enron s business a reaction that worried analysts on october 29 responding to growing concerns that enron might have insufficient cash on hand news spread that enron was seeking a further 1 2 billion in financing from banks next day as feared moody s lowered enron s credit rating from baa1 to two levels above junk status standard poor s affirmed enron s rating of bbb equivalent of moody s baa1 moody s also warned that it would downgrade enron s commercial paper rating consequence of which would likely prevent company from finding further financing it sought to keep solvent november began with disclosure that sec was now pursuing a formal investigation prompted by questions related to enron s dealings with related parties enron s board also announced that it would commission a special committee to investigate transactions directed by william c powers dean of university of texas law school next day an editorial in new york times demanded an aggressive investigation into matter enron was able to secure an additional 1 billion in financing from cross town rival dynegy on november 2 but news was not universally admired in that debt was secured by assets from company s valuable northern natural gas and pipeline proposed buyout by dynegy sources claimed that enron was planning to explain its business practices more fully within coming days as a confidence building gesture enron s stock was now trading at around 7 and by this time it was obvious that enron could not stay independent however investors worried that company would not be able to find a buyer after enron had received a wide spectrum of rejections enron management apparently found a buyer when board of dynegy another energy trader based in houston voted late at night on november 7 to acquire enron at a very low price of about 8 billion in stock chevron texaco which at time owned about a quarter of dynegy agreed to provide enron with 2 5 billion in cash specifically 1 billion at first and rest when deal was completed dynegy would also be required to assume nearly 13 billion of debt plus any other debt hitherto occluded by enron management s secretive business practices possibly as much as 10 billion in hidden debt dynegy and enron confirmed their deal on november 8 2001 with enron in a state of near collapse deal was largely on dynegy s terms dynegy would be surviving company and dynegy ceo charles watson and his management team would head merged company enron would get three seats on board one of which would go to lay of enron s senior executives only whalley would join merged company s c suite as an executive vice president agreed to invest 1 5 billion into enron to keep it alive until deal closed commentators remarked on different corporate cultures between dynegy and enron and on watson s straight talking personality some wondered if enron s troubles had not simply been result of innocent accounting errors by november enron was asserting that billion plus one time charges disclosed in october should in reality have been 200 million with rest of amount simply corrections of dormant accounting mistakes many feared other mistakes and restatements might yet be revealed another major correction of enron s earnings was announced on november 9 with a reduction of 591 million of stated revenue of years 1997 2000 charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships jedi and chewco corrections resulted in virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997 with significant reductions for other years despite this disclosure dynegy declared it still intended to purchase enron both companies were said to be anxious to receive an official assessment of proposed sale from moody s and s p presumably to understand effect completion of any buyout transaction would have on dynegy and enron s credit rating in addition concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture along with what to some observers were radically different corporate cultures of enron and dynegy both companies promoted deal aggressively and some observers were hopeful watson was praised for attempting to create largest company on energy market at time watson said we feel enron is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens next few months one analyst called deal a whopper a very good deal financially certainly should be a good deal strategically and provides some immediate balance sheet backstop for enron credit issues were becoming more critical however around time buyout was made public moody s and s p both reduced enron s rating to just one notch above junk status were company s rating to fall below investment grade its ability to trade would be severely limited if there was a reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors in a conference call s p affirmed that were enron not to be bought s p would reduce its rating to low bb or high b ratings noted as being within junk status additionally many traders had limited their involvement with enron or stopped doing business altogether fearing more bad news watson again attempted to re assure attesting at a presentation to investors that there was nothing wrong with enron s business he also acknowledged that remunerative steps in form of more stock options would have to be taken to redress animosity of many enron employees towards management after it was revealed that lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock during months prior to crisis situation was not helped by disclosure that lay his reputation in tatters stood to receive a payment of 60 million as a change of control fee subsequent to dynegy acquisition while many enron employees had seen their retirement accounts which were based largely on enron stock ravaged as price decreased 90 in a year an official at a company owned by enron stated we had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as 800 000 or 900 000 it pretty much wiped out every employee s savings plan watson assured investors that true nature of enron s business had been made apparent to him we have comfort there is not another shoe to drop if there is no shoe this is a phenomenally good transaction watson further asserted that enron s energy trading part alone was worth price dynegy was paying for whole company by mid november enron announced it was planning to sell about 8 billion worth of underperforming assets along with a general plan to reduce its scale for sake of financial stability on november 19 enron disclosed to public further evidence of its critical state of affairs most that company had debt repayment obligations in range of 9 billion by end of 2002 such debts were vastly in excess of its available cash also success of measures to preserve its solvency were not guaranteed specifically as regarded asset sales and debt refinancing in a statement enron revealed an adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on enron s ability to continue as a going concern two days later on november 21 wall street expressed serious doubts that dynegy would proceed with its deal at all or would seek to radically renegotiate furthermore enron revealed in a 10 q filing that almost all money it had recently borrowed for purposes including buying its commercial paper or about 5 billion had been exhausted in just 50 days analysts were unnerved at revelation especially since dynegy was reported to have also been unaware of enron s rate of cash use in order to end proposed buyout dynegy would need to legally demonstrate a material change in circumstances of transaction as late as november 22 sources close to dynegy were skeptical that latest revelations constituted sufficient grounds indeed while lay assumed that one of his underlings had shared 10 q with dynegy officials no one at dynegy saw it until it was released to public it subsequently emerged that enron s traders had grabbed much of money from dynegy s cash infusion and used it to guarantee payment to their trading partners when it came time to settle up sec announced it had filed civil fraud complaints against andersen a few days later sources claimed enron and dynegy were renegotiating terms of their arrangement dynegy now demanded enron agree to be bought for 4 billion rather than previous 8 billion observers were reporting difficulties in ascertaining which of enron s operations if any were profitable reports described an en masse shift of business to enron s competitors for sake of risk exposure reduction bankruptcy thumb right alt line chart showing gradual fall illustrated by a red line from a maximum of 90 to less than a dollar enron s stock price

two worst possible outcomes came true credit rating agencies all reduced enron s credit rating to junk status and dynegy s board tore up merger agreement on watson s advice watson later said at end you couldn t give it enron to me although they had seemingly ironed out a number of outstanding issues at a meeting in new york over previous weekend ultimately dynegy s concerns about enron s liquidity and dwindling business proved insurmountable company had very little cash with which to operate let alone satisfy enormous debts its stock price fell to 0 61 at end of day s trading one editorial observer wrote that enron is now shorthand for perfect financial storm systemic consequences were felt as enron s creditors and other energy trading companies suffered loss of several percentage points some analysts felt enron s failure indicated risks of post september 11 economy and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could question now became how to determine total exposure of markets and other traders to enron s failure early calculations estimated 18 7 billion one adviser stated we don t really know who is out there exposed to enron s credit i m telling my clients to prepare for worst within 24 hours speculation abounded that enron would have no choice but to file for bankruptcy enron was estimated to have about 23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans citigroup and jp morgan chase in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with enron s bankruptcy additionally many of enron s major assets were pledged to lenders in order to secure loans causing doubt about what if anything unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings as it turned out new corporate treasurer ray bowen had known as early as day dynegy pulled out of deal that enron was headed for bankruptcy he spent most of next two days scrambling to find a bank who would take enron s remaining cash after pulling all of its money out of citibank he was ultimately forced to make do with a small houston bank by close of business on november 30 2001 it was obvious enron was at end of its tether
