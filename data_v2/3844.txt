individual members are sometimes responsible for writing majority of a particular song notorious stuart brothers a date with peter buck bucketfull of brains december 1987 each member is given an equal vote in songwriting process however buck has conceded that stipe as band s lyricist can rarely be persuaded to follow an idea he does not favor among original line up there were divisions of labor in songwriting process stipe would write lyrics and devise melodies buck would edge band in new musical directions and mills and berry would fine tune compositions due to their greater musical experience michael stipe sings in what r e m biographer david buckley described as wailing keening arching vocal figures stipe often harmonizes with mills in songs in chorus for stand mills and stipe alternate singing lyrics creating a dialogue early articles about band focused on stipe s singing style described as mumbling by washington post which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable creem writer john morthland wrote in his review of murmur i still have no idea what these songs are about because neither me nor anyone else i know has ever been able to discern r e m s lyrics stipe commented in 1984 it s just way i sing if i tried to control it it would be pretty false producer joe boyd convinced stipe to begin singing more clearly during recording of fables of reconstruction stipe later called chorus lyrics of sitting still from r e m debut album murmur nonsense saying in a 1994 online chat you all know there aren t words per se to a lot of early stuff i can t even remember them in truth stipe carefully crafted lyrics to many early r e m songs stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like simple pictures but after a year he grew tired of approach and started experimenting with lyrics that didn t make exact linear sense and it s just gone from there in mid 1980s as stipe s pronunciation while singing became clearer band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level mills explained after you ve made three records and you ve written several songs and they ve gotten better and better lyrically next step would be to have somebody question you and say are you saying anything and michael had confidence at that point to say yes songs like cuyahoga and fall on me on lifes rich pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on document and green our political activism and content of songs was just a reaction to where we were and what we were surrounded by which was just abject horror stipe said later in 1987 and 88 there was nothing to do but be active stipe has since explored other lyrical topics automatic for people dealt with mortality and dying pretty turgid stuff according to stipe while monster critiqued love and mass culture musically stipe stated that bands like t rex and mott hoople really impacted me alt peter buck playing guitar and

guitar player but said it was byrds influenced bands including big star and soft boys that inspired him more comparisons were also made with guitar playing of johnny marr of alternative rock contemporaries smiths while buck professed being a fan of group he admitted he initially criticized band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by marr whose band had in fact made their debut after r e m buck generally eschews guitar solos he explained in 2002 i know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo people go nuts but i don t write songs that suit that and i am not interested in that i can do it if i have to but i don t like it mike mills melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by paul mccartney of beatles and chris squire of yes mills has said i always played a melodic bass like a piano bass in some ways i never wanted to play traditional locked into kick drum root note bass work mills has more musical training than his bandmates which he has

celebrity status to support political and humanitarian causes he is seen here at 2007 tribeca film festival which was created to renew that neighborhood of new york city after september 11 attacks throughout r e m s career its members sought to highlight social and political issues according to los angeles times r e m was considered to be one of united states most liberal and politically correct rock groups band s members were on same page politically sharing a liberal and progressive outlook mills admitted that there was occasionally dissension between band members on what causes they might support but acknowledged out of respect for people who disagree those discussions tend to stay in house just because we d rather not let people know where divisions lie so people can t exploit them for their own purposes an example is that in 1990 buck noted that stipe was involved with people for ethical treatment of animals but rest of band were not r e m helped raise funds for environmental feminist and human rights causes and were involved in campaigns to encourage voter registration during green tour stipe spoke on stage to audiences about a variety of socio political issues through late 1980s and 1990s band particularly stipe increasingly used its media coverage on national television to mention a variety of causes it felt were important one example is during 1991 mtv video music awards stipe wore a half dozen white shirts emblazoned with slogans including rainforest love knows no colors and handgun control now r e m helped raise awareness of aung san suu kyi and human rights violations in burma when they worked with freedom campaign and us campaign for burma stipe himself ran ads for 1988 supporting democratic presidential candidate and massachusetts governor michael dukakis over then vice president george h w bush in 2004 band participated in vote for change tour that sought to mobilize american voters to support democratic presidential candidate john kerry r e m s political stance particularly coming from a wealthy rock band under contract to a label owned by a multinational corporation received criticism from former q editor paul du noyer who criticized band s celebrity liberalism saying it s an entirely pain free form of rebellion that they re adopting there s no risk involved in it whatsoever but quite a bit of shoring up of customer loyalty from late 1980s r e m was involved in local politics of its hometown of athens georgia buck explained to sounds in 1987 michael always says think local and act local we have been doing a lot of stuff in our town to try and make it a better place band often donated funds to local charities and to help renovate and preserve historic buildings in town r e m s political clout was credited with narrow election of athens mayor gwen o looney twice in 1990s band is a member of canadian charity artists against racism members alt musicians huddled around a piano thumb r e m on their final
