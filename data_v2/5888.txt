glasgow paisley kilmarnock and ayr railway gpk ar was a railway in scotland that provided train services between glasgow kilmarnock and ayr it opened its first line between glasgow and ayr in stages from 1839 to 1840 section between glasgow and paisley was made jointly with glasgow paisley and greenock railway later it built a line from dalry via kilmarnock to cumnock linking there with glasgow dumfries and carlisle railway and together forming a through route from glasgow to carlisle two companies merged to form glasgow and south western railway original main line from glasgow to ayr and line from kilmarnock to carlisle are in use today although many intermediate stations and branch lines have closed history earliest lines coal and other minerals were extracted in west of scotland from medieval times getting heavy product to market was always a challenge and this encouraged development of tracked systems earliest used l shaped rails and wagons had plain wheels guidance was achieved through of l and wagons could run conveniently on ordinary ground at terminals for example in vicinity of ayr date from at latest 1775 harry broad rails to ayr 18th and 19th century coal ayr archaeological and natural history society 1991 in 1812 kilmarnock and troon railway opened also a horse operated plateway constructed to carry coal from kilmarnock area to harbour at troon for onward conveyance by coastal shipping it was first railway in scotland to have an authorising act of parliament in late 1820s several further mineral railways were constructed in west of scotland monkland and kirkintilloch railway opened in 1826 proved a remarkable success in carrying coal from collieries near airdrie and was quickly followed by railway these coal railways used horse traction mostly and short cast iron rails on stone block sleepers key technical advance was that they used edge rails guidance was provided by flanges on wheels of wagons these lines showed way forward c j a

1831 ardrossan railway opened it too was a horse operated line using stone block sleepers but passenger operation was a major part of its objective it was conceived as a means of developing ardrossan harbour as sea port for glasgow however promoters were unable to raise sufficient money to build whole of their line moreover recent improvements to navigability of river clyde enabled sea going ships to reach city accordingly line was truncated and only reached a terminal at kilwinning and collieries east of that town nonetheless it was a considerable commercial success carrying passengers and in enabling coal particularly from pits belonging to earl of eglinton to be exported at ardrossan and it further emphasised viability of railways liverpool and manchester railway had opened previous year and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from parallel canal and indicated that longer distances not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery could be dealt with and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next when grand junction railway was authorised in 1833 it was possible to consider that railways might one day link central scotland and south of england david ross glasgow and south western railway a history publishing limited catrine 2014 glasgow to ayr and kilmarnock by 1835 idea of building a railway from glasgow into ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from john miller a partner in firm of grainger and miller which had been heavily involved in earlier railways in west of scotland miller proposed a route from tradeston in glasgow at south end of glasgow bridge through paisley and valley to kilwinning and ayr with a branch from dalry to kilmarnock cost was to be ps550 000 and a 10 return could be expected notwithstanding south westerly course of line it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in england interests in kilmarnock were dismayed to be consigned to a branch line and burgh council of kilmarnock commissioned scott stephen and gale an engineering partnership which was not to make a mark on railway engineering robertson page 138 to plan a more direct route plotting a direct route was easy but gradients were severe earthworks would be formidable and there was much less intermediate business gale was a rival canal company s engineer and was hardly impartial it was necessary to bring in someone to settle matter george stephenson gave a report supporting miller s choice of route raising capital proved straightforward and it was possible to present a bill for line in 1837 session of parliament there was strenuous opposition from river and canal interests but this was overcome at time glasgow paisley and greenock railway gp gr was also promoting its line with a similar route from tradeston to paisley it became obvious that parliament would be hostile to formation of two adjacent lines so it was determined to build line jointly as far as paisley both gpk ar and gp gr received royal assent on 15 july 1837 glasgow paisley kilmarnock and ayr railway act authorised share capital of ps625 000 and 300 in loans line was to be constructed simultaneously from each end to prevent experience of ardrossan railway which failed to build eastern end of its authorised line whishaw p page 77 gauge of new line was not yet determined although estimates had been prepared on basis that it would not exceed 6 feet many of grainger and miller s lines had been to a gauge of 4 ft 6in dundee and railway 1831 had been at 4 ft 6 1 2in 1 384 mm and dundee and arbroath railway authorised in 1836 was to be 5 ft 6in 1 676 mm connections to local railways were considered important in determining gauge but engineer joseph locke urged that conformity to gauge of english railways was important and in end this was adopted standard gauge 4 ft 8 1 2in 1 435 mm locke was advising glasgow paisley and greenock company and it was their decision to conform to gauge of railways in england that obliged gpk ar to follow suit campbell glasgow and south western railway oakwood press lingfield 1965 construction starts construction of line supervised by grainger miller proved challenging as a large scale contracting industry was not yet in place in scotland nor was large scale financing sls page 2 at end of 1838 miller was instructed to build a branch from barassie to troon harbour earlier thoughts of taking over kilmarnock and troon railway and converting it as it was then still a horse operated plateway having been dropped in 1839 ardrossan and johnstone railway was engaged in converting its gauge to standard so as to with gpk ar with which it was to connect at kilwinning and following year it changed its name to ardrossan railway opening in stages after a directors special run between ayr north of river at newton on ayr and irvine on 19 july 1839 line opened to public between those points on 5 august 1839 eglinton tournament held on friday 30 august resulted in huge demand for tickets for railway this was an enormous success and that limited section of line made a surplus of ps500 from opening to end of that year section between irvine and kilwinning opened on 23 march 1840 on 13 july 1840 joint line between paisley and a temporary terminus in glasgow at bridge street was ready for a demonstration

construction of main line was stated to have overrun estimated costs considerably and at a shareholders meeting in february 1841 it was stated that as a result kilmarnock branch could not be started until authority for additional capital had been obtained and of course money actually raised kilmarnock had to be content with a coach connection until line there from dalry junction opened on 4 april

instituted fast steamer fire king plied on alternate days between ardrossan and liverpool from may 1841 english terminal was transferred to fleetwood following opening of preston wyre railway and dock company service only lasted a few days and was not a commercial success gpk ar sold vessel to james burns who continued service but soon withdrew it transferring boat to a route to ireland railway route to england thumb site of closed monkton station in time gpk ar was authorised controversy raged about route a railway to england might take it was plain that carlisle would be reached from south a direct route from glasgow over southern uplands route that became known as annandale line would involve severe gradients and pass through almost unpopulated territory locomotives available at time were not thought to be capable of climbing steep inclines and rope haulage was put forward by some as solution by contrast a route from kilmarnock through cumnock and dumfries nithsdale line would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres bringing in additional traffic moreover nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build government intervened and in 1839 appointed two royal commissioners to determine way forward at this time there was a presumption that one railway route from scotland to england would suffice but which there was no consensus between expert witnesses and in 1840 commissioners reported that annandale route should prevail but promoters must prove their bona fide intention to complete english portion of line otherwise preference would be given to east coast route from edinburgh via berwick upon tweed and newcastle upon tyne this stalled whole process there was no such single group as promoters of any route via carlisle and in fact lancaster and carlisle railway was not authorised until 1844 report of commissioners was not binding and rivalry between supporters of two routes intensified an independent glasgow dumfries and carlisle railway was proposed to build from carlisle to meet gpk ar and gpk ar itself proposed several branches mostly for tactical reasons to weaken or exclude caledonian railway cr as dominant supporter of annandale route of these only an extension from kilmarnock to horsecleugh south of mining town of old cumnock was authorised by act of 21 july 1845 cr case was strengthened by its intended branch to edinburgh that is proposed line from carlisle would fork and serve both glasgow and edinburgh while a route via dumfries and kilmarnock could not reach edinburgh so directly moreover locomotive designs were being improved and capacity to haul trains over steep gradients of annandale route was diminishing in importance in parliamentary hearings in 1845 caledonian railway passed commons and despite gpk ar fighting on in lords caledonian railway was authorised in preference to nithsdale route on 31 july 1845 glasgow dumfries and carlisle railway felt setback most keenly as it had no railway and had just been refused sanction to build one a resilient mood but then collapse gpk ar was at least able to see a positive future without line to carlisle a 6 dividend was declared in august 1845 shareholders approved lease of kilmarnock and troon railway k tr as a horse operated plateway this would need to be converted and upgraded at a cost of ps40 000 but process would give much improved access to harbour for collieries in area in addition a mineral line was to be built from auchinleck on cumnock extension to muirkirk there had long been an ironworks at

experienced a snowstorm of bills for new railways many of these threatened to encroach on gpk ar area of influence and abstract business several schemes were promoted by caledonian railway or its allies in self defence gpk ar itself promoted numerous schemes in fact 25 branches as well as a bill nominally by k tr to authorise modernisation works to head off some of encroachment in this session remodelled glasgow dumfries and carlisle railway got its authorising act of parliament on 13 august or 16 july to build from horsecleugh near cumnock southern limit of gpk ar authorisation to gretna junction reaching carlisle from gretna over caledonian railway line act stipulated that on actual completion of construction gd cr should merge with gpk ar to form a new company glasgow and south western railway this huge volume of intended activity was fuelled by financial speculation railway mania it appeared that fortunes could be made by subscribing to shares in new lines and subscriber only had to put a small deposit down until construction got under way over optimism led to stark inability to pay up when calls for cash on subscribed shares came in and suddenly money was impossible to come by most of speculative schemes collapsed at once regaining momentum thumb ballochmyle in difficulties for cash gd cr started construction obstructions by caledonian railway at gretna end were eventually resolved and a fresh act structuring merger with gpk ar was passed on 9 july 1847 but so heavily amended as to be useless to companies ross g swr page 31 on 1 march 1847 kilmarnock and troon line reopened as a standard gauge locomotive operated railway it had been closed for modernisation work and it now provided a proper link from kilmarnock to coast gpk ar opened a short

proposed paisley barrhead and hurlet railway supported by gpk ar for ps34 000 it was horse operated and had a track gauge of 4 ft 4in 1 321 mm line was loss making and had no practical value other than tactical one of securing territory against competing companies awdry states on page 98 that sale was completed on 31 july 1852 paisley barrhead and hurlet bill failed in 1847 session of parliament and was re presented in 1848 share capital proposed had risen to ps230 000 during lords hearings it became plain that running powers were likely to be granted to barrhead and neilston direct railway an offshoot of caledonian railway gpk ar had subscribed to ps150 000 in face value of shares of this proposed line with sole intention of excluding caledonian railway from area gpk ar now petitioned against bill but this was unsuccessful and it received royal assent with running powers clause on 31 august 1848 having a majority shareholding gpk ar was able to stall any plans to proceed with construction of hurlet line but on 9 october a special gpk ar shareholders meeting reviewed financial commitments made by their board in frenzied days of 1845 and 1846 when support to numerous new lines had been committed meeting left directors in no doubt as to their disapproval on 28 may 1848 a line opened between irvine and busbie about 2 miles 3 km north west of kilmarnock a short branch to irvine harbour opened on same day wham p says 22 may 1848 cumnock line as far as auchinleck and muirkirk branch from that point opened on 9 august this included ballochmyle viaduct

completing line to carlisle thumb site of closed station in 2007the glasgow dumfries and carlisle railway had been proceeding with construction as fast as funds would allow and on 23 august 1848 it opened its line between gretna and dumfries at gretna passengers could change to caledonian railway trains dumfries station was a temporary structure south of annan road gpk ar provided rolling stock to its junior partner gd cr was insolvent owing ps230 000 and needing 000 to complete line these facts emerged after another bruising session at which shareholders criticised liabilities and futile parliamentary expenses incurred by directors of both companies in fact there was considerable overlap on two boards by march 1849 these negative feelings led to gpk ar chairman james mccall being removed along with several directors andrew orr took over as chairman but for a period remaining directors from earlier years formed an obstructive group their motivation seemed to be personal liabilities they had taken on on behalf of company and their wish to be indemnified against personal loss orr eventually resolved these issues and on 24 august orr held shareholders meetings of each company separately and announced that all old directors had resigned and that a new board would shortly be formed with an identical composition for two companies engineer john miller also resigned at this time in interest of economy all remaining gd cr construction contracts had been let and were proceeding and two companies would operate as a single unit using gpk ar rolling stock on 20 may 1850 line was opened between auchinleck and new cumnock completing gpk ar southward extension and including northern extremity of gd cr line by 28 october 1850 final section of main line to carlisle was completed by gd cr and trains began to run through to carlisle evidently difficulty with caledonian railway from gretna southwards had been resolved glasgow and south western railway is formed gpk ar and gd cr had already been authorised by acts of 1846 and 1847 to amalgamate at this stage in fact gd cr was absorbed by gpk ar which then changed its name to g swr 1847 act provided for vesting of gd

railway s expresses to london in 1841 steamboat service was transferred from liverpool to new port at fleetwood lancashire in march 1850 passenger train service consisted of five trains southbound and four northbound on ayr line these called at all stations except that cochrane mill was served only by first southbound and last northbound trains journey time to ayr was two to two and a half hours service between glasgow and muirkirk had four trains each way but only two went throughout one trip was to and from auchinleck only and one was to and from kilmarnock there were connecting trains from ayr to irvine journey time glasgow to muirkirk was three hours three of four kilmarnock line trains were combined with ayr trains between glasgow and irvine and between dalry and kilmarnock trains travelled via irvine and dreghorn in addition a glasgow to troon direct train was advertised running on wednesdays and fridays in connection with steamers to liverpool leaving glasgow at 4 30 pm this

western railway thumb glasgow and south western railway emblem originally used by gpk ar on taking over gpk ar and gd cr networks glasgow and south western railway had a main line from glasgow to ayr and from glasgow to carlisle and some branches it already served areas rich in minerals especially coal and ironstone and had useful access to west coast ports it had two main limitations first was that carlisle line was very circuitous compared with competing caledonian railway cr route via beattock which also served edinburgh route also depended on running over cr from gretna junction to carlisle and needed accommodation at carlisle station cr was to prove a formidable competitor for anglo scottish traffic both passenger and goods and much energy and money were expended in securing exclusive territory for g swr and in keeping cr out second issue was that both glasgow and ayr stations were awkward glasgow station at bridge street was on south of clyde and glasgow bridge carried a toll at time ayr station was north of river ayr and although not inconvenient for passenger access to town location prevented southward railway extension means adopted to overcome these challenges are described more fully in glasgow and south western railway and other articles in overview company encouraged local promoters to build railways that extended or fed g swr often this was with substantial financial support from company a number of branches were constructed directly this was especially case to serve districts where mining was dominant in later years a number of agreements were finalised with caledonian railway over primacy of territory and limitation on formation of encroaching routes ayr and dalmellington railway encouraged by g swr built its line southwards from falkland junction immediately north of ayr station new line passed round east side of burgh and a new through station for ayr was provided on it in 1857 after initial reluctance this became main passenger station for ayr with north british railway g swr sponsored city of glasgow union railway which opened a line crossing clyde in glasgow and making a south to north link line as part of that scheme a new passenger terminal at st enoch was opened and no less important a central goods terminal at college on land vacated by university of glasgow river crossing and a temporary central station were in use in 1870 and st enoch station was opened in 1876 after a short time bridge street station was vacated by g swr glasgow barrhead and kilmarnock joint railway was made jointly with caledonian railway forming a direct route between glasgow and kilmarnock and shortening route from glasgow to carlisle this opened in 1873 dalry to kilmarnock line was reduced in importance for express passenger trains but continued as an important link from carlisle to west coast ports and for mineral and goods traffic twentieth century closures in first half of twentieth century extractive industries of west of scotland underwent a metamorphosis small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged a similar process took place in iron and steel production industries and medium scale iron works in many locations closed down many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from mineral industries and could not be sustained when they had gone but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities heavy rationalisation process in british railways in 1960s often referred to as beeching axe resulted in a re assessment of those lines at a time when efficient bus services were abstracting passengers from often infrequent and inconvenient train services effect of this process on original gpk ar network can be summarised thus glasgow to ayr still operating
