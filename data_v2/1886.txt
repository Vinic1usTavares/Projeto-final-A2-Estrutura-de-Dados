considered pop punk a genre that combines influences of pop music with traditional punk rock throughout band s career though their sound has diversified a large component of band s music favors fast tempos catchy melodies prominent electric guitar with distortion and power chord changes earlier albums by band have also been tagged with label skate punk owing to skater subculture that was important to their youth in addition band has also been classified under umbrella of alternative rock as a whole band have claimed punk rock group descendents to be their greatest influence on a number of occasions they have also named beatles ramones cure u2 stiff little fingers all dinosaur jr nofx bad religion refused fugazi screeching weasel pennywise and jimmy eat world as inspirations common lyrical themes for band involve relationships suburbia toilet humor and teen angst hoppus and delonge and later skiba split songwriting duty and much of their lyrics tend toward autobiography according to nitsuh abebe of new york band s biggest recurring topic is maturity more specifically their lack of it their attitude toward their lack of it or their eventual wide eyed exploration of it one of band s biggest singles what s my age again specifically addresses peter pan syndrome while dammit band s first mainstream hit single contains hook well i guess this is growing up albums such as take off your pants and jacket near exclusively deal in toilet humor and teen centered lyrics leading rolling stone to dub it a concept album chronicling adolescence nathan brackett 2004 new rolling stone album guide new york fireside 904 pp first edition 2004 for hoppus these themes were not exclusively adolescent things that happen to you in high school are same things that happen your entire life you can fall in love at sixty you can get rejected at eighty shooman 2010 p 85 mid career albums such as neighborhoods 2011 explore darker territory such as depression and loss more recent efforts like california 2016 aim for universality but also focus on miscommunication and loss of identity musically band s sound has progressed throughout their 25 year career tom delonge s guitar style which trades solos for riffs is often down stroked and power chord heavy with large amounts of palm muting his later work guitar work heavily delves into effects exploring ambience and delay prominently many blink songs center on i v vi iv progression bennett dan 2008 total rock bassist p 63 alfred as a bassist hoppus is known for his well defined midrange tone since band is a trio he approaches his role as a combination of being a rhythm guitarist and bassist early albums such as cheshire cat 1995 and dude ranch 1997 were recorded with original drummer scott raynor and consist of fast paced double time songs drummer travis barker diversified band s sound rhythmically when he joined in 1998 throughout their discography barker s drumming references a myriad of musical genres including afro cuban music bossa nova reggae and hip hop barker grew up playing in marching band and it still influences his drum fills and kit setup blink 182 was key in development of pop punk in that they were considered more radio friendly than their predecessors jon caramanica of new york times writes that band took punk s already playful core and gave it a shiny accessible polish luke lewis writing for total guitar in 2003 summarized it aptly they wrote catchy songs radio stations played them band s biggest hit all small things was written partially because delonge figured label might want a song for radio it was obvious from beginning it would fit that format he told lewis there s nothing wrong with that we don t want obstacles between us and our audience however band s conventional appeal as well as partnerships with mtv companies and clothing brands led to accusations that they were betraying independent spirit of punk rock delonge commented on band s mainstream appeal in an interview in 2014 legacy blink 182 was one of most popular bands at turn of millennium and spearheaded second wave of pop punk and its journey into mainstream romanowski patricia george

apart from other crossover punk acts of era such as green day enema of state catapulted band to stardom creating what new york abebe described as a blanket immersion among america s twenty some million teenagers at band s commercial peak albums such as take off your pants and jacket and enema of state sold over 14 and 15 million copies worldwide respectively according to kelefa sanneh of new yorker blink 182 emerged as a touchstone spawning more imitators than any american rock band since nirvana their seeming ordinariness convinced a generation of goofy punks that maybe they too could turn out deceptively simple songs as well constructed as anything on pop chart and their camaraderie made fans feel like members of their extended social circle most blink 182 songs are fairly straightforward and easy to play on guitar making them perfect practice for beginner musicians lewis of total guitar notes that this was key in influencing a generation of kids to pick up guitar and form bands of their own despite this band never received particularly glowing reviews with many reviewers dismissing them as a joke british publication nme was particularly critical of trio with reviewer steven wells begging them to fuck right off comparing them to that castrated shrink wrapped new wave crap that major us record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on punk bandwagon nevertheless subsequent reviews of band s discography have been more positive andy greenwald of blender wrote quick transformation from nudists to near geniuses is down right astonishing james montgomery of mtv said that despite their maturation blink never took themselves particularly seriously which was another reason they were so accessible however new generation of pop punk and alternative rock fans found blink sound hugely influential according to nicole of rolling stone in 2011 jon caramanica of new york times asserted that no punk band of 1990s has been more influential than blink 182 stating that even as band receded after its 2005 split its sound and style could be heard in muscular pop punk of fall out boy or in current wave of high gloss warped tour

writing apart from sound blink s ideology has been popularized their presence is everywhere when it comes to having inestimable influence blink 182 might well be contemporary punk s version of beatles
