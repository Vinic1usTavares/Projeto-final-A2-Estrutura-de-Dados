become troi nemecek 1995 p 66 sirtis praised this development as she felt she had been overlooked during first season due to presence of both gates mcfadden and denise crosby show runner maurice hurley later admitted that he had never looked at phase ii script gross altman 1993 p 173 while executive producer rick berman later explained that writers did not have as much time to redevelop

agreed with so bowman said that his direction went a bit further than he would normally in order to compensate for script difficulties he was allowed to use additional cameras and equipment to improve style of filming including opening shot of episode making their first appearances on next generation in child were diana muldaur as doctor katherine pulaski and whoopi goldberg as guinan muldaur had

emmy award for outstanding music composition for a series in 1989 but lost to joel rosenbaum for an episode of falcon crest o neil 1992 p 416 episode was described as uneven and an inauspicious start to second season by james van hise and hal schuster in their book complete trek next generation while duo praised addition of muldaur and goldberg lack of a follow up to episode was criticised as they felt that events should have had some type of lasting effect on troi it was suggested that either she would want to have a child or she would be wary of them in general due to impact of loss of ian van hise schuster 1995 p 37 keith decandido pointed out several changes at start of this season in child that would recur throughout rest of run of next generation in his review for tor com these included moving geordi la forge to become chief engineer placing miles o brien as transporter chief and riker growing a beard however he criticised fact that worf s calling for troi to have an abortion was never mentioned again but added that it was discussed in a non canon novel a rock and a hard place by peter david james hunt in his review for den of geek was surprised that no one in episode reacted to troi undergoing what he saw as a form of rape he also felt that her eagerness to have child could have been a type of mind control but none of crew seem to consider that as a possibility he said that crew failed to act rationally for sake of plot which was one of his pet peeves in television adding that you could replace any main character in this episode with a parsnip and outcome will be unchanged hunt also described introduction of new elements as clunky feigning wonder that someone doesn t say nice facial hair to riker because that s level of subtlety they go for zack handlen in reviewing episode for a v club gave it a score of d criticising passive nature of troi and equated her pregnancy to rape entire life of child was presented as a joyous life experience and handlen described lack of issues in a three day pregnancy as bunk he felt that episode would have been better served by concentrating on hard science fiction concept of plasma plague which was only used as a macguffin first home media release of child was on vhs cassette appearing on august 25 1994 in united states and canada episode was later included on star trek next generation season
