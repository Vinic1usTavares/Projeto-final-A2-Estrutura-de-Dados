uss liscome bay cve 56 was second of fifty s built to serve united states navy during world war ii launched in april 1943 and commissioned following august she was named for liscome bay in dall island in alexander archipelago of alaska on 24 november 1943 her munitions were catastrophically detonated by a torpedo attack by whilst she was acting as flagship of carrier division 24 which was supporting operations on makin she quickly sank with loss of 644 men her loss is deadliest sinking of a carrier in history of united states navy design and description thumb left a profile of design of which was shared with all casablanca class escort carriers liscome bay was a casablanca class escort carrier most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built and designed specifically to be mass produced using prefabricated sections in order to replace heavy early war losses standardized with her sister ships she was long overall had a beam of and a draft of she displaced standard with a full load she had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck she was powered with two uniflow reciprocating steam engines which drove two shafts providing thus enabling her to make ship had a cruising range of at a speed of her compact size necessitated installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between flight and hangar deck one each fore and aft one 38 caliber dual purpose gun was mounted on stern anti aircraft defense was provided by 8 bofors anti aircraft guns in single mounts as well as 12 oerlikon cannons which were mounted around perimeter of deck casablanca class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft but hangar deck could accommodate more for example during her only combat deployment operation kourbash she carried 11 fm 1 and 5 f4f 4 fighters as well as 9 tbm 1 and 3 tbm 1c torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft construction she was laid down on 12 december 1942 under a maritime commission contract hull 1137 by kaiser shipbuilding company vancouver washington she was launched on 19 april 1943 sponsored by mrs clara wife of rear admiral ben chief of navy s bureau of yards and docks originally she was intended to be sent to british royal navy under name hms ameer however a change in plans resulted in uss baffins being redesignated as ameer in liscome bays place she was named liscome bay on 28 june 1943 as part of tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in alaska vessel was assigned hull classification symbol cve 56 on 15 july 1943 and was

francisco on way arriving on 22 september 1943 for next month she engaged in training operations off southern california coast on 11 october she was designated as flagship of carrier division 24 under command of rear admiral henry m mullinnix on 14 october she received her aircraft contingent and on 21 october she departed for pearl harbor arriving a week later on 27 october she then conducted additional drills and training exercises off of hawaii until early november when she was assigned to invasion fleet assembling for operation kourbash as a member of carrier division 24 she departed from pearl harbor on 10 november as part of task force 52 commanded by rear admiral richmond k turner bound for invasion of gilbert islands it was to be her first and last mission liscome bay was assigned to naval forces supporting invasion of makin invasion bombardment announcing first major u s naval thrust into central pacific began on 20 november at 5 a m just 76 hours later tarawa and makin islands were both captured liscome bays aircraft had played a vital role in capture of makin providing close air support and bombing japanese positions in total there were 2 278 sorties conducted by carrier task group in support of operation galvanic which neutralized enemy airbases supported u s army landings and ground operations with bombing and strafing missions and intercepted enemy aircraft with islands secured u s naval forces began retiring however liscome bay was forced to stay with rest of her task force as marines mopped up resistance on butaritari island sinking invasion of gilbert islands had caught japanese command by surprise admiral mineichi koga in desperation issued orders to recall four japanese submarines southwest of hawaii and five submarines near truk and rabaul to converge on gilberts of nine japanese submarines sent to sortie against u s forces in gilberts six were lost on 23 november however submarine commanded by lieutenant commander tabata arrived off makin u s task group built around rear admiral henry m mullinnix s three escort carriers was steaming southwest of butaritari island at 15 knots task group was traveling in a circular formation with seven destroyers cruiser battleships and and liscome bays two sister ships and surrounding her liscome bay as guide for group was located dead center between other ships as collisions posed a greater risk to ships than a potential submarine attack ships were not zig zagging at 04 30 on 24 november reveille was sounded in liscome bay on 4 34 destroyer left to investigate a signal beacon likely dropped from a japanese plane this resulted in a gap within liscome bays screen at 4 36 radar operators on new mexico spotted a short lived blip which may have represented i 175 diving into position flight quarters was sounded at 04 50 crew went to routine general quarters at 05 05 when flight crews prepared their planes for dawn launching thirteen planes including one forward on catapult had been readied on flight deck these had all been fueled and armed there were an additional seven planes in hangar that were not fueled or armed she had a large number of munitions on board stored below decks meanwhile task group executed a turn to northeast which brought liscome bay to a near perpendicular course along i 175 hence japanese submarine fired a spread of at least three type 95 torpedoes towards task force at about 05 10 a lookout on starboard right side of liscome bay reported seeing a torpedo headed for ship torpedo struck behind after engine room as liscome bay was conducting its turn and detonated bomb magazine causing a devastating explosion that engulfed ship and sent shrapnel flying as far as away considerable debris fell on battleship new mexico about off whilst a sailor on board escort carrier coral sea was reportedly hit by a fire extinguisher from liscome bay entire task force was rocked by explosion albeit none suffered significant damage as a result a mushroom cloud erupted rising thousands of feet above wreck of liscome bay detonation sheared off nearly entire rear end of carrier killing everyone behind forward bulkhead of aft engine room seawater quickly rushed into gap mixing with oil released from hull both hangar and flight decks were heavily damaged parts of superstructure including radar antenna collapsed onto deck forward part of hangar was immediately engulfed in flames igniting few remaining planes on flight deck planes were launched off of carrier s deck steam compressed air and fire main pressure were lost throughout ship fires on flight deck caused ammunition within burning aircraft and anti aircraft guns to detonate further complicating matters gasoline coated water surrounding liscome bay caught fire hampering efforts by survivors to escape at 05 33 only 23 minutes after explosion liscome bay listed to starboard and sank carrying to their deaths 53 officers and 591 enlisted men rescue when liscome bay detonated rest of task group immediately conducted evasive maneuvers scattering from her wreck at 5 40 destroyers and arrived at oil slick of survivors that were hauled up many were dead or dying at 6 10 destroyer spotted two torpedo wakes one just from destroyer s hull a radar operator on new mexico detected an echo and hull was recalled to join in dropping depth charges took hulls place in picking up survivors at 8 00 search operation was concluded of 916 crewmen aboard liscome bay 644 including wiltsie mullinnix and miller went down with ship whilst 272 survived including sailors lost on liscome bay u s casualties in assault on makin island exceeded strength of entire japanese garrison aftermath survivors were transferred at makin lagoon from destroyers onto troop transports and on thanksgiving night two of survivors died and were buried at sea on 2 december navy announced that liscome bay had been sunk off makin island on 4 february 1944 i 175 was detected and sunk by destroyer and destroyer escort using their hedgehog anti submarine mortar thumb burial at sea aboard troopship of two liscome bay sailors victims of submarine attack by in foreground facing ceremony are
