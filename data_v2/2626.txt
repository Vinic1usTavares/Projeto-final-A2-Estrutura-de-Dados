with assistance of german architect and circuit designer hermann tilke in november 2011 bernie ecclestone expressed minor doubt over race going ahead after what he described as disagreements inside management company and gave circuit owners and race organisers a deadline of 7 december coinciding with meeting of fia world motorsports council and release of final 2012 calendar to sort out their differences or else risk losing event entirely final calendar included race with ecclestone confirming that a new arrangement had been made and that event organisers had paid their circuit sanctioning fees for 2012 race was originally scheduled to be held in june but was moved back to become penultimate event of season in response to concerns over heat of texas summer and its effects on teams

organisers could not agree on a renewed contract in august 2011 organisers of race revealed that they were negotiating with bernie ecclestone to resume their place on calendar however race was removed from calendar later that month changes rule changes technical regulations thumb right banning of exhaust blown diffusers meant all teams had to redevelop exit of exhaust season saw teams running off throttle blown diffusers which created downforce by forcing fuel through engine to produce exhaust gases and directing it over diffuser when driver was not applying throttle this concept was originally banned in incremental phases with increasingly restrictive rules on what teams could and could not do with a full ban to be applied from 2011 british grand prix onwards however incremental ban was controversial with several teams applying for and receiving permission to circumvent total ban after discussion between fia and engine manufacturers original regulations were restored with full ban delayed until 2012 regulations in 2012 governed design of exhaust with teams agreeing to strict constraints on position of exhaust this resulted in exhaust exiting bodywork much higher up than in 2011 and no longer in vicinity of diffuser several teams including williams and mercedes used young driver tests in abu dhabi as an opportunity to test parts for 2012 season in face of ban in october 2011 a clarification to amended rules was issued effectively banning exotic engine maps in november further amendments were introduced completely banning practice of blowing exhaust gasses over parts of car to improve downforce following a bid by several teams to allow it under certain conditions further amendments were made in february 2012 when mercedes alerted fia to a loophole in regulations that would allow teams to continue using a partially blown diffuser fia responded by re writing software governing engine s electronic control unit to close loophole at german grand prix in july red bull racing were referred to race stewards after fia technical delegate jo bauer noted that their engine maps had potential to violate technical regulations red bull stood accused of manipulating relationship between torque produced by red bull rb8 and degree to which throttle was open particularly in medium speed corners thereby allowing more air to pass through exhaust and over diffuser generating more downforce red bull were cleared of wrongdoing as in stewards words they had not technically broken any rules but fia announced plans to rewrite regulations governing throttle mapping so as to outlaw practice entirely ahead of hungarian grand prix one week later rule changes required teams to submit an engine map used during one of first four races of season which became known as reference map any subsequent changes to throttle map would require approval of fia provided that torque output above 6 000 rpm was within two percent of output specified on reference map further changes would be allowed at races with exceptional atmospheric conditions as designated by fia in january 2012 fia banned use of reactive ride height system first proposed by lotus in 2010 but not applied until 2012 used hydraulic cylinders located in brake calipers and suspension push rods to make minute adjustments to ride height of car thereby keeping ride height at an optimal level throughout race and providing stability during braking fia initially approved device as being legal and several teams including ferrari and williams submitted plans to fia for their own versions of device before it was banned one week later fia later confirmed that reactive ride height systems violated article 3 15 of technical regulations which states that any aerodynamic effect created by suspension should be incidental to its primary function and any device that influences car s aerodynamics must remain immobile in relation to sprung part of car and further noted that system s primary purpose was achieving aerodynamic gains as opposed to providing stability under braking and that use of reactive ride heights could also be challenged under article 10 2 of technical regulations which govern suspension systems thumb reduction in height of nose led to several teams using a platypus nose design as seen in force india top however mclaren did not use this design as evidenced in mclaren mp4 27 bottom technical regulations for 2012 include reprofiling of car s nose pre 2012 regulations allowed nose to be as high as above ground but revisions to sporting code lowered maximum allowable height to ahead of front bulkhead this resulted in cars being launched with a platypus nose as teams designed cars with a visible change in height along nose assembly of car mercedes amg team principal ross brawn explained distinctive nose shape as having come about from several teams wanting to use their 2011 chassis as basis for their 2012 cars drivers were no longer permitted to have a joker gearbox change prior to 2012 drivers were entitled to change their gearboxes once over course of season without incurring a five place grid penalty this system was abandoned in 2012 with drivers only being allowed to change gearboxes once every five races starting in 2012 all cars were required to pass their mandatory fia crash tests before being allowed to take part in pre season testing previously passing crash tests was only a requirement prior to first race of season crash tests for 2012 season will also be more rigorous than in previous years at meeting for formula one commission in geneva in november 2011 use of helium in air guns used to change tyres during pit stops was banned despite increasing rotation speed of air guns by up to 30 practice of using helium was deemed to be too expensive to continue for competitive gains it offered at 2012 abu dhabi grand prix fia banned use of trick brake devices which used a bi metallic strip that changed shape when heated by brakes to open or close off braking ducts and improving braking efficiency under certain conditions this was deemed to be in breach of article 11 4 of sporting regulations which states that only permissible changes to braking system while a car is moving must be directly controlled by driver sporting regulations after being banned in in season testing returned in 2012 with a test held at mugello on 1 may ahead of european leg of 2012 championship as teams were only be permitted to do fifteen days of testing over course of season pre season winter testing schedule was cut back to accommodate mugello test at september 2011 meeting of fia world motor sport council representatives of member organisations voted to amend rules for double waved yellow flags in all fia sanctioned championships amendment means that double waved flags will be shown when a track marshal is working on or beside circuit tyre supplier pirelli revised their tyre compounds for 2012 season in an effort to encourage teams to use each of compounds supplied for individual races pirelli predicted that changes would translate into 0 7 seconds difference per lap between harder and softer compounds down from 1 5 seconds per lap in 2011 according to pirelli hardest tyre compound available is just 31 harder than softest compound on offer by comparison hardest tyres used in 2011 were 70 harder than softest faced with several constructors applying for name changes teams requested a clearer definition of what constitutes a constructor under rules set out in sixth concorde agreement several teams have been forced to compete under names that do not necessarily reflect their ownership such as sauber competing as bmw sauber in despite bmw withdrawing from sport at end of season in order to preserve their status as a current constructor and their claim to a share of television rights paid to teams that placed in top ten in final world constructors championship standings at final meeting of world motorsports commission in december 2011 a series of amendments to sporting regulations were published chief among these is re introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under safety car which remained mercedes benz sls amg introduced in 2010 to be released from queue before car returns to pit lane allowing drivers to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart drivers were not permitted to leave confines of circuit without a justifiable reason following a spate of incidents in when drivers were sighted using access roads around circuit to shorten their reconnaissance and in laps in order to preserve their fuel and tyres similarly drivers will not be allowed to return to normal racing line should they choose a defensive line going into a corner races were run to a maximum four hour time limit to prevent indefinite suspension of a race this will stop theoretical possibility of a race lasting more than eight hours this rule was introduced in response to rain interrupted 2011 canadian grand prix which set a record for longest race in formula one history at four hours four minutes and thirty nine seconds any driver in pit lane when a race is suspended was permitted to return to circuit and take up position on grid that they were running in at time of suspension at 2012 british grand prix in july fia disabled use of drag reduction system drs during a race while yellow flags were being shown in same sector as drs zone move followed an incident at european grand prix in which michael schumacher was observed to activate his drs while yellow flags were being shown other changes in july 2011 a joint broadcasting deal for formula one in united kingdom was announced between sky sports and bbc announcement was controversial being met with highly negative reactions from fans and observers as it had previously been believed that terms of concorde agreement prevented formula one from being broadcast exclusively on pay per view but agreement did not prevent a shared broadcast such as proposal made by sky sports and bbc controversial nature of broadcast deal led to culture media and sport committee of house of commons calling bernie ecclestone and senior bbc figures including director general mark thompson to answer questions over details of broadcasting arrangement in december 2011 red bull racing and scuderia ferrari exited fota formula one teams association following prolonged debate over implementation of controversial resource restriction agreement though red bull team principal christian horner reaffirmed his team s commitment to cost cutting measures and highlighting team s concerns over certain loopholes in resource restriction agreement that they felt teams and manufacturers would willingly exploit one week later sauber also left organisation though swiss team did not publicly give a reason for ending their membership in february 2012 red bull racing s sister team scuderia toro rosso was also reported as having left organisation since first schism in december race summaries pre season testing jerez de la frontera and barcelona 2012 season was preceded by three test sessions one at jerez de la frontera and two in barcelona these sessions gave teams and drivers opportunity to familiarise themselves with their cars though teams downplayed accuracy of testing times as being representative of running order for season at second

sebastian vettel who profited from safety car to pass hamilton mclaren team principal martin whitmarsh later admitted that button was more than marginal on fuel after team made a mistake in calculating their fuel loads for race forcing button to use a severe fuel saving mode from eighth lap of race hamilton came under threat from mark webber in late stages of race but held on to secure third place webber finished fourth his best result in his home grand prix while fernando alonso finished fifth having endured pressure from pastor maldonado for last half of race maldonado s race ended when he crossed onto astroturf on final lap and spun into wall kimi raikkonen finished seventh after a poor qualifying session saw him start race seventeenth taking advantage of a chaotic final lap to make up two places while felipe massa and bruno senna both retired after a bizarre collision that saw their cars tangled up in one another hrt failed to qualify for race for second consecutive

button but his lead was short lived heavy rain interrupted race forcing suspension of grand prix when race restarted an hour later button was involved in contact with narain karthikeyan that forced him to make an unscheduled stop for a new front wing while hamilton had a slow pit stop and was held in lane while other cars passed fernando alonso inherited lead with sauber s sergio perez a surprise second having made an early stop for extreme wet weather tyres and then taking advantage of a rush to pit lane to position himself in third at restart as race wore on perez began to quickly catch alonso on a drying track daniel ricciardo was first driver to pit for dry weather tyres on lap 38 triggering another round of stops sauber and perez initially looked as if they had left their stop too late when perez emerged from pits five seconds behind alonso but he began catching two time world champion at same rate as he had before perez closed to within half a second with seven laps to go but ran wide at turn 14 and lost five seconds later admitting that it was his mistake he was unable to close gap and alonso went on to win race by two seconds win giving him a five point lead in championship perez was second taking his first podium and sauber s best ever result as an independent team hamilton finished third ahead of mark webber and kimi raikkonen while button had to settle for fourteenth bruno senna finished in sixth scoring more points in a single race than his team scored in sebastian vettel finished outside points after making contact with karthikeyan and developing

lotus f1 protesting legality of mercedes s rear wing design fia rejected protest and with mercedes allowed to continue racing with their car unchanged nico rosberg took his and team s first pole position since their return to formula one in while a penalty to lewis hamilton for a gearbox change promoted michael schumacher to second on grid schumacher would ultimately retire from race after first round of stops when it was discovered that one of his wheels had not been attached properly rosberg took an early lead in race and while his attempt to complete race with only two pit stops came under threat from second placed jenson button a mistake by button s pit crew during his final stop handed rosberg a nineteen second advantage over kimi raikkonen raikkonen was attempting a similar two stop strategy but his tyres wore out seven laps from end of race and he lost eleven positions in a single lap this forced rosberg to drive conservatively to preserve his tyres while button recovered from his disastrous pit stop to pass sebastian vettel for second button was held up by incumbent world champion long enough for rosberg to preserve his tyres and he became 103rd person to win a grand prix result was also mercedes s first win as a constructor since juan manuel fangio won 1955 italian grand prix button was second with hamilton scoring his third consecutive third place giving him a two point championship lead over button fernando alonso who had been leading championship before race finished ninth after two retirements in opening rounds of championship romain grosjean scored his first points in formula one by finishing sixth thumb right bahrain grand prix was overshadowed by civilian protests against ruling al khalifa family round 4 bahrain in face of ongoing media speculation and public pressure to cancel race due to ongoing political instability in bahrain fia released a statement at chinese grand prix confirming that bahrain grand prix would go ahead as planned week preceding grand prix saw a renewed wave of protests against government s attempts use race to tell outside world that whole thing is back to normal while human rights organisations

and its predecessor team lotus advanced beyond first qualifying period in dry conditions vettel went on to win race becoming fourth winner in as many races after spending much of race defending against kimi raikkonen having started eleventh raikkonen used an extra set of soft tyres to move up through field his team mate romain grosjean finished third grosjean had initially shown pace to challenge vettel s lead but unlike raikkonen he did not have an extra set of fresh tyres and lost touch with reigning world champion after first set of stops lewis hamilton finished eighth once again hampered by slow pit stops he was later involved in an altercation with nico rosberg that saw rosberg referred to stewards for forcing hamilton beyond boundary of circuit while defending his position but he escaped without penalty hamilton went on to finish eighth while team mate jenson button was forced to retire two laps from end of race after reporting an unusual vibration from differential daniel ricciardo was involved in early contact that saw australian driver slide down order from sixth at start to fifteenth by end of race having spent most of grand prix caught behind vitaly petrov

constructors championship while lotus s double podium moved them into third overall thumb left sebastian vettel won his first race of 2012 season in bahrain decision to hold race despite ongoing protests made it one of most controversial grands prix in sport s sixty year history mid season test mugello starting on 1 may teams conducted a three day test at mugello circuit in italy ahead of spanish grand prix test gave teams opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them hrt elected not to take part in test instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in madrid both lotus s trackside operations director alan and red bull racing driver mark webber questioned value of testing at mugello circuit as characteristics of circuit were unlike any of circuits championship was due to visit after test while caterham driver vitaly petrov was critical of choice of mugello as a testing venue as he felt it was not safe enough for formula one petrov s comments came shortly after fernando alonso crashed on final morning of test red bull racing and lotus team principals christian horner and eric boullier were also critical of test as they felt that costs of conducting in season testing outweighed any benefits with horner stating his opposition to continuing mid season testing in future round 5 spain following criticism over sensitivity of their tyre compounds tyre supplier pirelli announced changes to their tyre allocation for spanish grand prix making pit strategy focal point of grand prix pirelli would later diagnose problems with tyre compounds as originating from developing them on a testing chassis that was two years out of date at time lewis hamilton took his third pole of season edging out williams driver pastor maldonado by half a second while maldonado s team mate bruno senna was eliminated early when he spun hamilton was later excluded from qualifying results after his car did not have enough fuel to return to pits for scrutineering promoting maldonado to pole position and moving hamilton to back of grid fernando alonso took lead of race at first corner but maldonado reclaimed it during second round of pit stops when his team forced ferrari to pit early while alonso was held up by marussia of charles pic maldonado maintained a lead of seven seconds over alonso but a mistake by his crew during third pit stop cost him time and left him vulnerable to ferrari driver in final stint of race meanwhile third placed kimi raikkonen moved to an ambitious strategy that would see him attempt to force maldonado and alonso to race beyond life expectancy of their tyres allowing him to swoop in at last minute to steal first place raikkonen s strategy failed as maldonado withstood pressure from alonso for fifteen laps winning race by three seconds and becoming first venezuelan driver to win a formula one grand prix it was williams s first win in one hundred and thirty grand prix starts their previous race win was juan pablo montoya s victory at 2004 brazilian grand prix lewis hamilton recovered from twenty fourth on grid to finish eighth while sebastian vettel overcame a drive through penalty and an unscheduled stop for a technical fault that forced his team to replace his front wing to make a late move on nico rosberg for sixth place that would preserve his championship lead round 6 monaco for second consecutive race fastest driver in qualifying did not start race from pole michael schumacher set fastest time but a five place grid penalty left him sixth overall two hours before race protests against parts introduced onto floor of red bull rb8 left team principal christian horner with a choice to change offending parts and start both cars from pit lane guaranteeing that any result team recorded would be preserved or to leave parts on car allowing both drivers to start race from positions they qualified in but risking a post race exclusion horner ultimately chose latter option and mark webber started from pole establishing an early lead over nico rosberg as a first corner accident eliminated four cars race was run under constant threat of rain with drivers trying to extend life of their tyres to avoid being forced to make an additional stop and falling down order rain never materialised though jean eric vergne was observed using a set of intermediate tyres late in race variety of strategies used by front runners resulted in last ten laps being contested with top six cars running nose to tail webber visibly faded in final laps but held on when following cars were momentarily pinned behind slow moving heikki kovalainen webber won race his second on streets of monaco with rosberg second and fernando alonso third result giving alonso a three point lead in championship red bull racing maintained their lead in constructors championship as rival teams chose not to follow through on threat of their pre race protest while kovalainen finished thirteenth to see caterham overtake marussia for tenth place elsewhere spanish grand prix winner pastor maldonado was given a ten place grid penalty for an incident that saw him clip sergio perez combined with a five place penalty for changing his gearbox maldonado started from back row of grid where he was eliminated in first corner accident round 7 canada thumb right lewis hamilton became seventh winner of season when he won canadian grand prix one week before canadian grand prix fia declared floor used by red bull in monaco to be illegal forcing team to change offending parts for canadian grand prix despite ruling team s results were kept intact team was also forced to change design of their axles after fia race director charlie whiting felt that holes in axles contravened technical regulations nevertheless sebastian vettel comfortably took pole position by three tenths of a second vettel controlled early phase of race but was caught and passed by lewis hamilton before first round of stops while fernando alonso slipped through shortly afterwards all three drivers were using a two stop strategy at time but as hamilton made his second stop both alonso and vettel shifted to a one stop strategy with alonso s team resorting to discussing strategy options in his native spanish to prevent their rivals from overhearing their plans hamilton had twenty laps to make up a twelve second deficit and he easily reeled vettel in in response red bull pitted reigning world champion and vettel fell to fifth hamilton s next target was alonso whose tyres lost all grip and he fell victim to hamilton romain grosjean sergio perez and vettel in quick succession hamilton won race becoming seventh winner in seven races and taking a two point lead in championship grosjean s second place saw lotus take third place in constructors championship from ferrari both grosjean and perez expressed surprise at finishing on podium while 2011 winner jenson button finished sixteenth in what he described as his worst race in years and michael schumacher suffered a hydraulics failure that left his drag reduction system drs device jammed in open position round 8 europe fernando alonso became first man to win two races in 2012 at european grand prix in valencia scoring his first home win since 2006 spanish grand prix starting eleventh he was forced to navigate his way through traffic narrowly avoiding early contact between bruno senna and kamui kobayashi as sebastian vettel broke free of field to establish a twenty second lead by first round of stops vettel s lead was quashed when heikki kovalainen and jean eric vergne made contact triggering deployment of safety car to clear debris from circuit alonso found himself third at restart and pounced on a mistake by second placed romain grosjean to lead chase against vettel vettel pulled away once more but his lead was short lived as he lost drive and his engine shut down on lap 33 grosjean attempted to challenge alonso but was forced out of race with an alternator problem seven laps later leaving alonso in lead four seconds clear of lewis hamilton and kimi raikkonen as race entered final laps raikkonen forced his way past hamilton to secure second place but pastor maldonado s attempts to take third place ended with hamilton in barrier and a broken nose for williams driver maldonado finished tenth but was given a post race drive through penalty and was classified twelfth meanwhile michael schumacher and mark webber had started to carve their way through field by virtue of a late pit stop and easily picked off minor points positions and taking advantage of maldonado hamilton collision to finish third and fourth behind alonso and raikkonen it was schumacher s first podium since 2006 chinese grand prix alonso s win cemented a twenty point lead in championship whilst vettel s retirement relegated him to fourth overall twenty six points behind alonso thumb left heavy rain forced suspension of qualifying for british grand prix round 9 great britain difficult conditions greeted teams upon their arrival at silverstone circuit as parts of midlands received a month s rainfall in space of two days torrential rain lasted throughout weekend forcing qualifying to be suspended for ninety minutes before race day dawned clear circuit was declared dry allowing drivers to start on tyre compound of their choice with alonso on harder tyre streaking away at start while paul di resta crashed at aintree on first lap after making contact with romain grosjean as leaders settled into a rhythm pastor maldonado and sergio perez collided at brooklands prompting an angry response from mexican driver perez s team mate kamui kobayashi also ran into trouble locking his tyres as he entered his pit box and hitting three members of his pit crew though none were seriously injured race was ultimately decided by choice of tyre in first stint as alonso moved onto softer option and webber onto harder prime for final phase of race webber caught alonso with five laps to go passing him on wellington straight webber held on for his second win of season with vettel third and felipe massa in fourth his best result since achieving a podium in south korea in 2010 result meant webber closed to within thirteen points of alonso s championship lead with both drivers breaking away from third placed vettel after showing early promise in wet conditions mclaren went backwards in dry losing second place in constructors championship to ferrari and third to lotus round 10 germany thumb right reigning world constructors champion red bull was involved in several technical disputes that challenged legality of its car limited running in practice and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at hockenheimring fernando alonso controlled much of race from pole position only relinquishing lead when he pitted and he went on to take his third victory of season lewis hamilton s one hundredth grand prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on third lap and spent most of race at tail end of field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem confusion briefly reigned when hamilton in seventeenth place at time began lapping faster than leaders and sought to unlap himself sebastian vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by mclaren to force both him and alonso to drive defensively against hamilton slowing them down enough to allow team mate jenson button to leap frog them at second round of stops vettel lost a position to button but alonso was unaffected as ferrari pitted him before hamilton could interfere with his race button briefly looked as if he had pace to pass alonso for race lead but race was deadlocked in final twenty laps and button began to fade in final five laps of race race was marked by another technical dispute regarding red bull racing who were referred to stewards by fia technical delegate jo bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on red bull rb8 stewards elected to take no action against red bull stating that team had not violated any of technical regulations but noted that they did not accept all of arguments presented by team when asked to explain stewards were less forgiving of vettel who ran wide at hairpin while trying to pass button and could only complete pass outside limits of circuit vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty demoting him to fifth overall with button promoted to second kimi raikkonen inherited third place and kamui kobayashi was classified a career best fourth round 11 hungary thumb left following mid season break ferrari s felipe massa was in fourteenth place in championship 139 points behind team mate and championship leader fernando alonso as championship moved into second half of season fernando alonso maintained a thirty four point lead over his nearest rival mark webber with sebastian vettel a further ten points behind alonso s outlook for race was dour qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as lewis hamilton continued mclaren s mid season resurgence returning to pole position for first time since malaysian grand prix following an aborted start triggered by michael schumacher lining up in wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in confusion hamilton and grosjean lead field away after prematurely moving jenson button onto a three stop strategy mclaren gave hamilton order to hold position as tight confines of hungaroring circuit forced teams to try to make up positions in pits this was evidenced by kimi raikkonen who inherited lead after first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second coming dangerously close to team mate grosjean under brakes as he emerged from pit lane despite taking two seconds out of hamilton s lead within five laps of rejoining race raikkonen was powerless to reel hamilton in any further hamilton won race nineteenth of his career with raikkonen second and grosjean in third hamilton s victory brought with it twenty five points that put him back in championship contention while a late decision by red bull to move mark webber onto a three stop strategy saw australian slip further behind fernando alonso as spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points round 12 belgium thumb upright right lewis hamilton s future was a source of ongoing speculation during second half of season amid contract negotiations with mclaren and mercedes championship resumed one month later in belgium jenson button qualified on pole and broke away at start while a four car pile up started behind him when romain grosjean made contact with lewis hamilton and they both slammed into fernando alonso and sergio perez eliminating all four on spot and triggering safety car kamui kobayashi s car was also damaged and pastor maldonado was spun around amidst chaos grosjean was later given a one race ban for causing collision becoming first driver in eighteen years to be banned from racing maldonado retired shortly after restart with a broken front wing after making contact with timo glock while narain karthikeyan spun off at stavelot mid way through race when his wheel came loose button controlled race from front and was unchallenged throughout while sebastian vettel clawed his way up to second from tenth on grid kimi raikkonen started and finished third let down by a conservative pit strategy that forced him to make a second stop late in race in order to use both compounds of tyre as per rules even when it became apparent that button and vettel were racing on a one stop strategy and nico hulkenberg finished in a career best fourth place button s win allowed him to regain precious ground on championship fight while alonso s retirement from race and vettel s second place moved reigning world champion to within twenty four points of championship lead scuderia toro rosso scored their first points since malaysian grand prix with jean eric vergne and daniel ricciardo finishing eighth and ninth respectively further down order

fernando alonso on pole position by way of using felipe massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster when alonso s rear anti roll bar failed in final period of qualifying leaving championship leader marooned in tenth while lewis hamilton took pole hamilton asserted early control over race and while ferrari made significant ground early on to be running second and third despite losing data uplink between their cars and pit wall that provided them with telemetry it was sergio perez who proved to be hamilton s biggest challenge starting outside top ten perez elected to start on harder compound tyres and complete one stop producing fastest lap after fastest lap as mclaren s confidence was broken when jenson button s car was paralysed by a fuel pressure problem hamilton would ultimately prevail but he was forced to push in final few laps to maintain his lead and won race by four seconds as perez claimed his third podium of season with second place alonso went on to finish third benefiting from button s retirement and a drive through penalty for sebastian vettel when reigning world champion forced him so wide through curva grande that alonso was forced off circuit bruno senna later criticised race stewards for not penalising paul di resta for a similar altercation on approach to della early in race meanwhile with romain grosjean serving his suspension lotus enlisted former marussia f1 driver jerome d ambrosio as their second driver for weekend he qualified sixteenth and went on to finish thirteenth overall red bull racing suffered a double retirement with vettel falling victim to another alternator failure and mark webber spinning violently at ascari chicane with resultant damage to his tyres sending vibrations through car that forced him to retire this allowed hamilton to leapfrog both drivers and kimi raikkonen who finished race fifth to take second place in world drivers championship with result enabling mclaren to close gap to red bull in world constructors championship round 14 singapore thumb right paul di resta finished in a career best fourth place in singapore as teams returned to asia focus shifted to championship race lewis hamilton put himself in ideal position to take fight to fernando alonso qualifying on pole whilst alonso could only manage fifth place in physically most demanding race of year teams jostled for position through first phase of grand prix trying to position themselves for final ten laps just as drivers established a rhythm hamilton s gearbox failed forcing him out of race and handing lead to sebastian vettel race was shortened by two laps to fit two hour time limit for a grand prix following a pair of lengthy safety car interventions first narain karthikeyan understeered into barriers under grandstands on lap 30 forcing safety car to be deployed drivers had little opportunity to get comfortable on restart as michael schumacher misjudged his braking point at end of esplanade bridge careening into back of jean eric vergne and triggering safety car for second time in an accident that was a near mirror image of his collision with sergio perez in 2011 he was later given a ten place grid penalty for japanese grand prix vettel controlled race from second restart beating jenson button to line for his second win of season and his first since bahrain grand prix five months previously alonso completed podium retaining his championship lead after defending from paul di resta late in race elsewhere a string of retirements including a late engine problem for bruno senna which left brazilian with minor burns to his back and a series of altercations involving mark webber nico hulkenberg kamui kobayashi and sergio perez as they fought over minor points positions allowed timo glock to finish twelfth result seeing marussia retake tenth position in world constructors championship from caterham round 15 japan thumb right romain grosjean left was criticised for his role in causing another first lap incident this time spinning mark webber around at start of race fernando alonso s luck finally ran out in japan having spent most of season profiting from poor results from his rivals when he needed them most alonso was victim of a dramatic first corner clash spinning out when he made contact with kimi raikkonen and paving way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty nine point championship lead mark webber was also caught up in opening lap melee when he was hit by romain grosjean webber was forced to pit straight away while grosjean was given a ten second stop go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident bruno senna also ran afoul of stewards hitting nico rosberg whilst trying to avoid grosjean and webber and earning a drive through penalty for his troubles while rosberg retired on spot sergio perez added his name to growing list of early retirements when he slid off at hairpin under brakes and into gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling lewis hamilton sebastian vettel won race from pole position having led every lap of race and setting fastest lap time in process to complete his second grand chelem felipe massa finished second his first podium result since 2010 korean grand prix whilst kamui kobayashi claimed first podium of his career and first podium for a japanese driver at suzuka circuit since aguri suzuki finished third in 1990 after withstanding late pressure from jenson button with alonso retiring and vettel taking a full twenty five points for victory championship fight became as close as it had been all season long round 16 korea sebastian vettel s momentum continued one week later in korea winning his third consecutive race and taking a six point championship lead as fernando alonso finished third vettel overcame pole sitter mark webber at start and was aided in building up a lead by first lap contact between jenson button nico rosberg and kamui kobayashi that saw button and rosberg retire with damage from collision rosberg pulled over on approach to third turn forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car with sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown field was effectively thinned out in opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another tyre management became focus of race as drivers reported heavy graining particularly on right front tyre which bore most of load over a lap of circuit vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent only backing off just enough in final few laps to secure victory over webber by six seconds team later denied that there had ever been a problem with vettel s tyres further down order scuderia toro rosso s jean eric vergne and daniel ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty first on grid to finish eighth and ninth while romain grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh having been warned beforehand by stewards that another first lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from race lewis hamilton s day went from bad to worse when an anti roll bar on his mclaren failed while car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop in order to make it to finish only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from sergio perez to take final world championship point on offer button s retirement and hamilton s single point meant that mclaren lost second place in world constructors championship to ferrari and hamilton admitted that his bid to be 2012 world drivers champion was over round 17 india ferrari s strategy for staying in championship battle saw them introduce upgrades to f2012 at every remaining race in season starting with an extensive revision for indian grand prix but whatever advantage they offered was still not enough for fernando alonso to catch sebastian vettel vettel dominated weekend setting fastest time in every practice session before qualifying on pole and leading every lap of sixty lap race though he was denied his third grand chelem when jenson button set fastest lap of race on final lap fernando alonso finished second conceding another seven championship points to vettel ferrari driver rounded up both mclaren drivers at start of race and proceeded to chase down mark webber for second only overtaking australian on long back straight when his car developed a kers fault fifteen laps from end that it never recovered from webber held off a late challenge from lewis hamilton to complete podium further down order kimi raikkonen finished seventh after spending most of race trapped behind felipe massa and later claimed that mistakes on saturday had robbed him of a podium on sunday while pedro de la rosa retired from race when he suffered a brake failure that saw him spin into barriers at turn 4 race was marked by a series of explosive punctures after cars made light contact with one another michael schumacher s right rear tyre deflated on first lap when he made contact with jean eric vergne at first corner sergio perez suffered a puncture under similar circumstances when he glanced daniel ricciardo s front wing with loose rubber damaging floor of perez s car enough that he was forced into retirement and pastor maldonado also had a tyre punctured when he and kamui kobayashi touched at speed on approach to turn 5 forcing venezuelan to run wide onto tarmac run off but suffering no lasting damage round 18 abu dhabi thumb right kimi raikkonen took lotus s first victory of 2012 season in abu dhabi after he inherited lead following lewis hamilton s retirement from race sebastian vettel s dominant run was derailed in abu dhabi when his car was found to have insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved to back of grid as lewis hamilton led race away from start vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw nico hulkenberg paul di resta romain grosjean and bruno senna tangle hulkenberg was forced out while di resta and grosjean pitted with damage vettel began to round up and caterhams but his early progress came at expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with senna at turn 8 switchback he chose not to pit for time being as race was interrupted by intervention of safety car nico rosberg who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing was in process of overtaking narain karthikeyan as karthikeyan s car began to fail and indian quickly slowed rosberg caught unawares by karthikeyan s troubles was launched over back of hrt and into barrier during safety car period vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid daniel ricciardo and crashed into polystyrene bollard marking start of drs zone further damaging his wing red bull racing took opportunity to pit him early with downside being that vettel would have to do 42 laps on soft tyre when supplier pirelli predicted they could only do 36 meanwhile hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading race and was once again forced out handing lead to kimi raikkonen while fernando alonso inherited second vettel began to work his way through field again but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip he was saved by second appearance of safety car moments later brought about when di resta forced sergio perez wide as perez rejoined circuit he cut back across front of grosjean and two made contact which in turn forced grosjean into path of mark webber grosjean and webber retired whilst perez was given a stop go penalty when racing resumed raikkonen began to rebuild his lead over alonso who was being harried by jenson button button himself was being harried by vettel in fourth button and vettel s duel allowed alonso to break free and he started chasing down raikkonen in last five laps raikkonen held on to secure his and lotus f1 s first victory of season alonso was second while vettel caught and passed button to complete podium keeping a ten point championship lead in process with both alonso and vettel finishing on podium with him raikkonen s win was not enough to keep him in contention for world drivers championship leaving title to be fought out between alonso and vettel over final two races of season round 19 united states despite its troubled construction period circuit of americas passed its final fia inspection on 25 september allowing race to go ahead sebastian vettel took his sixth pole position of season whilst alonso struggled throughout qualifying to start race ninth which became eighth when romain grosjean received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change amid concerns that drivers starting from even numbered grid slots would suffer from a lack of grip as they were located off racing line ferrari deliberately broke seal on felipe massa s gearbox thereby giving him a five place grid penalty and promoting alonso to seventh and clean side of grid ferrari s fears were not without merit as drivers starting from even number spaces fell behind at start of race vettel quickly converted pole position into a steady race lead as lewis hamilton fought to regain second place from mark webber moments after hamilton caught him on lap 17 australian suffered yet another alternator problem and coasted to a halt red bull racing team principal christian horner later admitted that team s perpetual alternator problems were a serious concern with just one race left in championship a world championship at stake and very little time to diagnose and correct problem with webber now out of running hamilton then turned his attentions on vettel and steadily closed gap to lead overtaking world championship leader on lap 42 when vettel got caught behind narain karthikeyan in meandering first sector which allowed hamilton to pass vettel along long back straight hamilton held onto lead for final fourteen laps but with vettel never more than a second and a half behind him hamilton could not afford to relax and he won race by just six tenths of a second alonso recovered from seventh to finish third marking first time that he hamilton and vettel had stood on podium together in one hundred races all three had contested together and forcing title fight to extend to final round in brazil further down order massa overcame his gearbox penalty to finish fourth while jenson button fell from twelfth on grid to sixteenth at end of first lap using an alternative strategy to claw his way back up to fifth michael schumacher on other hand went backwards after qualifying fifth his mercedes chewed through its tyres forcing him to make a second stop that sent him plummeting down order to finish sixteenth and a clutch problem during his stop deprived kimi raikkonen of chance to compete with alonso for final podium place both marussia drivers out qualified caterhams for first time only for timo glock and charles pic be out raced by heikki kovalainen and vitaly petrov but russian team held onto tenth place in world constructors championship despite losing webber to an alternator failure red bull collected enough points to secure their

wet enough for drivers to use wet tyres but never quite dry enough for slick tyres to provide enough grip while jenson button and lewis hamilton fought over race lead sebastian vettel was involved in a first lap clash with bruno senna that damaged his exhaust and spun him around relegating him to last place senna retired on spot as did sergio perez who was caught in crossfire race was one of attrition with pastor maldonado and romain grosjean also crashing out early button seized lead from hamilton but soon found himself under pressure from nico hulkenberg and lost lead to german driver on lap 18 and second place to hamilton shortly thereafter field stabilised themselves after first round of stops with vettel in lower points and fernando alonso running fourth when he needed a podium to stand any chance of being champion hulkenberg spun on lap 48 and lost lead to hamilton but caught mclaren on lap 54 as they encountered lapped traffic two made contact in first corner forcing hamilton out of race and earning hulkenberg a drive through penalty for causing an avoidable accident in wake of their collision button re took lead and held on to end of race meanwhile rain intensified prompting teams to scramble for tyres hulkenberg s penalty and hamilton s retirement promoted alonso to podium which became second place when team mate felipe massa yielded for him a slow stop for vettel relegated him to twelfth and swinging balance of power in alonso s favour in last ten laps of race vettel began to make his way back up order until he was seventh just enough to secure title but leaving him vulnerable if damage he received on first lap which by now had left a long crack running along floor of his car got worse vettel s seventh became sixth when michael schumacher moved aside to let vettel through two laps from end of race paul di resta crashed heavily as he came onto main straight forcing deployment of safety car button won race with alonso second and massa third but vettel s sixth place was enough to secure his third consecutive world drivers championship kimi raikkonen finished season third overall having benefited from hamilton s retirement to hold onto place following a bizarre incident in which he left circuit and attempted to rejoin by taking to support paddock pit lane only to find way blocked and forcing him to double back and find another way onto circuit in his final race in formula one schumacher s seventh place saw him finish season in thirteenth place overall his worst performance over a season since he contested six rounds during season in world constructors championship ferrari secured second place from mclaren with two cars on podium while kamui kobayashi s ninth place was not enough for sauber to take fifth from mercedes and marussia lost tenth place to caterham when vitaly petrov secured team s best result of season with eleventh place nikolai marussia s director of engineering later claimed that charles pic had deliberately let petrov through as pic had announced his move to caterham for season two days before race however no action was taken by fia in response to these claims post season controversy three days after brazilian grand prix reports began to surface suggesting that sebastian vettel s championship was under threat and that ferrari would be filing a formal protest against race results challenge centred on a pass vettel made on jean eric vergne early in race at time first sector of circuit was under yellow flag conditions following spin and retirement of pastor maldonado at curva do sol interlagos circuit s third corner which feeds onto back straight vettel overtook vergne along straight which led to claims that pass was illegal because of yellow flags intense media speculation suggested that challenge threatened vettel s championship because as race finished behind safety car any post race penalty had potential to demote him in race standings and vettel would not have enough points to secure title ferrari wrote to fia requesting clarification on matter fia reviewed incident and declared that vettel s pass was legal as a green flag was being shown by a marshal adjacent to pit exit meaning track was green from that point onward confusion had been caused by a digital board showing a yellow flag on exit of curva do sol some one hundred metres before
