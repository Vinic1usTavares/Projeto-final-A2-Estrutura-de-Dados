mega drive release development thumb upright j cart was created to enable four players without an adaptor andrew graham programmer of original game had returned to university after its completion and david darling co founder of codemasters decided that they could not wait for him to finish his degree codemasters approached peter williamson of supersonic software and had him produce sequel williamson had just completed cosmic and wanted to do something new it was intended for sequel to reproduce feeling of original and add as many new features as possible original was used for reference and code and graphics were produced from beginning williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that original game offered and game s success was anticipated darling wanted it to be more than a mere continuation of first development began in 1993 just after release of mega drive version of first game release date was set at november 1994 and according to williamson there was pressure to meet it early decisions focused on vehicle physics such as heavier vehicles being slow according to williamson slow vehicles were considered boring and that team made game for ourselves he stated that team wanted more variety and depth than original so variables such as tyre friction and wheel lock were programmed to modify behaviours of vehicles these additions increased size of game to double that of original but compression techniques were used to avoid need for high capacity storage this also allowed production of j cart enabling four controllers to be plugged in without extra hardware williamson believed that increasing number of players would make game more fun and stated that j cart played a major role in establishing it as a party game david and richard darling came up with idea of j cart although not initially involved with it supersonic software s team were excited on hearing about j cart because they thought it had potential richard was also project manager and visited supersonic software s offices weekly his primary concern was how much fun game was david also thought of idea of players sharing controllers increasing total number of players supported to eight williamson said that team were not concerned with difficulty increasing too quickly or having a target audience supersonic s focus was on graphics and game modes for smaller vehicles as mega drive was considered leading platform an 8 bit look was impossible david darling was not happy with early efforts and had supersonic redraw graphics he said perspective was wrong and there was slowdown he also said that getting game running at 50 frames per second fps in eight player mode was difficult supersonic asked big red software to assist with graphics most of background graphics were produced by mark using an amiga 500 he stated that some graphics were hard despite having access to originals and believed that additional colours enabled him to muddy up graphics but also used increased colour palette to clean some up richard darling encouraged tweaking giving game a personality journalists frequently visited to check on progress violet berlin co presenter of television programme bad influence made a cameo appearance as a character she made one such visit and richard eddy of codemasters asked to take her picture to put in game she agreed on condition that she was made fastest character although it was already decided that another character would be she was instead made second fastest character micro machines 2 turbo tournament features greater background interaction than original such as levels in dark williamson s favourite addition to game was sponge in kitchen which forced players to time their entry onto and exit from a platform he also liked toilet seat track david darling initially disliked physics stating he liked way first game achieved skids without feeling like a train manoeuvring it was worked on until it was similar to original and ultimately it worked perfectly according to williamson team spent enormous amounts of time testing game micro machines 2 turbo tournament was released for mega drive in 1994 cartridge features a non volatile memory nvr chip that stores lap times and game achievements game was ported to dos game gear super nintendo entertainment system snes and game boy an amiga version was also

because team were going for a christmas release date he also stated that usa was a difficult market to compete in sequel was produced in six months due to its success supersonic was asked to develop micro machines military released in 1996 for mega drive which featured military vehicles with weapons graham returned to develop micro machines v3 released in 1997 micro machines 2 turbo tournament was bundled with original and released for game boy color in 2000 reception micro machines 2 turbo tournament was well received critics were impressed with j cart and extra tracks and vehicles mark patterson of computer and video games praised mega drive version s j cart enabling more than two players without extra hardware and described game as bloody brilliant edge reviewer commented that extra vehicles tracks and game modes increase re playability of both single player and multiplayer reviewers of gamesmaster lauded its addictiveness and commented that it is amongst best or highest rated games they have played a reviewer from mean machines sega believed game exceeded their expectations and echoed other opinions by praising re playability provided by extra levels and vehicles player one reviewer eulogised animation saying it lacks slowdown and playability reviewers from sega magazine were highly positive richard leadbetter and tom guise lauded multiplayer mode saying it is untouchable playability were also given high praise and was described as superb leadbetter believed game is totally brilliant and well worth asking price game gear version received positive reviews with some comparing it to mega drive version a reviewer from consoles describes its music as reminiscent of mega drive soundtrack and lauded animation saying its speed is incredible mean machines sega reviewer described game gear version as every bit as playable as mega drive classic but criticised screen update saying it makes things a bit muddy player one reviewer praised originality of circuits but described sound as average a reviewer from mega fun thought that multiplayer is better with two units linked than with two players sharing one similar compliments were made of other versions a reviewer from consoles praised snes version s simultaneous four player function and addition of game modes and tracks reviewer praised multiplayer saying it is simply excellent and gave vehicles manoeuvrability a similar description power play reviewer praised dos version s variety vince broady of gamespot praised excellent gameplay but complained that cd soundtrack is repetitive and that graphics were not as good as competitors coming soon magazine s reviewer complimented its terrific gameplay and praised track editor saying it was a tremendous idea and that it increases playability steve bauman of computer games strategy plus had mixed feelings he believed game is shallow as hell but also described it as surprisingly entertaining pc zones charlie brooker liked graphics and sound describing them as cute and neat respectively and praised game s timeless console style action game was named a pc zone classic a reviewer for next generation remarked that if you re just interested in simple arcade style racing that even runs fine on a 386 well you ve hit mother lode he felt game seemed designed more for consoles since it is plainly focused on multiplayer mode but lacks support for networked play thus requiring players to crowd around a single pc but was pleased with cuteness of cars and inventiveness of tracks updated mega drive version was also well received although some questioned its worth as a separate title track editor was described by gary lord of computer and video games as a novel idea but stated that there is not a lot else to it compared to original game describing extra tracks as more of same a reviewer from concurred by complimenting track editor and extra tracks and saying game gave an impression of deja vu mean machines sega reviewer took a different position he believed that track editor adds a whole new dimension but raised issue of whether players would want it if they already own original game player one reviewer gave opinion that it introduces innovations that add to game s interest a reviewer of mega fun praised exemplary gameplay but said track editor was only renovation ed lomas of sega saturn magazine compared track editor to dos version s and thought it severely limited and not as comprehensive and also criticised codemasters for releasing game as a standalone title rather than an add on cartridge nevertheless he praised game in general saying it is one of most playable games he has played but although he described it as better said improvements over original are not enough to make it essential references external
