thumb upright 1 6 at le havre in 1878 prior to her departure for san francisco in a trip that would see her round cape horn jeannette expedition of 1879 1881 officially called u s arctic expedition was an attempt led by george w de long to reach north pole by pioneering a route from pacific ocean through bering strait premise was that a temperate current kuro siwo flowed northwards into strait providing a gateway to open polar sea and thus to pole this theory proved illusory expedition s ship and its crew of 33 was trapped by ice and drifted for nearly two years before she was crushed and sunk north of siberian coast de long then led his 32 men on a perilous journey by sled dragging jeannette whaleboat and two cutters eventually switching to these small boats to sail for lena delta in siberia during this journey and in subsequent weeks of wandering in siberia before rescue 20 of ship s complement died including de long chief exponent of theory of a warm water gateway to north pole was german cartographer august petermann he encouraged james gordon bennett jr proprietor of new york herald to finance a polar expedition based on untried pacific route bennett acquired a former royal navy gunboat pandora and changed her name to jeannette de long whom bennett chose to lead expedition was a serving naval officer with previous arctic experience although essentially a private venture in which bennett paid all bills expedition had full support of u s government before departure ship was commissioned into u s navy as uss jeannette and sailed under navy laws and discipline before its demise expedition discovered new islands de long islands and collected valuable meteorological and oceanographic data although jeannettes fate demolished widely believed open polar sea theory appearance in 1884 of debris from wreck on south west coast of greenland indicated existence of an ocean current moving permanent arctic ice from east to west this discovery inspired fridtjof nansen to mount his fram expedition nine years later a monument to jeannettes dead was erected at united states naval academy in annapolis in 1890 background early arctic exploration thumb upright 1 5 north pole by gerardus mercator shows pole within an open polar sea in 1606 european exploration of arctic regions began in 16th century with searches for new routes to pacific via northeast and northwest passages english sea explorer henry hudson namesake of hudson river is presumed to have died in hudson bay in 1611 while trying to find northwest passage possibility of a third route directly across north pole was raised by early geographer richard hakluyt early explorers had little success in finding these routes but made important geographical discoveries in time search for trade routes became secondary to prestige objective of reaching north pole itself or at least of registering a farthest north in 1773 a british naval expedition under captain constantine phipps sought a route to pole from seven islands but found way blocked by ice on may 28 1806 whaling captain william achieved a new record northern latitude of to north of svalbard before being stopped by ice prevalent theory of polar geography throughout this period was that of a temperate open polar sea surrounding north pole observable southward drift of arctic ice was thought to result from pushing effect of this warmer water according to historian hampton sides despite lack of scientific evidence theory gathered a logic of its own no amount of contrary evidence could dislodge it from collective imagination fact that all northbound voyages had sooner or later been stopped by ice was rationalized through a belief that undiscovered sea was encircled in a ring or annulus of ice which it was thought could be penetrated via one of several warm water gateways or portals initial quest for north pole thus became a search for one of these portals after british naval expeditions in 1818 and 1827 1828 had probed north of spitsbergen and found no sign of supposed polar sea quest was in abeyance for 25 years in 1850s search for lost franklin expedition generated a rash of incursions into canadian arctic from these forays particularly that of edward augustus inglefield in 1852 emerged theory that smith sound a northerly channel between greenland and ellesmere island might be one of fabled gateways to polar sea this brought a succession of expeditions to this area elisha kane in isaac israel hayes in 1860 1861 charles francis hall in 1872 1874 and george nares in 1875 1876 no gateway was found although both kane and hayes claimed mistakenly to have seen open polar sea from a distance august petermann thumb upright 0 78 left august petermann smith sound route was not favored by everyone among those who rejected it was leading cartographer august petermann from gotha in germany widely known as sage of gotha a firm believer in open polar sea theory he believed that most likely portal would be found by following gulf stream which swept up coast of norway to unexplored arctic regions peterman thought current would weaken or even penetrate protective ice ring and that a sturdily built steamer following course of stream might thus be able to break through into supposed polar sea after two expeditions sponsored by petermann german north polar expedition of 1869 led by carl koldewey and austro hungarian north pole expedition of 1872 under karl and julius von payer had followed separate branches of gulf stream but ultimately failed to break through ice petermann grew dispirited in year before he took his own life in 1878 he transferred his advocacy to kuro siwo a pacific ocean current analyzed in 1850s by hydrographer silas bent petermann followed bent in believing that a branch of kuro siwo flowed through bering strait and might be powerful enough to create a path to polar sea at time no one had attempted to reach polar sea by this route george w de long thumb upright george w de long in july 1873 u s navy dispatched to greenland to search for survivors from polaris expedition which had disintegrated after death of its leader charles francis hall second in command was george w de long a 28 year old graduate of united states naval academy making his first visit to arctic ice conditions prevented juniata from advancing beyond upernavik de long volunteered to take ship s tender a small steamer named little juniata in hope of finding survivors at cape york a further north attempt failed little juniata faced extreme weather conditions and was forced to retreat a few miles from cape york de long returned to juniata in mid august having found no trace of polaris crew who had meanwhile been rescued by scottish whaler but experience had profoundly affected his outlook having earlier described greenland coast in a letter to his wife emma as a dreary land of desolation i hope i may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly god forsaken place he returned home captivated by arctic emma wrote polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest abortive little juniata mission brought de long to public notice and he saw himself as a possible leader of next u s arctic expedition he approached henry grinnell philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support instead advising de long to approach james gordon bennett jr owner and publisher of new york herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes de long met bennett in new york early in 1874 newspaperman was impressed by de long and assured him that his arctic ambitions would have enthusiastic support of herald in meantime de long had applied to navy department for an arctic command a request that he was informed would receive due attention james gordon bennett jr james gordon bennett jr had succeeded his father as proprietor of new york herald in 1866 he had won renown in 1872 when his reporter henry morton stanley sent by bennett to africa in search of british missionary explorer david livingstone cabled that livingstone had been found bennett knew news value of arctic exploration two herald reporters had accompanied juniata and in 1874 bennett was helping to fund british sailor allen young and his decommissioned former gunboat pandora on one of final franklin searches bennett was interested in petermann s theories and in 1877 traveled to gotha to discuss possible arctic routes with geographer petermann thought that as well as providing best path to pole passage through bering strait using kuro siwo would enable investigation of unexplored barely glimpsed land mass known since 1867 as wrangel s land he theorized that this land might form part of a continent connected to greenland if so it might provide an alternative land based route to pole should expedition fail to find a portal to polar sea my idea he told bennett is that if one door will not open try another he offered bennett full use of his maps and charts petermann s advice convinced bennett that a new american polar venture should go ahead on his return from gotha he cabled de long requesting him to seek leave of absence from navy and to begin search for a ship suitable for arctic exploration using petermann s bering strait route preparation ship thumb pandora cruising in smith sound during one her arctic voyages as no suitable ship was available in united states de long went to england where he found young s pandora on offer at 6 000 vessel s arctic pedigree made it seem ideal but young s hesitancy about selling delayed purchase until late 1877 at bennett s instigation congress passed legislation that gave navy department full control over expedition it would fly american flag crew would be engaged by navy and would be subject to naval discipline bennett remained responsible for financing enterprise and undertook to reimburse government for all costs incurred meanwhile de long was released from active duty to oversee pandora s refit in england in june 1878 after a thorough overhaul at deptford on thames estuary pandora was sailed to le havre in france where on july 4 she was renamed after bennett s sister who performed ceremony on july 15 ship manned by de long and a small crew sailed from le havre to begin voyage to san francisco port from which arctic expedition was to sail they arrived on december 27 1878 and transferred jeannette to mare island naval shipyard to undergo further work in readiness for a prolonged journey in arctic ice de long spent much of early part of 1879 in washington d c promoting expedition among officials searching for appropriate crew members and harrying navy secretary richard w thompson for practical support his requests included use of a supply ship to accompany jeannette as far as alaska among less standard equipment acquired by de long was an experimental arc lamp system devised by thomas edison which would supposedly provide light equivalent to 3 000 candles and thus transform arctic winter darkness having successfully undergone her sea trials on june 28 ten days before her scheduled

pilot william dunbar who had many years experience in whalers appointment of expedition s navigating officer was problematic john w danenhower a young naval officer from a well connected washington family was recommended to bennett by former president ulysses s grant such sponsorship won danenhower his place despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at government hospital for insane on bennett s request danenhower accompanied de long on voyage from le havre to san francisco during which he confided details of his medical history navigator s competent performance persuaded de long that such troubles were in past ship s surgeon james ambler was assigned to expedition by navy s bureau of medicine and surgery only because he was next on list of medical officers available for sea duty ambler deduced from danenhower s medical records that a probable cause of navigator s medical lapses was syphilis but danenhower s influential connections ensured that he kept his place on expedition two others from jeannettes voyage from le havre carpenter albert sweetman and boatswain john cole were enlisted as was heralds meteorologist jerome collins

himself at odds with naval engineers at mare island whose estimates of work required to prepare jeannette for arctic greatly exceeded his own judgement of what was necessary de long spent much time negotiating on bennett s behalf with navy department in an effort to reduce costs in this he was broadly successful but in other areas he faced setbacks in april he learned that navy was unable to provide a supply ship to accompany jeannette northward a decision which he thought left fate of expedition hanging by a thread bennett eventually resolved this difficulty by chartering a schooner frances hyde to carry extra coal and provisions as far as alaska late in his preparations de long received orders from secretary thompson that before proceeding with his own arctic mission he should enquire along siberian coast for news of adolf erik nordenskiold and his ship swedish explorer was currently attempting first navigation of northeast passage he was not overdue and there was no evidence that he was in difficulty nevertheless bennett sensed opportunity for a rescue story to equal his stanley livingstone scoop and persuaded thompson to issue order de long unaware that his patron was originator protested that this requirement would jeopardize his primary mission but was forced to modify his plans de long was unaware as he prepared to sail that u s coast and geodetic survey was studying latest and meteorological data obtained from its research ships in bering sea material indicated conclusively that contrary to bent s theories kuro siwo had no perceptible effect on areas north of bering strait survey s report went on to dismiss entire concept of gateways and warm polar sea by time these conclusions were published jeannette had sailed and de long remained in ignorance of this information voyage toward arctic jeannette s departure from san francisco on july 8 1879 was a popular spectacle witnessed by large crowds who came from all quarters of city army at fort point provided an eleven gun salute in contrast de long noted that none of naval vessels in and around san francisco made any formal acknowledgement of their sister ship s departure not even blast of a steam whistle bennett absent in europe cabled that he hoped to be present when jeannette made its triumphant return first weeks on journey northwards were uneventful on august 3 jeannette reached unalaska in aleutian islands where de long sought information on nordenskiold from crew of a revenue cutter newly returned from bering strait cutter had no news of him on august 12 jeannette reached st michael a small port on alaskan mainland and waited for francis hyde to arrive with extra provisions and coal at st michael de long hired two experienced inuit dog drivers and took on board a number of sled dogs on august 21 after transferring provisions and fuel francis hyde departed jeannette set out for chukchi peninsula on siberian coast to enquire after nordenskiold at saint lawrence bay chukchi people reported that an unidentified steamer had recently passed by going south de long then headed through bering strait towards cape where he learned from locals that a ship had called at cape serdtse kamen further along coast here a shore party from jeannette quickly established from artifacts left behind with villagers that this ship was vega and that nordenskiold s expedition had therefore safely completed northeast passage de long left a note of his findings for transmission to washington on august 31 jeannette left in assumed direction of wrangel s land where de long hoped to establish his winter quarters icebound thumb upright 1 3 herald island sketched in 1881 from corwin jeannette initially made good speed northward on september 2 she was about from charted position of wrangel s land but with ice thickening all around movement became slow and erratic on september 4 from crow s nest dunbar sighted known landmark of herald island but ice now presented an almost insuperable obstacle to progress de long raised steam and repeatedly charged pack seeking to batter a way forward thick plume of smoke from jeannette s stack observed by whalers was final sighting of jeannette by outside world next day september 5 crew caught a brief glimpse of wrangel s land or perhaps as de long surmised a mirage ice conditions now made it impossible to move closer to this tantalizing shore and de long made herald island his new objective shortly afterwards jeannette was sealed within pack as tightly as a fly in amber according to historian leonard herald island was still about away a sled party under chipp set off across ice to investigate possibility of a winter harbor should ship regain maneuverability chipp s party was unable to get closer to island than before volatile ice conditions forced their return to ship de long still hoped for a change in weather that would release them from ice writing in his journal i am told that in later part of september and early part of october there is experienced in these latitudes quite an indian summer following weeks brought no increase in temperature and de long reluctantly accepted that jeannette was trapped for winter drifting initial direction of ship s drift was haphazard back and forth on october 13 nearly a month after jeannette was first trapped herald island was still in sight as october developed direction of drift shifted to northwest and it became apparent to de long that wrangel s land was not after all a land mass but was a relatively small island at same time analyses of sea currents salinity and temperature provided data confirming geodetic survey s findings by then known in washington that kuro siwo had no effect north of bering strait vista of endless ice surrounding ship raised profound doubts about entire concept of open polar sea amid boredom of largely drift crew ate well ship s stores were boosted by regular hunting parties which brought a harvest of seal and polar bear meat thumb upright 1 5 left jeannette trapped in ice off herald island in late october as winter approached de long ordered edison arc lighting system erected but generating mechanism failed to produce even dimmest of lights and apparatus was swiftly abandoned along with equally ineffective telephone system christmas 1879 and start of new year were celebrated without great joy de long wrote of christmas as dreariest day of my life and it is certainly dreariest part of world on january 19 1880 jeannettes hull was breached by ice and she began to take in water rapidly de long prepared to abandon ship but she was saved by actions of nindemann and sweetman who waded into freezing water in hold and inflow by stuffing whatever materials were available into breaches melville used elements of discarded edison apparatus to build a mechanical pumping system and problem was largely resolved by construction of a new watertight bulkhead de long noted in his journal that efforts of nindemann and sweetman were at least worthy of recommendation for medal of honor for months on end jeannette hardly moved at all de long recorded on march 2 that their position was almost precisely what it had been three months earlier on may 5 ship passed to west of 180deg meridian but two months later had retreated back to other side of line summer brought no relief although it briefly seemed possible in august that jeannette might break free and find open water this proved a false hope condition of danenhower was a further source of anxiety his syphilis began to take toll of his body particularly his left eye which despite ambler s repeated operations stoically endured given lack of anesthetic left navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties on last day of 1880 de long wrote in his journal i begin new year by turning over a new leaf and i hope to god we are turning over a new leaf in our book of luck crushed thumb sinking of jeannette early in 1881 de long noted that after 16 months jeannette was still only from point where she had been trapped he wrote we are drifting about like a modern flying dutchman thirty three people are wearing out their lives and souls on may 16 an island was sighted followed almost immediately by another first land seen for well over a year there is something then beside ice in world wrote de long they were in uncharted seas so these islands were discoveries de long named first henrietta island after bennett s mother and second jeannette island a sledge party under melville was despatched to henrietta island to claim territories for united states at around this time was in alaskan waters seeking news of de long s expedition captain calvin hooper heard stories of a shipwreck in far north and set off to investigate for five weeks he circled bering sea encounters with locals convinced him that wreck was not that of jeannette on june 16 another relief vessel left san francisco but was destroyed by fire in saint lawrence bay in november on board jeannette discovery of islands had raised de long s spirits expedition would wherever drift took it have some concrete geographical achievement to its credit onset of brief arctic summer brought fresh hopes that jeannette would at last be released from ice and on june 11 she was briefly free afloat in a small pool however next day ice returned with renewed force which battered ship and finally penetrated hull beyond repair de long supervised an orderly evacuation of men dogs equipment and provisions in early morning of june 13 1881 jeannette sank her final recorded position being around off siberian coast journey across ice thumb upright 1 5 june 12 to september 17 1881 entire crew of 33 was still together de long s general plan was to march with dogs and sleds to new siberian islands somewhere to south and then use boats to carry his party to siberian mainland according to petermann s maps his intended landfall lena delta was studded with settlements that would provide them with shelter and safety by june 25 after a week s hard traveling on ice northward drift had nullified their progress they were further from land than they had been when they set out when direction of ice shifted party was finally able to advance in right direction but going was slow and difficult part of problem lay with dogs who after nearly two years of relative idleness were either lethargic or quarrelsome unable to work in harness some of worst offenders were shot for food on july 12 land appeared to south fleetingly de long thought this was part of new siberian islands but it was another uncharted island when party reached it on july 29 de long named it bennett island and called point of landing cape emma after his wife meanwhile hundreds of miles to east corwin had given up on its rescue mission after months of searching vainly for definite news or traces of jeannette hooper had concluded that vessel was lost and headed back to san francisco after a week s rest party departed bennett island on august 6 leaving a message in a rock cairn ice was now too loose for sled travel so party transferred to boats having no further use for dogs de long ordered them shot general direction of ice flow carried party south west and on august 20 most easterly of new siberian islands novaya sibir was in sight for first time since moving away from herald island nearly two years previously they were in charted world de long steered boats through channel between novaya sibir and kotelny island

being placed under engineer s command but de long replied that danenhower was unfit for duty a view confirmed by ambler de long instructed that boats should each aim for a point indicated as cape barkin on petermann map if they became separated and landed in different areas parties should rendezvous at bulun a sizeable settlement about from coast boats made good progress through morning and melville initially thought they might strike land after a single night at sea in afternoon weather worsened boats separated and lost sight of each other de long used a sea anchor to stabilize his craft in ferocious seas and despite having his sail torn away by wind managed to hold a course to west storm had largely subsided by morning of september 14 but progress was erratic in absence of sail and it was three more days before cutter ran aground at most northerly limit of lena delta de long and his crew waded ashore carrying their provisions from boat and prepared for a long foot journey based on their map nearest settlement appeared to lie away de long thought their rations would last for three and a half days in whaleboat melville had like de long ridden out storm by means of a sea anchor boat s course was far to south of de long s they finally reached land at one of main mouths of lena and were able to navigate upriver within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp and by september 25 had reached settlement of arrhu chipp s cutter never reached land overwhelmed by storm it presumably foundered with loss of all eight on board de long party thumb upright 1 1 lena delta de long s party found no immediate sign at their landing place of any human habitation and had only a sketchy idea of where they were petermann s map provided few useful details on september 19 having buried their non essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole they set out in search of settlements progress was hampered by poor physical condition of men in particular eriksen who was badly affected by frostbite on september 21 they halted at two empty huts probably part of a hunting camp where alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks de long allowed his exhausted party several days rest before resuming march on september 28 party found a large hut with signs of recent occupation edible food in store and moccasin tracks in snow when searches in locality brought no sign of people de long decided to move on by october 4 eriksen could not continue party halted at another abandoned hut where on october 6 eriksen died on october 9 with condition of several men worsening de long decided to send two of fittest in group nindemann and noros to seek help ambler was offered opportunity to go with them but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with main body for next week de long s party struggled on sometimes making barely a mile a day although they jettisoned more of their possessions on way de long insisted on carrying his maps and journals his entry for october 10 recorded that there was nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine a few days later alexey group s principal hunter shot a ptarmigan which provided soup but alexey was weakening and on october 17 he died on october 20 trapped by weather and without supplies party came to a final halt throughout march de long had written up his journal each day but after october 20 his entries became intermittent largely limited to terse statements of dying and dead he noted deaths of kaak and lee on october 21 iverson on 28th dressler on 29th his last entry dated october 30 records deaths of boyd and gortz and ends mr collins dying melville nindemann and noros thumb upright 0 8 nindemann and noros after resting at arrhu melville s group moved out aiming for agreed rendezvous at bulun on september 19 they encountered native tungus who led party first to tiny settlement of little and then on to larger village of here locals advised them that they would have to wait for river to freeze before attempting to reach bulun after several weeks melville learned from a russian traveler that two americans were recuperating at bulun weather conditions were now suitable for travel so melville hired a pair of expert local dog drivers to take him to bulun he left danenhower in charge with instructions to lead party to bulun as soon as practicable and from there to proceed as best he could to yakutsk a large city hundreds of miles to south melville arrived in bulun on november 3 where he found nindemann and noros weak but recovering from them melville learned of de long s plight and his urgent need for rescue pair had endured a harrowing experience since leaving de long nearly a month previously they had struggled for ten days sleeping in improvised shelters and eating what they could catch or shoot in this fashion they reached a small abandoned camp which they later learned was named here they had been found by a nomadic band of yakut hunters who had taken them to a large camp at surt to their great frustration they were unable to make understand that they were shipwrecked mariners whose comrades were in dire straits they did manage to convey their desire to reach bulun and were taken there by sled arriving on october 29 a few days before melville joined them there searches from bulun melville sent messages to washington and herald advising them of jeannette s loss and listing survivors and missing parties on november 5 he set out with two local guides using rough maps supplied by nindemann and noros to begin his search for de long at village of north bulun natives brought him notes left by de long s party in cairns one note directed melville to cache of logbooks and instruments that de long had buried at his landing place although now convinced that de long and his comrades must have died melville continued search but encroaching arctic winter meant that he could do no more that season he returned to bulun at end of november and then traveled on to yakutsk to be reunited with other jeannette survivors in january 1882 while most of survivors began their long journey home melville nindemann and james bartlett prepared to head a new search in delta when weather allowed they left yakutsk on january 16 and resumed their search when thaw began in mid march beginning at spot where nindemann and noros had left de long previous october melville began a systematic examination of area on march 23 he found alexey s hunting rifle and nearby remains of a camp team found further artifacts a frozen human arm protruding from snow and finally de long s journal from this they learned story of party s final days soon all bodies except that of alexey which was never found had been recovered those of last three to die de long ambler and ah sam were some distance from rest where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground melville s party wrapped all bodies in canvas and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding there they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross inscribed with names of lost men melville s group left site on april 7 1882 then spent a further month in delta searching without success for signs of chipp and his crew aftermath

deferred until arrival on september 13 of melville nindemann and noros they were welcomed as heroes given a civic reception and treated to a banquet at celebrated delmonico s restaurant public interest in jeannette story had been high since first news of ship s fate had been received from yakutsk bennett had dispatched several reporters to russia including john p jackson who had reached lena delta and found tomb of de long in his zeal for a story jackson had opened tomb to search for papers or other records an act of desecration that emma de long described to bennett as bitterest potion i had to swallow in my whole life jackson had also interviewed danenhower who made allegations of discord within party and of ill treatment of certain officers particularly himself a naval inquiry into loss of jeannette convened at beginning of october at which survivors were principal witnesses in february 1883 board announced its findings jeannette was a fit vessel for arctic service difficulties such as late start and diversion to search for news of vega were not de long s fault nor was he to blame for ship s loss he had conducted subsequent retreat in an exemplary manner not everybody was satisfied relatives of collins who had heard during evidence of trouble between de long and meteorologist did not believe that whole truth had been told and termed enquiry a whitewash in april 1884 a house of representatives naval affairs subcommittee reviewed evidence and confirmed findings of earlier enquiry in february 1882 secretary thompson had despatched naval lieutenants giles harber and william to delta to search for any traces of lost explorers particularly of chipp s party they were unsuccessful but in november received orders from secretary to supervise return of bodies of de long and his comrades to united states weather and bureaucracy delayed them for a year in november 1883 bodies were taken from yakutsk by train to moscow berlin and finally hamburg from where they were transported to new york city by ss frisia in february 1884 funeral cortege was escorted by naval and military detachments to church of holy trinity on madison avenue for a memorial service afterwards bodies of ambler collins and boyd were claimed for private burial those of de long and six others were taken to woodlawn cemetery in bronx and buried together in october 1890 a large monument to expedition s dead was unveiled at united states naval academy in annapolis its design is based on original cairn and cross raised at burial site on lena delta thumb upright 1 monument at annapolis a mountain range in alaska and two naval ships were named in de long s honor three arctic islands discovered during expedition plus two others discovered a few years later form an archipelago that bears name de long islands despite melville s planting of american flag islands have always been accepted as russian territory on september 30 1890 congress authorized jeannette medal eight congressional gold medals and 25 congressional silver medals in commemoration of perils encountered by officers and men of expedition expedition provided some key scientific information on june 18 1884 wreckage from jeannette was found on an ice floe near julianehab near south western corner of greenland this proved that a continuous ocean current flowed from east to west across polar sea and was basis of nansen s fram expedition of 1893 1896 also although open polar sea theory ended with jeannettes voyage ship s meteorological and oceanographic records have provided 21st century climatologists with valuable data relating to climate change and shrinking of polar icecap survivors only one of main survivors in jeannette drama melville returned to arctic where he helped rescue survivors of adolphus greely s lady franklin bay expedition of 1881 1884 melville s naval career prospered and he eventually achieved rank of rear admiral he died in 1912 danenhower continued in navy
