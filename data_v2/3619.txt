dignitaries and media ioc president jacques rogge praised chicago s design in november 2007 as a possible blueprint for future reflecting desire of ioc to make games both more affordable and to have a smaller ecological footprint on host city chicago 2016 stadium plan praised by ioc president olympic village olympic village for housing athletes during games would have been a 1 1 billion series of newly constructed lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after games village was to be located immediately south of mccormick place which was expected to

likely have been superior in terms of lower cost and more successful urban planning implementation in november 2007 mayor daley announced a plan to acquire site and following june hospital decided that it would cease operations in july 2008 city announced its official bid for property city planned to borrow 85 million to buy michael reese hospital campus near 31st and king drive from its current owner medline industries medline would only get 65 million because company agreed to make a 20 million charitable contribution back to city city would use that 20 million to pay up to five years of interest on its 85 million debt demolish hospital and clean up site then sometime in next couple years it planned to sell site for at least 85 million to a developer or developers who in turn were expected to build a complex big enough to house about 15 000 olympians after games developer would sell or rent out units in september 2008 city realized it had underestimated demolition and environmental cleanup costs which put transaction at risk additionally in september associated press reported a recalcitrant property owner may force hospital site to be abandoned these problems needed resolution by bid committee by february 2009 date which bid books were due that month city requested a renegotiation of terms and within a week michael reese hospital filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in december 2008 new terms for deal became public although original financing plans included no taxpayer funding late deal was only possible with 500 million of taxpayer participation via a guarantee by city to cover possible revenue shortfall and 45 million for chicago police department costs in addition in early 2008 records were uncovered that show campus of michael reese hospital to have been designed in large part by one of twentieth century s most well respected modernist architects walter gropius thus plan for olympic village battled growing belief that preserving old hospital campus would be better from an urban planning and historic preservation standpoint and also rose questions about financing village in addition planned demolition of 28 buildings put sustainability

trailing behind tokyo and madrid s bids technical qualities are only part of final selection process final selection from madrid spain rio de janeiro brazil was made on october 2 2009 in copenhagen denmark in 2007 usoc head peter ueberroth contended that chicago was in third or fourth place with a need to focus more on international relations rather than just having a stronger technical bid in september 2009 ioc gave a written evaluation of venues budgets transportation plans and public support chicago s bid was not federally underwritten unlike other bid cities which concerned ioc given declining tax revenue during a major recession in us economy nevertheless with chicago s strong hosting of aiba boxing championships which exposed city to many ioc members city was cited as a current favorite and one member claimed games were theirs to lose chicago also successfully hosted 2006 gay games another multinational sporting event both events were planned with short lead times in april

chicago was knocked out in first round of voting and olympics went to rio de janeiro despite some high profile backers such as us president barack obama and chicago based television hostess oprah winfrey going to copenhagen to support bid since balloting is secret and ioc members rarely share their voting tendencies there has been much speculation as to why chicago lost olympic bid so early in process michelle higgins on new york times blog argued that an overly restrictive passport and visa policy was one such reason cbs 2 chicago s website suggested that anti americanism may have contributed bid ceo patrick ryan was quoted in chicago sun times as saying bloc voting and assumptions by others in ioc that chicago had enough votes to make it to second round of voting led to its early demise same article hinted at fractious relations noted by seattle times between ioc and usoc over corporate background of usoc executives and inordinate share of revenue that they receive aftermath following chicago s loss usoc declined to bid for 2020 summer olympics which was ultimately awarded to tokyo usoc later entered race for 2024 summer olympics with boston but withdrew their bid usoc quickly selected los angeles to be american candidate for 2024 olympics after ioc decided to award hosts of both 2024 and 2028 olympics in 2017 los angeles declared their candidature for 2028
