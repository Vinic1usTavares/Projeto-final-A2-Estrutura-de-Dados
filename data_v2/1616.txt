noctilucent clouds or night shining clouds are tenuous cloud like phenomena in upper atmosphere of earth they consist of ice crystals and are only visible during astronomical twilight noctilucent roughly means night shining in latin they are most often observed during summer months from latitudes between 50deg and 70deg north and south of equator they are visible only during local summer months and when sun is below observer s horizon but while clouds are still in sunlight recent studies suggest that increased atmospheric methane emissions produce additional water vapor once methane molecules reach mesosphere creating or reinforcing existing noctilucent clouds they are highest clouds in earth s atmosphere located in mesosphere at altitudes of around they are too faint to be seen in daylight and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below horizon while lower layers of atmosphere are in earth s shadow general thumb noctilucent clouds over uppsala sweden thumb

phenomenon no confirmed record of their observation exists before 1885 although they may have been observed a few decades earlier by thomas romney robinson in armagh robinson made a series of interesting observations between 1849 and 1852 and two of his entries in may 1850 may describe noctilucent clouds on 1st of may he notes strange luminous clouds in nw not auroral this does sound very much like nlcs even though early may falls outside typical nlc window however it is still possible as nlcs can form at armagh s latitude within this period doubts now surround robinson s out of season records following observations from several points around high northern latitudes of nlc like phenomena following chelyabinsk entry in february 2013 outside nlc season that were in fact stratospheric dust reflections visible after sunset noctilucent clouds can form only under very restricted conditions during local summer their occurrence can be used as a sensitive guide to changes in upper atmosphere they are a relatively recent classification occurrence of noctilucent clouds appears to be increasing in frequency brightness and extent formation noctilucent clouds are composed of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100 nm in diameter and exist at a height of about higher than any other clouds in earth s atmosphere clouds in earth s lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles data from aeronomy of ice in mesosphere satellite suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour dust and very cold temperatures to form sources of both dust and water vapour in upper atmosphere are not known with certainty dust is believed to come from micrometeors although particulates from volcanoes and dust from troposphere are also possibilities moisture could be lifted through gaps in tropopause as well as forming from reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in stratosphere about nlcs polar mesospheric clouds from atmospheric optics exhaust from space shuttles in use between 1981 and 2011 which was almost entirely water vapour after detachment of solid rocket booster at a height of about 46 km was found to generate minuscule individual clouds about half of vapour was released into thermosphere usually at altitudes of in august 2014 a spacex falcon 9 also caused noctilucent clouds over orlando fl after a launch https twitter com spacex status 11 aug 2014 spacex falcon 9 caused spectacular noctilucent clouds exhaust can be transported to arctic region in little over a day although exact mechanism of this very high speed transport is unknown as water migrates northward it falls from thermosphere down into colder mesosphere which occupies region of atmosphere just below although this mechanism is cause of individual noctilucent clouds it is not thought to be a major contributor to phenomenon as a whole as mesosphere contains very little moisture approximately one hundred millionth that of air from sahara and is extremely thin ice crystals can form only at temperatures below about this means that noctilucent clouds form predominantly during summer when counterintuitively mesosphere is coldest as a result of seasonally varying vertical winds leading to cold summertime conditions in upper mesosphere upwelling and adiabatic cooling and wintertime heating and adiabatic heating therefore they can t be observed even if they are present inside polar circles because sun is never low enough under horizon at this season at these latitudes noctilucent clouds form mostly near polar regions because mesosphere is coldest there clouds in southern hemisphere are about higher than those in northern hemisphere ultraviolet radiation from sun breaks water molecules apart reducing amount of water available to form noctilucent clouds radiation is known to vary cyclically with solar cycle and satellites have been tracking decrease in brightness of clouds with increase of ultraviolet radiation for last two solar cycles it has been found that changes in clouds follow changes in intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year but reason for this long lag is not yet known noctilucent clouds are known to exhibit high radar reflectivity in a frequency range of 50 mhz to 1 3 ghz this behaviour is not well understood but a possible explanation is that ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron which makes cloud far more reflective to radar although this explanation remains controversial sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above altitude of noctilucent clouds and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when clouds are present other experiments have demonstrated that at extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface discovery and investigation noctilucent clouds are first known to have been observed in 1885 two years after 1883 eruption of krakatoa it remains unclear whether their appearance had anything to do with volcanic eruption or whether their discovery was due to more people observing spectacular sunsets caused by volcanic debris in atmosphere studies have shown that noctilucent clouds are not caused solely by volcanic activity although dust and water vapour could be injected into upper atmosphere by eruptions and contribute to their formation scientists at time assumed clouds were another manifestation of volcanic ash but after ash had settled out of atmosphere noctilucent clouds persisted finally theory that clouds were composed of volcanic dust was disproved by in 1926 in years following their discovery clouds were studied extensively by otto jesse of germany who was first to photograph them in 1887 and seems to have been one to coin term noctilucent cloud which means night shining cloud his notes provide evidence that noctilucent clouds first appeared in 1885 he had been doing detailed observations of unusual sunsets caused by krakatoa eruption previous year and firmly believed that if clouds had been visible then he would undoubtedly have noticed them schroder 2001 p systematic photographic observations of clouds were organized in 1887 by jesse foerster and and after that year continuous observations were carried out at berlin observatory schroder 2001 p 2459 during this research height of clouds was first determined via triangulation schroder 2001 p project was discontinued in 1896 in decades after otto jesse s death in 1901 there were few new insights into nature of noctilucent clouds wegener s conjecture that they were composed of water ice was later shown to be correct study was limited to ground based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of mesosphere until 1960s when direct rocket measurements began these showed for first time that occurrence of clouds coincided with very low temperatures in mesosphere schroder 2001 p noctilucent clouds were first detected from space by an instrument on ogo 6 satellite in 1972 ogo 6 observations of a bright scattering layer over polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds gadsden 1995 p 18 a later satellite solar mesosphere explorer mapped distribution of clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at utah state university even when they were not visible to naked eye first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed primary component of noctilucent clouds came from instrument on upper atmosphere research satellite in 2001 in 2001 swedish odin satellite performed spectral analyses on clouds and produced daily global maps that revealed large patterns in their distribution on april 25 2007 aim satellite aeronomy of ice in mesosphere was launched it is first satellite dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds and made its first observations on may 25 2007 images taken by satellite show shapes in clouds that are similar to shapes in tropospheric clouds hinting at similarities in their dynamics on august 28 2006 scientists with mars express mission announced that they found clouds of carbon dioxide crystals over mars that extended up to above surface of planet they are highest clouds discovered over surface of a planet like noctilucent clouds on earth they can be observed only when sun is below horizon research published in journal geophysical research letters in june 2009 suggests that noctilucent clouds observed following tunguska event of 1908 are evidence that impact was caused by a comet united states naval research laboratory nrl and united states department of defense space test program stp conducted charged aerosol release experiment care on september 19 2009 using exhaust particles from a black brant xii suborbital sounding rocket launched from nasa s wallops flight facility to create an artificial noctilucent cloud cloud was to be observed over a period of weeks or months by ground instruments and spatial imager for mesospheric radicals shimmer instrument on nrl stp 1 spacecraft rocket s exhaust plume was observed and reported to news organizations in united states from new jersey to massachusetts observation noctilucent clouds are generally colourless or pale blue although occasionally other colours including red and green occur gadsden 1995 p 13 characteristic blue colour comes from absorption by ozone in path of sunlight illuminating noctilucent cloud they can appear as featureless bands but frequently show distinctive patterns such as streaks wave like undulations and whirls gadsden 1995 pp 8 10 they are considered a beautiful natural phenomenon gadsden 1995 p 9 noctilucent clouds may be confused with cirrus clouds but appear sharper under magnification those caused by rocket exhausts tend to show colours other than silver or blue because of iridescence caused by uniform size of water droplets produced noctilucent clouds may be seen by observers at a latitude of 50deg to 65deg gadsden 1995 p 8 they seldom occur at lower latitudes although there have been sightings as far south as paris utah italy turkey and spain and closer to poles it does not get dark enough for clouds to become visible they occur during summer from mid may to mid august in northern hemisphere and between mid november and mid february in southern hemisphere they are very faint and tenuous and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when clouds of lower atmosphere are in shadow but noctilucent cloud is illuminated by sun they are best seen when sun is between 6deg and 16deg below horizon gadsden 1995 p 11 although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres they have been observed thousands of times in northern hemisphere but fewer than 100 times in southern southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently additionally southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations these clouds may be studied from ground from space and directly by sounding rocket also some noctilucent clouds are made of smaller crystals 30 nm or less which are invisible to observers on ground because they do not scatter enough light forms clouds may show a large variety of different patterns and forms an identification scheme was developed by fogle in 1970 that classified five different forms these classifications have since been modified and subdivided gadsden 1995 pp 9 10 as a result of more recent research world meteorological organization now recognizes four major forms that can be subdivided type i veils are very tenuous and lack well defined structure somewhat like cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus type ii bands are long streaks that often occur in groups arranged roughly parallel to each other they are usually more widely spaced than bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds type iii billows are arrangements of closely spaced roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus type iv whirls are partial or more rarely complete rings of cloud with dark centres see also aeronomy aeronomy of ice in mesosphere iridescent cloud polar mesospheric cloud polar stratospheric cloud space
