southern africa that had been self governing since 1923 he settled in central town of gatooma where he farmed mined and set up an earth moving contractor s business in 1953 southern rhodesia became a territory of federation of rhodesia and nyasaland alongside northern rhodesia and nyasaland each territory retained its own political status and government and southern rhodesia s constitutional status was unaltered dominion party harper entered politics when he contested gatooma seat in 1958 general election running for opposition dominion party which called for full dominion or commonwealth realm status southern rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote criteria were applied equally regardless of race but since most black citizens did not meet set standards electoral roll and colonial legislative assembly were overwhelmingly drawn from white minority about 5 of population harper won in gatooma with 717 out of 1 300 votes holding strongly conservative views he soon became seen as voice of party s right wing he was elected president of dominion party s southern rhodesian arm in october 1959 and by 1960 he was official leader of opposition in southern rhodesian parliament amid decolonisation and wind of change federation was looking ever more tenuous and idea of no independence before majority rule was gaining considerable ground in british political circles harper called for southern rhodesia to abandon federation and go it alone in june 1960 he and southern rhodesian branch of dominion party adopted policy of southern rhodesia first prompting strong protests from party s northern rhodesian division dominion party splintered into separate federal and territorial entities a month later when black nationalist riots broke out in townships in october 1960 harper condemned southern rhodesian prime minister sir edgar whitehead and governing united federal party ufp as too lenient on protesters and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black rhodesians believe that trouble pays dividends arguing against black representation in legislative assembly he said that if there were black mps they will share restaurant with us and they will share bars with us we will be living cheek by jowl with them and what sort of legislation can people of this country expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with africans rhodesian front thumb upright ian smith became prime minister in 1964 harper was touted by pressmen as a possible replacement for next four years in 1962 harper was a founding member of rhodesian front rf an alliance of conservative voices centred around former dominion party and defectors from ufp party s declared goal was independence for southern rhodesia without radical constitutional change and without any set timetable for introduction of majority rule after rf won a surprise victory in november 1962 general election harper comfortably retained his seat in gatooma and elsewhere country s first black mps were elected new prime minister winston field made him minister of irrigation roads and road traffic in new government over next few years harper became one of main agitators in cabinet for a unilateral declaration of independence udi equating southern rhodesia to india he saw this as a way to prevent a repeat of same mistake rf grew dissatisfied with field during late 1963 and early 1964 because of his failure to win independence on federal dissolution at end of 1963 northern rhodesia and nyasaland by contrast were both independent under black majority governments within a year respectively renamed zambia and malawi harper who had been assigned additional portfolios of transport and power in november 1963 was one of two frontrunners to replace field other was deputy prime minister ian smith formerly of ufp who was also minister of treasury harper described in spectator as an ambitious politician and single minded upholder of white supremacy was generally considered more hardline choice and man more likely to go through with udi when cabinet forced field to resign in april 1964 it was smith who was nominated by ministers to become new prime minister accepting premiership smith reshuffled cabinet a few days later and moved harper to ministry of internal affairs harper was deeply disappointed not to have succeeded field as minister of internal affairs harper oversaw indaba conference of chiefs and headmen at in october 1964 at end of which tribal leaders unanimously announced their support for government s line on independence he continued to be linked with premiership during smith s negotiations with british government each breakdown or setback was accompanied by speculation in rhodesia southern was dropped in late 1964 that harper might step up to take his place as dispute with britain intensified and white rhodesians clamoured for independence harry franklin reported in spectator in august 1965 that if smith proved unwilling to go through with udi it is widely believed that harper will emerge from wings no longer an understudy to dare what mr smith dare not harper was one of four ministers chosen by smith to accompany him to london for talks in october 1965 others being john wrathall finance desmond lardner burke justice and deputy minister of information p k van der byl agreement was not reached and a month later on 11 november 1965 smith and his cabinet declared rhodesia independent at time of udi harper reportedly kept a map of southern africa on wall of his office on which he had coloured south africa south west africa rhodesia mozambique south of zambezi and angola red he told visitors that red area will be under white rule forever while insisting that rhodesia would continue regardless of international opinion he publicly demonised uk government describing it in january 1966 as an enemy that must be brought down he also vilified black nationalist guerrilla fighters opposed to rhodesian government calling them gangs of terrorists and criminals comments such as these helped to cement harper s reputation as a hardline right winger and rival to smith s leadership strong personalities of harper and other ministers such as duke of montrose generally known in rhodesia by his former title lord graham were perceived by british prime minister harold wilson and his compatriots as a great influence on smith s political decision making an opinion also expressed by harper himself thumb upright duke of montrose lord graham one of harper s main allies in cabinet although harper was considered an intelligent and capable minister by peers and reporters a 1965 report in economist called him by far best brain in rhodesian cabinet his views were often perceived as overly reactionary he led a phalanx of far right voices within rf calling for a form of political apartheid in rhodesia and while party line was gradual advancement of black political representation harper called not only for cessation of such moves but for abolition of black mps altogether he thus became something of an obstacle to an anglo rhodesian settlement indeed when smith brought a working document back from hms tiger talks with wilson in october 1966 it was harper who led opposition to terms in cabinet contributing to its ultimate rejection harper considered himself to have been overlooked when smith gave office of deputy prime minister which had been vacant since udi to more moderate wrathall month before tiger conference south african newspaper die beeld reported in december 1966 that rf s right wing was poised to oust smith in favour of harper but this did not occur resignation on 4 july 1968 harper resigned from cabinet at smith s request he was first minister to be dismissed during smith s premiership government released a statement explaining that harper had been removed for reasons entirely unrelated to differences of opinion over constitutional or other political issues and saying simply that harper had been deemed a security risk harper publicly claimed that he had been fired for political reasons and because of threat he posed to smith s leadership smith was reticent but told reporters he was prepared to tell whole sorry tale if harper wished according to memoirs of ken flower then director of rhodesia s central intelligence organisation cio harper s downfall was result of an extramarital affair with a young secretary in rhodesian civil service who cio discovered was an agent for mi6 flower informed smith of this on 3 july and prime minister demanded harper s resignation that afternoon harper acquiesced next day because this was kept secret presuming it is true harper s sudden departure from cabinet was interpreted by many observers at time as culmination of personal and political rivalry between smith and harper or result of disagreements over new constitution harper officially resigned his parliament seat and left rhodesian front on 11 july 1968 wilson publicly welcomed his departure as a step in right direction prompting a retort from smith that he did not appoint or sack ministers to please british government smith said that harper had been depicted as more extreme than he really was and denied that he had obstructed a settlement in retrospect smith said he had been glad to be rid of harper who he considered underhand and devious harper ignored an approach from ultra right wing rhodesian national party offering leadership and for a time withdrew from public affairs montrose and ministers arthur phillip smith and phillip van heerden briefly threatened to follow harper out of government but backed down within a few days after a fresh dispute montrose resigned on 11 september 1968 in protest against smith s proposed constitutional and racial policies which he deemed too liberal a week later rf s albert mells easily won by election to fill harper s former seat in gatooma later career by time of july 1974 general election amid bush war harper had formed a small bloc of independents called harper group in an attempt to co ordinate opposition to rhodesian front group made an election agreement with rhodesia party rp which had been formed two years earlier according to bulletin it was seriously hampered by lack of established leadership but nevertheless offered only real resistance to rf in polls shortly before election day harper told a meeting of 300 people that under present system which was geared to eventually bring parity between black and white rhodesians racial tension would increase and white man will be forced out of country he said that while he was not prepared to let black rhodesians take control of government he understood that some form of power sharing between races was imperative to country s future rf won all 50 white roll seats denying rp any representation in parliament harper himself lost decisively in southern salisbury constituency of hatfield by end of 1974 harper had formed united conservative party which called for separate black and white legislatures he subsequently reacted with revulsion each time smith moved towards settlement with black nationalist factions in december that year he described smith s announcement of a ceasefire in run up to victoria falls conference as a ghastly capitulation in 1976 when smith announced his acceptance of unconditional majority rule by 1978 harper accused prime minister of selling us out mind boggles at enormous impertinence and audacity of this man smith he said in december 1975 two months after disappearance of prominent lawyer and black nationalist leader edson sithole from middle of salisbury along with his secretary miriam mhlanga harper stepped forward claiming that rhodesian state had kidnapped them in what became known as harper memorandum ex minister alleged that special branch had interrogated sithole at prison and then shuttled him between holding points around country rhodesian government denied that it was holding sithole adding that he was not under any form of restriction sithole and mhlanga were never seen again and their fate has never been explained in modern zimbabwe it is generally accepted that they were abducted and killed by agents of rhodesian government emigration to south africa and death smith and non militant nationalists agreed to what became internal settlement in march 1978 and in january following year whites backed new majority rule constitution by 85 in a national referendum multiracial elections were held in april 1979 with country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia afterwards by this time harper had already left country guardian reported
