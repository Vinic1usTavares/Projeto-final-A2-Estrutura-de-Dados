in purple jicarilla apache tribe is a native american indian tribe in northwestern new mexico on a reservation of reservation was established by an executive order of president grover cleveland in 1887 and clarified by executive orders of presidents theodore roosevelt in 1907 and william howard taft in 1912 tribe adopted a formal constitution under provisions of indian reorganization act et seq that provided for taxation of members of tribe and non members of tribe doing business on reservation if tribe enacted a such tax ordinance on non members ordinance had to be approved by secretary of interior beginning in 1953 tribe entered into agreements with oil companies including plaintiffs merrion and bayless to provide oil and gas leases leases were approved by commissioner of indian affairs now bureau of indian affairs or bia in accordance with as was usual practice at time oil companies negotiated directly with bia who then presented contracts to tribal council while oil and gas was from reservation land merrion paid severance taxes to state of new mexico under provisions of where congress had authorized such taxation in 1927 leases provided for royalties to be paid to tribe but bia was lax in collecting them in 1973 tribal attorneys wrote to bia to demand collection of royalties and after a year delay bia would only state that they were looking into it in 1976 bia approved a tribal ordinance that also provided for a severance tax this tax was set at 29 cents u s per barrel of oil and at 5 cents per million british thermal units for natural gas district court merrion did not want to pay a severance tax to both new mexico and tribe and filed suit in united states district court for district of new mexico along with such major companies as atlantic richfield now part of bp getty oil gulf oil and phillips petroleum now conocophillips among others case was not filed until 15 days before severance tax was due in hearing on temporary injunction on june 17 1977 merrion argued that tribe s severance tax was unconstitutional violating both commerce clause and equal protection clause and that it was both taxation without representation and double taxation in addition plaintiffs argued against entire concept of tribal sovereignty stating that it had been a legal fiction for decades u s district judge h payne granted temporary injunction and set hearing on permanent injunction for august 29 1977 oil companies showed up with approximately 40 50 attorneys compared to 2 or 3 lawyers for tribe both sides made essentially same arguments as for temporary injunction following hearing district court ruled that tribe s tax violated commerce clause of constitution and that only state and local authorities had ability to tax mineral rights on indian reservations court then issued a permanent injunction prohibiting collection of tax by tribe circuit court case then went to tenth circuit court of appeals western states of utah new mexico montana north dakota and wyoming filed amici curiae briefs in support of oil companies while navajo nation arapahoe nation shoshone indian tribe assiniboine and sioux tribes three affiliated tribes of fort berthold reservation and national congress of american indians all filed briefs in support of tribe case was heard on may 29 1979 by a three judge panel consisting of chief judge oliver seth and circuit judges william holloway jr and monroe g mckay arguments were same as at district court level with oil companies stating that tribal sovereignty did not apply to taxation of non indians conducting business on reservation in an unusual move no written decision was issued and attorneys were told to reargue case en banc mckay stated that as he recalls he and holloway were in disagreement with seth who favored a limited view of tribe s authority to tax oil companies on september 12 1979 case was before entire panel following that hearing in a 5 2 decision tenth circuit reversed district court holding that tribe had inherent power under their tribal sovereignty to impose taxes on reservation court also held that tax did not violate commerce clause nor place an undue burden on oil companies opinion of court initial arguments oil companies immediately appealed and united states supreme court granted certiorari to hear case this appeal came shortly after supreme court had decided oliphant v suquamish indian tribe which had stated that an indian tribe did not have authority to try a non indian for a crime committed on reservation oliphant v suquamish indian tribe oliphant case was a major blow against tribal sovereignty and was a case used by oil companies in their briefs oil companies argued that oliphant currently limited to criminal cases should be expanded to civil matters as well attorneys for tribe argued that this case was no different than washington v confederated tribes of colville indian reservation which stated that tribes had authority to impose a cigarette tax on both tribal members and non indians alike washington v confederated tribes of colville indian reservation amici briefs were filed by montana north dakota utah wyoming new mexico washington state mountain states legal foundation salt river project agricultural improvement and power district shell oil and westmoreland resources in support of oil companies council of energy resource tribes and navajo nation filed briefs supporting tribe arguing for and bayless was jason w kellahin for amoco and marathon oil was john r cooney originally a separate case but which was consolidated with this case for tribe was robert j nordhaus and on behalf of tribe for solicitor general was louis f claiborne kellahin argued that tribal sovereignty only extended to members of tribe citing both oliphant and montana v united states montana v united states both cases involving jurisdiction of a tribal court over non indians kellahin stated that those cases that allowed a tribe to tax non indians were not due to tribal sovereignty but were connected with authority of tribe to regulate who could enter reservation in same manner as a landlord controlled their property cooney argued that tax was a violation of commerce clause in that congress divested tribes of that authority when they enacted granting states right to impose a severance tax on reservation lands nordhaus in arguing for tribe pointed out that there was first no congressional preemption of tribal authority to tax and that second taxation was an inherent power of tribal sovereignty claiborne first distinguished montana noting that it dealt with non indians on fee land owned by non indians that happened to be within boundaries of reservation something that was completely unrelated to current case re argument following oral argument chief justice assigned justice john paul stevens to write majority opinion and justice william j brennan jr asked justice thurgood marshall to write minority or dissenting opinion based on initial count of justices views since justice potter stewart did not participate in case it would take a 5 3 vote to overturn decision of circuit court stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate tax chief justice warren burger and justice william rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion justice byron white stated that he would wait and see what dissent said and then indicated he would join dissent in part it also appeared that justice harry blackmun was also going to write a separate dissent but he also stated that he would wait to see marshall s opinion at this point tribe had votes to win on a 4 4 vote but court was close to being adjourned for summer recess on july 3 1981 court notified parties to reargue case on november 4 1981 in meantime court had changed justice stewart retired and president ronald reagan had appointed sandra day o connor to replace him during re argument kellahin began with fact new mexico was acquired via treaty of guadalupe hildalgo and that neither spain or mexico recognized indian title and claimed that tax was a veiled attempt to increase royalty payments cooney argued that there was no authority in statute for secretary of interior to approve a tribal tax and that 1927 statute preempted tribes authority in favor of states being empowered to apply a severance tax on reservations nordhaus stated that argument about treaty of guadalupe hildalgo did not apply since no branch of federal government had ever differentiated between these tribes and other tribes case was then submitted to court majority opinion thumb 200px right alt portrait of justice thurgood marshall justice thurgood marshall author of majority opinion justice thurgood marshall delivered opinion of court marshall noted that tribe had a properly formed constitution approved by secretary of interior and that it included that tribal council may impose taxes on non members doing business on reservation he noted that tribe had executed oil and gas leases for about 69 of reservation and that leases provided for royalties to be paid to tribe marshall further noted that tribe followed proper process to enact a severance tax obtaining approval of bia as part of process first argument of oil companies that power to tax only arose from power of tribe to exclude persons from reservation marshall disagreed stating that power to tax is an inherent attribute of a tribe s sovereignty tribal government includes need to provide for services not only to tribe but to anyone doing business on reservation he noted that oil companies benefited from police protection and other governmental services citing colville he stated that tribe s interest in raising revenues for essential governmental programs is strongest when revenues are derived from value generated on reservation by activities involving tribes and when taxpayer is recipient of tribal services marshall noted that congress was able to remove this power but had not done so and had acknowledged in 1879 power of cherokee nation to tax non indians marshall further noted oil companies arguments that a lease would prevent a governmental body from later imposing a tax would denigrate tribal sovereignty and that tribal sovereignty was not limited by contractual arrangements only federal government has authority to limit powers of a tribal government and a non indian s consent is not needed by contract or otherwise to exercise its sovereignty to contrary tribe may set conditions and limits on non indian as a matter of right to presume that a sovereign forever right to exercise one of its sovereign powers unless it expressly reserves right to exercise that power in a commercial agreement turns concept of sovereignty on its head marshall then addressed commerce clause issues and argument of solicitor general that section of commerce clause that dealt directly with indians applied rather than argument of oil companies that section dealing with interstate commerce applied first marshall noted that case history of indian commerce clause was to protect tribes from state infringement not to approve of indian trade without constitutional restraint he saw of no reason to begin now especially since he did not find that tribe s severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce in a 6 3 decision marshall found that tribe had right to impose such a tax on non indians dissent thumb 200px left alt portrait of justice john paul stevens justice john paul stevens author of dissent justice john paul stevens joined by chief justice burger and justice rehnquist dissented from majority opinion stevens noted that over its own members a tribe has virtually unlimited sovereignty over non indians a tribe had no power but many tribes were granted authority to exclude non indians from their reservations stevens also noted that various statutes that were passed in regards to mineral rights and leases were silent as to authority of a tribe to impose taxes therefore authority must come from one of three sources federal statutes treaties and inherent tribal sovereignty he noted that in matters involving their own members tribe could act in manners that federal government could not such as discriminating against females in citizenship cases citing santa clara pueblo v martinez santa clara pueblo v martinez tribal authority over non members was always severely limited in both a civil and criminal context and he viewed both oliphant and montana as controlling in this area also he viewed authority to tax as merely an adjunct to tribe s right to exclude individuals from reservation since leases were entered into by tribe voluntarily tribe cannot enact later taxes without consent of oil companies stevens would have reversed circuit court subsequent developments almost immediately after decision bia on directions from assistant secretary of interior kenneth smith proposed federal regulations that would have severely limited ability of tribes to impose severance taxes following numerous complaints from tribes bia abandoned that plan
