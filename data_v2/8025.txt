yamsay mountain is a large shield volcano in cascade range of south central oregon located about east of crater lake on border between klamath county and lake county it is part of cascade volcanic arc but is located in a mountain range behind main cascade volcanic front best known members of this enigmatic arc are massive shields of newberry volcano about farther north in oregon and medicine lake volcano about south in northern california yamsay is highest volcano in eastern arc almost higher than newberry and medicine lake a central part of klamath mythology mountain offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding historically area around it has been inhabited by native american tribes and settlers until 1970s a fire lookout tower sat on summit of mountain and its foundation remains to this day geography and geology thumb 250px diagram plate tectonics of cascade range like other volcanoes in cascade range yamsay was produced by subduction of oceanic juan de fuca plate under north american plate annual convergence between two continues at a rate of per year cascades make up majority of north american west coast volcanoes they have been volcanically active for about 36 million years rock making up cascades is slightly older dated between 55 and 42 million years old in an attempt to organize volcanoes by age scientists typically divide them into two provinces high younger western cascades comprising older volcanoes yamsay along with simcoe volcanic complex medicine lake highlands and newberry volcano make up a wayward range of shield volcanoes between and east of main cascade range volcanism at these centers is unlike other eruptions in cascades and it does not stem from fissures as would basin and range volcanism volcanoes appear to be isolated from major volcanic ranges in northwestern united states although scientists group them as part of cascades recent volcanism in cascades lasting from 7 to 2 mya produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite based material up to 50 percent on eastern side of high cascades however volcanoes erupted dacite andesite and rhyolite these materials made up several types of eruptions lava flows domes and pyroclastic flows in most recent volcanic activity andesite basalt and rhyolite have been erupted from high cascades volcanoes particularly three sisters broken top mount hood mount jefferson and crater lake history name yamsay is a corruption of klamath a native american tribe of southern oregon name a form of meaning north wind this mountain was supposed to be home of supreme being of klamath mythology historically area by mountain was inhabited by klamath modoc and bands all of snake paiute people lived east of yamsay mountain near modern day lakeview their group inhabited of land in oregon and california traders entered area at some point between 1825 and 1827 where they worked as trappers for hudson s bay company after routes opened up in 1846 fort klamath was built in 1863 zilverberg p 3 city of klamath falls southwest of yamsay sprang up in 1920s and featured fastest growing population in oregon contributors to this new growth and development included creation of southern pacific railroad completed in 1909 this opened area for logging and timber business which became focus of profit of area zilverberg p 4 mountain features a united states forest service fire lookout tower with an steel tower built on summit of yamsay in 1929 it was removed after 1970s and only remnants of foundation remain today a dirt road was built to summit to service lookout but this was abandoned after tower was removed upper now form a hiking trail to summit climate and ecology cascade range is dramatically different in climate from west to east west side is heavily forested and features trees such as douglas firs western hemlock pacific silver firs and alaska yellow cedars wuerthner p 74 east of cascades where yamsay lies climate becomes much drier even arid precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse with lodgepole pine white fir ponderosa pine and juniper to south chaparral plants such as beargrass and bitterbrush prevail wuerthner p 76 diverse life exists within range including endangered species like larch mountain salamanders and spotted owls amphibians like salamanders and frogs are common as are birds mammals in area consist of elk mountain lions deer and black bears eastern cascades fish include lost river suckers and short suckers which are both endemic species wuerthner p 77 recreation fremont national recreation trail passes through area it offers tourists excellent views of other oregon cascades landmarks such as mount bachelor mount shasta three sisters and mount thielsen other activities along trail include hiking and horseback riding up mountain from recreation area located at an elevation between references bibliography external links aerial photo of mountain in winter by brent logan category shield volcanoes of united
