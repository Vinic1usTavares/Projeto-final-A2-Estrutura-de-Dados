college before jourdain was appointed it was decided that two women should get to know one another better jourdain owned an apartment in paris where she tutored english children and so moberly went to stay with her claims moberly and jourdain recounted that they had decided to visit palace of versailles as part of several trips around paris detailing how on 10 august 1901 they travelled by train to

reported that she noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window while jourdain recalled noticing an old deserted farmhouse outside of which was an old plough at this point they described a feeling of oppression and dreariness coming over them after which men who they thought looked like palace gardeners told them to go straight on moberly described men as very dignified officials dressed in long greyish green coats with small three cornered hats qtd in jourdain recalled that she noticed a cottage with a woman holding out a jug to a girl in doorway describing it as a tableau vivant a living picture much like madame tussauds moberly did not observe cottage but remembered that she felt atmosphere change she wrote everything suddenly looked unnatural therefore unpleasant even trees seemed to become flat and lifeless like wood worked in tapestry there were no effects of light and shade and no wind stirred trees qtd in thumb upright comte de vaudreuil was later suggested as a candidate for man with marked face allegedly seen by moberly and jourdain they reported reaching edge of a wood close to temple de l amour and coming across a man seated beside a garden kiosk wearing a cloak and large shady hat according to moberly his appearance was most repulsive its expression odious his complexion was dark and rough jourdain noted man slowly turned his face which was marked by smallpox his complexion was very dark expression was evil and yet and though i did not feel that he was looking particularly at us i felt a repugnance to going past him they said that another man whom they described as tall with large dark eyes and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat came up to them and showed them way to petit trianon thumb upright portrait of marie antoinette by wertmuller figure that moberly saw near petit trianon was claimed to bear a resemblance to queen as depicted in this painting moberly said she noticed a lady sketching on grass who looked at them after they crossed a bridge to reach gardens in front of palace she later described lady as wearing a light summer dress and a shady white hat with lots of fair hair moberly reported that she thought she was a tourist at first but dress appeared to be old fashioned moberly came to believe that lady was marie antoinette jourdain however did not see lady at their return to palace they reported that they were directed round to entrance and joined a party of other visitors they said that after they toured house they had tea at hotel des reservoirs before returning to jourdain s apartment aftermath according to jourdain and moberly neither woman mentioned incident to one another until a week after leaving versailles when moberly in a letter to her sister about their trip started writing about afternoon of versailles incident she reportedly asked jourdain if she thought petit trianon was haunted and jourdain told her that she thought it was three months later in oxford pair said they compared their notes and decided to write separate accounts of what happened while also researching history of trianon they thought they might have seen events that took place on 10 august 1792 only six weeks before abolition of french monarchy when tuileries palace in paris was besieged and king s swiss guards were massacred according to their narrative they visited trianon gardens again on several occasions but were unable to trace path they took various landmarks such as kiosk and bridge were missing and grounds were full of people trying to come up with an explanation they wondered if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day however they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon through their research they thought they recognised man they reportedly saw by kiosk as comte de vaudreuil a friend of marie antoinette who herself moberly had claimed to see convinced that grounds were haunted they decided to publish their story in a book an adventure 1911 under pseudonyms of elizabeth morison and frances lamont book containing claim that marie antoinette had been encountered in 1901 caused a sensation however many critics did not take it seriously on grounds of implausibilities and inconsistencies that it contained a review of book by eleanor mildred sidgwick in proceedings of society for psychical research suggested that women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced review is reprinted in goodman dena kaiser thomas e 2003 marie antoinette writings on body of a queen routledge p 231 mrs sidgwick s anonymous review appeared in june 1911 supplement to proceedings of society for psychical research in 1903 an old map of trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map identity of authors of an adventure was not made public until 1931 both women claimed many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure in one of them moberly claimed to have seen in louvre in 1914 an apparition of roman emperor constantine a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga he was not observed by anybody else during first world war jourdain dominant personality of pair who had succeeded as principal of st hugh s became convinced that a german spy was hiding in college after developing increasingly autocratic behaviour she died suddenly in 1924 in middle of an academic scandal over her leadership of college her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff moberly died in 1937 story of adventure was made into a tv movie anglia television production miss morison s ghosts written and produced by ian curteis and directed by john bruce in 1981 cf with dame wendy hiller as moberly morison and hannah gordon as jourdain lamont bbc broadcast a 90 minute radio dramatisation in 2004 and 2015 explanations and critiques thumb upright left robert de montesquiou an explanation of events was proposed by philippe jullian in his 1965 biography of aristocratic decadent french poet robert de montesquiou at time of moberly and jourdain s excursion to versailles montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of party entertainments moberly and jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party that they confused for a haunting marie antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross dresser pockmarked man montesquiou himself it was suggested that a gathering of french decadent avant garde of time could have made a sinister impression on two middle class edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company in a review of history of moberly jourdain adventure and extensive public reaction to it terry castle noted with skepticism claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie a deux between two women castle concludes that when all proposed explanations have been considered a core of mystery remains as much in relation to psychological dynamics of pair as to any aspects of paranormal associated with their story without fully endorsing de montesquiou explanation michael coleman carefully examined story and in particular two published versions of ladies accounts earlier written of which from november 1901 had only previously been published in second small print run edition of an adventure in 1913 coleman concluded that more widely available texts as published in 1911 and later editions had been considerably aggrandized well after events described and after ladies had begun their investigations while original accounts had little or nothing to suggest a supernatural experience he also questioned rigour and reliability of ladies subsequent research pointing out that few if any of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources coleman m h ed ghosts of trianon aquarian press 1988 psychologist leonard zusne suggested that incident was a hallucinatory experience that was elaborated upon over time by information moberly and jourdain gathered after fact zusne leonard jones warren h 2014 edition psychology a study of magical thinking psychology press p 195 brian dunning of concluded that moberly and jourdain were simply human and were mistaken he notes that editions of an adventure were embellished each time they were published and inconsistencies in their memories were apparent for example in second edition pair wrote that moberly did not mention sketching woman to jourdain until three months after their visit to versailles and jourdain did not remember such a thing in contrast moberly did not remember much of what jourdain described it was only after much discussion note sharing and historical research that moberly and jourdain came up with time period as 1789 and assigned identities to a few of characters they saw including marie antoinette herself as lady sketching on lawn as moberly and jourdain admitted they d been lost on vast grounds of versailles dunning notes that their descriptions of footbridges and kiosks could fit any number of existing structures dame joan evans who owned copyright to an adventure accepted jullian explanation and forbade any further editions however after work came out of copyright it was republished in 1988 as ghosts of trianon complete an adventure by thoth publication and again in 2008 by createspace both times crediting moberly and
