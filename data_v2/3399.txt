designed all of earlier ironclad vessels to prepare designs for two new ironclads first became custoza and second became latter built to a slightly smaller design owing to budgetary shortages romako had studied battle of lissa fought in 1866 and decided new ships should favor heavy armor and capability of end on fire to allow it to effectively attack with its ram this required compromises in number of guns and power of ship s machinery to make up for carrying fewer guns romako adopted same casemate ship design adopted with previous vessel unlike wooden hulled lissa however hull would be constructed with iron first major austro hungarian warship with an iron hull pawlik p 81 though she proved to be a fairly fast and maneuverable ship custoza was built to an obsolescent design and did not meet standards of other major navies in period which demanded greater armor protection and superior firepower dislere pp 24 25 italy austria hungary s rival across adriatic sea laid down two s

a major advantage casemate ships like custoza had over broadside ironclads was reduced weight of smaller battery custoza had enough buoyancy in midships section alone to support weight of ship service
