nepal house martin delichon nipalense frequently delichon nipalensis in older sources but nipalense is currently preferred in accordance with is a non migratory passerine of swallow family hirundinidae its two subspecies breed in himalayas from northwestern india through nepal to myanmar northern vietnam and just into china it occurs in river valleys and rugged wooded mountain ridges at heights between altitude where it nests in colonies beneath overhangs on vertical cliffs laying three or four white eggs in an enclosed mud nest this martin has blue black upperparts with a contrasting white rump and white underparts it resembles its close relatives asian house martin and common house martin but unlike those species it has a black throat and black undertail it feeds in flocks with other swallows catching flies and other insects in flight it is subject to predation and parasites but its status within its limited range appears secure taxonomy nepal house martin was first described by british entomologist frederic moore in 1854 and placed in a new genus delichon created by moore and american naturalist thomas horsfield specimen or its description was attributed by moore to brian houghton hodgson and early literature sometimes refers to in as hodgson s martin some older taxonomic sources such as those by s d ripley specify binomial author as hodgson moore in horsfield moore 1854 its closest relatives are two other members of genus asian house martin and common house martin this martin has a distinctive subspecies d n cuttingi described by american biologist ernst w mayr in 1941 from a specimen taken near burma yunnan border white throated birds in southern extension of range are similar in appearance to nominate subspecies but because of their geographical separation are sometimes considered to be a third race d n delichon is an anagram of ancient greek term meaning swallow and nipalense refers to nepal where type specimen was obtained distribution and habitat nominate subspecies d n nipalense breeds in himalayas from garhwal east through nepal north eastern india and bangladesh as far as western myanmar race d n cuttingi is found in northern myanmar along myanmar s border with chinese yunnan and in northern tonkin vietnam nepal house martin is largely resident but may move to lower altitudes when not breeding and has been occasionally recorded in northern thailand in winter range in thailand is poorly known habitat is river valleys and wooded ridges at altitude although mainly below when not breeding birds may descend as low as range of this species overlaps with that of nominate subspecies of asian house martin although they breed at different altitudes height separation and small differences in appearance seem sufficient to prevent interbreeding description adult nepal house martin is long mainly blue black above and white below it has a contrasting pure white rump tail and upperwings are brownish black and underwings are grey brown legs and feet are brownish pink and covered with white feathers eyes are brown and bill is black chin is black but extent varies clinally in northeast of range birds of race d n cuttingi have black on whole of throat and uppermost breast but further west or south black increasingly becomes restricted to chin there are no differences in appearance between sexes but juvenile bird is less glossy and has a duskier throat and buff washed underparts eastern form d n cuttingi has a wing length of slightly larger than nominate subspecies at both subspecies can be distinguished from similar asian and common house martins by their black chin black undertail coverts and much squarer tail this is an exceptionally fast flying martin which gives an occasional short chi i call in flight it is otherwise is a rather quiet bird but it has a brief three note breeding song behaviour breeding nepal house martin breeds between march and july with some variation in timing depending on locality and usually raises two broods it normally builds its nest a deep mud bowl lined with grasses or feathers under an overhang on a vertical cliff very occasionally buildings may be used as nest sites and in sikkim this bird is recorded as nesting under school roofs near lho wildlife sanctuary this martin is a colonial breeder with colonies sometimes containing hundreds of nests some birds may remain at colonies throughout year using nests as a winter roost normal clutch is three or four plain white eggs averaging and weighing incubation and fledging times are unknown but are probably similar to those of common house martin which has an incubation period of 14 16 days until eggs hatch and a further 22 32 days to fledging both sexes build nest incubate eggs and feed chicks feeding nepal house martin feeds on insects taken in flight hunting along ridges or above treetops diet is not well known but includes flies this bird is gregarious feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like himalayan swiftlet or other hirundines such as barn swallow striated swallow or common house martin predators and parasites predators of this martin have been little studied but it was only bird recorded in a study of diet of mainly insectivorous collared falconet it is parasitised by a flea of genus conservation status nepal house martin has a large range that does not appear to be contracting and its numbers appear to be stable although population is unknown since range is more than and there are more 10 000 mature individuals in absence of any large decline in distribution or numbers species does not appear to meet criteria to be considered vulnerable and is currently evaluated as least concern although often localised due to requirement for suitable cliff nesting sites this species is fairly common in nepal as a whole and very common in some regions some earlier authors have noted this species as uncommon in nepal references external
