began when police confronted march calling for a full investigation into shaoguan incident a brawl in southern china several days earlier in which two uyghurs had been killed however observers disagree on what caused protests to become violent chinese central government alleged that riots themselves were planned from abroad by world uyghur congress wuc and its leader rebiya kadeer while kadeer denies fomenting violence in her fight for uyghur self determination uyghur exile groups claim that escalation was caused by police s use of excessive force chinese media coverage of urumqi riots was extensive and was compared favourably to that of unrest in tibet in 2008 when riots began telephone and internet connections with xinjiang were cut off in weeks that followed official sources reported that over 1 000 uyghurs were arrested and detained uyghur run mosques were temporarily closed communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of january 2010 by november 2009 over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during riots nine were executed in november 2009 and by february 2010 at least 26 had received death sentences background xinjiang is a large central asian region within people s republic of china comprising numerous minority groups 45 of its population are uyghurs and 40 are han its heavily industrialised capital urumqi has a population of more than 2 3 million about 75 of whom are han 12 8 are uyghur and 10 are from other ethnic groups in general uyghurs and mostly han government disagree on which group has greater historical claim to xinjiang region uyghurs believe their ancestors were indigenous to area whereas government policy considers present day xinjiang to have belonged to china since around 200 bc according to prc policy uyghurs are classified as a national minority rather than an indigenous group in other words they are considered to be no more indigenous to xinjiang than han and have no special rights to land under law people s republic has presided over migration into xinjiang of millions of han who dominate region economically and politically at start of 19th century 40 years after qing reconquest of area there were around 155 000 han and hui chinese in northern xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of uyghurs in southern xinjiang millward james a 2007 eurasian crossroads a history of xinjiang p 306 a census of xinjiang under qing rule in early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of population as 30 han and 60 turkic while it dramatically shifted to 6 han and 75 uyghur in 1953 census however by 2000 recorded population was 40 57 han and 45 21 uyghur professor stanley w toops noted that today s demographic situation is similar to that of early qing period in xinjiang in northern xinjiang qing brought in han hui uyghur and kazakh colonists after they exterminated oirat mongols in region with one third of xinjiang s total population consisting of hui and han in north while around two thirds were uyghurs in southern xinjiang s tarim basin ed starr 2004 p 243 although current prc minority policy which is based on affirmative actions has reinforced a uyghur ethnic identity that is distinct from han population some scholars argue that beijing unofficially favours a monolingual monocultural model that is based on majority authorities also crack down on any activity that appears to constitute separatism these policies in addition to long standing cultural differences have sometimes resulted in resentments between uyghur and han citizens on one hand as a result of han immigration and government policies uyghurs freedoms of religion and of movement are curtailed while most uyghurs argue that government downplays their history and traditional culture on other hand some han citizens view uyghurs as benefiting from special treatment such as preferential admission to universities and exemption from one child policy and as harbouring separatist aspirations tensions between uyghurs and han have resulted in waves of protest in recent years xinjiang has been location of several instances of violence and ethnic clashes such as incident of 1997 2008 kashgar attack widespread unrest preceding olympic games in beijing as well as numerous minor attacks immediate causes riots took place several days after a violent incident in shaoguan guangdong where many migrant workers are employed as part of a programme to alleviate labour shortages according to state media a disgruntled former worker disseminated rumours in late june that two han women had been raped by six uyghur men official sources later said they found no evidence to support rape allegation overnight on 25 26 june tensions at guangdong factory led to a full blown ethnic brawl between uyghurs and hans during which two uyghur co workers were killed exiled uyghur leaders alleged death toll was much higher while official xinhua news agency reported that person responsible for spreading rumours had been arrested uyghurs alleged that authorities had failed to protect uyghur workers or to arrest any of han people involved in killings they organised a

government said on 6 july that overseas separatist forces had taken advantage of shaoguan incident to instigate sunday s unrest and undermine ethnic unity and social stability government blamed exiled independence group world uyghur congress wuc for coordinating and instigating riots over internet government sources blamed wuc leader rebiya kadeer in particular citing her public speeches after tibetan unrest and phone recordings in which she had allegedly said that something would happen in urumqi chinese authorities accused a man who they alleged to be a key wuc member of inciting ethnic tensions by circulating a violent video and urging uyghurs in an online forum to fight back against hans with violence jirla isamuddin mayor of urumqi claimed that protesters had organised online via such services as groups china daily asserted that riots were organised to fuel separatism and to benefit middle east terrorist organisations kadeer denied fomenting violence and argued that urumqi protests and their descent into violence were triggered by heavy policing discontent over shaoguan and years of chinese repression rather than by intervention of separatists or terrorists uyghur exile groups claimed that violence erupted when police used excessive force to disperse crowd all parties then agree that protests were organised beforehand main points of contention are whether violence was planned or spontaneous and whether underlying tensions reflect separatist inclinations or a desire for social justice events initial demonstrations 300px thumb alt road map of urumqi showing where
