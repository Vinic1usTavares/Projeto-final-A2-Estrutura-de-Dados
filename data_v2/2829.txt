boy derek pointed out that at least he s alive and not alone megan said yes but he s sick and possibly coughing up blood amateur nature of photo gave derek hope that kidnapper wasn t a professional great said megan that meant he was incompetent and desperate was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract she said it was a pity that megan turned derek down megan could use a bit of a love life and i m hoping we see more of agent ames in future she said she was thankful that there was not a storyline with lacey mary mouser saying that storyline with megan and kate arguing over lacey had
