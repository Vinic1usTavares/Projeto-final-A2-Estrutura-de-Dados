pyrotechnics mike wass from website idolator called show a concert extravaganza in style of michael jackson or madonna praising fact that singer made a progress in production values compared with her previous performances mostly due to expensive and high quality visual projections which create atmosphere and add another layer to production he further praised singer s extraordinary talent during performances hailing her as greatest entertainer of her generation after seeing show which showcased an icon at top of her game tiffany poole from oklahoman praised fashion video backdrops and some of most impersonated dance moves on youtube concluding to say that beyonce puts on a good show would be grossly understated billboard writer gail mitchell hailed concert as a musical and visual extravaganza complete with a kaleidoscope of colorful imagery and dancing which according to him enhanced music complete with singer s strong vocals rather than overshadowing it he concluded that tour claimed multi talented artist s intent to join rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer nick hasted of independent wrote that tour followed stadium trends containing big budget movie clips and broadway musical dance moves with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras further hailing it as a cecil b demille spectacle he finished his reviews by concluding what makes this show s largely enervating juggernaut breathe is beyonce s tireless physical effort she has created a literal body of work alexis petridis of guardian who compared singer s performance with tina turner praised show s bombastic opening and wrote that there s something powerful and relentless about it he concluded while onstage beyonce feels weirdly unassailable mikael wood of los angeles times noted what left deepest impression was something far more elemental beyonce s ability to make self aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility her ambition seemed in proportion with her fans expectations she came by sense of scale honestly observers kitty empire highlighted art direction of show as nothing short of breathtaking making awesome and repeated use of silhouette of great white blocks of video screens of live dancers interacting with video she praised singer s fierce tireless dancing and concluded but for all here in couture and bearing beyonce delivers genuine warmth at close range bernadette mcnulty from daily telegraph found air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony and of an expensive revue show in concert although she felt that choreographies often outshined music mcnulty concluded yet beyonce was never less than compelling to watch and often blistering in her vocal attack philip matusavage of musicomh praised beyonce s abilities to perform live calling her insanely talented and considered performance at b stage a show highlight however he commented that production values of show consisting solely of a video screen were relatively low key compared to other pop arena concerts matusavage further criticized repetition of songs and dance routines which had been previously performed during singer s other concerts as tour s most notable problem shirley halperin of hollywood reporter felt that singer tore through her set with ferocity of a grown woman who has something to prove and felt that she tried her damnedest to win crowd over with an equal dose of sex appeal and good old fashioned hyping further showcasing unequaled showmanship and those killer vocals which placed her at top of r b music however halperin criticized show s set list mainly due to majority of songs from album 4 writing bey sounded terrific on all of course but with a ready to party audience angling to groove in aisles rather than sway with their hands to heavens overall it missed mark digital spys robert copsey praised high energy nature of show with vigorous dancing and blistering pace but felt that there was a lack of hits performed in show s first half nme editor emily mackay echoed his statements giving a mixed review for tour further criticizing lack of hits in set list and adding that only a paucity of material was incorporated in set she further dismissed placement of interlude films in show a negative review came from san jose mercury news jim harrington who called tour flawed criticized its set list consisting of plenty of filler s and many dissipating costume changes she went through for show he further noted that singer looked and sounded well but blamed way show and production were choreographed thumbnail right beyonce and her background dancers performing during crazy in love revamped show in 2014 received acclaim by critics isabel mohan from daily telegraph acclaimed revamped show praising singer s sex appeal and noted that although set included many new songs singer remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent charisma and awe inspiring thighs sidney madden who praised upgraded set list further commended show s fashion digital spys robert copsey felt that show s set list was better than original one describing tour as wall to wall amazing beyonce he concluded in his review relentless pace ever changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into set is a lot to take in let alone fact that beyonce delivers entire thing with power yet impeccable ease when it comes to putting on a show of this calibre these days she s really only competing with herself observers kitty empire praised singer s raunchiness during tour different from other performers and concluded by writing there is no question as to beyonce s own powers she can stop and start her all female band with a click of her fingers and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest she sings with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour and dances flawlessly for more than one and a half hours david pollock of independent felt that this near two hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that knowles intends to be recognised as defining pop artist of her era it was at very least one of hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year and with barely a drop of minutely choreographed sweat to be seen tour received a nomination in category for choice
