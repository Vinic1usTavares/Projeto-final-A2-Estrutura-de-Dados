fortifications of mdina are a series of defensive walls which surround former capital city of mdina malta city was founded as maleth by phoenicians in around 8th century bc and it later became part of roman empire under name melite ancient city was surrounded by walls but very few remains of these have survived city walls were rebuilt a number of times including by byzantine empire in around 8th century ad arabs in around 11th century and kingdom of sicily in medieval period until 15th century most of extant fortifications were built by order of saint john between 16th and 18th centuries city has withstood a number of sieges and it was defeated twice first by aghlabids in 870 and then by maltese rebels in 1798 today city walls are still intact except for some outworks and they are among best preserved fortifications in malta mdina has been on malta s tentative list of unesco world heritage sites since 1998 punic roman walls city of mdina occupies tip of a plateau located on high ground in northern part of island of malta far away from sea site has been inhabited since prehistory and by bronze age it was a place of refuge since it was naturally defensible phoenicians colonized malta in around 8th century bc and they founded city of maleth on this plateau it was taken over by roman republic in 218 bc becoming known as melite punic roman city was about three times size of present day mdina extending into a large part of modern rabat melite s walls had a thickness of around and were surrounded by a long ditch very little remains of punic roman walls of melite still survive remains of a city gate or tower were discovered in saqqajja in modern rabat about below current street level parts of ditch have survived under present day st rita street and church of st paul lower foundations of some punic roman ramparts consisting of rusticated ashlar blocks three courses high still in situ were found near magazine curtain in western part of mdina only other remains of ancient walls are punic roman masonry blocks which were reused in medieval period these include a wall around greeks gate and some stones which were discovered in excavations at street and palace medieval walls thumb left inner portal of greeks gate one of few visible remains of medieval walls at some point following fall of western roman empire a retrenchment was built within city reducing it to its present size this was done to make city s perimeter more easily defensible and similar reductions in city sizes were common around mediterranean region in early middle ages although it was traditionally assumed that retrenchment was built by arabs it has been suggested that it was actually built by byzantine empire in around 8th century when threat from arabs increased in 870 melite was captured by aghlabids who massacred its inhabitants and demolished its fortress according to chronicler al this account further mentions that malta remained almost uninhabited until it was resettled in around 1048 or 1049 by a muslim community and their slaves who built a settlement called medina on site of melite archaeological evidence suggests that city was already a thriving muslim settlement by beginning of 11th century so 1048 49 might be date when city was officially founded and its walls were constructed byzantines besieged medina in 1053 54 but were repelled by its defenders medina surrendered peacefully to roger i of sicily after a short siege in 1091 and malta was subsequently incorporated into county and later kingdom of sicily being dominated by a succession of feudal lords fortifications of mdina were rebuilt and modified a number of times over following centuries a castle known as castellu di la chitati or castrum civitas was built on southeast corner of city near main entrance probably on site of an earlier byzantine fort city withstood a siege by invaders in 1429 by 15th century most of mdina s enciente had a system of double walls land front was flanked by four towers one near greeks gate another at centre of land front turri mastra also known as turri di la bandiera near main entrance and turri di la camera at southeast corner of city a barbican was built near mdina s main entrance sometime after 1448 in 1450s there were fears of a barbary or ottoman attack so efforts were made to improve mdina s walls main ditch was completed and castellu di la chitati was partially demolished by royal licence in 1453 due to its ruinous state and excessive cost for its upkeep thumb mdina as seen from by 1474 cannons had been introduced in mdina other extensive preparations for an attack were made in 1480s when fortifications were once again improved under direction of sicilian military engineers at this point some buildings in rabat were demolished to clear fortifications line of fire by 1522 fortifications were being modernized with construction of embrasures however walls were still regarded as obsolete since they lacked bastions and could not resist bombardment from modern artillery most of medieval walls of mdina were gradually dismantled between 1530s and 1720s when city s fortifications were being upgraded by hospitallers one of most significant visible remnants of medieval fortifications is greeks gate and surrounding curtain walls which still retains its medieval form apart from outer portal which was built in 18th century parts of double walls including remains of two gun loops still stand between gate and torre dello standardo most of northern and eastern walls date back to medieval period although some sections were rebuilt by hospitallers northern ramparts contain a medieval wall tower while remains of byzantine antemurals and foundations of a late 15th century artillery platform have been found in eastern walls hospitaller walls thumb left map of mdina s fortifications as they were during great siege of malta in 1565 when order of saint john took over in malta in 1530 nobles ceremoniously handed over keys of city to grand master philippe villiers de l isle adam order settled in birgu and mdina lost its status as capital city but l isle adam built a palace on remaining part of castellu di la chitati which became meeting place of civil administrative council known as universita first major upgrade of mdina s fortifications occurred in 1540s during magistracy of juan de homedes y coscon two new bastions were built at extremities of land front possibly to designs of military engineer antonio ferramolino parts of eastern walls were also rebuilt en cremaillere only instance this style is found in malta 15th century barbican in front of main gate was demolished in 1551 since it obstructed line of fire of newly built bastions that year city withstood a brief ottoman attack thumb painting of great siege of malta with mdina at bottom mdina was not attacked directly during great siege of malta but it nonetheless played a crucial role in siege ottoman general mustafa pasha wanted to take over poorly defended city first but was overruled by pasha who wanted to attack fort saint elmo fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting but ottomans had lost crucial time in doing so on 7 august 1565 order s cavalry in mdina attacked unprotected ottoman field hospital which led in invaders abandoning a major assault on main fortifications in birgu and ottomans tried to take over city in september so as to winter there but abandoned their plans when mdina fired its cannon leading them to believe that city had ammunition to spare thumb left plan on left shows proposal to reduce mdina s size by half with proposal being overlaid on a plan of city s existing fortifications plan on right shows a similar proposal to modernize gozo s cittadella after siege maltese military engineer girolamo cassar drew up plans to reduce mdina s size by half and turning it into a fortress but these were never implemented due to protests by city s nobles city s main gate was reconstructed in early 17th century but next major alterations were not made until 1650s when large de redin bastion was built at centre of land front despite these modifications by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish entire fortress due to its state of disrepair although these plans were opposed by locals in late 17th century some of mdina s medieval double walls began to be encased in sloping ramparts thumb 18th century mdina gate and walled up medieval entrance a major restoration of mdina s fortifications was undertaken in 1720s by french military engineer charles francois de mondion during magistracy of antonio manoel de vilhena l isle adam s palace including remaining parts of castellu di la chitati were demolished to make way for palazzo vilhena while main gate was walled up and a new city gate was built in baroque style a baroque portal was also added to greeks gate remaining medieval towers in land front were demolished and torre dello standardo was built on site of turri mastra while entire western walls of city were demolished to make way for a single casemated curtain wall known as magazine curtain d homedes bastion was modified with addition of a bastionette while traverse like batteries were built at extremities of land front city was further protected with construction of outworks including a covertway two places of arms and a glacis thumb left map of mdina s fortifications with mondion s modifications mondion also made further plans to strengthen mdina s fortifications but they were not implemented since order focused on building its fortifications in harbour area only major addition to mdina fortifications after mondion s reconstruction was despuig bastion which was built during reign of ramon despuig between 1739 and 1746 on 10 june 1798 mdina was captured by french forces without much resistance during french invasion of malta a french garrison remained in city but a maltese uprising broke out on 2 september of that year following day rebels entered city through a sally port in despuig bastion and massacred garrison of 65 men these events marked beginning of a two year uprising and blockade which ended in 1800 with malta becoming a british protectorate mdina s fortifications remained in use during british period and some minor alterations such as installation of gun emplacements were made in 19th century by end of century city was regarded as forming part of defensive system of victoria lines in 1890s battery near st peter bastion was demolished and a gateway was opened within magazine curtain this was done in order to facilitate access to newly built railway station located nearby fortifications were included on antiquities list of 1925 some of galleries in mdina s ditch were used as air raid shelters during world war ii recent history thumb greeks gate undergoing restoration in 2015 sections of medieval walls of mdina were rediscovered by dr stephen c spiteri and mario while they were surveying bastions in 2002 first plans to undertake a major restoration of mdina s walls were made in 2006 as part of a project that also included restoration of fortifications of valletta birgu and cittadella in case of mdina main focus was to consolidate terrain since city is built on a blue clay plateau which is prone to subsidence multimillion euro restoration was partially financed by european regional development fund works began in early 2008 by restoration unit process of restoration was documented by dr spiteri in 2011 steel rods were inserted into d homedes bastion in order to prevent walls from slipping down clay slopes ditch was inaugurated as a public garden in march 2013 all erdf financed work was completed in late 2013 but restoration directorate later restored other parts of fortifications including northern walls st peter bastion and area around greeks gate project was fully completed in early 2016 thumb left a 14th century limestone block bearing a coat of arms which was discovered at d homedes bastion in 2012 throughout course of restoration a number of archaeological discoveries were made excavations along eastern part of city walls unearthed byzantine antemurals and base of a late 15th century artillery platform in 2010 remains of foundations of punic roman walls were found when excavations were made along magazine curtain a late 14th century stone block bearing coat of arms of guglielmo possibly originating from castellu di la chitati was discovered in 2012 during restoration of d homedes bastion this block is now displayed at fortifications interpretation centre in valletta layout thumb d homedes bastion present configuration of mdina s fortifications consists of an irregular perimeter of curtain walls stiffened by a number of bastions northern western and eastern walls are built on perimeter of natural plateau so they were difficult to attack southern perimeter of city is built on level ground along what is now border with rabat it was only realistic direction to assault city and was hence known as mdina land front southern perimeter contains an arrowhead shaped bastion with rectangular orillons on each extremity with a large pentagonal bastion in centre st peter bastion also known as greeks gate bastion built in 1550s during magistracy of juan de homedes y coscon de redin bastion built in 1650s during magistracy of martin de redin d homedes bastion also known as st paul bastion or del palacio built between 1540s and 1551 during magistracy of juan de homedes y coscon it is further defended by a bastionette thumb right 19th century gate within magazine curtain two gates into city mdina gate and greeks gate are located within curtain walls of land front remains of medieval double walls as well as 18th century torre dello standardo are located just within city walls land front is surrounded by a deep ditch and a traverse like battery is located in its eastern extremity most of eastern walls of city consist of an en cremaillere enciente built in mid 16th century although parts of walls date back to medieval period pentagonal despuig bastion built in 1740s during magistracy ramon despuig is grafted below walls on northeastern corner of city northern walls of mdina still retain their medieval form with a few hospitaller modifications and they contain only surviving tower in city walls st mary s bastion or ta bachar bastion which was built in 16th century is grafted on northwest corner of city this is linked to st peter bastion by magazine curtain a long casemated curtain wall built in 1720s in western part of city a small gate built by british in 19th century is located within this curtain wall notes references bibliography external links national inventory of cultural property of maltese islands
