completion of its predecessor game was created by team silent a production group within konami computer entertainment tokyo story was conceived by cgi director takayoshi sato who based it on russian author fyodor dostoevsky s novel crime and punishment 1866 with individual members of team collaborating on actual scenario main writing was done by hiroyuki and sato who provided dialog for female characters around time silent hill 2 was in production average budget for video game production has been estimated to be around us 7 10 million by sato decision to produce a sequel to silent hill was partly a financial one as it had been commercially successful and partly a creative one as team had faced difficulties while working on original game team was given a small window to settle on a platform as it was unable to gather information on then unannounced gamecube and xbox consoles they began production of game for playstation 2 producer akihiro imamura stated that decision was also influenced by a wish from business section that we move rapidly on ps2 you know it is currently market focus imamura read all comments about original game and kept them in mind while working on silent hill 2 he estimated that a total of fifty people worked on game while creative team from first game remained they had to bring in thirty people from konami computer entertainment tokyo developed at same time playstation 2 version of silent hill 2 and its xbox port debuted at march 2001 tokyo game show to positive reactions silent hill 2 shared same atmosphere of psychological horror as first silent hill game as developers already had a rough sense of game s environment they focused on its plot first in contrast to process used with first game playstation 2 hardware allowed developers to create improved fog and shadow special effects for example as a monster approaches player character its shadow cast on wall by flashlight grows when dealing with game s camera angles team struggled with a balance between those that stayed true to creative vision and those that did not hamper gameplay psychological elements such as gradual disappearance of mary s letter and symbolic holes were incorporated into game team wanted silent hill 2s protagonist to reflect evil against which protagonist of first game battles for game s artistic style team drew on a variety of influences work of film directors david cronenberg david fincher david lynch and alfred hitchcock along with films similar to 1990 psychological thriller horror film jacob s ladder and painters such as francis bacon rembrandt and andrew wyeth early in project they studied 1996 video game tomb raiders creation of 3d environments other influences on game included 1992 survival horror video game alone in dark first silent hill game and japanese comic by while working on character designs sato and his team sketched human faces and various expressions to gain a better sense of characters facial structures they drew characters profiles from various angles before creating wire frame models each consisting of six thousand polygons they then completed model with textures data for character animation was taken through motion capture and using softimage they animated characters masahiro ito designed monsters in silent hill 2 soured flesh was concept behind their appearance monsters were also to incorporate an element of humanity for most part monsters reflect protagonist s subconscious for example monster pyramid head was based on executioners of town s fictional history and is intended to be a punisher for james two exceptions to this theme are abstract daddy a reflection of angela s subconscious and memories and creepers which are also seen in first game silent hill 2 also incorporates some references to real life events in original scenario developers designed maria and james with dual personalities maria s other personality was mary a reference to mary jane kelly jack ripper s last victim while james was joseph a reference to one of jack ripper suspects eddie dombrowski s name was taken from actor eddie murphy during beginning phases of production when eddie was originally designed with a pleasantly optimistic personality name of angela orosco was derived from angela bennett name of protagonist in 1995 film net and laura s from 1970 novel no language but a cry by richard d ambrosio developers satirized perceived accessibility of guns in united states by allowing james to find a handgun in a shopping cart there are also indications that layout of silent hill was based to a certain extent on town of san bruno california audio akira yamaoka composed music for silent hill 2 at his home yamaoka took three days to write music for theme of laura silent hill 2s main theme by combining a sad melody and a strong beat although he does not consider melody to be most important element of a musical piece he wanted music to evoke emotions in player silent hill 2

its release and in retrospect andy greenwald of spin magazine praised it as a frightening but restrained game jon thompson of allgame stated silent hill 2 feels a bit rushed and although it might not live up to dizzying horror of first game it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel ign s doug perry wrote it s frightening deep clever and tries to improve genre if just a little and in end that s all i really want in a survival horror game joe fielder of gamespot concluded silent hill 2 is a much prettier somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than original in replay history of video games 2010 donovan described silent hill 2 as high point of series in a retrospective article on survival horror genre ign writer jim sterling praised game s plot as one of finest examples of

tension and fear for players in his review of game he commented silent hill 2 is game i replay every now and again to remind myself that for all shiny brown quick time event rpg element space marines gaming is still worth defending and that it s a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied graphics and atmosphere of silent hill 2 were praised by reviewers who highlighted smooth transitions from computer generated cg to in game cutscenes and sense of claustrophobia caused by fog on other hand thompson felt that grainy image effects and dense fog hid details of environment while fielder wrote that exterior environments rarely push playstation 2 s graphical capabilities character animation was considered realistic by reviewers though james animation in cg sometimes appeared marionette like according to perry voice acting garnered mixed responses from reviewers divided over whether it was well done with an improved script or hampered by script reviewers enjoyed monster designs although some found monsters less frightening due to abundance of ammunition and being easily avoided reviewers found camera though improved still difficult when battling monsters which hung from ceiling concerns echoed by reviewers of pc version soundtrack and sound effects were considered by reviewers to be effective in creating suspense though thompson considered them sometimes a bit forced and contrived puzzles were generally seen as not overly challenging by reviewers though thompson found them generally easy and gamespy s david wrote that they were sometimes illogical less well received was combat criticized for its lack of challenge and easily defeated monsters and bosses reactions to xbox port were also positive reviewers have written that playstation 2 and xbox versions were mostly similar except for born from a wish side scenario found in xbox version eurogamers kristan reed called born from a wish more like a demo than anything while fielder described it as a commendable extra both felt that it could be completed in around an hour and did not add much to game pc port in contrast received mixed reaction allen rausch of gamespy considered pc port overall to be a fantastic translation of konami s stylish and scary survival horror game ign s ivan sulic advised against playing game with keyboard and rated game great
