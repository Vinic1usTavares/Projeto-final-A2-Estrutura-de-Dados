mudejar revolt of 1264 1266 was a rebellion by muslim populations in lower andalusia and murcia regions of crown of castile rebellion was in response to castile s policy of relocating muslim populations from these regions and was partially instigated by muhammad i of granada rebels were aided by independent emirate of granada while castilians were allied with aragon early in uprising rebels managed to capture murcia and jerez as well as several smaller towns but were eventually defeated by royal forces subsequently castile expelled muslim populations of reconquered territories and encouraged christians from elsewhere to settle their lands granada became a vassal of castile and paid an annual tribute background a rebellion occurred during reconquista centuries long conquest of muslim territories in iberian peninsula called al andalus by muslims by christian kingdoms from northern part of iberia islam had been present in iberia since umayyad conquest in eighth century at beginning of twelfth century muslim population in peninsula was estimated to number up to 5 6 million among whom were arabs berbers and indigenous converts in following centuries christian kingdoms steadily grew in strength and territories while muslim ones declined early thirteenth century was a period of great loss for muslims almohad caliphate which had dominated muslim iberia fell into dynastic struggles after yusuf ii died in 1224 without heir al andalus disintegrated into multiple small kingdoms or taifas meanwhile ferdinand iii united christian kingdoms of castile and leon in 1231 and taking advantage of muslims disunity conquered various territories in south his conquests during this period included guadalquivir basin also known as lower andalusia and murcia which became principal centers of this rebellion on 2 april 1243 city of murcia surrendered to infante alfonso future alfonso x after which it became a semi independent vassal of castile jerez one of remaining muslim enclaves in andalusia surrendered in 1261 after a month long siege alfonso x had ascended to throne in 1252 by which time according to historian l p harvey muslim subjects could be broadly classified into two groups those from old and new castile who had lived for several centuries under stable castilian rule in well established communities and had rights that were enshrined in charters of their home towns or cities and those from areas conquered in thirteenth century who suffered from political instability many were relocated by their christian conquerors or had migrated to muslim ruled granada and in some rare cases to north africa relocation policies were considered oppressive by muslim population and led to a protest being presented to pope these policies were a major factor in outbreak of rebellion in south of iberian peninsula emirate of granada emerged under rule of muhammad i ibn al in 1246 he agreed to pay tribute and swear fealty to castile then under alfonso s father ferdinand iii in exchange for peace muhammad i used ensuing peace to consolidate his realm in addition his forces participated in some castilian campaigns against other muslim territories including conquest of seville 1248 and jerez 1261 however muhammad s position was far from unambiguously pro castile historian l p harvey speculated that after castilian conquest of muslim kingdom of niebla in 1262 he became emboldened as sole independent muslim ruler in spain and sought to weaken castilian control over their recently conquered territories course of war beginning of rebellion thumb upright a moorish warrior embraces his castilian ally during revolt taken from cantigas de santa maria revolt began almost simultaneously in lower andalusia and murcia rebellion likely started between april and june 1264 when muhammad i s name was struck from list of alfonso x s loyal vassals a skirmish took place on 10 july in which granada defeated castilian forces in august 1264 muslim inhabitants of jerez aided by allies from algeciras and tarifa attacked outnumbered royal garrison led by nuno gonzalez de lara demoralized nuno deserted his post and alcazar was taken on 8 august according to songs in cantigas de santa maria mudejars captured all soldiers destroyed chapel of mary and tried to burn a statue of mary but statue miraculously resisted flames reinforcements from seville arrived two days later but it was too late following jerez lower andalusian towns of arcos and medina sidonia also fell to rebels nearby castle of held by knights of calatrava was successfully defended by garrison in murcia city of murcia itself fell as well as galera but orihuela was successfully defended by royal forces murcia s muslims ousted city s royal garrison and declared allegiance to muhammad i who appointed abu muhammad ibn ashqilula to be governor alfonso s father in law james i of aragon wrote that three hundred cities great towns and castles were captured by rebels and that alfonso and queen violant escaped an assassination attempt in capital seville however alfonso did not mention any assassination attempt and james account might have been an exaggeration emirate of granada whose forces would later be bolstered by volunteers from north africa fully supported rebellion additional muslim troops from north africa attempted a landing in guadalquivir estuary but were repulsed by alfonso ultimately north african troops did not play a significant role in war muslims from old and new castile such as those from avila burgos arevalo and madrid which had been under castilian rule for generations and did not suffer from alfonso s relocation policy largely did not join rebellion castile s counter attack castilian forces counter attacked by marching on jerez a key garrison town recapturing it in late 1264 possibly on 9 october after a siege rebel held towns of medina sidonia rota and de also fell to royal forces muslims in retaken towns were expelled mosques in jerez were converted to churches and region was settled by christians from elsewhere meanwhile queen violant requested help from her father king james i of aragon who was initially reluctant to provide support but eventually agreed thumb siege of chincoya castle during rebellion according to cantigas de santa maria granadan troops besieging castle retreated after defenders put a statue of

castilian positions cantigas mention an unsuccessful granadan siege of chincoya castle purportedly after a statue of virgin mary put on ramparts discouraged from attacking despite failure in chincoya muhammad i likely took many poorly defended castles along border in response to granadan threat towns in upper andalusia established a brotherhood pact at andujar on 26 april 1265 swearing cooperation and a common defense meanwhile alfonso began preparations for invading granada he opened communication with banu ashqilula a powerful family within emirate at odds with ruling nasrid dynasty in early 1265 a major battle took place between alfonso and muhammad and ended in an important victory for castile alfonso subsequently invaded granada in late spring 1265 and by summer was encamped on plains of granada his forces raided granada s territory including alcala de benzaide from emirate s capital aragonese conquest of murcia even though james i agreed to help castile initially he was delayed by negotiations with his nobles catalan courts agreed to raised taxes for campaign in july 1264 but parliament for his other dominion aragonese corts initially rejected campaign when they met in november james i spent following months convincing aragonese lords before they consented to support his campaign in may 1265 archbishop of tarragon and bishop of valencia began preaching for crusades in late summer infante peter raided rebel controlled countryside in october james himself led aragonese forces to invade rebel held murcia as james army advanced to murcia muslim held towns in region including villena elda orihuela surrendered to his forces granada sent a column numbering 2 800 men to relieve murcia but it was defeated by aragonese troops on 2 january 1266 james laid siege to city after skirmishes and negotiations murcia surrendered on 31 january james entered city on 3 february 1266 and its mosque was reconsecrated as a church later murcia cathedral where james priests held mass with murcia secured james returned to his realm in march and no longer participated in war end of war still in 1266 banu ashqilula rebelled against muhammad i from their stronghold at malaga they offered alliance to alfonso x who responded by promising to personally protect them and sent a force of 1 000 men under command of nuno gonzalez de lara to defend malaga in exchange banu ashqilula might have promised to cede antequera and marbella to castile there is a lack of record about battles or military operations from this point onward but it seemed that castile banu ashqilula alliance was gaining advantage with his allies defeated and facing enemies in two fronts muhammad i sued for peace he and his son future muhammad ii concluded a treaty at alcala de benzaide with muhammad agreeing to become alfonso s vassal and pay a tribute of 250 000 per year sources vary on date of this treaty alfonso x s royal chronicle dated it at 1265 but modern historian joseph f o callaghan dismissed this date as confused moroccan historian ibn s al bayan al written 1312 dated treaty at 665 ah which corresponds to a range between october 1266 and september 1267 o callaghan dated it at 1267 possibly late may or early june while another historian simon r doubleday dated it at late august or early september 1266 aftermath failure of rebellion had disastrous consequences for muslims in andalusia and murcia castile annexed murcia which had been semi independent since 1244 outright except for orihuela and elche which were annexed by aragon victors imposed harsh punishments in rebellious territories including mass expulsion and ethnic cleansing alfonso paid christians from elsewhere to settle formerly muslim lands and mosques were reconsecrated as churches from this point on muslims were almost non existent in andalusia in murcia large muslim population remained with their religious rights guaranteed but they were forced to move to suburb of and their houses and lands in city were divided among christian settlers over time alfonso reduced portion of lands allocated to muslims in granada rebellion had mixed consequences granada had suffered a heavy defeat and had to pay an enormous tribute to castile significantly greater than what it paid before rebellion however signing of treaty ensured its survival and granada emerged as sole independent muslim state in peninsula muslims who were expelled by castile emigrated to granada strengthening emirate s population for castile revolt which had nearly succeeded had been a grave threat to alfonso s rule and had shaken his self confidence in years after rebellion he accomplished little and subsequently rebellion began to foment among his nobles including those who had taken refuge in granada presence of granada on his southern borders also complicated his efforts to launch a crusade in africa tribute payments from granada became both a source of income and a major problem because resulting inflation reduced effective revenue of castilian nobles and made attracting settlers using payments more difficult alfonso stayed in jerez until late 1268 overseeing christian settlement of territories and attempting to stem inflation mudejars of old and new castile most of whom did not join rebellion were unaffected by expulsion imposed in rebellious territories however community became less prominent than before accepting that discretion and second class status were price to be paid to ensure survival references notes citations bibliography category 1260s conflicts category 1260s in europe
