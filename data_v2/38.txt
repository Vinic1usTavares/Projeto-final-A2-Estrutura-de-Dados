novel food of gods and how it came to earth and its theme of animal size change another influence was 1927 film cat and canary and its 1939 re make archer 2004 p 74 both of which feature haunted house premises and stalker characters writer alan pattillo who according to special effects supervisor derek meddings had tried to come up with most nightmarish rescue situation he could meddings 1993 p 75 had wanted to direct episode as well ultimately however it was directed by david lane la riviere 2009 p 127 attack of alligators was filmed in october and november 1965 la riviere 2009 p 129 production went over schedule forcing crew to work extra hours and sometimes long into night to complete filming special effects technician ian wingrove remembered that episode s complex technical aspects once resulted in crew working day and night through a weekend alligators in episode were portrayed not by actual alligators as gerry anderson had originally intended bentley 2005 p 29 but by juvenile crocodiles these were acquired from a private zoo in north of england to double as enlarged alligators on episode s scale sets and water tanks bentley 2005 p 30 crocodiles that appear in episode were long a larger specimen measuring was not used as it was too aggressive to be taken out of its box crew kept water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to coax movement out of crocodiles animals were unpredictable and difficult to control either basking in heat of studio lights or disappearing into tanks for hours at a time meddings 1993 p 74 to make them more visible to cameras crew attached them to guiding rods and co ordinated their movements use of live animals in both puppet and scale model shots required an unusually close collaboration between puppet and effects crews effects director brian johnson and several other crew members boycotted production on animal welfare grounds camera operator alan perry did not remember any of crocodiles being mistreated series supervising director desmond saunders however claimed that more than one specimen died of pneumonia after being left overnight in an unheated tank director david elliott though filming a different episode at time recalled that another dislocated one of its limbs after receiving an electric shock puppet operator christine glanville admitted that filming would not have been pleasant for crocodiles because tanks contained all sorts of dirty paint water oil and soapy water to make it look swampy saunders commented it was scandalous it was one of great episodes nevertheless there was a price to be paid for it concerns about possible animal cruelty prompted an anonymous telephone call to rspca which sent an inspector to studios after a brief investigation no action was taken against apf this coincided with a decision to increase voltage of electric shocks to induce greater movement from crocodiles la riviere 2009 p 126 according to gerry anderson when inspector arrived meddings explained that his team were laying crocodiles down and they weren t doing anything they were just lying there rspca man said well they would because of warmth of lamps so derek said we ve been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move guy asked what voltage they were using and derek said it was about 20 volts and guy said oh they ve got terribly thick skins you know if you want them to move you ll have to pump it up to 60 inspector later joined production to work alongside crocodiles handler filming with crocodiles was often hazardous during a promotional photography shoot featuring lady penelope who does not appear in episode one of animals attacked puppet and destroyed one of its legs archer 2004 p 20 during filming of a particular scene meddings was pulling a crocodile towards him on a rope when animal slid out of its harness archer 2004 p 41 in his book 21st century visions meddings wrote of incident my crew never saw me move as fast as i did to get out of tank when i pulled rope and realised creature was free of largest crocodile which was kept at back of stage when not being used wingrove recalled you would forget that it was there then one day someone shouted look out and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across stage which cleared of people very quickly both this episode and cham cham next episode to enter production exceeded their budgets this led writers to re script final episode of thunderbirds series one security hazard as a clip show to reduce costs bentley 2005 p 31 opening scene features an insert shot of a stormy sky that was later used to introduce opening titles of prisoner bentley 2005 p 87 broadcast attack of alligators was seen by 4 78 million viewers when it was

like a beautifully directed short film he elaborated attack of alligators serves as a terrific example of how strong thunderbirds can look it s not howdy doody sporting a jetpack it s an hour long programme that feels like a motion picture susanna lazarus of radio times suggests that episode is memorable specifically for its crocodile footage techniques used to produce footage have caused episode to be described as controversial by some sources mark of website den of geek criticises footage from a visual standpoint arguing that use of scale sets with young crocodiles shot in super
