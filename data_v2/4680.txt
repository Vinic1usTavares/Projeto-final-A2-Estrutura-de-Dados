directed by satoru okada and masao yamamoto credited as yamamoto and featured music written by hirokazu tanaka credited as hip tanaka makoto kano credited under his last name was tasked to create scenario and hiroji kiyotake credited under his last name hirofumi matsuoka credited as new matsuoka and yoshio sakamoto credited as designed game s characters character design for samus aran was created by kiyotake production was described as a very free working environment by tanaka who stated that despite being composer he also gave input for game s graphics and helped name game s areas part way through development one of developers asked others hey wouldn t that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside suit was a woman this idea was incorporated into game though english language instruction manual for game uses pronoun he many times in reference to samus ridley scott s 1979 horror film alien was described by sakamoto as a huge influence on metroid after game s world had been created development staff was affected by work of film s creature designer h r giger and found his creations to be fitting for metroid universe still there were problems in progressing development in spite of approaching release date that eventually led sakamoto to be forcefully asked to participate by his superiors hoping his previous experience could help metroid team get job done sakamoto stated he figured out a way to bypass limited resources and time to leverage existing assets to create variation and an exciting experience nintendo attempted to set metroid apart from other games by making it a nonlinear adventure based game in which exploration was a crucial part of experience game often requires that players retrace their steps to progress forcing player to scroll screen left in addition to moving it right as was case in most contemporary games metroid was also considered one of first video games to impress a feeling of desperation and solitude on player following legend of zelda metroid helped pioneer idea of acquiring tools to strengthen characters and help progress through game up until that point most ability enhancing power ups like power shot in gauntlet 1985 and starman in super mario bros offered only temporary boosts to characters and they were not required to complete game in metroid however items were permanent fixtures that lasted until end in particular missiles and ice beam were required to finish game after defeating mother brain player is given an end screen based on time it took them to get there metroid is one of first games to contain multiple endings with five in total in third fourth and fifth endings samus aran appears without her suit and for first time reveals herself to be a woman in japan disk card media used by disk system allowed players to save up to three different games in metroid similar to three save slots in legend of zelda in west use of an internal battery to manage files was not fully realized in time for metroids international release western versions of metroid use a password system that was new to industry at time in which players write down a 24 letter code and re enter it into game when they wish to continue a previous session codes also allow for changes in gameplay sword grants samus infinite ammunition health all power ups and a modified ice beam justin bailey code lets player play as samus without her power suit which was thought by some to be only way to use feature however it is available simply by beating game quickly enough to reveal samus wearing a leotard at ending sequence music tanaka said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a living organism and had no distinction between music and sound effects only time a melodic theme is heard is when mother brain is defeated in order to give victorious player catharsis during rest of game melodies are more minimalistic because tanaka wanted soundtrack to be opposite of hummable pop tunes found in other games at that time release officially defined as a scrolling shooter video game nintendo released metroid for family computer disk system in japan on august 6 1986
