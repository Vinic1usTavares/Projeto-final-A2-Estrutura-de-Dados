der opposition gegen hitler resistance coup d etat assassination battle of opposition against hitler this work lists strachwitz as being part of german military resistance to nazism with generals hubert lanz hans speidel and he is shown as being associated with plan lanz as testified by general der gebirgstruppe hubert lanz according to lanz plan was to arrest or kill hitler in early february 1943 during hitler s scheduled visit to armeeabteilung lanz in his account strachwitz s role was to surround hitler and his escorts shortly after hitler s arrival with his tanks lanz stated that he would have then arrested hitler and in event of resistance strachwitz s tanks would have shot and killed entire delegation hitler cancelled visit and plan was dropped roll 2011 pp 182 183 author roll casts doubt on this account citing that strachwitz s cousin rudolf christoph freiherr von gersdorff who attempted to assassinate hitler in 1943 had recounted that strachwitz had expressed belief to
