of its northwesterly track tropical depression moved over hainan shortly after tropical cyclogenesis upon its emergence into gulf of tonkin on july 5 toraji quickly intensified into a tropical storm with winds of 65 km h 40 mph this would be tropical cyclone s peak intensity for its entire duration however jma indicated that tropical storm intensity had been reached a day earlier on evening of july 5 toraji made its final landfall on dongxing guangxi before rapidly deteriorating inland and degenerating into a remnant low pressure area by following day during its two day duration toraji brought heavy rainfall to areas of southeastern china and vietnam prior to impacting china 147 000 people were evacuated from potentially affected regions in that country storm s effects were spread out over a area torrential rainfall produced by tropical storm damaged agricultural land and destroyed several hundred homes while damaging many more total damage in china was estimated at cny 73 million 9 6 million despite making landfall near border of vietnam and china effects in former were generally minimal however several fishing boats capsized offshore these sinkings did not result in

classified system as a tropical depression at 0000 utc on july 3 after storm had organized sufficiently however other tracking agencies did not indicate that tropical cyclogenesis had occurred at time however joint typhoon warning center jtwc began to monitor disturbance for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis at 0100 utc later that day at time storm system was situated in an area of weak to moderate wind shear exposing disturbance s low level circulation center despite prevailing conditions and proximity to land storm continued to organize and as such jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for system at 0130 utc following day as it tracked in a general northwesterly direction intensification continued and both jma and jtwc consequently upgraded disturbance to tropical storm intensity at 0600 utc on july 4 giving storm name toraji meanwhile hong kong observatory hko upgraded same system to tropical depression status at same time toraji made its first landfall on hainan island according to jma tropical storm had winds of 65 km h 40 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 mbar hpa 29 42 inhg as cyclone passed over island toraji weakened marginally and whilst hko and jma maintained their prior intensities for system jtwc downgraded toraji to tropical depression status at 1800 utc before a subsequent re upgrade as cyclone emerged into gulf of tonkin early following day once over open water modest intensification ensued with storm reaching peak intensity at 1800 utc on july 4 with winds still at 65 km h 40 mph and a pressure of 994 mbar hpa 29 36 inhg six hours later on following day hko upgraded toraji to tropical storm intensity after having tracked north northwestward along western periphery of a subtropical ridge toraji made its final landfall near cam pha vietnam at approximately 1200 utc on july 5 at same intensity six hours later all three agencies downgraded toraji to tropical depression intensity by that time jtwc had ceased issuance of tropical cyclone products on storm however jma and hko continued to monitor system until 0000 utc on july 5 preparations and impact due to impending threat of toraji chinese officials

quarters of 2007 system s effects were spread out over a region approximately in area in guangxi toraji caused extensive impacts in dongxing a weather station clocked gusts peaking at 120 km h 75 mph
