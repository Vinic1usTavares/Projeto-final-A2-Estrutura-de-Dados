motul de san jose is an ancient maya site located just north of lake peten itza in peten basin region of southern maya lowlands it is a few kilometres from modern village of san jose in guatemala s northern department of peten a medium sized civic ceremonial centre it was an important political and economic centre during late classic period ad 650 950 foias 2000 p 773 halperin 2008 p 114 site was first settled between 600 and 300 bc in latter portion of middle preclassic period when it most likely was a fairly small site this maya city then had a long and continuous occupational history until early postclassic up to around ad 1250 with peaks in late preclassic and late classic periods moriarty 2004 pp 37 39 motul de san jose had begun to refer to tikal as its overlord in late 4th century ad by 7th century it had switched its allegiance to calakmul tikal s great rival before returning its allegiance to tikal in early 8th century in late 8th century motul de san jose appears to have been conquered by dos pilas capital of petexbatun kingdom most natural resources were easily available in immediate vicinity of city nearby port at la trinidad de nosotros was an important hub for import of exotic goods and export of local products such as chert and ceramics other goods not immediately available were likely to have been provided by city s satellite sites local area provided a number of different soils suitable for varied agricultural use and port at la trinidad de nosotros provided city with freshwater products such as turtles crocodiles and freshwater molluscs deer were hunted locally and provided an important source of protein for upper class while freshwater snails were main source of protein for commoners motul de san jose has been identified as source of ik style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of late classic maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities reents budet et al 2007 pp 1417 1418 ik style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour scenes with dancers wearing masks and realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life city was capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance including a port on shore of lake peten itza location motul de san jose is located from north shore of lake peten itza in centre of department of el peten foias 2000 p 773

nuevo san jose a northern expansion of san jose by a dirt road foias et al 1998a p 9 it lies among land that has been cleared of forest within last century and is now used to plant maize and graze cattle moriarty 2004 p 24 motul de san jose lies on a limestone plateau at northern edge of fault depression that underlies central lakes of peten basin moriarty 2004 pp 23 32 local topography consists of ridges generally running east west or northeast southwest alternating with lower lying areas with clay soils these low lying areas tend to feed into drainage systems flowing into either lake peten itza itself or into akte river kantetul river is a seasonal watercourse with its origin to northeast of site and flowing westwards into akte river passing from site core moriarty 2004 p 23 akte river in turn flows west into san pedro river which flows northwest into mexico where it joins usumacinta river and ultimately empties into gulf of mexico a mixture of ancient and modern agricultural terraces line riverbank north of site core emery 1998 pp 63 64 access to water was crucial for maya cities since much of maya lowlands have been described as a seasonal desert due to combination of a prolonged dry season lasting between four and six months together with limestone geography that makes surface water scarce drew 2002 p 239 in addition maya greatly preferred water to land transport and used canoes to trade extensively by river and sea and access to river routes connected cities to extensive trade routes abbas 1998 pp 21 22 thumb left 400px map of lake peten itza

parts glyphs representing k uhul and ajau meaning divine and lord followed by name of polity this person ruled over martin and grube 2000 p 17 decipherment of emblem glyphs was crucial to interpreting political makeup of classic period maya civilization martin and grube 2000 p 18 emblem glyph of motul de san jose contains main sign ik breath or wind it is found on monuments and ceramics from 8th and 9th centuries a vessel bearing this emblem and depicting king lamaw ek was found as far away as altar de sacrificios analysis has revealed that it was manufactured in motul de san jose indicating some form of interaction between these distant sites miller 1999 10 reents budet et al 2007 p 1419 economy majority of basic natural resources were readily available in immediate vicinity of city with local soils being suitable for production of maize and mixed crops to support local populace emery 2003 p 44 subsidiary site of la trinidad de nosotros located on shore of lake peten itza some southeast of site core appears to have been an important port for import and export of goods to and from motul de san jose emery 2003 p 40 food resources not available in immediate vicinity of city were probably provided by satellite sites dispersed at some distance from site core and la trinidad is likely to have played an important part in supplying exotic goods to city as well as freshwater foodstuffs such as crocodiles fish and turtles chert nodules were locally available from first ridges to north of lake a chert workshop has been discovered in northern sector of motul de san jose foias 2003 p 27 ceramic figurines were produced in acropolis palace complex in group c and also in a medium sized palace complex in group b an elite plaza in group e and also in two elite plazas in northern part of site foias 2003 pp 23 27 small satellite site of chak maman tok several kilometers to southwest of motul de san jose appears to have been an important centre for production of chert tools with only a few other centres within maya lowlands manufacturing chert on such a scale although very small chak maman tok probably played a major part within economy of motul de san jose polity moriarty castellanos 2007 p 6 differences in architectural style between elite residential complexes and in activities carried out at them suggest that aristocracy of motul de san jose was divided into several distinct classes including royal family resident in group c royal courtiers and low to middle rank nobles kantetul river although now seasonal is reported to have been a navigable water channel until relatively recently during height of motul de san jose s power it may have provided an important link to san pedro river a significant trade route in ancient times ik style ceramics motul de san jose is possibly source of so called ik style painted polychrome ceramics a theory that has recently received additional support from archaeological excavations at site moriarty 2004 p 21 reents budet et al 2007 p 1417 these ceramic vessels including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels were first associated with then unidentified site of ik in 1970s by emblem glyph included in hieroglyphic texts on them confirmation of motul de san jose as ik came from investigations carried out from 1998 to 2004 chemical analysis of ik style ceramics have revealed that they were not only produced in workshops in motul itself but also in satellite sites in vicinity reents budet et al 2007 p 1420 ik style ceramic corpus includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks one of most distinctive features is realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life something that is very rare in mesoamerican art corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels majority of unknown provenance which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from motul de san jose and its satellite sites subject matter of vessels includes courtly life from peten region in 8th century ad such as diplomatic representations feasting bloodletting scenes of warriors and sacrifice of prisoners of war variations in artistic style and chemical composition of ik style ceramics suggests that they were produced in a number of workshops local to motul de san jose area they have been subdivided into five types four from motul de san jose itself and one from one of its satellite sites there are also various lower quality examples that are presumed to have been manufactured in sites of lesser importance within motul de san jose polity ik style ceramics are believed to have been produced in period from 740 800 ad in spite of differences all ik style ceramics are thought to have been made within a network of allied workshops dedicated to producing vessels for use in banquets of aristocracy of motul de san jose and of petty nobility of capital s satellites ceramics were distributed widely in maya region as gifts in order to seal alliances between elites of various maya kingdoms foias 1999 p 4 of particular note is that chemical analysis of ceramic fragments has revealed that very same workshops not only produced highest quality ik style polychrome ceramics but also general low quality ceramics for household use high quality ik style ceramics made at motul de san jose have been excavated from across maya region including tikal and uaxactun to northeast of city copan far to south and altar de sacrificios tamarindito and seibal in western peten reents budet et al 2007 pp 1418 1419 valdes et al 1995 p 421 a particularly rare feature found on motul de san jose ceramics is so called x ray style showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it all other representations using this rare style are depicted on late classic sculptures at sites with which it is known that motul de san jose had contact at this time including dos pilas machaquila tikal and yaxchilan this x ray style has been found on at least nine painted vessels from motul de san jose and is also used on west side of stela 2 velasqeez garcia 2007 pp 15 17 occupation and diet motul de san jose was occupied from middle preclassic right through to early postclassic however height of city s occupation was late classic moriarty 2005 p 440 settlement density averages 250 structures per square kilometer 650 structures per square mile in site s monumental core 125 structures per square kilometer 325 structures per square mile in city s suburban area and 79 structures per square kilometer 205 structures per square mile in site s periphery emery 2003 p 39 motul de san jose s likely resource catchment zone probably extended between around site core and included a number of satellite sites including kantetul la trinidad de nosotros akte buena vista chachaklum and chakokot this region also includes two major water sources in form of lake peten itza to south and kantetul river to north area around city included a variety of soils suitable for agriculture with 20 of this being very fertile soil highly suited to agriculture just over 50 of area was very fertile but required high maintenance consisting of either fertilization or crop rotation and 14 being low fertility soil consisting of lowland clay and suitable only for maize or being left soil analysis has revealed that maize was not only grown in peripheral areas but also close to residential areas throughout motul de san jose emery 2003 pp 36 37 archaeological investigations have revealed that diet of inhabitants of motul de san jose included dogs canis familiaris turtles including pond sliders trachemys scripta and mesoamerican river turtles freshwater snails mostly but also jute snails spp white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus red brocket mazama americana a species of small deer white lipped peccary rabbits sylvilagus spp lowland paca central american agouti punctata and nine banded armadillos dasypus novemcinctus emery 1998 pp 66 68 71 foias 2000 p 777 emery 2003 p 38 thornton emery 2007 p 1463 only dog had been domesticated by late classic maya so majority of protein in diet of inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within catchment area around city most common food animals were white tailed deer river clam and river turtle emery 2003 p 38 some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation such as those of jaguar ocelot or other small feline and crocodile crocodilus spp these latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs freshwater snails were more an ingredient in diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with elite residents of city emery 1998 pp 67 68 among motul de san jose and its most important satellite la trinidad de nosotros majority of remains from trinidad were from aquatic species while at motul de san jose majority were from terrestrial species 10 of animal remains from motul had been modified to form artefacts compared with only 4 of animal remains at trinidad artefact remains found at la trinidad de nosotros were more likely to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at motul de san jose they were more likely to be artefacts at end of their usable life aquatic animal products arriving at motul de san jose were far more likely to be consumed by elite than by commoners whether used as food or to craft artefacts thornton emery 2007 pp 1466 1469 history preclassic period middle preclassic motul de san jose was first settled between 600 and 300 bc in latter portion of middle preclassic period when it was probably a fairly small site at this time some of its satellite sites were also settled including la trinidad de nosotros and buena vista both of which would have been small villages at this time and they may have been settled even earlier in middle preclassic between 800 and 600 bc moriarty 2004 pp 37 38 late preclassic although investigation of preclassic remains is difficult at motul de san jose due to overlying late classic construction it is evident that site experienced major growth during late preclassic 300 bc ad 300 and became a sizeable centre at roughly same time most of major structures were built at akte and chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during late preclassic in contrast buena vista appears to have been lightly occupied la trinidad de nosotros also underwent major expansion in late preclassic and became larger and more important than motul de san jose with its architectural layout being finalised in this period later classic period construction was superimposed upon pre existing late preclassic structures moriarty 2004 p 38 classic period although motul de san jose had begun to refer to tikal as its overlord in late 4th century drew 1999 p 201 by 7th century various hieroglyphic texts mention that it was under dominion of calakmul tikal s greatest enemy before again coming under power of tikal in early 8th century reents budet et al 2007 p 1421 early classic early classic ceramic finds are scarce at motul de san jose and those that have been found were a minor component in mixed fill deposits this suggests that motul de san jose was largely abandoned in early classic best examples of early classic pottery come from outside of motul de san jose itself with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during construction of a modern language school in trinidad de nosotros and some fragments of early classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at in late 4th century motul de san jose began to refer to tikal as its overlord late classic motul de san jose experienced its second major peak in occupation during late classic period between ad 600 and ad 830 most of major architecture at site was built during this surge in activity and city reached its maximum size motul de san jose became one of three most important cities around lake peten itza and was approximately same size as tayasal while it was slightly smaller than ch ich there was renewed growth in city s satellite sites chakokot reached its peak population and most of its residential complexes were built in late classic buena vista experienced only light occupation at this time major construction work took place at akte including building of principal platform and its causeway it also appears that rulers of akte erected several stelae la trinidad de nosotros took on its final form and most of its major architecture was built at this time including mesoamerican ballcourt major residential complexes four plazas and port facilities in 8th century ad city had important relationships with maya cities to southwest especially in petexbatun region and on pasion and usumacinta rivers including seibal on pasion altar de sacrificios near where pasion becomes usumacinta and dos pilas aguateca tamarindito arroyo de piedra and cueva de sangre all five in petexbatun region reents budet et al 2007 p 1420 velasqeez garcia 2007 p 22 it is possible that widespread distribution of ik style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in petexbatun region may be linked to military defeat of motul de san jose by dos pilas with these high quality ceramics forming a part of tribute payment made to petexbatun kingdom velasqeez garcia 2007 p 23 foias 2003 p 19 after its defeat at hands of petexbatun kingdom motul de san jose no longer erected sculpted stelae but history of site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in texts on ik style ceramics foias 2003 p 19 politics thumb right lady wak tuun of motul de san jose married yaxun b alam iv of yaxchilan here she is depicted performing a bloodletting rite in ad 755 yaxchilan lintel 15 now in british museum trustees of british museum in late classic period motul de san jose was located between two mutually hostile powers great city of tikal to north and breakaway kingdom of petexbatun to southwest which had become a vassal of tikal s implacable enemy calakmul in mesoamerica such border states as motul de san jose became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage this seems to be case at motul de san jose with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to politically motivated banqueting that took place in city in 8th century although motul de san jose was capital of ik polity aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within political hierarchy of state while remaining subordinate to ruling lord of capital city during 7th century ad motul de san jose is recorded in hieroglyphic inscriptions as being a vassal of calakmul by early 8th century city had switched its allegiance to jasaw chan k awiil i king of tikal then falling under power of petexbatun itself a vassal of calakmul in middle of 8th century before once again switching its allegiance to tikal in 711 jasaw chan k awiil i lord of tikal was recorded as overlord of motul perhaps reflecting tikal s traditional overlordship of city martin grube 2000 pp 45 46 in spite of these shifting alliances motul de san jose acted with a degree of independence and was a powerful kingdom in 8th century ad with its ruler using title given to high kings city s rulers became very successful on political scene in wider maya region with use of politically motivated feasting war economics and political marriages reents budet et al 2007 pp 1421 1422 velasquez garcia 2007 p 15 there is a glyphic record that sometime before 731 a lord of motul was captured by a lord ruler b of machaquila mathews willey 1991 p 63 in 740 machaquila attacked motul de san jose hieroglyphic stairway 3 at dos pilas records that in 745 a lord of motul was captured by k awiil chan k inich of dos pilas martin grube 2000 p 62 in middle of 8th century ad motul de san jose was closely allied with important city of yaxchilan on usumacinta river as demonstrated by fact that king of yaxchilan yaxun b alam iv bird jaguar iv who ruled from 752 to 768 took two wives from motul de san jose they are named in inscriptions at yaxchilan as lady wak tuun and lady wak jalam chan ajaw martin grube 2000 p 129 tuszynska 2009 p 9 tuszynska argues that these two ladies named at yaxchilan may not have been wives of yaxun b alam iv at all but may have been wives of subordinate lords lady wak jalam chan ajaw is shown preparing her husband for a battle that took place in 755 on yaxchilan lintel 41 now in british museum in london martin grube 2000 p 129 in fact alliance with yaxchilan may date further back to early 8th century since yaxchilan lintel 25 dedicated in ad 723 used so called x ray style of imagery that is closely associated with motul de san jose polity velasqeez garcia 2007 p 19 however relations with yaxchilan were not always peaceful and hieroglyphic

terminal classic motul de san jose underwent a major decline in population at end of classic period between ad 830 and ad 1000 and construction also suffered terminal classic ceramics are common but limited to major centres of motul de san jose itself and its principal satellite la trinidad de nosotros although it declined construction did not halt occupation at group d in site core continued while late classic structures at la trinidad de nosotros were modified in terminal classic there is little evidence for terminal classic occupation at smaller satellite sites moriarty 2004 p 39 an inscription dating to ad 830 mentions last known ruler of machaquila which may be evidence of a long standing relationship between two sites culbert 1996 p 63 if this is case then machaquila appears to have been dominant city out of two seibal stela 10 dating to roughly 849 ad has an inscription naming kan ek as ruler of motul de san jose which is recorded as being one of four paramount polities

not well understood for postclassic period it is known that there was a moderate occupation of area during early postclassic period between ad 1000 and ad 1250 early postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at motul de san jose and all of its satellite sites but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited la trinidad de nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of best examples of early postclassic ceramics there is little evidence of occupation in motul de san jose area during late postclassic from ad 1250 to

pyramids in group c and northeast of acropolis like other groups it consists of various structures laid out around a plaza group includes two palaces including one on west side of plaza that has been badly damaged by looters foias 2000 p 775 foias 2003 p 22 a pyramid is situated on east side of group d plaza a looters trench that was cut into pyramid revealed earlier levels of construction consisting of well made stone blocks archaeological investigation of looters tunnel revealed that looters had probably plundered a high ranking noble or royal tomb items recovered from looted tomb included polychrome ceramic fragments 10 pieces of jade beads 77 pieces of shell beads 20 jade mosaic fragments 145 shell mosaic fragments 98 pyrite mosaic fragments a shell necklace and a stingray spine human bones in tomb had been painted red presence of royal tomb suggests either that palaces in group d were royal residences or those of priesthood dedicated to rituals of dead king foias 2003 p 23 occupation of group d dates as far back as middle preclassic period foias et al 1999 p 35 group d was occupied as late as terminal classic when a termination ritual was apparently performed after which northern building of group was abandoned ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of south entrance to building and then possibly burning building itself rubbish is presumed to have come from area of group d itself and included some items associated with weaving and manufacture of paper south structure in group d had a patio with two circular columns an architectural style that is characteristic of terminal classic period group e group e is second largest group at motul de san jose after group c it is situated to west of groups c and d group includes two pyramids measuring and high both have been looted and taller pyramid being located north of smaller pyramid residential groups lie to south and east of pyramids they are made up of three to four rectangular structures laid out around small central plazas structures are all less than high two palaces investigated in group e are architecturally quite different from palaces in groups c and d a notable feature is that their doors possess projecting corners western structure has a vaulted room with a central bench and also a cross shaped exterior bench walls of structure still stand high north structure s walls stand high and its western room had been divided in two by placement of vertical stone slabs this north structure did not possess any interior benches it may be that different architectural styles of group e and other main groups at motul de san jose result from their association with different lineages each with its own style group e is distinguished by a long avenue known as north south avenue with residential groups on east side on west side avenue is bordered by a high wall northern end of avenue terminates at a small temple while south ends at plaza b stelae thumb

base of stela was still in situ two other large fragments were lying on surface and more than 100 smaller fragments were collected stela appears to have shattered when it fell some time after motul de

similar to stela 1 from dos pilas with both depicting ruler in an identical position stela appears to have been a relatively late addition to plaza and dates to late postclassic period deter wolf

situated northwest of motul de san jose and is known for its sculptured monuments moriarty 2005 p 444 centre of akte covers an area of and includes 32 structures on a high artificially landscaped hill with a number of other structures scattered through surrounding area moriarty 2004 p 33 moriarty 2005 p 444 hill supporting site core overlooks rivers akte and kantetul main periods of occupation date to late preclassic and late classic with further occupation in terminal classic and early postclassic moriarty 2005 pp 444 5 overall area of akte is probably larger than that of trinidad de nosotros covering a area but this includes less structures than at trinidad with small residential groups widely scattered on hilltops around site core main residential complex at akte rests upon a platform and contains three patios with other residential groups clustered around east south and west side of platform s base a small temple is located on east side of north patio akte may have served as a rural administrative centre or perhaps as a royal estate of motul de san jose elite moriarty 2004 p 36 seven sculpted monuments have been found at akte an unusual number for such a small site if these monuments were originally erected at akte then this may mean that site was actually outside of motul de san jose polity archaeological investigations of stelae carried out in 2003 were unable to determine if monuments had been moved to akte or not stela 1 is best preserved monument at akte moriarty 2004 p 35 it is badly eroded and can be dated by a damaged long count date inscribed on back which dates it to end of 7th century or beginning of 8th moriarty 2005 p 445 front of stela bears representation of a standing divine lord with attributes typical of late classic stela 2 is badly damaged being broken into a number of fragments stela 3 had a cache of 44 pieces of obsidian buried near its base buena vista buena vista lies to southwest of site core and from northwest shore of lake peten itza moriarty 2005 p 443 castellanos cabrera 2008 p 3 13 structures have been mapped situated around a small plaza with a small temple on east side moriarty 2005 p 443 site is located on a hilltop and was once much larger but has been partially covered by modern development of nuevo san jose structures 4 and 8 have been investigated revealing that buena vista was probably occupied from middle preclassic through to late classic with a much reduced population in early postclassic site was surveyed in 2000 and preliminary excavations took place in 2001 castellanos cabrera 2008 p 2 main pyramids of motul de san jose are visible from buena vista as is a large part of lake castellanos cabrera 2008 p 3 buena vista has fairly good soil and surviving portions of site are currently used for milpa cultivation moriarty 2004 p 37 earliest ceramic evidence excavated at buena vista dates to very end of early preclassic period indicating that site was initially settled at transition between early and middle preclassic periods castellanos cabrera 2008 p 10 long occupational history of buena vista may be linked to its proximity to chert rich hills excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to production of tools together with dumps of waste flakes buena vista features an early architectural style that differs from that at motul de san jose consisting of platforms built from unworked stone with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures they were built in middle to late preclassic periods and then reused in late classic differences in style between buena vista and motul probably results from differing epochs of construction group a is arranged around main plaza castellanos cabrera 2008 p 5 group b is located a little to southeast and contains structures 11 to 14 castellanos cabrera 2008 p 23 structure 1 is east pyramid it is located on hillside a short distance from rest of mounds it was a high late classic funerary structure containing a looted tomb from summit of this temple both lake peten itza and twin temples of group c at motul de san jose are visible structure 4 is north structure it dates to late classic but overlies construction dating to middle preclassic a stairway ascended front of building under which were found remains of late classic polychrome ceramics perhaps belonging to a pre construction ritual offering stucco floors on top of mound supported asymmetric walls that perhaps date to postclassic period being associated with a mix of late classic and postclassic pottery structures 7 8 and 9 were long low rectangular platforms they measure long by wide and high they had perishable roofs and date to late classic although structures 7 and 8 may overlie middle preclassic remains chachaklum chachaklum also spelt um is situated east of site core and may also have formed a part of motul de san jose polity emery 2003 pp 34 35 it is a large site covering over an area that includes over 141 structures chachaklum includes a small ceremonial centre where a possible e group has been identified site is located in an area of savanna with poor soils considered unsuitable for growing of maize somewhat at odds with settlement density of site contrast between settlement density and poor soils has highlighted need for further research into maya agriculture in a savanna environment chachaklum was a relatively large site of secondary rank within motul de san jose polity moriarty castellanos 2007 p 5 chachaklum s principal phase of occupation appears to date to terminal classic period during 10th and 11th centuries ad however site possesses massive basal platforms and these together with presence of e group suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from first excavations of site further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in late preclassic period and continuing right through to late classic chak maman tok la estrella chak maman tok is a very small site located southwest of motul de san jose and about from buena vista site includes a small number of mounds spread along hillside overlooking lake peten itza site was investigated by archaeologists in 2005 and 2006 although site is very small it seems to have been an important centre for production of high quality chert tools and one of major manufacturers of chert tools in peten lowlands with considerable economic importance within motul de san jose polity site has been severely damaged by modern construction with chert deposits being reused as construction material chakokot chakokot is located to east of main plaza moriarty 2005 p 441 it occupies an area of and consists of 59 structures widely dispersed around a small plaza upon flat summit of a high hill moriarty 2004 p 36 moriarty 2005 p 441 principal occupation dates from late preclassic and late classic periods soils at chakokot are considered good for agriculture and maize was grown within site itself area between chakokot and motul de san jose is occupied by a bajo or low lying seasonal swamp moriarty 2004 pp 36 37 plaza at chakokot is small and covers an area of about on north and east sides it is bordered by residential groups a square platform is to south and on west by two low parallel structures measuring just high largest structure at chakokot is a tall temple to east of a large residential area bordering plaza on east side moriarty 2004 p 37 moriarty 2005 p 441 most of residential areas at chakokot possess one or more bottle shaped underground storage chambers known as chultunob with 14 having been found as of 2001 because of thick vegetation at site investigators consider that there are probably more to be found these chultunob were closed with disc shaped stone lids many of which were found either still in place or close to aperture of chultun to which it belonged stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water kantetul kantetul is located north of site core ox ool ox ool is located in hill country a few kilometers south of motul de san jose and has fertile soil for agriculture

stretching right through from middle preclassic to early postclassic with two phases of greater activity in early classic around ad 350 and in late classic from ad 650 830 moriarty 2005 p 449 terminal classic occupation was largely limited to lake shore but was fairly dense monumental architecture port and ballcourt all identify la trinidad de nosotros as an important secondary centre within motul de san jose polity additionally site was situated close to a source of chert and probably manufactured chert tools foias 2003 p 28 la trinidad de nosotros has been tentatively identified as xililchi a settlement visited by conquistador martin de ursua after spanish conquest of itza capital noj peten in 1697 but no late postclassic remains have yet been securely identified site is divided into two areas site core is located on a hill above lake and with a good view across it second area is spread along lake shore and hillside leading to site core site core has at least 80 structures arranged around five plazas majority of structures are residential in nature but la trinidad has an unusual amount of ceremonial architecture for such a small site la trinidad seems to have been an important port for import and export of goods to and from motul de san jose group c is main residential complex of site it has a small shrine at eastern end la trinidad de nosotros has five main plazas within its site core labelled i through to v all of them were resurfaced multiple times between late preclassic and late classic combined surface areas of five plazas cover over with plaza v making up about half of this making it slightly smaller than main plaza at motul de san jose itself moriarty 2004 p 33 structure a 1 is main temple it is a high radial pyramid structure c 1 is an elite residence

closed northern end zone and a small temple adjoining eastern side moriarty 2004 p 33 moriarty 2005 p 448 last phase of construction dates to late classic ballcourt is similar in design to ballcourt on main plaza of dos pilas in petexbatun region no ballcourt has been identified at motul de san jose site itself making presence of one here of especial interest rich deposits were found associated with ballcourt including 21 000 potsherds 239 pieces of obsidian 155 fragments of ceramic figurines and 84 stone tools moriarty castellanos 2007 p 4 group o is a small residential group to west of
