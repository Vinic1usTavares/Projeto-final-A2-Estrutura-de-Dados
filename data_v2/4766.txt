u s navy u s marine corps and uscg agreed to recruit and to train members of their respective women s reserves together using existing navy facilities for recruiting purposes spars would utilize offices of naval officer procurement their first recruiting efforts got underway in december 1942 but they were hampered somewhat by absence of spar recruiting personnel their absence resulted from agreement between navy and uscg whereby spars would receive its first personnel by transfer from waves a total of 15 wave officers and 153 wave enlisted women requested and were discharged from waves to become first spars eventually spar officers were assigned to most of naval officer procurement offices recruiting information about spars was disseminated with waves publicity materials and it was

uscg districts outside country but in late 1944 congress amended law allowing spars to serve overseas for spars this meant hawaii and alaska however only those with good records good physical health a

occasion male guardsmen would make point that uscg had struggled along without women for over 150 years attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility but not all objections were personal or petty many of men simply failed to see need for women in service while others felt it was an unnecessary expense however if women were equal to job men were willing to give
