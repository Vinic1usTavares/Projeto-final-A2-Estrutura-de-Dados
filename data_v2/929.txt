attributed to ten and a half year old mary godwin later mary shelley in a nursery companion 1980 by peter and iona opie don locke supported this view in his biography of william godwin mary s father that same year opie 127 28 locke 215 attribution rested on a 1960 advertisement by a book dealer which printed part of a 2 january 1808 letter from william godwin to an unknown correspondent moskal 397 sunstein 19 dibdin s song refers to popular song by charles dibdin on which poem is based opies wrote that presumption must be that verses godwin printed were those by his daughter opie 128 in 1831 introduction to frankenstein shelley described her early childhood writing as that of a close imitator rather doing what others had done than putting down suggestions of my own mind qtd in moskal 397 however after rediscovery of entire letter doubts emerged regarding this attribution dear sir in midst of our short conversation of yesterday still more pleasant than short you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of thing we desired i am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return to afford you every facility in my power i therefore two scribbles with which i would not otherwise have troubled you that in small writing is production of my daughter in her eleventh year is strictly modelled as ar as her infant talents would allow on dibdin s song this may answer purpose of a prose sketch other is written by a young man of twenty it is rather unintelligible but two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting first two designs more what you shall favour us with shall purely be your own more exquisite i am well satisfied it will be found whole object is to keep up joke of nong tong paw being constantly taken for greatest man in france believe me with a thousand thanks my dear sir very sincerely yours w godwin jan 2 1808 may we send to you at ten or eleven to morrow morning if you should have any thing to communicate should address it to mr hooley 41 skinner street snow hill it will reach me in safety qtd in sunstein 19 20 complete letter suggests that small writing was a prose piece although sunstein former owner of letter which is now held by carl h pforzheimer collection of shelley and his circle argues that wording is open to interpretation moskal 397 and 399 note 6 she claims that read in its entirely letter indicates that mary godwin wrote initial revised text for nongtongpaw but not final version sunstein 19 she argues that mary godwin s revision was usable for a prose sketch does not necessarily mean that she wrote it in prose sunstein 20 21 according to jeanne moskal one of editors of most recent definitive edition of mary shelley s works it can be deduced from letter and corroborated by other circumstantial evidence uncovered by sunstein that correspondent had been invited to write a new version of dibdin s song and that correspondent and composer of 1808 text were therefore one and same moskal 397 98 sunstein points to a meeting between godwin and a j taylor as well as godwin s publication of another of taylor s works as evidence of his involvement sunstein 21 significance mounseer nongtongpaw represents beginning of mary shelley s collaborative writing career although it is no longer possible to reconstruct her actual contributions her sketch was given to author of published work as a way to inspire him what precisely he drew from that text is however unknown moskal 398 sunstein 22 notes bibliography mounseer nongtongpaw new york public library digital gallery new york public library 31 july 2007
