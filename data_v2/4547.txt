bosnia in 1831 and 1850 crushing local feudal lords and set of modernising reforms known as tanzimat began to be implemented in province christians were underprivileged in ottoman empire and this was even more so in bosnia than in rest of empire an improvement in this respect occurred in 1862 when bosnian christians orthodox serbs and catholic croats were granted more rights including those to open new churches and to run their own schools this came after several uprisings by christians especially serbs who had strongest national movement in province ivan franjo and other bosnian franciscans requested right to establish a printing house in 1847 1850 1853 and 1857 but each time their requests were denied by ottoman government reforms became firmly rooted in bosnia during 1860s when ottoman governor vali of province was topal sherif osman pasha though most of changes proceeded at a slow pace according to recently issued ottoman constitutional law each vilayet first order administrative division was to have an official printing house and an official gazette constitutional law for vilayet of bosnia published in 1865 promoted province from rank of eyalet to that of vilayet and article 9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital osman pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house at that time press in principality of serbia and in south slavic parts of austrian empire sharply criticised ottoman regime in bosnia textbooks imported from serbia for serb elementary schools in bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment which osman pasha saw as anti ottoman in his view national movement of serbs in bosnia presented a danger for ottoman state interests to protect their hold on bosnia ottomans sought to promote idea of a unitary bosnian nation thus counteracting particular national identities and political aspirations of bosnia s serbs croats and muslims history and publications under sopron thumb right topal sherif osman pasha shortly after constitutional law for vilayet of bosnia was issued osman pasha invited publishing magnate ignjat sopron to sarajevo sopron was owner and

be published in bosnia and herzegovina sopron made a deal with vilayet s authorities to publish it independently from official gazette when sopron presented editorial policy of his newspaper to authorities he indicated that it would be printed in serbian language much to ottomans displeasure authorities subsequently scratched serbian and replaced it with bosnian sopron accepted revision and went along with osman pasha s idea of promoting a unitary bosnian nation nevertheless bosanski vjestnik had a decidedly serb orientation sopron did not consider this contradictory as he apparently
