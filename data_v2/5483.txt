global financial centres index ranks manila 97th in world etymology maynila filipino name for city comes from phrase may nila which translates to where indigo is found nila is derived from sanskrit word nila which refers to indigo and by extension to several plant species from which this natural dye can be extracted maynila name is more likely in reference to presence of indigo yielding plants growing in area surrounding settlement rather than maynila being known as a settlement that trades in indigo dye this is because settlement was founded several hundred years before indigo dye extraction became an important economic activity in area in 18th century native tagalog name for indigo plant tayum or variations thereof actually finds use in another toponym within manila area where indigo plant is and elsewhere in philippines e g tayum abra davao del norte maynila was eventually adopted into spanish as manila may nilad 120px thumb left plate depicting nilad plant scyphiphora from augustinian missionary fray francisco manuel blanco s botanical reference flora de filipinas an antiquarian and inaccurate etymology asserts origin of city s name as may nilad where nilad is found here nilad is taken to be name for one of two littoral plant species popularly but incorrectly water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes which still grows on banks of pasig river to this day however it is a recent introduction to philippines from south america and therefore could not have been plant species referred to in toponym correctly a shrub like tree scyphiphora formerly ixora manila blanco found in or near mangrove swamps this tree is actual species that tagalog terms nilad or refer to from a linguistic perspective it is unlikely for native tagalog speakers to completely drop final consonant d in nilad to arrive at present form maynila as an example nearby bacoor still retains final consonant of old tagalog word elevated piece of land even in old spanish renderings of placename e g historians ambeth ocampo and joseph baumgartner have also found that in all early documents place had always been written without final d thereby making may nilad etymology spurious misidentification of nilad as source of toponym appears to originate from an 1887 essay written by trinidad pardo de tavera in which he wrote nila as both referring to indigofera true indigo and to ixora manila actually nilad in tagalog early 20th century writings such as those of julio julio a suggestion to to elucidate origin of name of capital city of philippines manila which of these three
