chapter books wrote a poem about a new haircut after seeing a friend s sketch of a teenager he sold it after being asked if he had any books about life of a normal african american boy being barnes first picture book he gave particular thought about how to divide up his poem across pages after being rejected by several other illustrators barnes unusually for children s picture books approached james directly who he knew to do illustrations barnes describes their connection as meant to be with james noting i think key is that our artistic styles really complement each other for barnes word fresh might be generally seen as dated but for him had a timeless quality when applied to a haircut in black community barnes reflected on his own feeling of independence and being best version of myself after leaving barber barnes was concerned that in converting poem to book form it would lose its meaning as it was spread across pages of a picture book themes and illustrations critics noted unique subject matter for a 2018 picture book having a contemporary african american protagonist partake in a setting of importance to african american culture and way book could introduce audiences to a variety of haircuts with which they might not have been familiar several critics affirmed barnes author s note by noting that barbershop was one of few institutions besides church which celebrates and honors african american boys this celebration of boy helped to reinforce book s theme of self confidence and pride however it was not just a celebration of boys but all african americans even women as boy imagines who else is sharing barbershop with him title itself is an allusion to hats african american women will wear to church this is all underscored by barnes rhythmic text brimming with cool illustrations after reading poem cover came easily to james who drew inspiration from attitude of boy narrator at end of book his goal was to impress and excite people who opened book and have them feel that they were looking at fine art or even photographs after doing thumbnail drawings james painted with oils on illustration board barnes son silas served as model for boy in book while barber is based on james son s barber james oil color illustrations drew comparisons to that of basquiat thanks to detailed realistic portraits which included a variety of unique and
