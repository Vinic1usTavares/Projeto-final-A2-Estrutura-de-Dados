global warming with a key gameplay mechanic being player character using to navigate a coastal city later team became interested in concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned game accordingly although game director jean maxime moris was reluctant to set game in paris since studio was based there it was originally developed as a role playing game with sony publishing it exclusively for playstation 3 starting full development in february 2010 following creative disagreements between dontnod and sony and subsequent cancellation of project in february 2011 because of budget cuts project was presented at 2011 gamescom trade fair in hope that it would garner attention necessary to secure another publishing deal capcom purchased intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for project reimagining it as an action adventure game for release on multiple platforms game s theme was inspired by social network sites that abound in modern world with facebook tumblr and twitter cited as examples moris explained that while some elements looked fantastical game was grounded in real world in terms of how social networking might evolve over coming decades remember me was considered to be digital view of human identity compared to dontnod s life is strange its analogue counterpart game was influenced by classic cyberpunk anime such as akira and ghost in shell and one of literary works referenced in game is george orwell s novel nineteen eighty four when asked in an interview why he made protagonist a woman moris replied that he wanted a game in cyberpunk genre that was more about emotion intimacy identity and way technology would intersect those so it made more sense for player character to be a woman however when game was shown to potential publishers many were discouraged from backing project saying that a male character would be more successful music was composed by olivier deriviere who recorded score with a 70 piece orchestra then modified and changed it using electronic equipment in an interview with game informer deriviere said during my first contact with game i was quite confused by so much information and i felt music should reflect this confusion deriviere disclosed that players would not hear main theme until end of game given that it is scattered in pieces through rest of score to reflect nature of game and story of nilin for his work deriviere was awarded 2013 award for best original score for a video game or interactive media remember me was created with unreal engine 3 to lessen workload involved in making a new intellectual property with a nascent studio of just under 100 employees to evaluate engine dontnod collaborated with epic games engineering team at various stages during production reception remember me received mixed or average reviews according to metacritic in 2017 daily telegraph named remember me one of best cyberpunk video games world design soundtrack and plot were praised while aspects of story design choices and combat were criticised edge staff lauded nilin as a powerhouse of a protagonist for possessing a blend of character traits that made her instantly likeable and story of reclaiming her lost memories was praised as well puzzles were said to be fresh and thought provoking eurogamers tom bramwell appreciated dontnod s work on refreshing combat system he felt memory remix sequences were absorbing and said portrayal of technology being abused was handled well according to ben reeves of game informer remember mes memory remixes constituted highlight of game and soundtrack was also subject to enjoyment kevin vanord at gamespot was satisfied with main character calling her a great heroine who is both powerful and vulnerable premise and general setting were commended with musical soundtrack appraised as superb ryan taljonick at gamesradar wrote favourably of city setting and noted that it was rich in detail taljonick agreed that memory remix held most excitement of all features in game justin speer of gametrailers thought remember me presented its concept with fascinating and ridiculous elements while manipulation of minds with memory remix was described as rewarding ign s daniel krupa admired ambition of game neo paris was considered vibrant and distinctive and as with rest of reviewers he praised ability to remix memories ludwig kietzmann at joystiq approved of nilin s power to manipulate memories wishing that there were more opportunities to use it staff writing for opm uk opined that futuristic setting was astonishing and visually arresting arthur gies of polygon endorsed game world story and protagonist as its most positive aspects he argued that combo modification system set apart an otherwise predictable combat system gies felt soundtrack deserved recognition for its well written and unique style which he thought complemented central theme conversely edge staff complained that characters other than nilin were weaker overall design of pressens combos was thought to be flawed as rate at which one unlocks them was too slow to use them until final hours of game though bramwell found engagement in first few hours he said that later parts of story suffered from too many science fiction elements absence of external motivation for main character was also disparaged reeves was dissatisfied with characters whose world he said was more interesting than they were and story was berated for being uninspired vanord observed that game was held back by an unfulfilling story and sub par level design dialogue and metaphors were criticised for dimming story s potential taljonick also disliked dialogue with overwhelming jargon noted as one of its chief offences exploration was deemed restrictive level design claustrophobic and combat system stiff krupa was unimpressed with action which he felt lacked variation and was not well executed his delight in setting led to disappointment with limited exploration of it lack of memory remixes received reproval as well kietzmann declared remember me as a listless and mediocre action game whose appearance held more value than its performance and objected to combat for being stilted and void of excitement playstation official magazine uk staff became quickly disenchanted with game as it delved into generic fighting sales game became a capcom platinum title with more than 1 million copies sold its inclusion on playstation plus accumulated more than two million players causing it to become second most downloaded playstation plus title in europe
