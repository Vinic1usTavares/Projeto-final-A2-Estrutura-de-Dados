world freely tasks include collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or solving puzzles and side quests for rewards world is unstructured and designed to reward experimentation and story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion development of breath of wild lasted five years wanting to reinvent series nintendo introduced elements such as a detailed physics engine high definition visuals and voice acting monolith soft known for their work in open world xenoblade chronicles series assisted in designing landscapes and topography game was planned for release in 2015 as a wii u exclusive but was delayed twice due to problems with physics engine breath of wild was a launch game for switch and final game published by nintendo for wii u two downloadable content packs were released later in 2017 breath of wild received acclaim for its open ended gameplay and attention to detail and has been cited as one of greatest video games of all time critics called it a landmark in open world design despite minor criticism for its technical performance at launch it won numerous awards including several game of year honors by 2019 breath of wild had sold over 16 04 million copies worldwide making it bestselling zelda game a sequel was announced at e3 2019 gameplay thumb 250px left players are free to explore world of breath of wild using a variety of tools for example by jumping from a high elevation and deploying his paraglider link can travel distances quickly alt an in game screenshot of protagonist link paragliding across a vast world breath of wild is an action adventure game set in an open world environment where players are tasked with exploring kingdom of hyrule while controlling link in terms of structure breath of wild encourages nonlinear gameplay which is illustrated by game s lack of defined entrances or exits to areas scant instruction given to player and encouragement to explore freely breath of wild introduces a consistent physics engine to zelda series letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution game also integrates a chemistry engine that defines physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with player and one another for example players may take advantage of game s dynamic weather by throwing metal objects at enemies during thunderstorms to attract a lightning strike however level of realism offered in chemistry engine also means that players will equally attract an unavoidable fatal lightning strike if wearing any metal during thunderstorms these design approaches result in a generally unstructured and interactive world that rewards experimentation and allows for nonlinear completion of story as link players can perform actions such as running climbing swimming and gliding with a paraglider although link is limited by his stamina link can procure items from environment including weapons food and other resources unlike previous zelda games weapons and shields will degrade over time many items have multiple uses for example wooden weapons and armor can be set to light fires or collect incoming enemy arrows and shields can be used as makeshift players can obtain food from hunting animals gathering wild fruit or collecting parts of defeated enemies by cooking combinations of food or materials player can create meals and elixirs that can replenish link s health and stamina or provide temporary status bonuses such as increased strength or weather resistance an important tool in link s arsenal is sheikah slate which can be used to mark waypoints on a map and as an in game camera over course of game link can collect powers to add to slate including remote bombs ability to manipulate metal objects form ice blocks on watery surfaces and temporarily stopping objects in time in combat players can lock onto targets for more precise attacks while certain button combinations allow for advanced offensive and defensive moves players may also defeat enemies without weapons such as rolling boulders off cliffs into enemy camps besides exploration players can undergo quests or challenges to obtain certain benefits activating towers and shrines adds waypoints that player may warp to at any time activating towers also adds territories to map although location names are not added until player explores that area dotted throughout hyrule are shrines that contain challenges ranging from puzzles to battles against robotic opponents clearing shrines earns spirit orbs which can be traded for additional health or stamina points scattered across hyrule are small puzzles that reveal korok seeds which can be traded to expand inventory size for weapons shields and bows towns serve as hotspots for quests sidequests and shops selling materials and clothing hikers and other travelers offer sidequests hints or conversation additionally players can scan amiibo figures against their console to summon items or call link s horse epona from previous zelda games and wolf link from twilight princess plot breath of wild takes place at end of zelda timeline in kingdom of hyrule 10 000 years before beginning of game evil calamity ganon threatens hyrule but he is defeated by a princess with blood of goddess and with help of her appointed knight hyrule matured into an advanced civilization protected by four divine beasts enormous animalistic machines and an army of guardians autonomous weapons upon ganon s return four great warriors were given title of champion and piloted one of divine beasts each to weaken him while princess knight fought ganon so she can seal him away 9 900 years later kingdom of hyrule had devolved to a medieval state reading their ancestors prophecies recognized signs of ganon s return and excavated divine beasts and guardians during this time zelda trained vigorously to awaken sealing magic needed to defeat ganon champions of hyrule s races warrior of mountainous goron princess of aquatic zora archer of birdlike rito and chief of desert dwelling gerudo assembled to pilot divine beasts while current zelda and link battled ganon however ganon possessed guardians and divine beasts turning them against hyrule king rhoam and champions were killed castle town was destroyed and link was gravely wounded zelda took link to safety hid master sword and used her magic to trap ganon in hyrule castle 100 years after that an amnesiac link awakens in hyrule he meets an old man who reveals himself as spirit of king rhoam rhoam explains that ganon sealed in hyrule castle has grown strong he pleads for link to defeat ganon before he breaks free and destroys world link travels across hyrule returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories with help of hyrulean races he boards four divine beasts and purges them of ganon s monsters releasing spirits of hyrule s former champions and allowing them to pilot divine beasts once again after obtaining master sword from lost woods link enters hyrule castle and defeats ganon with help of divine beasts and zelda s bow of light zelda seals ganon away restoring peace and allowing spirits of king rhoam and champions to depart sensing their presence link and zelda smile fondly if players fulfill certain conditions freeing all four divine beasts retrieving master sword and finding all memories they unlock a secret ending in which zelda realizes that hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and link must begin process themselves as link and zelda survey hyrule and embark to rebuild their world princess confides that she may no longer possess any supernatural power yet still she is happy development thumb upright 8 with breath of wild zelda series producer eiji aonuma sought to rethink series conventions alt an image of eiji aonuma producer nintendo an internal division of nintendo developed breath of wild for nintendo switch and wii u according to series producer eiji aonuma development team aimed to rethink conventions of zelda following release of legend of zelda skyward sword in 2011 aonuma received comments from players who wished to see a more interconnected map to explore locales between gameplay areas in 2013 nintendo experimented with nonlinear open world gameplay in legend of zelda a link between worlds at 2014 electronic entertainment expo aonuma said he planned to reform dungeons and puzzles two of series major gameplay elements and redesign game to allow players to reach end without progressing through story as nintendo had never worked on a modern open world game before they took influence from development of elder scrolls v skyrim prior to full development developers designed a playable 2d prototype similar to original zelda to experiment with physics based puzzles final game uses a modified version of havok physics engine at 2017 game developers conference director hidemaro fujibayashi technical director and art director satoru takizawa held a presentation titled change and constant breaking conventions with legend of zelda breath of wild during which they demoed prototype aonuma called physics engine in breath of wild a major development for zelda series saying that it underpins everything in world and makes things operate in a logical and realistic way allowing players to approach puzzles and problems in different ways he expanded on difficulty in developing this system recalling how one day during development he entered an area in game and found that all objects had been blown away by wind game was built and demonstrated with touchscreen features for wii u but developers found that looking away from main screen distracted from game features were removed when game moved to tandem development across switch and wii u wii u gamepad also affected animation although link is canonically left handed he is right handed in game to match gamepad s control scheme which has its sword swinging buttons on its right side switch version performs better than wii u release when docked to a television although when undocked both run at same resolution switch version also has higher quality environmental sounds aonuma stated that art design was inspired by gouache and en plein air art to help identify vast world game s landscape was based on locations in and around kyoto hometown of game director hidemaro fujibayashi and was partially designed by monolith soft who assisted with topographical level design breath of wild was first main zelda game to use voice acting in cutscenes although link remains a silent protagonist aonuma was affected by first time he heard a character with a human voice in game and wanted to leave a similar impression on players team decided to record voice overs for all cutscenes instead of only key scenes as originally planned nintendo provided voice overs and subtitles in eight languages initially players were not able to mix and match languages of voices and subtitles however nintendo released an update in may 2017 that allowed players to choose voice over language game went gold on february 3 2017 with nintendo holding a wrap party to celebrate coinciding with game s launch in taiwan and south korea in early 2018 nintendo introduced a patch worldwide adding traditional and simplified chinese and korean translations for nintendo switch version original score was composed by manaka kataoka yasuaki iwata and hajime wakai kataoka and wakai had previously worked on zelda games spirit tracks and wind waker respectively soundtrack was primarily written and performed on a piano with a focus on ambient music and sounds rather than melodic and upbeat music in previous zelda games according to wakai this helped add authenticity to environments and was taken on as a challenge by rest of sound team promotion and release aonuma originally teased game for wii u in january 2013 during company s nintendo direct presentation game he

and mechanics perfected in other games and reworks them for its own purposes to create something wholly new but also something that still feels quintessentially like a zelda game it s both a return to form and a leap into uncharted territory and it exceeds expectations on both fronts edge wrote that game world was an absolute and unremitting pleasure to get lost in and that magic of being given all tools in opening hour is knowledge that solution to any problem is already at your disposal and you can always change tack according to kyle orland of ars technica after spending a week utterly immersed in nintendo s open world reimagining of tried and true zelda formula it s hard to return to more formulaic entries of franchise s past journalists commented on unexpected results not intended by developers with serendipitous moments proving popular on social media chris plante of verge predicted that whereas prior open world games tended to feature prescribed challenges zelda would influence a new generation of games with open ended problem solving reviewers lauded sense of detail and immersion kotaku recommended turning off ui elements in praise of indirect cues that contextually indicate same information such as link shivering in cold or waypoints appearing when using scope reviewers also commented on unexpected permutations of interactions between link villagers pets and enemies many of which were shared widely on social media a tribute to former nintendo president satoru iwata who died during development also attracted praise jim sterling was more critical than most giving breath of wild a 7 10 score he criticized difficulty weapon durability and level design but praised open world and variety of content other criticism focused on unstable frame rate
