sinoceratops is an extinct genus of ceratopsian dinosaur that lived approximately 73 million years ago during latter part of cretaceous period in what is now shandong province in china it was named in 2010 by xu xing et al for three skulls from zhucheng china name of its type species sinoceratops zhuchengensis means chinese horned face from zhucheng after location of its discovery sinoceratops was a medium sized built ground dwelling quadrupedal herbivore it could grow up to an estimated length and height and weigh up to it was first ceratopsid dinosaur discovered in china and only ceratopsid known from asia all other centrosaurines and all chasmosaurines are known from fossils discovered in north america except for possibly turanoceratops sinoceratops is also significant because it is one of largest known centrosaurines and is much larger than any other known basal members of this group sinoceratops was discovered in xingezhuang formation which was deposited during late cretaceous it lived alongside saurolophines and tyrannosaurines most common creature in formation was shantungosaurus to which most of material has been assigned animals living alongside sinoceratops and shantungosaurus were zhuchengceratops and zhuchengtyrannus description thumb left size comparison sinoceratops was a larger ceratopsian ornithischian with an estimated length of about weight of and height of about thomas r holtz jr estimated its length at and weight at weight of a rhinoceros it has a short hooked horn on its nose called a nasal horn no horns above its eyes brow horns and a short neck frill with a series of forward curving hornlets that gave frill a crown like appearance inside this row of hornlets there is a series of low knobs on top of frill which are not seen in any other horned dinosaur sinoceratops is a member of short frilled ceratopsids centrosaurinae holotype specimen zcdm v0010 consists of a partial skull with most elements of skull roof and partial braincase skull of sinoceratops is estimated to be long making it one of largest known centrosaurine skulls thumb restoration features that differentiate an animal from most or all others are called a diagnosis some but not all of features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies an autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism according to xu 2010 sinoceratops can be distinguished based on following diagnostic characteristics there are at least ten robust strongly curved hornlike processes along rear margin of combined parietals while at same time at least four hornlike processes on combined are present there is a large accessory fenestra in front of antorbital fenestra differing from all other known centrosaurines external margin of parietals is only weakly undulating differing from all other known centrosaurines and presence of broad based epoccipitals differing from all other known centrosaurines discovery thumb left illustration of known portion of skull holotype specimen zcdm v0010 consisting of a partial skull including a braincase was in summer of 2008 recovered at xingezhuang formation of wangshi group in shandong china specimen was collected in fluvial sediments that were deposited during campanian maastrichtian stages of cretaceous period approximately 72 66 million years ago two other specimens have been recovered from same formation specimen zcdm is a partial skull that consists of skull roof and most of braincase and zcdm represents a partial braincase genus name sinoceratops means chinese horned face and is derived from word sino referring to china from latin sina country of its discovery and greek words keras keras meaning horn and ops ops meaning face sinoceratops was described and named by paleontologist xu xing and colleagues in 2010 type species is sinoceratops zhuchengensis specific name refers to location of its discovery city of zhucheng which also financed excavations discovery was significant because it represented first ceratopsid known from china and possibly only ceratopsid from asia only other possible asian ceratopsid is turanoceratops but recently its identification as a ceratopsid has been questioned classification sinoceratops was assigned to taxon centrosaurinae as a basal member by xu et al 2010 based on characteristics present in skull sinoceratops bears several characteristics that resemble features in chasmosaurines blurring distinction between centrosaurinae and according to xu e a basal position of sinoceratops indicates that originated in asia sinoceratops however shares a number of features with advanced centrosaurines such as centrosaurus and styracosaurus that are not seen in primitive centrosaurines like including a well developed nose horn and reduced brow horns implication might be that this genus represents a lineage that invaded asia from north america through beringia thumb right close up illustration of head cladogram below represents a phylogenetic analysis by chiba et al 2017 paleoecology thumb sinoceratops skeleton mounted as if confronting zhuchengtyrannus sinoceratops is known from xingezhuang formation of southern china it is known from skull material alongside it in formation lived shantungosaurus a very common hadrosaurid to which most of material has been assigned zhuchengtyrannus an asian tyrannosaurid related to tarbosaurus zhuchengceratops an asian and a possible older individual of shantungosaurus other possible remains have been assigned to a probable junior synonym of shantungosaurus and
