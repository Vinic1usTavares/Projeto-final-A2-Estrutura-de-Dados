sleep hygiene is a behavioral and environmental practice developed in late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia but evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is limited and inconclusive clinicians assess sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions such as depression and offer recommendations based on assessment sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule using naps with care not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime limiting worry limiting exposure to light in hours before sleep getting out of bed if sleep does not come not using bed for anything but sleep and sex avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine caffeine and other stimulants in hours before bedtime and having a peaceful comfortable and dark sleep environment assessment assessing sleep hygiene is important to determine whether an individual has inadequate sleep hygiene disorder diagnostic assessment is usually conducted using clinical interview and supplemented by self report questionnaires and sleep diaries which are typically kept from one to two weeks to record a representative sample data there are also computerized assessments such as sleep eval system which can be employed in diagnostic process it features 1 543 possible questions automatically selected according to individual s previous answers practice of sleep hygiene and knowledge of sleep hygiene practices can be assessed with measures such as sleep hygiene index sleep hygiene awareness and practice scale or sleep hygiene self test for younger individuals sleep hygiene can be assessed by adolescent sleep hygiene scale or children s sleep hygiene scale recommendations clinicians choose among recommendations for improving sleep quality for each individual and counselling is presented as a form of patient education hauri p 2011 sleep wake lifestyle modifications sleep hygiene in tr matheson jk ferber r k eds therapy in

number of physical and mental health deficits and therefore a top sleep hygiene recommendation is allowing enough time for sleep clinicians will frequently advise that these hours of sleep are obtained at night instead of through napping because while naps can be helpful after sleep deprivation under normal conditions naps may be detrimental to nighttime sleep negative effects of napping on sleep and performance have been found to depend on duration and timing with shorter midday naps being least disruptive there is also focus on importance of awakening around same time every morning and generally having a regular sleep schedule activities exercise is an activity that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality people who exercise experience better quality of sleep than those who do not but exercising too late in day can be activating and delay falling asleep increasing exposure to bright and natural light during daytime and avoiding bright light in hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep wake schedule aligned with nature s daily light dark cycle activities that reduce physiological arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended conversely continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed has been shown to delay falling asleep similarly good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep so in such situations a person may be advised to get out of bed and try something else for a brief amount of time generally for people experiencing difficulties with sleep spending less time in bed results in deeper and more continuous sleep so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of bed for any activities except sleep or sex foods and substances a number of foods and substances have been found to disturb sleep due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands avoiding nicotine caffeine including coffee energy drinks soft drinks tea chocolate and some pain relievers and other stimulants in hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians because although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially arousal caused by alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one s quality of resting by decreasing time spent in deep sleep leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime requiring effort to metabolize it all and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime lastly limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to sleep environment arranging a sleep environment that is quiet very dark and cool is recommended noises light and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown to disrupt continuous sleep other recommendations that are frequently made though less studied include selecting comfortable mattresses bedding and pillows and eliminating a visible bedroom clock to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep in 2015 a systematic review of studies on mattresses concluded that medium firm custom inflated mattresses were best for pain and neutral spinal alignment effectiveness sleep hygiene studies use different sets of sleep hygiene recommendations and evidence that improving sleep hygiene improves sleep quality is weak and inconclusive most research on sleep hygiene principles has been conducted in clinical settings and there is a need for more research on non clinical populations strength of research support for each recommendation varies some of more robustly researched and supported recommendations include negative effects of noisy sleep environments alcohol consumption in hours before sleep engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep and trying too hard to fall asleep there is a lack of evidence for effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations including getting a more comfortable mattress removing bedroom clocks not worrying and limiting liquids other recommendations such as effects of napping or exercise have a more complicated evidence base effects of napping for example seem to depend on length and timing of napping in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights there is support showing positive sleep outcomes for people who follow more than one sleep hygiene recommendation while there is inconclusive evidence that sleep hygiene alone is effective as a treatment for insomnia some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep hygiene education in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy practices special populations sleep hygiene is a central component of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia sleep hygiene recommendations have been shown to reduce or eliminate symptoms of insomnia specific sleep disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers college students are at risk of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of resulting effects of sleep deprivation because of irregular weekly schedules and campus environment college students may be likely to have variable sleep wake schedules across week take naps drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments because of this researchers recommend sleep hygiene education on college campuses harvard university for example requires all incoming first year undergraduates to take a short online course on subject before fall semester begins sleep 101 harvard freshmen required to take sleep course before school begins similarly shift workers have difficulty maintaining a healthy sleep wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours shift workers need to be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety but should be timed carefully because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping due to symptoms of low mood and energy individuals with depression may be likely to have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene such as taking naps during day consuming alcohol near bedtime and consuming large amounts of caffeine during day in addition to sleep hygiene education bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep wake schedule but it also has been shown to be effective for treating depression directly especially when related to seasonal affective disorder individuals with breathing difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can be addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep reducing ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep for individuals with allergies or asthma additional considerations must be given to potential triggers in bedroom environment medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways so there must be careful management of asthma controllers and antihistamines implementation sleep hygiene strategies include advice about timing of sleep and food intake in relationship to exercise and sleeping environment recommendations depend on knowledge of individual situation counselling is presented as a form of patient education as attention to role of sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown there has been an increase in number of resources available in print and on internet organizations running public health initiatives include national sleep foundation and division of sleep medicine at harvard medical school both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources such as tips for sleep hygiene instructional videos sleep hygiene self assessments poll statistics on sleep hygiene and tools to find sleep professionals a cooperative agreement between u s centers for disease control and prevention and american academy of sleep medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate national healthy sleep awareness project with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness history while term sleep
