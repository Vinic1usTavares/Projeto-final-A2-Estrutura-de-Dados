taylor v illinois 484 u s 400 1988 is a united states supreme court decision in which court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances even if that hurts defense s case taylor was first case to hold that there is no absolute bar to blocking testimony of a surprise witness even if that is an essential witness for defendant a limitation of broad right to present a defense recognized in washington v texas 1967 taylor was first compulsory process clause case since washington v texas to provide a specific limitation on right of defendants to force their witnesses to testify in that case court construed a defendant s right very broadly in his ability to present a defense here however court restricted that ability to comply with court rules especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both prosecution and defense this decision was reached over dissent of three justices all of whom felt a defendant s case should not be limited based on an error solely by defendant s attorney to list appropriate witnesses background history of discovery rules discovery procedures for defendants began with adoption of state laws in 1920s in following decades courts began instituting new procedures in 1962 for example california supreme court ordered reciprocal discovery rules without an initial law requiring it however a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony but no alibi notice rule was fashioned leading to an unworkable position for both sides in 1974 california supreme court ordered legislature to create discovery system ending state s experiment with judicial discovery rule making in 1970 united states supreme court first set down principles in terms of constitutionality of discovery rules in williams v florida court held that florida s notice of alibi rule did not violate fifth amendment while rule in williams was reciprocal it was not for another three years before court mandated that discovery rules had to be reciprocal as a general principle decision articulated two way street approach that trials be run as a search for truth without either side maintaining poker game secrecy for its own witnesses along with these decisions that were specific to discovery process supreme court broadened general constitutional rights for defendants in 1967 ruling of washington v texas in washington court incorporated compulsory process clause against states holding that constitution is violated by arbitrary rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying despite this court did not rule specifically on whether preclusion sanction was appropriate instead applying constitutional standard for an absolutist state law over next few decades supreme court rejected attempts to review sole constitutionality of a preclusion sanction taylor s trial on august 6 1981 ray taylor was arrested for murder of jack bridges in a fight in chicago in advance of trial prosecutor submitted a request for all defense witnesses in case defense attorney for taylor provided a list of four individuals which did not include witnesses alfred wormley and pam when defendant tried to introduce these witnesses on second day of trial trial judge sanctioned defense for failing to put witness names on original list provided to prosecution therefore it ruled two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify trial judge was specifically frustrated that witness wormley was known to defense prior to trial but was hidden away from prosecution a jury convicted taylor of murder charge and illinois appellate court affirmed it held that when discovery rules are violated trial judge may exclude evidence which violating party wishes to introduce appellate court s ruling further gave trial judge discretion in appropriate remedy in such a case whether to exclude entirely surprise witnesses taylor sought a writ of certiorari to united states supreme court to review his case which was accepted opinion of court 140px thumb right justice john paul stevens wrote majority opinion in taylor v illinois alt justice john paul stevens justice john paul stevens wrote opinion which affirmed decision of illinois appellate court and upheld taylor s conviction he began by addressing position of state of illinois who argued that there is never a compulsory process clause concern when preclusion of a witness is used as a discovery sanction court had held converse view stevens wrote that few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense this strong footing of sixth amendment values forced court to reject state s absolutist argument at same time though court rejected defendant s broad claim that there could never be preclusion of a defense witness stevens wrote that t he compulsory process clause provides defendant with an effective weapon but it is a weapon that cannot be used irresponsibly whole adversarial process would be destroyed stevens argued if either side could simply refuse to follow basic rules of court there are countervailing public interests which weigh against absolute defense position broader idea embedded in opinion was idea that willful misconduct of an attorney lowers truthfulness of proffered testimony in instant case court held that a trial judge could hold presumption that a new witnesses testimony is perjured due to a pattern of discovery violations pattern in taylor s case was a series of two amendments to witness list done in bad faith it would demean high purpose of clause to construe it as encompassing an absolute right to an automatic continuance or mistrial stevens wrote as misconduct of judge towards defense counsel did not implicate sixth amendment s compulsory process clause there was no need to disrupt lower courts decisions further even though defendant was harmed by defense counsel error stevens wrote that such an argument could not excuse counsel s fault despite rejection of taylor s constitutional position court did create framework for a balancing test for lower courts to use in handling future discovery preclusion questions a trial court must balance defendant s interest in a robust defense with i state s interest in efficient justice ii state s interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity iii state s interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules and iv prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant s discovery violation brennan s dissent justice brennan s dissenting opinion was joined by justices marshall and blackmun brennan argued that court s balancing test creates a conflict of interest in every case involving a discovery violation such that a better approach would be to hold that compulsory process clause per se bars discovery sanctions that exclude criminal defense evidence brennan quoted at length from washington v texas a 1967 case which announced broad rights for defendants to present a defense exclusion of criminal defense evidence undermines central aim of our criminal justice system brennan opined because it deliberately distorts record at risk of misleading jury into convicting an innocent person he went on to argue that simple preclusion of a defense witness was too extreme a penalty for a discovery violation to point that it subverts criminal justice by basing convictions on a partial presentation of facts blackmun s dissent justice blackmun wrote a separate one paragraph long dissenting opinion he stressed that state s legitimate interests might well occasion a result different from what should obtain in factual context of present case see also due process clause sixth amendment to united states
