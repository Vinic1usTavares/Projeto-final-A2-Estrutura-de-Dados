petter s tufted tailed rat eliurus petteri is a rodent in genus eliurus found in lowland eastern madagascar first described in 1994 it is most closely related to smaller eliurus grandidieri virtually nothing is known of its natural history except that it occurs in rainforest and is nocturnal and solitary it is threatened by destruction and fragmentation of its habitat and is listed as vulnerable on iucn red list with a head and body length of eliurus petteri is a moderately large species of eliurus its upperparts are gray brown to gray and contrast sharply with white underparts tail tuft a characteristic feature of eliurus is weakly developed skull is delicate and incisive foramina openings in front part of palate are short and narrow incisors are weak taxonomy eliurus petteri was first described in 1994 by american zoologist michael carleton as part of a revision of genus eliurus carleton had only three specimens of new species which had been collected in 1929 1956 and 1963 in close proximity in an area of eastern madagascar specific name honors french biologist francois petter who has contributed to scientific study of in 1998 carleton and steven goodman described a related species eliurus grandidieri from northern highlands of madagascar surprisingly dna sequence data suggest that this species is more closely related to voalavo gymnocaudus than to other species of eliurus however e petteri has not been studied genetically carleton and goodman reported additional occurrences of e petteri though within same general area in 2007 and formally recognized eliurus petteri group including e grandidieri and e petteri as one of five species groups within genus common names petter s tuft tailed rat and petter s tufted tailed rat have been used for this species it is now one of twelve species recognized within eliurus most diverse and widespread genus of native malagasy rodents subfamily nesomyinae description measurements of eliurus petteri and related e

otherwise indicated all measurements are in millimeters except body mass in grams eliurus petteri is a fairly large long tailed species of eliurus that resembles a smaller version of eliurus webbi it is larger than closely related e grandidieri fur is soft and fine upperparts appear gray brown to gray in overall color individual hairs are light gray for most of their length then pale buff and dark brown to black at tip dark guard hairs longer hairs projecting above main fur are present but relatively short underparts are entirely white a feature unique for genus even e grandidieri has dark gray underparts transition between coloration of upper and underparts is sharp vibrissae whiskers on upper lip are long and extend beyond ears when pressed against head in some specimens eyes are surrounded by a dark ring pinnae external ears are dark and appear naked but are covered by fine brown fur on outer and by white hairs on inner surface forefeet are entirely white above but a narrow dark streak is present on hindfeet skin of tail is dark sometimes with some white spots on lower side although tail appears mostly naked it is covered with inconspicuous hairs tail tuft characteristic of genus eliurus is weakly developed and consists of light brown to grayish brown hairs along 25 to 30 of tail closest to tip skull looks delicate interorbital region between eyes is narrow and hourglass shaped and braincase is smooth both lack conspicuously developed ridges and shelves zygomatic arches cheekbones are poorly developed incisive foramina openings in front part of palate are short and narrow bony palate ends at level of back of third upper molars alisphenoid strut a piece of bone at back of skull separating two foramina or openings is absent strut is present in most eliurus but absent in some specimens of e grandidieri subsquamosal fenestrae openings in squamosal bone are fairly large auditory bullae are small incisors are weak and enamel on upper incisors is yellow to light orange root of lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process at back of mandible lower jaw a feature shared only with e grandidieri among species of eliurus distribution and ecology eliurus petteri is known only from a limited area in foothills of eastern madagascar toamasina province where it occurs from above sea level it occurs in close proximity with e minor e tanala and e webbi and is probably sympatric with them information on natural history of e petteri is extremely limited it occurs in lowland rainforest and is probably arboreal or scansorial climbing in vegetation it is nocturnal and solitary and may eat fruits seeds and insects weak incisors suggest to carleton that it eats more fruits and insects than other eliurus conservation status destruction and fragmentation of its habitat are major threats to eliurus petteri which is not known to occur in any protected area furthermore it may be vulnerable to plague transmitted by introduced rodents accordingly it is classified as endangered on iucn red list notes references literature cited category mammals described in 1994 category mammals of madagascar category rodents of africa
