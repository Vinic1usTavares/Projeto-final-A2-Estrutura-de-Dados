1985 86 south west indian ocean cyclone season was first in which meteo france office mfr on reunion tracked cyclones as far east as 90deg e in indian ocean south of equator previously agency s area of responsibility was limited to 80deg e it was an active season with twelve named storms of which five strengthened into tropical cyclone with 10 minute sustained winds of at least 120 km h 75 mph first named storm was tropical storm alifredy which originated in mozambique channel in late december and moved across madagascar however unofficial joint typhoon warning center jtwc tracked a short lived storm in september most of activity occurred in 1986 with four storms in january three of which briefly existed simultaneously on january 10 first of these three tropical storm berobia struck eastern mozambique tropical storm costa was a series of three tropical depressions within same broader system that persisted for 12 days bringing gusty winds and rainfall to mascarene islands strongest storm of season erinesta formed in late january and struck tiny tromelin island decimating native rabbit population erinesta later produced of rainfall in mountainous peaks of reunion one of highest 24 hour rainfall totals at time at cilaos two other storms in february filomena and gista moved southward for their durations and did not significantly impact land in march cyclone honorinina killed 99 people and caused 150 million 1986 usd in damage when it struck eastern madagascar there were two other storms in march iarima and jefotra latter of which brushed rodrigues island with gusty winds final two storms of season krisostoma and lila entered from australian basin in april and may respectively with lila exiting basin to end season on may 10 seasonal summary thumb right satellite image of unofficial september tropical storm during season meteo france office mfr on reunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within basin using satellite imagery from national oceanic and atmospheric administration agency estimated intensity through dvorak technique and warned on tropical cyclones in region from coast of africa to 90deg e south of equator in september 1985 their area of responsibility shifted from 80deg e to current 90deg e although lack of satellite imagery along eastern periphery prevented complete coverage world meteorological organization would later label mfr as a regional specialized meteorological center in 1993 joint typhoon warning center jtwc which is a joint united states navy united states air force task force also issued tropical cyclone warnings for southwestern indian ocean season s twelve named storms was well above average of nine while five tropical cyclones storms attaining maximum sustained winds of at least was average mfr considered tropical cyclone year to begin on august 1 and continue to july 31 of following year by december 1985 water temperatures were cooler than normal across indian ocean however monsoon intensified following month allowing for increased tropical cyclogenesis there were no el nino conditions by march in addition to storms tracked by mfr jtwc followed a short lived tropical storm in september classified as tropical cyclone 01s storm developed on september 23 to east southeast of diego garcia which is an atoll in central indian ocean it failed to intensify beyond peak 1 minute winds of 75 km h 45 mph and after passing south of diego garcia storm dissipated on september 29 south of seychelles systems moderate tropical storm alifredy on december 23 a tropical depression formed in mozambique channel accompanied by spiral rainbands toward center that day system reached peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph and madagascar meteorological service named it alifredy storm moved quickly southeastward toward madagascar high pressures to south prevented much development and alifredy moved ashore near morondava in western madagascar on december 24 at peak intensity while crossing island storm weakened into a tropical depression alifredy emerged into open indian ocean and failed to restrengthen it became extratropical and turned southeastward dissipating on december 27 within westerlies jtwc did not track storm alifredy had little impacts on madagascar morombe reported a peak wind gust of moderate tropical storm berobia intertropical convergence zone itcz spawned a tropical depression in northern periphery of mozambique channel on january 5 near comoros initially still located with itcz system tracked south southwestward although its motion slowed due to a ridge to south it passed near juan de nova island on january 6 producing gusts of by january 7 system began disassociating itself from itcz and it intensified that night madagascar meteorological service named depression berobia which intensified into a moderate tropical storm next day also on january 8 jtwc began classifying storm as tropical cyclone 06s that day berobia began moving to west northwest due to strengthening ridge to south on january 9 storm attained peak winds of 85 km h 50 mph according to mfr jtwc estimated a slightly higher 1 minute peak of 95 km h 60 mph late on january 9 berobia made landfall about 125 km 75 mi north of beira mozambique and it dissipated next day after entering zimbabwe remnants of berobia dropped heavy rainfall in northeastern zimbabwe with a 24 hour peak of severe tropical storm costa tropical storm costa was a series of three different tropical depressions within same broader system that persisted for 12 days east of madagascar all given same name first circulation formed on january 7 between northeast coast of madagascar and agalega later that day madagascar meteorological service named it costa and jtwc labeled it tropical cyclone 05s it moved eastward and later turned to southeast passing near agalega before weakening while moving into itcz another circulation formed to east of costa and original circulation dissipated on january 9 new center moved to west southwest toward st brandon although it was disorganized dissipating on january 11 a third circulation formed on previous day to east becoming a tropical depression with well organized rainbands this third system would last longest originally moving to northeast before curving southeastward on january 12 costa intensified into a moderate tropical storm on next day jtwc upgraded it to equivalent of a minimal hurricane and mfr estimated peak winds of 95 km h 60 mph costa weakened briefly on january 14 while passing about 100 km 60 mi east of rodrigues although it re attained its former peak on next day while accelerating southeastward costa thereafter weakened rapidly and moved erratically toward southwest by january 15 it deteriorated into a minimal tropical storm and meandered for several days on january 19 costa dissipated within flow of westerlies when costa formed it passed near agalega producing wind gusts of storm approached st brandon twice on its first passage costa produced gusts of during a strong rainband later storm dropped of rainfall on rodrigues while producing gusts of tropical cyclone delifinina monsoon was active in early january across indian ocean spawning what would eventually become tropical cyclone delifinina on january 7 jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone to east southeast tropical storm costa however mfr did not classify it initially due to lack of data system had a curved area of convection and organized enough for mfr to designate it tropical storm delifinina on january 10 on same day jtwc upgraded storm to equivalent of a minimal hurricane storm moved generally southward after an initial westward movement delifinina gradually intensified becoming a tropical cyclone on january 13 by that time storm had an eye in center of deep organized convection mfr estimated peak winds of 135 km h 85 mph while jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 205 km h 125 mph subsequently delifinina weakened as it progressed southward after turning to southeast deteriorating storm turned sharply northwestward between two ridges delifinina turned back to east and dissipated on january 19 at nearly same longitude where it formed intense tropical cyclone erinesta satellite imagery indicated that a tropical disturbance formed on january 29 to southwest of diego garcia it moved westward and slowly organized becoming a moderate tropical storm on january 31 on same day jtwc classified storm as tropical cyclone 13s and mauritius meteorological service named it erinesta its track shifted to a slow west southwest trajectory while intensifying jtwc upgraded storm to equivalent of a minimal hurricane on february 1 and mfr upgraded erinesta to tropical cyclone status on next day on february 4 cyclone attained peak winds becoming one of strongest storms in basin in several decades jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km h 130 mph and mfr estimated peak winds of 170 km h 105 mph shortly after erinesta reached peak intensity it passed within of tromelin island storm curved southward due to an approaching trough briefly threatening to strike reunion however a ridge built behind trough bringing storm between east coast of madagascar and mascarene islands erinesta gradually weakened passing west of reunion as a severe tropical storm on february 7 storm accelerated to south southeast and later became extratropical dissipating on february 11 within westerlies passing near tromelin at peak intensity erinesta produced peak wind gusts of before damaging anemometer with peak winds estimated as high as 250 km h 155 mph high winds damaged every building and scientific instrument on island passage of storm killed tromelin s entire rabbit population along east coast of madagascar erinesta produced wind gusts and 24 hour rainfall of at toamasina lastly cyclone passed west of reunion where ten days of precipitation accumulated to at cilaos of which fell over 24 hours 24 hour total there was among highest on record surpassing even cyclone hyacinthe wettest storm on record in one hour erinesta dropped of rainfall which only occurs every two and a half years this helped replenish aquifer levels after two years of drought conditions rains caused 1 in 10 year flooding in portions of island reaching 30 m3 s 1 060 ft3 s at ravine blanche while moving past island erinesta produced peak gusts of in mountainous interior at plaine des cyclone also produced very high waves along coastal roads closing them for four days and damaging guard rails moderate tropical storm filomena in early february an area of disturbed weather persisted around diego garcia although lack of satellite imagery made it difficult to track system at first on february 6 satellite images indicated that a tropical storm formed given name filomena by mauritius meteorological service also on february 6 jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 14s initially storm moved to west although filomena turned southeastward into an area of low pressure storm never intensified beyond winds of 65 km h 40 mph according to mfr however jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 100 km h 65 mph filomena gradually weakened as it progress southward on february 11 system turned westward and later northwest due to a ridge to south having weakened into a tropical depression filomena dissipated on next day severe tropical storm gista on february 18 a circulation formed in mozambique channel based on satellite imagery that day it developed into moderate tropical storm gista early on february 19 jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 19s gista moved generally southward initially moving to southeast toward western madagascar and later curving to southwest bringing it within 100 km 60 mi of coast storm gradually intensified while moving away from country reaching peak 10 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph on january 21 about 120 km 75 mi east of europa island according to mfr gista became extratropical that night although jtwc continued tracking it for several more days according to jtwc gista intensified to equivalent of a minimal hurricane on february 22 to southwest of madagascar and next day reached peak 1 minute winds of 160 km h 100 mph gista accelerated to southeast and dissipated late on february 24 in westerlies while gista was moving along west coast of madagascar it produced peak wind gusts of at maintirano it later produced wind gusts of on europa island tropical cyclone honorinina tropical storm honorinina formed on march 9 to south of diego garcia it moved generally to west southwest due to a ridge to south gradually intensifying on march 12 mfr upgraded honorinina to tropical cyclone status which is equivalent of a minimal hurricane on next day cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150 km h 95 mph while in vicinity of tromelin island although jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 205 km h 125 mph honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40 km 25 mi north of toamasina madagascar with winds of 135 km h 85 mph storm weakened further over land moving southwestward across country it emerged into mozambique channel and became extratropical on march 18 honorinina turned to southeast dissipating on march 23 early in its duration storm produced gusty winds along st brandon and it later brought gusts of on tromelin island however effects were worst in madagascar especially in toamasina near where storm made landfall damage spread along 800 km 500 mi of coastline and reached 100 km 60 mi inland from landfall point with many towns severely affected in toamasina cyclone damaged main port airport and several warehouses resulting in 17 million 1986 usd of lost inventory thousands of houses were damaged leaving 83 885 people homeless a housing program earlier set up after cyclone kamisy in 1984 was extended to help storm victims after honorinina nationwide cyclone killed 99 people and caused 150 million 1986 usd in damage moderate tropical storm iarima while honorinina was intensifying and moving toward madagascar another system was forming on march 13 south southeast of diego garcia at 06 00 utc that day a tropical storm formed although it was not named iarima until next day also on march 13 jtwc began classifying storm as tropical cyclone 26s iarima initially moved southwestward failing to intensify beyond winds of 65 km h 40 mph on march 15 storm turned and accelerated to southeast after an anticyclone formed between iarima and honorinina it subsequently weakened dissipating on march 18 while approaching 90deg e tropical cyclone jefotra an area of low pressure persisted in northeast portion of basin toward end of march on march 27 a tropical depression formed to southeast of diego garcia system moved west southwestward quickly intensifying into a tropical storm mauritius meteorological center named storm jefotra while jtwc designated it as tropical cyclone 27s on march 28 jtwc upgraded jefotra to equivalent of a minimal hurricane and on next day mfr upgraded storm to tropical cyclone status on march 29 jefotra attained its peak intensity jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 195 km h 120 mph and mfr estimated 10 minute winds of 135 km h 85 mph by that time motion shifted more to southwest bringing it 400 km 250 mi east of rodrigues winds on island remained less than storm gradually weakened to tropical depression status by april 2 that day an approaching cold front turned jefotra to southeast and storm became extratropical on april 5 circulation dissipated within cold front severe tropical storm alison krisostoma a tropical low formed in australian basin on april 4 to southwest of sumatra it moved to west southwest without much development steered by a ridge to south it attained gale force winds on april 7 and was named alison by bureau of meteorology in australia bom on next day storm passed just north of cocos islands and bom upgraded alison to equivalent of a tropical cyclone jtwc also classified it as tropical cyclone 28s storm crossed 90deg e into south west indian ocean on april 10 and mauritius meteorological service renamed it krisostoma mfr estimated peak winds of 95 km h 60 mph much less than jtwc 1 minute estimate of 160 km h 100 mph an eastward area of low pressure turned storm to southeast crossing back into australian basin on april 13 on next day storm dissipated jtwc analyzed end of krisostoma as turning back to west southwest without exiting south west indian ocean tropical cyclone billy lila on may 4 a monsoonal low developed southwest of sumatra in australian basin it moved to southeast and intensified into a tropical storm on may 5 given name billy that day jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 32s storm turned to southwest due to a ridge to south crossing 90deg e into south west indian ocean on may 9 at that time mauritius meteorological service renamed storm lila storm curved more to south due to an approaching trough early on may 10 mfr estimated peak winds of 135 km h 85 mph and jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km h 105 mph shortly thereafter lila crossed 90deg e back into australian basin where it was renamed billy storm intensified further before weakening steadily due to wind shear all while accelerating to southeast circulation eventually crossed western australian coast near geraldton on may 14 moving across southwestern australia billy dissipated on may 15 in great australian bight off south australia see also atlantic hurricane seasons 1985 1986
