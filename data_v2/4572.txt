danish bacon and their co operatives were represented by danske slagterier whose uk subsidiary was danish bacon and meat council danske slagterier was absorbed into danish ministry of agriculture and food in 2009 majority of danish bacon is produced through farmer owned co operative danish crown co operative system has low costs because of scale 25 million pigs per year and elimination of need for markets most of production is for export danish pig exports started to uk in mid 19th century when exporting to germany became difficult and have grown ever since despite attempts by uk domestic producers and other importers to compete they have not been able to keep pace with danish modernisation of curing process and increasing centralisation denmark now concentrates on pig production and has moved bacon curing and packing to other countries such bacon is sold as danish somewhat controversially even within denmark itself pigs for uk market were reared separately to a uk specification mostly because of uk concerns over pig welfare in denmark this separation ceased following eu wide of sow stalls in 2013 organisation and output most danish pig farms are members of one of two large farmer owned co operatives which account for 95 of pigs slaughtered largest of these is danish crown which alone accounts for 90 coff et al page 83 all export is through these two co operatives a number of smaller slaughterhouses operate outside this system for domestic supply but none have a licence to export costs are high in denmark and industry there is highly regulated but country has nevertheless developed a competitive advantage through large scale integrated organisation by its co operatives there are no markets or auctions in this system prices are set on a weekly basis by a committee of danske slagterier thus making a large saving on transportation costs as there is less need to move animals around coff et al page 85 about 25 million pigs are slaughtered per year which is 5 pigs for every dane coff et al p 80 pig production is still increasing pig production grew from 17 7 million to 21 4 million in decade up to 2002 and reached 24 7 million in 2004 future growth is planned at 2 per year 75 of this production goes to export history in 19th century denmark s main food export was grain to uk but it was outcompeted by united states and russia and began to switch to pigs and butter from dairy herds coff et al page 84 from 1840 to 1870 grain was almost half of denmark s exports but by 1900 this had fallen to under 3 per cent strandskov pedersen page 45 denmark exported bacon to united kingdom from at least 1847 when of bacon were specially prepared for english market but had no large scale production until 1864 when second schleswig war made export of live pigs to hamburg where up to then they had been slaughtered and cured impossible and denmark was forced to do this locally however export to uk only became significant after germany to whom denmark had been exporting since middle ages erected trade barriers to 1879 and finally banned 1887 import of live pigs lost german market amounted to almost 300 000 pigs per year and denmark desperately needed to find a new market danish imports were welcomed in uk growth in population following industrial revolution meant that country was no longer self sufficient in food but there was an increasing demand from a more affluent working class thumb danish bacon cooking at time british workers on average pay consumed bacon two to three times a week and bacon and eggs became traditional british breakfast this had previously been quite unaffordable for working class by end of 19th century 90 of danish pig exports went to uk and accounted for 20 of total danish exports this made denmark main supplier to uk replacing u s which previously held that position danish bacon still had more than 25 of uk market in 1980s two sources coff et al page 90 strandskov pedersen pages 45 47 co operatives first danish farmer owned co operative bacon factory was established in 1887 there were soon more and by 1897 there were dozens by 1900 co operatives outnumbered private enterprises by this time export of live pigs had almost ceased being replaced by export of pork and bacon strandskov pedersen page 48 there followed intense competition between co operatives and private producers with co operatives eventually winning out co operatives had competition from foreign investors as well as indigenous enterprises first of these was i d koopmann of hamburg who bought and opened new bacon factories in order to get around german ban on live pigs koopmann refused to do business with co operatives calling movement a sick idea they worked closely with denny co of london denny family were a major bacon manufacturer in ireland and between them they controlled a large portion of uk market denny s took over koopmann s when latter got into debt in 1894 denny s never managed to get on top of co operatives but they held on in denmark until 1968 when they finally sold what was left of danish operation to federation of danish co operatives one co operative group and another major foreign player was a competitor of danish co operatives this was english co operative wholesale society cws cws had depots in denmark from 1881 taking advantage of refusal of london dealers to buy from co operatives from 1899 however they started setting up their own manufacturing in denmark production grew until 1930 but then slowly declined and cws started selling up in 1971 strandskov pedersen pages 48 51 52 danish bacon brand first made an appearance in uk when danish bacon agency limited later danish bacon company now a brand of danish crown was set up in port of london by cooperatives in 1902 to handle exports to uk federation of danish co operative bacon factories de danske from 1932 just danske slagterier was formed in 1897 known in uk as danish bacon and meat council latter was responsible for uk marketing activities and promoted danish bacon brand two sources karantininis page 24 danish crown pages 2 6 danske slagterier was absorbed into danish ministry of agriculture and food in 2009 and ceased to exist as a separate organisation strandskov page 754 through a series of mergers and takeovers danish crown became largest co operative and by 2000 controlled vast majority of danish slaughterhouses danish crown history of denmark s slaughterhouses retrieved and archived 29 april 2013 world wars danish bacon exports to uk were interrupted during both world wars during world war one cause was shortage of imported cereals with which to feed pigs in world war two danish ships supplying britain had their cargo confiscated by germans or were even sunk 6 500 tonnes of bacon were lost in this way occupation of denmark by germans in 1940 put a stop to exporting to britain altogether danish crown pages 2 6 trade relations attempts were made to modernise british bacon production along danish lines in 1930s but this was not altogether successful at displacing danish bacon despite trade restrictions being imposed pages 89 92 danish bacon remained a major item of discussion in trade negotiations between two countries and complaints about of british bacon production compared to that from denmark were still taking place in parliament in 1950s sevaldsen pages 256 260 house of commons parliamentary debate 11 march 1955 hansard national academies 1955 danish bacon established a reputation in britain mildly cured taste was preferred to heavily salted and borax laden bacon imports from us attempts by other countries such as canada to establish bacon imports into britain during this period used danish bacon as quality standard against which their product was judged two sources gridgeman page 3 strandskov pedersen page 51 modernisation production methods moved from traditional dry curing process of rubbing salt spices and sugar into bacon to less labour intensive wet curing process in which bacon is left to soak in brine wet curing can also be used to increase water content of meat to add bulk and to add sodium nitrate and phosphates to shorten process which can then take as little as six hours compared to 2 3 days for dry curing coff et al page 90 there has been a growing movement by co operatives to centralise slaughterhouse and bacon processing plants into ever larger establishments plants have been moved out of denmark to more economically advantageous locations and this has partially happened to slaughterhouses too leaving denmark to concentrate on just raising of pigs coff et al page 86 in 1960s vacuum packing and automated slicing were introduced which were carried out in plants in uk in 1970s mixed farms were still common but farms then became more specialised in pig rearing and process more industrialised number of farmer owned co operatives fell from 62 in 1962 to just two today denmark imports bacon in 2001 5 of bacon consumed in denmark was imported during 2004 and 2005 bacon production was moved to germany and especially poland where costs are lower this almost immediately resulted in imports climbing to 75 and price falling to one third of danish produced bacon coff et al page 91 however product is still marketed as danish bacon since it is produced from danish pigs in danish shops it is not possible to buy conventionally produced danish sliced bacon that has been sliced in denmark danish consumers have expressed unhappiness with what they perceive to be a deceptive practice in uk slicing and packaging of danish bacon continues to be carried out in uk plants owned by danish crown uk pig a specific system is in place to produce pigs for uk market and these are referred to as uk pigs specification for these pigs is not only determined by uk legislation but also by conditions set by uk supermarkets who are main customers coff et al pages 88 89 similar schemes are in operation to produce pigs for other markets such as organic pigs raised to eu council regulations coff et al page 87 uk pig system was introduced following a call in late 1990s by william hague leader of british conservative party at time in opposition to ban danish bacon hague claimed that sow stall system used in denmark put british pig farmers at a competitive disadvantage since they were not allowed to use this system under british animal welfare regulations uk supermarkets responded by demanding improved pig welfare conditions which resulted in uk pig with sows able to move freely danish farmers were paid a supplement to cover additional cost of rearing uk pigs coff et al pages 90 91 sow stalls were again criticised by celebrity chef jamie oliver in 2009 and response from danish bacon industry made it clear that they were still in use on some farms but were all before eu deadline of 2013 response to jamie saves our bacon channel 4 thursday 29 january 2009 press release from danish bacon and meat council
