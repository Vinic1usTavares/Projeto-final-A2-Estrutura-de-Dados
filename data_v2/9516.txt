caddisflies or order trichoptera are a group of insects with aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults there are approximately 14 500 described species most of which can be divided into suborders integripalpia and annulipalpia on basis of adult mouthparts larvae construct a portable casing to protect themselves as they move around looking for food while larvae make themselves a fixed retreat in which they remain waiting for food to come to them affinities of small third suborder spicipalpia are unclear and molecular analysis suggests it may not be monophyletic also called sedge flies or rail flies adults are small moth like insects with two pairs of hairy membranous wings they are closely related to lepidoptera moths and butterflies which have scales on their wings two orders together form superorder aquatic larvae are found in a wide variety of habitats such as streams rivers lakes ponds spring seeps and temporary waters vernal pools glenn b wiggins larvae of north american caddisfly general trichoptera 2nd ed toronto university press 1996 p 3 larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases which are often strengthened with gravel sand twigs bitten off pieces of plants or other debris larvae exhibit various feeding strategies with different species being predators leaf shredders algal grazers or collectors of particles from water column and benthos most adults have short lives during which they do not feed in fly fishing artificial flies are tied to imitate adults while larvae and pupae are used as bait common and widespread genera such as helicopsyche and hydropsyche are important in sport where caddisflies are known as sedges caddisflies are useful as bioindicators as they are sensitive to water pollution and are large enough to be assessed in field in art french artist hubert duprat has created works by providing caddis larvae with small grains of gold and precious stones for them to build into decorative cases etymology name of order trichoptera derives from greek hair genitive wing and refers to fact that wings of these insects are bristly origin of word caddis is unclear but it dates back to at least as far as izaak walton s 1653 book compleat angler where cod worms or caddis were mentioned as being used as bait term was being used in fifteenth century for silk or cotton cloth and men were itinerant vendors of such materials but a connection between these words and insects has not been established evolution and phylogeny thumb upright eocene fossil in baltic amber lithuania fossil history fossil caddisflies have been found in rocks dating back to triassic largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases which are made of durable materials that preserve well body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare oldest being from early and middle triassic some 230 million years ago and wings are another source of fossils evolution of group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems to have taken place some time during triassic finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in brazil may push back origins of order to early permian period evolution nearly all adult caddisflies are terrestrial but their larvae and pupae are aquatic they share this characteristic with several distantly related groups namely dragonflies mayflies stoneflies and lacewings ancestors of all these groups were terrestrial with open tracheal systems convergently evolving different types of gills for their aquatic larvae as they took to water to avoid predation about 14 500 species of caddisfly in 45 families have been recognised worldwide but many more species remain to be described most can be divided into suborders integripalpia and annulipalpia on basis of adult mouthparts characteristics of adults depend on palps wing venation and genitalia of both sexes latter two characters have undergone such extensive differentiation among different superfamilies that differences between suborders is not clear cut larvae of are free living well sclerotized long legged predators with dorso ventrally flattened bodies and protruding mouthparts larvae of are poorly sclerotized detritivores with abdominal prolegs in addition to thoracic legs living permanently in tight fitting cases affinities of third suborder spicipalpia are unclear larvae are free living with no cases instead creating net like traps from silk phylogeny cladogram of external relationships based on a 2008 dna and protein analysis shows order as a clade sister to lepidoptera and more distantly related to diptera true flies and mecoptera scorpionflies cladogram of relationships within order is based on a 2002 molecular phylogeny using ribosomal rna a nuclear elongation factor gene and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase annulipalpia and integripalpia are clades but relationships within spicipalpia are unclear distribution caddisflies are found worldwide with greater diversity being in warmer regions they are associated with bodies of freshwater larvae being found in lakes ponds rivers streams and other water bodies land caddis pusilla lives in damp litter of woodland floor in united kingdom it is found in and around county of worcestershire in oakwoods ecology thumb larva in its underwater habitat caddisfly larvae can be found in all feeding guilds in freshwater habitats most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector gatherers picking up fragments of organic matter from benthos other species are collector sieving organic particles from water using silken nets or hairs on their legs some species are scrapers feeding on film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight others are shredder herbivores chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder detritivores gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre processed by bacteria and fungi most of nutrients of latter group come from consumption of bacteria and fungi predatory species either actively hunt their prey typically other insects tiny crustaceans and worms or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close a few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish and some leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges like mayflies stoneflies and dragonflies but to a somewhat lesser extent caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality they die out of streams with polluted waters they are an important part of food web both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to surface after emerging from submerged pupa and as it dries its wings fish find these new adults easy pickings and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at right time of year adult stage of a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding but some species are known to feed on nectar winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night flying birds bats small mammals amphibians and arthropods larval stage lasts much longer often for one or more years and has a bigger impact on environment they form an important part of diet of fish such as trout fish acquire them by two means either plucking them off vegetation or stream bed as larvae move about or during daily behavioural drift this drift happens during night for many species of aquatic larvae or around midday for some cased caddisfly species and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device larvae may drift in great numbers either close to bottom in mid water or just below surface fish swallow them whole case and all underwater architects cases caddisflies are best known for portable cases created by their larvae about thirty families of caddisfly members of suborder integripalpia adopt this stratagem these larvae eat detritus largely decaying vegetable material and dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows in slow moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots cases provide protection to larvae as they make their way between these resources case is a tubular structure made of silk secreted from salivary glands near mouth of larva and is started soon after egg hatches various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure nature of materials and design depending on larva s genetic makeup this means that caddisfly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family and even genus level materials used include grains of sand larger fragments of rock bark sticks leaves seeds and mollusc shells these are neatly arranged and stuck onto outer surface of silken tube as larva grows more material is added at front and larva can turn round in tube and trim rear end so that it does not drag along substrate caddisfly cases are open at both ends larvae drawing oxygenated water through posterior end over their gills and pumping it out of wider anterior end larvae move around inside tubes and this helps maintain water current lower oxygen content of water more active larvae need to be this mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae fixed retreats in contrast to larvae that have portable cases members of annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy they make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary waiting for food to come to them members of psychomyiidae ecnomidae and xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to bottom and feed on accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited tube can be lengthened when growing larva needs to feed in new areas more complex tubes short and flattened are built by polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objects sometimes with strands of silk suspended across nearby surface these larvae are carnivorous resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across surface silk domes larvae of members of family glossosomatidae in suborder spicipalpia create dome shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on periphyton biological film that grows on stones and other objects while carrying their enclosure around like turtles in family philopotamidae nets are sac like with intricate structure and tiny mesh larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off microflora that get trapped in net as water flows through nets thumb net made by a larva of suborder spicipalpia larvae of other species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases these are silken webs stretching between aquatic vegetation and over stones these net making larvae usually live in running water different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds there is a constant drift of invertebrates washed downstream by current and these animals and bits of debris accumulate in nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats development and morphology caddisfly larvae are aquatic with six pairs of tracheal gills on underside of abdomen eggs are laid above water on emergent twigs or vegetation or on water surface although females of some species enter water to choose sites although most species lay eggs a few in genus are ovoviviparous some species lay eggs on land and although most are associated with freshwater a few like are found in coastal saline water females lay their eggs into cavity of intertidal starfish larvae are long and roughly cylindrical very similar to those of lepidoptera but lacking prolegs in case bearing species heads are heavily sclerotinised while abdomen is soft antennae are short and mouthparts adapted for biting each of usually ten abdominal segments bears a pair of legs with a single tarsal joint in case bearing species first segment bears three papillae one above and two at sides which anchor larva centrally in tube posterior segment bears a pair of hooks for grappling there are five to seven larval instars followed by an aquatic pupa which has functional mandibles to cut through case gills and swimming legs pupal cocoon is spun from silk but like larval case often has other materials attached when pupating species that build portable cases attach them to some underwater object seal front and back apertures against predators while still allowing water to flow through and pupate within it once fully developed most pupal caddisflies cut through their cases with a special pair of mandibles swim up to water surface moult using exuviae as a floating platform and emerge as fully formed adults they can often fly immediately after breaking from their pupal cuticle emergence is mainly univoltine once per year with all adults of a species emerging at same time development is within a year in warm places but takes over a year in high latitudes and at high elevation in mountain lakes and streams adult caddisfly is a medium sized insect with membranous hairy wings which are held in a tent wise fashion when insect is at rest antennae are fairly long and threadlike mouthparts are reduced in size and legs have five tarsi lower leg joints adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities but many fly only weakly adults are usually short lived most being non feeders and equipped only to breed once mated female caddisfly lays eggs in a gelatinous mass attaching them above or below water surface depending on species eggs hatch in a few weeks relationship with humans thumb upright silver sedge fishing fly mimicking lepidostoma caddisfly from trout fly fishing in america thumb upright elegans elegant grannom from british entomology by john curtis c 1840 in angling caddisflies are called sedges by anglers individual species emerge en masse at different times and are used one after other often for only a few days each year as models for artificial fishing flies for fly fishing in trout streams a mass emergence is known as a hatch each type has its own angling name so for example is dancer or great red sedge grannom lepidostoma silver sedge longhorn sedge cheumatopsyche little sister sedge helicopsyche speckled peter an important fishing fly in north america and hydropsyche sedge perhaps most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net makers as bioindicators caddisflies are useful as bioindicators of good water quality since they are sensitive to water pollution and are large enough to be assessed conveniently in field some species indicate undisturbed habitat and some indicate degraded habitat although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities species rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies such as lakes ponds and marshes together with stoneflies and mayflies caddisflies feature importantly in surveys of streams and other water bodies in art while caddisflies in wild construct their cases out of twigs sand aquatic plants and rocks french artist hubert duprat makes art by providing wild caddisflies with precious stones and other materials he collected caddisfly larvae from wild and put them in climate controlled tanks he removes larvae from their original cases and adds precious and semi precious items such as grains of gold into tank larvae then build new cases out of precious items creating a unique form of artwork resulting works are sold across world as food in japan caddisfly larvae is called zazamushi and eaten as a delicacy zazamushi silk successful discovery
