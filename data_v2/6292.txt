point of view of arthur s antagonist morgan le fay paxson pp 11 18 bradley wrote firebrand after publishing mists of avalon in 1983 paxson p 117 according to encyclopedia of fantasy after mists of avalon bradley wrote stories with a strong literary appeal to appeal to a wide readership rather than focus on fantasy genre bradley s later works often centered on strong lead characters in mytho historic settings with few fantasy elements clute grant p 135 for instance in firebrand kentaurs are depicted as a nomadic tribe of short naked riders of horses rather than as half human half horsemen legends traditionally portray dorschel p 179 firebrand is bradley s second re telling of a famous legend crosby p 54 and her only novel set in ancient greece dorschel p 151 she decided to re envision legends from a female perspective and said that she had an interest to hear more about human realities surrounding well known stories but did not believe this constituted a feminist writing style sharp p 243 in an interview with lisa see of publishers weekly bradley said she viewed trojan war legend as an example of masculine culture dominating and female viewpoints and contributions she said unlike mists of avalon which featured a wide range of arthurian legends that bradley drew upon as source material bradley cited few sources while writing firebrand she credits her then husband author walter h breen with helping her research book and create story breen was knowledgeable about ancient greek history and language according to bradley he persuaded her to use linguistically correct transliterations of characters names such as akhilles rather than commonly known form achilles bradley acknowledgments though kassandra s fate remains unknown in iliad bradley found inspiration for character s ending from an inscription at archaeological museum in athens which mentioned kassandra s descendants bradley postscript bradley believed that this inscription provided historical basis for kassandra s existence n p themes and analysis gender roles right thumb 250px ajax raping cassandra on an attic red figure pottery cup c 440 430 bc classical depictions of cassandra show her with characteristics associated with insanity such as nudity and wild hair in original story found in iliad female characters receive little attention although they are often crucial to progressing events they have no developed identities of their own and are instead defined by motherhood and sisterhood dorschel pp 152 156 57 cassandra is described in that story as loveliest of priam s lovely daughters but does not speak at all homer iliad xiii 363 367 today she is remembered for portending city s doom and for not being believed by its inhabitants who think she is mad on ancient greek pottery she is depicted as half naked with long wild hair and shakespeare s 1602 play troilus and cressida characterizes her as an insane woman shakespeare troilus and cressida act 2 scene 2 96 125 after akhaians

clytemnestra aeschylus agamemnon 1370 75 dorschel pp 152 54 by setting her story from female perspective bradley gives formerly silent voice dorschel pp 155 56 166 crosby pp 54 55 here kassandra is depicted as a strong and insightful woman rather than as a lunatic yet she is still misunderstood by many of those around her dorschel pp 170 71 she is allowed to survive klytemnestra s wrath to record a female counter narrative komar p 174 thompson pp 186 88 firebrand employs similar themes to bradley s other works roberts p 113 including reversal of gender roles where women are true heroes while proud arrogant men who lead troy to doom fail to invoke reader s sympathy novel s title refers to paris and destruction he brings to troy bradley p 483 firebrand has been perceived as belonging to revisionist history genre crosby p 17 as it fits into a reinvent ion of stories that are either historical or derived from myth legend but often taken to be historical and then told with a different narrative novel has also been seen as an example of feminist literature crosby p 43 despite bradley s refusal to label herself as a feminist paxson p 113 her works often dealt with themes of gender religion and power particularly in historically patriarchal societies paxson pp 113 14 fry pp 71 72 78 in firebrand bradley introduces feminist ideals by equating patriarchal culture with oppressive tendencies perceived to have been scorned by male god apollo kassandra is not believed by trojan citizens because of her gender dorschel p 172 dorschel noted that because there is no humanity or compassion in this masculine world characters traditionally associated with noble positive qualities are instead stripped of their own glamor and are portrayed in a negative for instance is a mad dog who rapes penthesilea as an act of cold blooded contempt rather than as an act of sudden love upon causing her death dorschel pp 175 76 agamemnon and menelaus are rendered as patriarchal stereotypes in her entry for science fiction fantasy book review annual mary kay bray wrote that bradley s account makes these traditional heroes seem more human and flawed even if they are also less admirable bray p 106 religion and gender bradley believed that cultural shock clash of alien cultures is essence of literature and drama and incorporated this viewpoint into many of her works sharp p 244 firebrand is set in a time of change and kassandra is caught between new and old cultures despite being ruled by a king and worshiping male god apollo trojans still respect ancient cult surrounding earth mother in colchis powerful queen imandra rules alone but her way of life is is aging and uncertain of her successor and impoverished areas surrounding colchis contain two other dwindling civilizations amazons and kentaurs literary critics have observed elements of neo paganism in novel bradley often included characteristics of neo paganism into her stories as she explored intersection of gender and religion while neo paganism lacks a singular definition many followers have come to define it as a primitive matriarchal religion that flourished in western europe centered on worship of a mother goddess and became largely decimated by christianity fry p 68 fry wrote that a basic assumption in firebrand is that people of ancient greece had worshiped goddess prior to arrival of akhaians a people who brought with them a male warrior pantheon of gods and gradually subverted old ways bradley s penthesilea tells a young kassandra but remember child before ever apollo sun lord came to rule these lands our horse great mare earth mother from whom we all are was here bradley p 58 firebrand combines two belief systems and mixes neo paganism with elements of greek mythology fry p 76 scholars have found similarities between firebrand and mists of avalon they serve parallel purposes by retelling old legends from female perspectives n p reid p 247 both stories deal with confrontation between female based earth centered belief systems and rising patriarchal religions reid p 247 this religious dichotomy appears first as a conflict between apollo and goddess and later as a confrontation between akhaian and trojan gods dorschel pp 166 68 178 79 crosby p 56 in novel s tradition serpents represent mother goddess prominent place in religious life immortality rebirth and regeneration readers are told that female snake deity and symbol of slain by hellenistic apollo representing destruction of feminine social political and religious power dorschel pp 178 79 bradley also uses story s female characters to create a feminist dichotomy kassandra and penthesilea represent feminist side in their pursuit of independence while many of other as andromache hecuba and helen subordinate themselves to patriarchal traditions values goods smith n p dorschel pp 166 68 loss of this matriarchal culture has been viewed as novel s main theme dorschel p 166 bradley writes of power of women in many of her works including mists of avalon and darkover series fry pp 70 71 and firebrand continues this by depicting kassandra in an idealized world amazons follow earth goddess but are slowly dwindling in wake of patriarchal male warrior pantheon of gods fry p 75 through kassandra s experiences with amazons bradley shows that she this group of women release novel was

has received less critical attention and success than bradley s earlier novel mists of avalon which has tended to overshadow it dorschel p 152 firebrand received mixed to positive reviews from mainstream literary critics magill book reviews applauded bradley s faithfulness to source material in iliad despite startling liberties she takes with homer s work however reviewer said her themes of gender and religion rendered artfully and gracefully in mists of avalon becomes tiresome with repetition bradley said that some readers would take umbrage at her changes to trojan legend she said had i been content with account in iliad there would have been no reason to write a novel besides iliad stops short just at most interesting point leaving writer to conjecture about end from assorted legends and traditions library journal said readers should familiarize themselves with greek mythology before beginning novel and said author makes a strong statement about desirability of women having control of their own destinies and about cruelties men inflict upon them encyclopedia of fantasy said that firebrand and bradley s 1994 novel forest house display bradley s talent for plot character vision and fine storytelling reviewing for globe and mail h j kirchhoff compared firebrand to mists of avalon and wrote that former is neither as refreshing nor as lovely even though it is a pretty good read kirchhoff wrote that firebrand contained too many similarities to bradley s previous novels saying of old story and feminist ideology seems forced though he praised her flesh and blood depiction of men associated with legend vicki mccash of sun sentinel commended novel for making legendary characters breathe and feel and for giving a refreshing twist to ancient story mccash wrote from first pages reader is gripped in magic of ancient troy these stories have been revered for centuries but in firebrand they are retold to become one epic novel not only of heroes and gods but of heroines and goddesses and of change in very fabric of society mccash said that male readers might be troubled by negative portrayals of their sex but that bradley attempted to avoid this by inputting a few sympathetic men such as aeneas and several evil women such as klytemnestra virginia judge of herald called it a fascinating but lengthy tale and praised bradley s depictions of old religion she criticized ending for seeming contrived a reviewer for english journal praised novel and found one of its main strengths is its ability to entertain reader with characters who are basically faithful to their origins in iliad yet at same time rounder fuller and more personally engaging reviewer wrote bradley out stereotypes on which characterization in epic poem cold calculating achilles crafty gregarious odysseus frustrated convincing dialogue which not only carries plot but gives reference to other events both mythical and historical frederick p 85 english journal also said that bradley tempers bitterness and cynicism of homer s cassandra presenting instead a woman confused and tormented by knowledge on which she is powerless to act in an overview of bradley s body of work encyclopedia of fantasy and horror fiction author don d called novel one of her better fantasies d p 34 bradley s works have received praise from feminist critics who have particularly lauded her ability to portray multidimensional women as revered conduit s of nature based religion and mysticism as seen with character of kassandra snodgrass p 79 at 1988 locus awards firebrand was voted
