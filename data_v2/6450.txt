domhnall mac raghnaill was a hebridean noble in late 12th and early 13th century he is eponymous progenitor of clan donald clann children of donald for this reason some traditions accumulated around him in later middle ages and early modern period despite his role as historical figurehead of one of world s most famous kindreds and surnames there is almost no contemporary evidence yielding certain information about his life his place in genealogical tradition of macdonalds is only reason for believing in his existence a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted beyond his actual existence there is little that is certain three entries in irish annals may discuss him though he is never named a praise poem surviving from early modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him a miracle in a manx chronicle may or may not have domhnall as its subject and a doubtful charter surviving from a similarly late era was allegedly issued by him origins domhnall was reputedly son of raghnall fl 1192 son of somhairle died 1164 17th century history of macdonalds by hugh macdonald of sleat claimed that domhnall s father raghnall had married a daughter or sister of early 14th century hero thomas randolph earl of moray sellar suggested that this tradition may have derived from a garbled version of reality perhaps sellar argued his mother was a daughter of william fitz duncan latter was another famous earl of moray but one who lived in 12th rather than 14th century sellar hebridean sea kings p 200 in a charter to paisley abbey domhnall s father raghnall is given a wife named fionnghuala sellar hebridean sea kings p 195 mcleod bateman duanaire na sracaire p 503 states without citing evidence that this woman was a grand daughter of fergus king of galloway though there is no direct proof that this was name of domhnall s mother domhnall s father raghnall carrying legacy of his own father somhairle was a powerful argyll and hebridean magnate who depending on context bore titles king of isles lord of argyll and kintyre and lord of hebrides sellar hebridean sea kings p 194 table ii his father s legacy was such that he became ancestor figure of both clann ruaidhri and clan donald possible evidence of life annals of ulster there are no certain contemporary notices of domhnall and domhnall s existence is not explicitly attested in any reliable contemporary source datable to any particular year however in 1212 domhnall may have been one of sons of raghnall who suffered some kind of military defeat at hands of men of isle of skye annals of ulster reporting for year 1209 recorded that a battle was fought by sons of raghnall son of somhairle against men of skye wherein slaughter was inflicted upon them annals of ulster s a 1209 2 trans a similar report from same source has sons of raghnaill join in a raid on irish city of derry led by tomas mac uchtraigh brother of alan lord of galloway under year 1212 it related that tomas mac uchtraigh with sons of raghnall son of somhairle came to derry of st colum cille with six and seventy ships and town was greatly destroyed by them and inis was completely destroyed by them and by cenel conaill s a 1212 4 trans two years later a similar raid by tomas is mentioned by same source though only son of raghnall reported as present that time was

editor mcleod bateman duanaire na sracaire p 75 poem gives little information besides associating him with lennox a quatrain addressed him as o o descendant of gofraidh descendant of amhlaibh fionn a o go his gall stewards from sea to sea donna a an following gall are stout youths do is cholla is of progeny of brian and colla and conn mcleod bateman duanaire na sracaire p 79 gall is a word that originally meant foreigner or norseman later lowlander and might be meant to refer to someone from region of innse gall i e from hebrides it is not clear who gofraidh or amhlaibh fionn are but they may refer to some of norse gaelic rulers of mann and dublin possibly amhlaibh and gofraidh crobhan mcleod bateman duanaire na sracaire pp 502 3 miracle from manx chronicle chronicle of kings of man related a story that may have involved domhnall in 1249 according to text following death of haraldr olafsson king of mann new ruler haraldr gudrodarson persecuted one of old king s favourite vassals this persecuted vassal described as an aged man was named as i e domhnall domhnall and his young son were subsequently imprisoned owing to intervention of st mary domhnall and his son managed to escape and brought their thanks and story to abbey of st mary of rushen monastic house at which chronicle was kept ref woolf dead man p 78 ref possible charter there is a charter allegedly issued by domhnall to paisley abbey found in cartulary of that abbey mcdonald kingdom of isles pp 148 9 in this charter domhnall is given no title instead merely described by his genealogy filius domhnall son of raghnall son of somhairle sellar hebridean sea kings p 200 n 57 charter is paisley registrum 126 this charter is thought by some historians to be spurious mainly because witness list and wording of charter are in words of alex woolf suspiciously similar to those in a genuine charter of domhnall s son aonghus mor presumably explanation is that monks of paisley abbey at some later stage may have thought it in their interest to replicate aonghus mor s charter in order to add authority of founder of clan donald to their land rights woolf dead man p 78 sellar hebridean sea kings p 200 see also

besides were slain annals of loch ce s a 1247 7 available here irish historian sean duffy suggested that this mac somhairle was domhnall mac raghnall duffy s main argument is that 18th century book of relayed a tradition that domhnall had been invited by irish at tara to come to take headship of western isles and greater part of gaels duffy bruce brothers p 56 mcdonald believed that this mac somhairle referred to donnchadh mac dubhghaill while sellar thought that clear favourite for this mac somhairle should be domhnall s older brother ruaidhri mcdonald kingdom of isles p 94 alex woolf more recently offered an extended case for latter view arguing on a number of grounds that ruaidhri is by far best candidate woolf dead man pp 77 85 see also woolf age of sea kings p 108 assuming that domhnall is not dead man at ballyshannon date of domhnall s death cannot be fixed macdonald tradition placed it in 1289 a tradition usually rejected by modern historians as falling far too late mcdonald kingdom of isles pp 95 6 r andrew mcdonald suggested that domhnall s death must have taken place before 1263 when king haakon collected allegiance of aonghus mor in hebrides mcdonald kingdom of isles p 96 alex woolf argued that it very likely must have occurred before february 1256 when domhnall s son aonghus mor made a grant to paisley abbey is his own name as lord of islay suggesting at very least that domhnall had retired munro munro acts p 280 woolf dead man p 79 legacy domhnall s main legacy is being eponymous founding figure of famous macdonald kindred of islay mcdonald kingdom of isles p 96 sellar hebridean sea kings p 194 table ii early modern macdonald tradition thought of domhnall as a lord of isles like his descendants one such tradition related that king alexander ii of scotland sent a messenger to domhnall requesting that he hold isles from alexander rather than king of denmark domhnall was said to have responded that his their rights of isles from crown of denmark which were renewed by present king thereof quoted in mcdonald kingdom of isles p 95 this anachronistic portrayal of struggle between king haakon iv of norway and scottish crown for overlordship of western seaboard of scotland giving domhnall such a senior role does not fit with contemporary evidence when it was written down denmark ruled norway and macdonalds were well established as rulers isles however during most of his life domhnall was probably subordinate to his older brother ruaidhri mac raghnaill and as alex woolf has said there is little or no explicit contemporary evidence that domhnall was a significant figure during his lifetime woolf dead man p 78 nevertheless domhnall appears to have left his son aonghus mor a lordship of respectable size centred on islay while his reputedly younger son alasdair mor appears to have been left lands in kintyre according to a praise poem written for this son realm latter inherited from domhnall included
