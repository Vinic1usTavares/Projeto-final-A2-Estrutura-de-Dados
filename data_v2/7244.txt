hindu german conspiracy note on name was a series of plans between 1914 and 1917 by indian nationalist groups to attempt pan indian rebellion against british raj during world war i formulated between indian revolutionary underground and exiled or self exiled nationalists who formed in united states ghadar party and in germany indian independence committee in decade preceding great war conspiracy was drawn up at beginning of war with extensive support from german foreign office german consulate in san francisco as well as some support from ottoman turkey and irish republican movement most prominent plan attempted to foment unrest and trigger a pan indian mutiny in british indian army from punjab to singapore this plot was planned to be executed in february 1915 with aim of overthrowing british rule over indian subcontinent february mutiny was ultimately thwarted when british intelligence infiltrated ghadarite movement and arrested key figures mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within india were also crushed other related events include 1915 singapore mutiny annie larsen arms plot jugantar german plot german mission to kabul mutiny of connaught rangers in india as well as by some accounts black tom explosion in 1916 parts of conspiracy included efforts to subvert british indian army in middle eastern theatre of world war i indo german alliance and conspiracy were target of a worldwide british intelligence effort which was successful in preventing further attempts american intelligence agencies arrested key figures in aftermath of annie larsen affair in 1917 conspiracy resulted in lahore conspiracy case trials in india as well as hindu german conspiracy trial at time longest and most expensive trial ever held in united states this series of events was consequential to indian independence movement though largely subdued by end of world war i it came to be a major factor in reforming raj s indian policy similar efforts were made during world war ii in germany and in japanese controlled southeast asia where subhas chandra bose formed indische legion and indian national army respectively and in italy where mohammad iqbal formed azad background nationalism had become more and more prominent in india throughout last decades of 19th century as a result of social economic and political changes instituted in country through greater part of century indian national congress founded in 1885 developed as a major platform for loyalists demands for political liberalisation and for increased autonomy nationalist movement grew with founding of underground groups in 1890s it became particularly strong radical and violent in bengal and in punjab along with smaller but nonetheless notable movements in maharashtra madras and other places of south india in bengal revolutionaries more often than not recruited educated youth of urban middle class community that epitomised classic indian revolutionary while in punjab rural and military society sustained organised violence indian revolutionary underground thumb left upright rash behari bose key leader of delhi lahore conspiracy and later of february plot controversial 1905 partition of bengal had a widespread political impact acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in india and abroad it became a focal issue for indian revolutionaries revolutionary organisations like jugantar and anushilan samiti had emerged in 20th century several significant events took place these included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants prominent public figures and indian informants including one in 1907 aiming to kill bengal lieutenant governor sir andrew fraser matters came to a head when 1912 delhi lahore conspiracy led by erstwhile jugantar member rash behari bose attempted to assassinate then viceroy of india charles hardinge in aftermath of this event british indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy bengali and punjabi revolutionary underground though movement came under intense pressure for some time rash behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years by time world war i had begun in europe in 1914 revolutionary movement had revived in punjab and bengal in bengal movement with a safe haven in french base of chandernagore had sufficient strength to all but paralyse state administration earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in india appears in nixon s report on revolutionary organisation which reported that jatin mukherjee bagha jatin and bhattacharya had met crown prince of germany during latter s visit to calcutta in 1912 and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition terrorism in bengal compiled and edited by a k government of west bengal 1995 vol ii at same time an increasingly strong pan islamic movement started developing mainly in north and north west regions of india with onset of war in 1914 members of this movement formed an important component of conspiracy at time of partition of bengal krishna varma founded india house in london and received extensive support from notable expatriate indians including madam bhikaji cama lala lajpat rai s r rana and dadabhai naoroji organisation ostensibly a residence for indian students in reality sought to promote nationalist opinion and pro independence work india house drew young radical activists of likes of m l dhingra v d savarkar v n chatterjee m p t acharya and lala har dayal it developed links with revolutionary movement in india and nurtured it with arms funds and propaganda authorities in india banned indian sociologist and other literature published by house as seditious under v d savarkar s leadership house rapidly developed as a centre for intellectual and political activism and as a meeting ground for radical revolutionaries among indian students in britain earning moniker most dangerous organisation outside india from valentine in 1909 in london m l dhingra fatally shot sir w h curzon wyllie political aide de camp to secretary of state for india in aftermath of assassination metropolitan police and home office rapidly suppressed india house its leadership fled to europe and to united states of america some like chatterjee moved to germany har dayal and many others moved to paris organisations founded in united states and in japan emulated example of london s india house krishna varma nurtured close interactions with turkish and egyptian nationalists and with clan na gael in united states joint efforts of mohammed barkatullah s l joshi and george freeman founded pan aryan association modelled after krishna varma s indian home rule society in new york in 1906 barkatullah himself had become closely associated with krishna varma during a previous stay in london and his subsequent career in japan put him at heart of indian political activities there myron an acquaintance of krishna varma and an admirer of swami vivekananda founded an india house in manhattan in new york in january 1908 amidst a growing indian student population erstwhile members of india house in london succeeded in extending nationalist work across atlantic gaelic american reprinted articles from indian sociologist while liberal press laws allowed free circulation of indian sociologist supporters could ship such nationalist literature and pamphlets freely across world new york increasingly became an important centre for indian movement such that free hindustan a political revolutionary journal closely mirroring indian sociologist and gaelic american published by taraknath das moved in 1908 from vancouver and seattle to new york das established extensive collaboration with gaelic american with help from george freeman before it was proscribed in 1910 under british diplomatic pressure this irish collaboration with indian revolutionaries resulted in some of early but failed efforts to smuggle arms into india including a 1908 attempt on board a ship called ss moraitis which sailed from new york for persian gulf before it was searched at smyrna irish community later provided valuable intelligence logistics communication media and legal support to german indian and irish conspirators those involved in this liaison and later involved in plot included major irish republicans and irish american nationalists like john devoy joseph roger casement eamon de valera father peter yorke and larry de lacey these pre war contacts effectively set up a network which german foreign office tapped into as war began in europe ghadar party thumb left an immigrant punjabi family in america c 1900s large scale indian immigration to pacific coast of north america took place in 20th century especially from punjab which faced an economic depression canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting entry of south asians into canada and at restricting political rights of those already in country punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for british empire and commonwealth community had expected that its commitment would be honoured with same welcome and rights which british and colonial governments extended to british and white immigrants restrictive legislation fed growing discontent protests and anti colonial sentiments within community faced with increasingly difficult situations community began organising itself into political groups many punjabis also moved to united states but they encountered similar political and social problems meanwhile india house and nationalist activism of indian students had begun declining on east coast of north america towards 1910 but activity gradually shifted west to san francisco arrival at this time of har dayal from europe bridged gap between intellectual agitators in new york and predominantly punjabi labour workers and migrants in west coast and laid foundations of ghadar movement thumb right 180px ghadar di an early ghadarite compilation of nationalist and socialist literature was banned in india in 1913 ghadar party initially pacific coast hindustan association was formed in 1913 in united states under leadership of har dayal with singh as its president it drew members from indian immigrants largely from punjab many of its members were also from university of california at berkeley including dayal tarak nath das kartar singh sarabha and v g pingle party quickly gained support from indian expatriates especially in united states canada and asia ghadar meetings were held in los angeles oxford vienna washington d c and shanghai ghadar s ultimate goal was to overthrow british colonial authority in india by means of an armed revolution it viewed congress led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and latter s constitutional methods as soft ghadar s foremost strategy was to entice indian soldiers to revolt to that end in november 1913 ghadar established ashram press in san francisco press produced hindustan ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature towards end of 1913 party established contact with prominent revolutionaries in india including rash behari bose an indian edition of hindustan ghadar essentially espoused philosophies of anarchism and revolutionary terrorism against british interests in india political discontent and violence mounted in punjab and ghadarite publications that reached bombay from california were deemed seditious and banned by raj these events compounded by evidence of prior ghadarite incitement in delhi lahore conspiracy of 1912 led british government to pressure american state department to suppress indian revolutionary activities and ghadarite literature which emanated mostly from san francisco germany and berlin committee with onset of world war i an indian revolutionary group called berlin committee later called indian independence committee was formed in germany its chief architects were c r pillai and v n chatterjee committee drew members from indian students and erstwhile members of india house including bhattacharya dr abdul hafiz padmanabhan pillai a r pillai m p t acharya and gopal germany had earlier opened intelligence bureau for east headed by archaeologist and historian max von oppenheim oppenheim and arthur zimmermann state secretary for foreign affairs of german empire actively supported berlin committee which had links with jatin mukherjee a jugantar party member and at time one of leading revolutionary figures in bengal office of t25 member committee at no 38 was accorded full embassy status german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg authorised german activity against british india as world war i broke out in september 1914 germany decided to actively support ghadarite plans using links established between indian and irish residents in germany including irish nationalist and poet roger casement and german foreign office oppenheim tapped into indo irish network in united states har dayal had helped organise ghadar party before his arrest in united states in 1914 he however jumped bail and made his way to switzerland leaving party and publications in charge of ram chandra bharadwaj who became ghadar president in 1914 german consulate in san francisco was tasked to make contact with ghadar leaders in california a naval lieutenant by name of wilhelm von with help of indian nationalist journalist tarak nath das and an intermediary by name of charles established links with bharadwaj meanwhile in switzerland berlin committee was able to convince har dayal that organising a revolution in india was feasible conspiracy thumb right punjabi sikhs aboard komagata maru in vancouver s english bay 1914 canadian government banned passengers from landing in canada and ship was forced to return to india events surrounding komagata maru incident served as a catalyst for ghadarite cause in may 1914 canadian government refused to allow 400 indian passengers of ship komagata maru to disembark at vancouver voyage had been planned by singh sandhu as an attempt to circumvent canadian exclusion laws that effectively prevented indian immigration before ship reached vancouver german radio announced its approach and british columbian authorities prepared to prevent passengers from entering canada incident became a focal point for indian community in canada which rallied in support of passengers and against government s policies after a two month legal battle 24 of them were allowed to immigrate ship was escorted out of vancouver by protected cruiser and returned to india on reaching calcutta passengers were detained under defence of india act at budge budge by british indian government which made efforts to forcibly transport them to punjab this caused rioting at budge budge and resulted in fatalities on both sides ghadar leaders like barkatullah and taraknath das used inflammatory passions surrounding komagata maru event as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected indians in north america into party s fold british indian army meanwhile was contributing significantly to allied war effort in world war i consequently a reduced force estimated to have been 15 000 troops in late 1914 was stationed in india it was in this scenario that concrete plans for organising uprisings in india were made in september 1913 a ghadarite named singh visited shanghai to promote nationalist cause amongst indians there followed by a visit to india in january 1914 when singh circulated ghadar literature amongst indian soldiers through clandestine sources before leaving for hong kong singh reported that situation in india as favourable for revolution by october 1914 many ghadarites had returned to india and were assigned tasks like contacting indian revolutionaries and organisations spreading propaganda and literature and arranging to get arms into country first group of 60 ghadarites led by singh left san francisco for canton aboard steamship korea on 29 august they were to sail on to india where they would be provided with arms to organise a revolt at canton more indians joined and group now numbering about 150 sailed for calcutta on a japanese vessel they were to be joined by more ghadarites arriving in smaller groups during september and october about 300 indians left for india in various ships like ss siberia maru china manchuria ss maru ss mongolia and ss shinyo maru although korea s party itself was uncovered and arrested on arrival at calcutta a successful underground network was established between united states and india through shanghai swatow and siam singh ghadar operative in shanghai is believed to have spent 30 000 for helping revolutionaries to get into india ghadarites in india were able to establish contact with sympathisers within british indian army as well as build networks with underground revolutionary groups east asia efforts had begun as early as 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into india when a clear idea of conspiracy emerged more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support herambalal gupta who had arrived in united states in 1914 at berlin committee s directives took over leadership of american wing of conspiracy after failure of ss korea mission gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms while men were in plentiful supply with more and more indians coming forward to join ghadarite cause obtaining arms for uprising proved to be more difficult revolutionaries started negotiations with chinese government through james dietrich who held sun yat sen s power of attorney to buy a million rifles however deal fell through when it was realised that weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders from china gupta went to japan to try to procure arms and to enlist japanese support for indian independence movement however he was forced into hiding within 48 hours when he came to know that japanese authorities planned to hand him over to british later reports indicated he was protected at this time by toyama mitsuru right wing political leader and founder of nationalist secret society indian nobel laureate rabindranath tagore a strong supporter of pan met japanese premier count terauchi and count okuma a former premier in an attempt to enlist support for ghadarite movement tarak nath das urged japan to align with germany on grounds that american war preparation could actually be directed against japan later in 1915 mukherji a jugantar activist and associate of rash behari bose is also known to have tried unsuccessfully to arrange for arms from japan ascendancy of li to chinese presidency in 1916 led to negotiations reopening through his former private secretary who resided in united states at time in exchange for allowing arms shipments to india via china s borders china was offered german military assistance and rights to 10 of any material shipped to india via china negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful due to sun yat sen s opposition to an alliance with germany europe and united states thumb right upright franz von papen later chancellor of germany briefly before hitler s rise to power papen was key in organising arms shipments indian nationalists then in paris had with egyptian revolutionaries made plans to assassinate lord kitchener as early as 1911 these plans were however not implemented after war began this plan was revived and har dayal s close associate gobind behari lal visited liverpool in march 1915 from new york to put this plan in action he may also have intended at this time to bomb docks in liverpool however these plans ultimately failed chattopadhyaya also attempted at this time to revive links with remnants of india house that survived in london and through swiss german and english sympathisers then resident in britain among them were meta brunner a swiss woman dube an indian man and his common law german wife anna brandt and hilda an english woman in yorkshire chattopadhyaya s correspondences were however traced by censor leading to arrest of cell among other plans that were considered at time were large scale conspiracies in june 1915 to assassinate foreign secretary lord grey and war minister lord kitchener in addition they also intended to target french president raymond poincare and prime minister rene viviani king victor emmanuel iii of italy and his prime minister antonio these plans were coordinated with italian anarchists with explosives manufactured in italy barkatullah by now in europe and working with berlin committee arranged for these explosives to be sent to german consulate in zurich from where it was expected to be taken charge of by an italian anarchist named bertoni however british intelligence was able to infiltrate this plot and successfully pressed swiss police to expel abdul hafiz in united states an elaborate plan and arrangement was made to ship arms from country and from far east through shanghai batavia bangkok and burma even while herambalal gupta was on his mission in china and japan other plans were explored to ship arms from united states and east asia german high command decided early on that assistance to indian groups would be pointless unless given on a substantial scale in october 1914 german vice consul e h von schack in san francisco approved arrangements for funds and armaments 200 000 worth of small arms and ammunition were acquired by german military attache captain franz von papen through krupp agents and arranged for its shipment to india through san diego java and burma arsenal included 8 080 springfield rifles of spanish american war vintage 2 400 springfield carbines 410 hotchkiss repeating rifles 4 000 000 cartridges 500 colt revolvers with 100 000 cartridges and 250 mauser pistols along with ammunition schooner annie larsen and sailing ship ss henry s were hired to ship arms out of united states and transfer it to ownership of ships were hidden under a massive smokescreen involving fake companies and oil business in south east asia for arms shipment itself a successful cover was set up to lead british agents to believe that arms were for warring factions of mexican civil war this ruse was successful enough that rival villa faction offered 15 000 to divert shipment to a villa controlled port although shipment was meant to supply mutiny planned for february 1915 it was not dispatched until june of that year by which time conspiracy had been uncovered in india and major leaders had been arrested or gone into hiding plot for shipment itself failed when disastrous co ordination prevented a successful rendezvous off socorro island with maverick plot had already been infiltrated by british intelligence through indian and irish agents linked closely with conspiracy upon returning to hoquiam washington after several failed attempts annie larsen s cargo was promptly seized by us customs cargo was sold at an auction despite german ambassador count johann von s attempts to take possession insisting they were meant for german east africa hindu german conspiracy trial opened in 1917 in united states on charges of gun running and at time was one of lengthiest and most expensive trials in american legal history franz von papen attempted to sabotage rail lines in canada and destroy welland canal he also attempted to supply rifles and dynamite to sikhs in british columbia to blast railway bridges these plots in canada did not materialise among other events in united states that have been linked to conspiracy is black tom explosion when on night of 30 july 1916 saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition at black tom terminal at new york harbour awaiting shipment in support of british war effort although blamed solely on german agents at time later investigations by directorate of naval intelligence in aftermath of annie larsen incident unearthed links between black tom explosion and franz von papen irish movement indian movement as well as communist elements active in united states pan indian mutiny by start of 1915 many ghadarites nearly 8 000 in punjab province alone by some estimates had returned to india however they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis although some were rounded up by police on suspicion many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like lahore ferozepur and rawalpindi various plans had been made to attack military arsenal at mian meer near lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 november 1914 in another plan a group of sikh soldiers manjha planned to start a mutiny in 23rd cavalry at lahore cantonment on 26 november a further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 november from ferozepur under nidham singh in bengal jugantar through jatin mukherjee established contacts with garrison at fort william in calcutta in august 1914 mukherjee s group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from rodda company a major gun manufacturing firm in india in december 1914 several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in calcutta mukherjee kept in touch with rash behari bose through kartar singh and v g pingle these rebellious acts which were until then organised separately by different groups were brought into a common umbrella under leadership of rash behari bose in north india v g pingle in maharashtra and sanyal in benares a plan was made for a unified general uprising with date set for 21 february 1915 february 1915 thumb public executions of convicted mutineers at outram road singapore c march 1915 in india unaware of delayed shipment and confident of being able to rally indian sepoy plot for mutiny took its final shape under plans 23rd cavalry in punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 february this was to be followed by mutiny in 26th punjab which was to be signal for uprising to begin resulting in an advance on delhi and lahore bengal cell was to look for punjab mail entering howrah station next day which would have been cancelled if punjab was seized and was to strike immediately however punjab cid successfully infiltrated conspiracy at last moment through a sepoy named kirpal singh sensing that their plans had been compromised d day was brought forward to 19 february but even these plans found their way to intelligence plans for revolt by 130th baluchi regiment at rangoon on 21 january were thwarted attempted revolts in 26th punjab 7th rajput 130th baluch 24th jat artillery and other regiments were suppressed mutinies in firozpur lahore and agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of conspiracy were arrested although some managed to escape or evade arrest a last ditch attempt was made by kartar singh and v g pingle to trigger a mutiny in 12th cavalry regiment at meerut kartar singh escaped from lahore but was arrested in varanasi and v g pingle was apprehended in meerut mass arrests followed as ghadarites were rounded up in punjab and central provinces rash behari bose escaped from lahore and in may 1915 fled to japan other leaders including giani pritam singh swami satyananda puri and others fled to thailand on 15 february 5th light infantry stationed at singapore was among few units to mutiny successfully nearly eight hundred and fifty of its troops mutinied on afternoon of 15th along with nearly a hundred men of malay states guides this mutiny lasted almost seven days and resulted in deaths of 47 british soldiers and local civilians mutineers also released interned crew of sms emden who were asked by mutineers to join them but refused and actually took up arms and defended barracks after mutineers had left sheltering some british refugees as well until prison camp was relieved mutiny was suppressed only after french russian and japanese ships arrived with reinforcements of 200 people tried at singapore 47 mutineers were shot in public executions rest were transported for life to east africa most of rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years in all 800 mutineers were either shot imprisoned or exiled some historians including hew strachan argue that although ghadar agents operated within singapore unit mutiny was isolated and not linked to conspiracy others deem this as instigated by silk letter movement which became intricately related to ghadarite conspiracy christmas day plot thumb right upright bagha jatin wounded after his final battle at banks of burha balang off balasore his enterprise was deemed one of most significant threats to british india in autumn 1915 in april 1915 unaware of failure of annie larsen plan papen arranged through krupp s american representative hans tauscher a second shipment of arms consisting of 7 300 springfield rifles 1 930 pistols 10 gatling guns and nearly 3 000 000 cartridges arms were to be shipped in mid june to surabaya in east indies on holland american steamship ss however intelligence network operated by courtenay bennett consul general to new york was able to trace cargo to tauscher in new york and passed information on to company thwarting these plans as well in meantime even after february plot had been scuttled plans for an uprising continued in bengal through jugantar cohort under jatin mukherjee bagha jatin german agents in thailand and burma most prominently emil and theodor brothers of german finance minister karl helfferich established links with jugantar through lahiri in march that year in april jatin s chief lieutenant narendranath bhattacharya met with and was informed of expected arrival of maverick with arms although these were originally intended for ghadar use berlin committee modified plans to have arms shipped into india to eastern coast of india through on chittagong coast in sundarbans and balasore in orissa instead of karachi as originally decided from coast of bay of bengal these would be collected by jatin s group date of insurrection was fixed for christmas day 1915 earning name christmas day plot jatin estimated that he would be able to win over 14th rajput regiment in calcutta and cut line to madras at balasore and thus take control of bengal jugantar also received funds estimated to be rs 33 000 between june and august 1915 from helfferich brothers through a fictitious firm in calcutta however it was at this time that details of maverick and jugantar plans were leaked to beckett british consul at batavia by a defecting baltic german agent under alias oren maverick was seized while in india police destroyed underground movement in calcutta as an unaware jatin proceeded according to plan to bay of bengal coast in balasore he was followed there by indian police and on 9 september 1915 he and a group of five revolutionaries armed with mauser pistols made a last stand on banks of river burha balang seriously wounded in a gun battle that lasted seventy five minutes jatin died next day in town of balasore to provide bengal group enough time to capture calcutta and to prevent reinforcements from being rushed in a mutiny coinciding with jugantar s christmas day insurrection was planned for burma with arms smuggled in from neutral thailand thailand siam was a strong base for ghadarites and plans for rebellion in burma which was a part of british india at time had been proposed by ghadar party as early as october 1914 which called for burma to be used as a base for subsequent advance into india this siam burma plan was finally concluded in january 1915 ghadarites from branches in china and united states including atma ram singh and banta singh from shanghai and santokh singh and bhagwan singh from san francisco attempted to infiltrate burma military police in thailand which was composed mostly of sikhs and punjabi muslims early in 1915 atma ram had also visited calcutta and punjab and linked up with revolutionary underground there including jugantar herambalal gupta and german consul at chicago arranged to have german operatives george paul boehm henry schult and albert sent to siam through manila with purpose of training indians santokh singh returned to shanghai tasked to send two expeditions one to reach indian border via yunnan and other to penetrate upper burma and join with revolutionary elements there germans while in manila also attempted to transfer arms cargo of two german ships sachsen and to siam in a schooner seeking refuge at manila harbour however us customs stopped these attempts in meantime with help of german consul to thailand remy ghadarite established a training headquarters in jungles near thai burma border for ghadarites arriving from china and canada german consul general at shanghai knipping sent three officers of peking embassy guard for training and in addition arranged for a norwegian agent in swatow to smuggle arms through however thai police high command which was largely british discovered these plans and indian police infiltrated plot through an indian secret agent who was revealed details by austrian charge d affaires thailand although officially neutral was allied closely with britain and british india on 21 july newly arrived british minister herbert presented foreign minister prince with request for arrest and extradition of ghadarites identified by indian agent ultimately resulting in arrest of leading ghadarites in august only a single raid into burma was launched by six ghadarites who were captured and later hanged also to coincide with proposed jugantar insurrection in calcutta was a planned raid on penal colony in andaman islands with a german volunteer force raised from east indies raid would release political prisoners helping to raise an expeditionary indian force that would threaten indian coast plan was proposed by vincent kraft a german planter in batavia who had been wounded fighting in france it was approved by foreign office on 14 may 1915 after consultation with indian committee and raid was planned for christmas day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred germans knipping made plans for shipping arms to andaman islands however vincent kraft was a double agent and leaked details of knipping s plans to british intelligence his own bogus plans for raid were in meantime revealed to beckett by oren but given successive failures of indo german plans plans for operations were abandoned on recommendations of both berlin committee and knipping afghanistan and middle east thumb right mahendra pratap centre at head of mission with german and turkish delegates in kabul 1915 seated to his right is werner otto von hentig another arm of conspiracy was directed at indian troops who were serving in middle east while efforts were directed at drawing afghanistan into war on side of central powers which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan islamic uprising in india and destabilise british recruiting grounds in punjab and across india after russia s defeat in 1905 russo japanese war her influence had declined and it was afghanistan that was at time seen by britain as only power in sub continent capable of directly threatening india in spring of 1915 an indo german expedition was sent to afghanistan via overland route through persia led by exiled indian prince raja mahendra pratap this mission sought to invite afghan emir habibullah khan to break with britain declare his independence join war on central side and invade british india it managed to evade considerable anglo russian efforts that were directed at intercepting it in mesopotamia and in persian deserts before it reached afghanistan in august 1915 in afghanistan it was joined in kabul by members of pan islamic group darul uloom deoband led by maulana ubaidullah sindhi this group had left india for kabul at beginning of war while another group under mahmud al hasan made its way to hijaz where they hoped to seek support from afghan emir ottoman empire and imperial germany for a pan islamic insurrection beginning in tribal belt of north west india indo german mission pressed emir habibullah to break from his neutral stance and open diplomatic relations with germany eventually hoping to rally emir to german war effort habibullah khan vacillated on mission s proposals through much of winter of 1915 hoping to maintain his neutral stance till course of war offered a concrete picture however mission opened at this time secret negotiations with pro german elements in emir s court and advisory council including his brother nasrullah khan and son amanullah khan it found support among afghan intellectuals religious leaders and afghan press which rallied with increasingly anti british and pro central articles by 1916 raj was forced to intercept copies of afghan newspaper siraj al akhbar sent to india it raised to emir a threat of a coup d etat in his country and unrest among his tribesmen who were beginning to see him as subservient to british authority even as turkey called for a pan islamic jihad in december 1915 indian members founded provisional government of india which it was hoped would weigh on habibullah s advisory council to aid india and force emir s hands in january 1916 emir approved a draft treaty with germany to buy time however central campaign in middle east faltered at around this time ending hopes that an overland route through persia could be secured for aid and assistance to afghanistan german members of mission left afghanistan in june 1916 ending german intrigues in country nonetheless mahendra pratap and his provisional government stayed behind attempting to establish links with japan republican china and tsarist russia after russian revolution pratap opened negotiations with soviet union visiting trotsky in red petrograd in 1918 and lenin in moscow in 1919 and he visited kaiser in berlin in 1918 he pressed for a joint soviet german offensive through afghanistan into india this was considered by soviets for some time after 1919 coup in afghanistan in which amanullah khan was instated as emir and third anglo afghan war began pratap may also have influenced kalmyk project a soviet plan to invade india through tibet and himalayan buffer states in middle eastern theatre members of berlin committee including har dayal and m p t acharya were sent on missions to baghdad and syria in summer of 1915 tasked to infiltrate indian expeditionary force in southern mesopotamia and egypt and to attempt to assassinate british officers indian effort was divided into two groups one consisting of a bengali revolutionary p n dutt alias dawood ali khan and pandurang this group arrived at bushire where they worked with wilhelm wassmuss and distributed nationalist and revolutionary literature among indian troops in mesopotamia and persia other group working with egyptian nationalists attempted to block suez canal these groups carried out successful clandestine work in spreading nationalist literature and propaganda amongst indian troops in mesopotamia and on one occasion even bombed an officer s mess nationalist work also extended at this time to recruiting indian prisoners of war in constantinople bushire kut al amara m p t acharya s own works were directed at forming indian national volunteer corps with help of indian civilians in turkey and to recruiting indian prisoners of war he is further known to have worked along with wilhelm wassmuss in bushire amongst indian troops efforts were however ultimately hampered by differences between berlin committee members who were predominantly hindus and indian revolutionaries already in turkey who were largely muslims further egyptian nationalists distrusted berlin committee which was seen by former as a german instrument nonetheless in culmination of these efforts indian prisoners of war from france turkey germany and mesopotamia especially basra bushehr and from kut al amara were recruited raising indian volunteer corps that fought with turkish forces on many fronts led by amba prasad sufi attempted to organise incursions to western border of india from persia through balochistan to punjab amba prasad was joined during war by kedar nath rishikesh and amin chaudhry these indian troops were involved in capture of frontier city of karman and detention of british consul there and also successfully harassed percy sykes persian campaign against baluchi and persian tribal chiefs who were aided by germans aga khan s brother was killed while fighting rebels rebels also successfully harassed british forces in sistan in afghanistan confining them to in balochistan and later moving towards karachi some reports indicate they took control of coastal towns of and baluchi chief of having declared his independence from british rule also joined ghadarites but war in europe turned for worse for turkey and baghdad was captured by british forces ghadarite forces their supply lines starved were finally dislodged they retreated to regroup at shiraz where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during siege of shiraz amba prasad sufi was killed in this battle but ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with iranian partisans until 1919 by end of 1917 divisions had begun appearing between ghadar party in america on one hand and berlin committee and german high command on other reports from german agents working with ghadarites in southeast asia and united states clearly indicated to european wing a significant element of disorganisation as well as in gauging public mood and support within ghadarite organisation failure of february plot lack of bases in southeast asia following china s participation in war in 1917 and problems of supporting a southeast asian operation through sea stemmed plans significantly infiltration by british agents change in american attitude and stance and changing fortunes of war meant massive conspiracy for revolution within india never succeeded counter intelligence british intelligence began to note and track outlines and nascent ideas of conspiracy by as early as 1911 incidents like delhi lahore conspiracy and komagata maru incident had already alerted criminal investigation department cid of existence of a large scale network and plans for pan indian militant unrest measures were taken which focussed on bengal seat of most intense revolutionary terrorism at time and on punjab which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in wake of komagata maru har dayal s extant group was found to have strong links with rash behari bose and were cleaned up in wake of delhi bomb case in asia at outbreak of war punjab cid sent teams to hong kong to intercept and infiltrate returning ghadarites who often made little effort to hide their plans and objectives these teams were successful in uncovering details of full scale of conspiracy and in discovering har dayal s whereabouts immigrants returning to india were double checked against a list of revolutionaries in punjab cid although aware of possible plans for unrest was not successful in infiltrating conspiracy for mutiny until february 1915 a dedicated force was formed headed by chief of punjab cid and including amongst its members liaqat hayat khan later head of punjab cid himself in february that year cid was successful in recruiting services of kirpal singh to infiltrate plan singh who had a ghadarite cousin serving in 23rd cavalry was able to infiltrate leadership being assigned to work in his cousin s regiment singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy but was able to pass on information regarding date and scale of uprising to british indian intelligence as date for mutiny approached a desperate rash behari bose brought forward mutiny day to evening of 19 february which was discovered by kirpal singh on very day no attempts were made by ghadarites to restrain him and he rushed to inform liaqat hayat khan of change of plans ordered back to his station to signal when revolutionaries had assembled singh was detained by would be mutineers but managed to escape under cover of answering call of nature role of german or baltic german double agents especially agent named oren was also important in infiltrating and preempting plans for autumn rebellions in bengal in 1915 and in as scuttling bagha jatin s plans in winter that year another source was german double agent vincent kraft a planter from batavia who passed information about arms shipments from shanghai to british agents after being captured maps of bengal coast were found on kraft when he was initially arrested and he volunteered information that these were intended landing sites for german arms kraft later fled through mexico to japan where he was last known to be at end of war later efforts by mahendra pratap s provisional government in kabul were also compromised by herambalal gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to indian intelligence in europe and middle east by time war broke out indian political intelligence office headed by john wallinger had expanded into europe in scale this office was larger than those operated by british war office approaching european intelligence network of secret service bureau this network already had agents in switzerland against possible german intrigues after outbreak of war wallinger under cover of an officer of british general headquarters proceeded to france where he operated from paris working with french political police surete among wallinger s recruits in network was somerset maugham who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit geneva while avoiding swiss interference among other enterprises european intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of indian leaders in europe a british agent named donald gullick was dispatched to assassinate virendranath chattopadhyaya while latter was on his way to geneva to meet mahendra pratap to offer kaiser wilhelm ii s invitation it is said that somerset maugham based several of his stories on his first hand experiences modelling character of john ashenden after himself and chandra lal after virendranath short story giulia lazzari is a blend of gullick s attempts to assassinate virendranath and mata hari s story winston churchill reportedly advised maugham to burn 14 other stories czech revolutionary network in europe also had a role in uncovering of bagha jatin s plans network was in touch with members in united states and may have also been aware of and involved in uncovering of earlier plots american network headed by e v voska was a counter espionage network of nearly 80 members who as habsburg subjects were presumed to be german supporters but were involved in spying on german and austrian diplomats voska had begun working with guy gaunt who headed courtenay bennett s intelligence network at outbreak of war and on learning of plot from czech european network passed on information to gaunt and to tomas masaryk who further passed on information american authorities in middle east british counter intelligence was directed at preserving loyalty of indian sepoy in face of turkish propaganda and concept of caliph s jihad while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting kabul mission east persian cordon was established in july 1915 in sistan province of persia to prevent germans from crossing into afghanistan and to protect british supply caravans in sarhad from damani reki and kurdish baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by german gold among commanders of sistan force was reginald dyer who led it between march and october 1916 in united states in united states conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by british intelligence through irish and indian channels activities of ghadar on pacific coast were noted by w c hopkinson who was born and raised in india and spoke fluent hindi initially hopkinson had been despatched from calcutta to keep indian police informed about doings of taraknath das home department of british indian government had begun task of actively tracking indian on east coast as early as 1910 francis cunliffe owen officer heading home office agency in new york had become thoroughly acquainted with george freeman alias fitzgerald and myron phelps famous new york advocate as members of clan na gael owens efforts were successful in thwarting ss moraitis plan ghadar party was incidentally established after irish republicans sensing infiltration encouraged formation of an exclusively indian society following this several approaches were adopted including infiltration through an indian national named bela singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to hopkinson and through use of famous american pinkerton s detective agency bela singh was later murdered in india in 1930s hopkinson was assassinated in a vancouver courthouse by a ghadarite named singh in october 1914 charles lamb an irish double agent is said to have passed on majority of information that compromised annie larsen and ultimately helped construction of prosecution an indian operative codenamed c and described most likely to have been adventurous chandra kanta chakravarty later chief prosecution witness in trial also passed on details of conspiracy to british and american intelligence trials conspiracy led to several trials in india most famous among them being lahore conspiracy trial which opened in lahore in april 1915 in aftermath of failed february mutiny other trials included benares simla delhi and ferozepur conspiracy cases and trials of those arrested at budge budge at lahore a special tribunal was constituted under defence of india act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial of these 42 were awarded death sentence 114 transported for life and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment several of these were sent to cellular jail in andaman islands forty two defendants in trial were acquitted lahore trial directly linked plans made in united states and february mutiny plot following conclusion of trial diplomatic effort to destroy indian revolutionary movement in united states and to bring its members to trial increased considerably in united states hindu german conspiracy trial commenced in district court in san francisco on 12 november 1917 following uncovering of annie larsen affair one hundred and five people participated including members of ghadar party former german consul general and vice consul and other members of staff of german consulate in san francisco trial itself lasted from 20 november 1917 to 24 april 1918 last day of trial was notable for sensational assassination of chief accused ram chandra by a fellow defendant ram singh in a packed courtroom singh himself was immediately shot dead by a us marshal in may 1917 eight indian nationalists of ghadar party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against britain in later years proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that united states was joining an imperialist war jury during trial was carefully selected to exclude any irish person with republican views or associations strong public support in favour of indians especially revived anglophobic sentiments following colonial provisions of treaty of versailles allowed ghadarite movement to be revived despite british concerns impact conspiracy had a significant impact on britain s policies both within empire and in international relations outlines and plans for nascent ideas of conspiracy were noted and tracked by british intelligence as early as 1911 alarmed at agile organisation which repeatedly reformed in different parts of country despite being subdued in others chief of indian intelligence sir charles cleveland was forced to warn that idea and attempts at pan indian revolutions were spreading through india like some hidden fire a massive concerted and coordinated effort was required to subdue movement attempts were made in 1914 to prevent naturalisation of tarak nath das as an american citizen while successful pressure was applied to have har dayal interned political impact conspiracy judged by british indian government s own evaluation at time and those of several contemporary and modern historians was an important event in indian independence movement and was one of significant threats faced by raj in second decade of 20th century in scenario of british war effort and threat from militant movement in india it was a major factor for passage of defence of india act 1915 among strongest proponents of act was michael o dwyer then lieutenant governor of punjab and this was largely due to ghadarite movement it was also a factor that guided british political concessions and whitehall s india policy during and after world war i including passage of montagu chelmsford reforms which initiated first round of political reform in indian subcontinent in 1917 events of conspiracy during world war i presence of pratap s kabul mission in afghanistan and its possible links to soviet union and a still active revolutionary movement especially in punjab and bengal as well as worsening civil unrest throughout india led to appointment of a sedition committee in 1918 chaired by sidney rowlatt an english judge it was tasked to evaluate german and bolshevik links to militant movement in india especially in punjab and bengal on recommendations of committee rowlatt act an extension of defence of india act 1915 was enforced in india events that followed passage of rowlatt act in 1919 were also influenced by conspiracy at time british indian army troops were returning from battlefields of europe and mesopotamia to an economic depression in india attempts of mutiny in 1915 and lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention news of young who fought on behalf of turkish caliphate and later fought in ranks of red army during russian civil war was also beginning to reach india russian revolution had also cast its long shadow into india it was at this time that mahatma gandhi until then relatively unknown in indian political scene began emerging as a mass leader ominously in 1919 third anglo afghan war began in wake of amir habibullah s assassination and institution of amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by kabul mission in addition in india gandhi s call for protest against rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests situation especially in punjab was deteriorating rapidly with disruptions of rail telegraph and communication systems movement was at its peak before end of first week of april with some recording that practically whole of lahore was on streets immense crowd that passed through anarkali was estimated to be around 20 000 in amritsar over 5 000 people gathered at jallianwala bagh this situation deteriorated perceptibly over next few days michael o dwyer is said to have been of firm belief that these were early and ill concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around may on lines of 1857 revolt at a time when british troops would have withdrawn to hills for summer amritsar massacre as well as responses preceding and succeeding it was end result of a concerted plan of response from punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy james houssemayne du boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between fear of a ghadarite uprising in midst of an increasingly situation in punjab and british response that ended in massacre lastly british efforts to downplay and disguise nature and impact of revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen moderate movement in india which ultimately saw gandhi s rise in indian movement international relations conspiracy influenced several aspects of great britain s international relations most of all anglo american relations during war as well as to some extent anglo chinese relations after war it was one of issues that influenced anglo japanese relations at start of war american government s refusal to check indian seditionist movement was a major concern for british government by 1916 a majority of resources of american department of british foreign office were related to indian seditionist movement before outbreak of war political commitments of wilson government especially of secretary of state william jennings bryan who had eight years previously had authored british rule in india a highly critical pamphlet that was classified as seditionist by indian and imperial governments and political fallouts of perception of persecution of oppressed people by britain prevented then ambassador cecil spring rice from pressing issue diplomatically after robert lansing replaced bryan as secretary of state in 1916 secretary of state for india marquess of crewe and foreign secretary edward grey forced spring rice to raise issue and evidences obtained in lahore conspiracy trial were presented to american government in february first investigations were opened in america at this time with raid of wall street office of wolf von igel resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in hindu german conspiracy trial however a perceptibly slow and reluctant american investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916 aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of british far eastern fleet on high seas that threatened sovereignty of american vessels german and turkish passengers were seized from american vessel china by hms at mouth of yangtze river several incidents followed including ss henry s which were defended by british government on grounds that seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in india these drew strong responses from us government prompting us atlantic fleet to dispatch destroyers to pacific to protect sovereignty of american vessels authorities in philippines were more cooperative which assured britain of knowledge of any plans against hong kong strained relations were relaxed in may 1916 when britain released china prisoners and relaxed its aggressive policy seeking co operation with united states however diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before november that year conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by william g e wiseman head of british intelligence in united states when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to new york police bypassing diplomatic channels this led to arrest of chandra kanta as links between s papers and igel papers became apparent investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover entire conspiracy ultimately united states agreed to forward evidence so long as britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality at a time that diplomatic relations with germany were deteriorating british foreign office directed its embassy to co operate with investigations resolving anglo american diplomatic disputes just as united states entered war through 1915 16 china and indonesia were major bases for conspirators and significant efforts were made by british government to coax china into war to attempt to control german and ghadar intrigues this would also allow free purchase of arms from china for entente powers however yuan s proposals for bringing china into war were against japanese interests and gains from war this along with japanese support for sun yat sen and rebels in southern china laid foundations for deterioration of anglo japanese relations as early as 1916 after end of great war japan increasingly became a haven for radical indian nationalists in exile who were protected by patriotic japanese societies notable among these were rash behari bose tarak nath das and a m sahay protections offered to these nationalists most notably by toyama mitsuru s black dragon society effectively prevented british efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern ghadar party and iic iic was formally disbanded in november 1918 most of its members became closely associated with communism and soviet union dutta and virendranath chattopadhyay alias chatto arrived in moscow in 1920 narendranath bhattacharya under a new identity of m n roy was among first indian communists and made a memorable speech in second congress of communist international that rejected leninist views and foreshadowed maoist peasant movements chatto himself was in berlin until 1932 as general secretary of league against imperialism and was able to convince jawaharlal nehru to affiliate indian national congress with league in 1927 he later fled nazi germany for soviet union but disappeared in 1937 under joseph stalin s great purge ghadar party suppressed during war revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs although sidelined in california it remained relatively stronger in east asia where it allied itself with chinese communist party world war ii although conspiracy failed during world war i movement being suppressed at time and several of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated several prominent ghadarites also managed to flee india to japan and thailand concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation indian leaders most notably subhas chandra bose who towards mid 1930s began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination during world war ii several of these leaders were instrumental in seeking axis support to revive such a concept bose himself from very beginning of world war ii actively evaluated concept of revolutionary movement against raj interacting with japan and subsequently escaping to germany to raise an indian armed force indische legion to fight in india against britain he later returned to southeast asia to take charge of indian national army which was formed following labour of exiled nationalists efforts from within japan to revive a similar concept and direction and leadership of people like mohan singh giani pritam singh and rash behari bose most famous of these saw formation of indian independence league indian national army and ultimately e azad hind in southeast asia commemoration thumb 1915 singapore mutiny memorial tablet at entrance of victoria memorial hall singapore

conspiracy indo german conspiracy ghadar conspiracy or ghadr conspiracy or german plot term hindu german conspiracy is closely associated with uncovering of annie larsen plot in united states and ensuing trial of indian nationalists and staff of german consulate of san francisco for violating american neutrality trial itself was called hindu german conspiracy trial and conspiracy was reported in media and later studied by several historians as hindu german conspiracy however conspiracy involved not only hindus and germans but also substantial numbers of muslims and punjabi sikhs and strong irish support that pre dated german and turkish involvement term hindu or hindoo was used commonly in opprobrium in america to identify indians regardless of religion likewise conspiracy was also a term with negative connotations term hindu conspiracy was used by government to actively discredit indian revolutionaries at a time united states was about to join war against germany term ghadar conspiracy may refer more specifically to mutiny planned for february 1915 in india while term german plot or christmas day plot may refer more specifically to plans for shipping arms to jatin mukherjee in autumn 1915 term indo german conspiracy is also commonly used to refer to later plans in southeast asia and to mission to kabul which remained remnant of conspiracy at end of war all of these were parts of larger conspiracy most scholars reviewing american aspect use name hindu german conspiracy hindu conspiracy or ghadar conspiracy while most reviewing conspiracy over its entire span from southeast asia through europe to united states more often use term indo german conspiracy in british india rowlatt committee set up investigate events referred to them as seditious
