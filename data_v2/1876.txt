to handle a draken observation balloon balloon was linked to ship via a telephone line and was used to spot naval mines scout for fleet and to observe fall of shot from ships this was first time italian navy experimented with aircraft of any sort at sea initial tests were held off calabria in company with liguria which was similarly modified during annual fleet maneuvers in 1908 elba and her balloon were used to keep watch on harbor entrance of augusta sicily which proved to be effective in alerting defenders to attacking warships by outbreak of italo turkish war in september 1911 elba had been stationed in italy s east african colonies eritrea and somaliland ship operated without her balloon as fleet relied solely on ground based airships for duration of war in january 1912 she and her sister escorted a pair of mail steamships to red sea where they were used to enforce blockade of several ottoman ports elba remained in region for remainder of war assisting in blockade effort ottoman naval forces had already been defeated at battle of bay so there was no chance for elba to see action ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in october ending war conversion to seaplane tender elba operated observation balloon through 1913 following year she was modified to serve as a depot ship for three seaplanes and she entered service in this new role on 4 june 1914 during this

cruisers elba was stationed in taranto in october where she served with main fleet following italy s entry into world war i in may 1915 she used her aircraft to scout for fleet but with only a maximum of four aircraft she could not provide continuous reconnaissance screening in addition she lacked sufficient space for aircraft fuel storage and workshops to repair seaplanes which hampered her ability to keep her limited number of aircraft operational like many of other conversions of similar vessels in foreign navies elba was too small and too slow for her intended role and she was retired in 1916 by this time more effective tender had entered service she remained in italian inventory until 4 january 1920 when she was sold for scrap notes references category regioni class cruisers
