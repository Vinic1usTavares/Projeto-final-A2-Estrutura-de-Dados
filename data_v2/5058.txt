crescent honeyeater phylidonyris pyrrhopterus is a passerine bird of honeyeater family meliphagidae native to southeastern australia a member of genus phylidonyris it is most closely related to common new holland honeyeater p novaehollandiae and white cheeked honeyeater p niger two subspecies are recognized with p p halmaturinus restricted in range to kangaroo island and mount lofty ranges in south australia it has dark grey plumage and paler underparts highlighted by yellow wing patches and a broad black crescent outlined in white down sides of its breast species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism with female being duller in colour than male juvenile birds are similar to female though yellow wing patches of male nestlings can be easily distinguished male has a complex and variable song which is heard throughout year it sings from an exposed perch and during breeding season performs song flights crescent honeyeater is found in areas of dense vegetation including sclerophyll forest and alpine habitats as well as heathland and parks and gardens where its diet is made up of nectar and invertebrates it forms long term pairs and often stays committed to one breeding site for several years female builds nest and does most of caring for two to three young which become independent within 40 days of laying its egg parent birds use a range of anti predator strategies but nestlings can be taken by snakes currawongs or cats while crescent honeyeater faces a number of threats its population numbers and distribution are sufficient for it to be listed as of least concern for conservation taxonomy crescent honeyeater was originally described by ornithologist john latham in 1801 as certhia pyrrhoptera because of an assumed relationship with treecreepers certhia it was later named certhia by george shaw in 1812 melithreptus by louis jean pierre vieillot in 1817 and meliphaga by john gould in 1838 generic term comes from french which combines names for a honeyeater and a sunbird previously thought to belong to same family specific epithet is derived from ancient greek stems pyrrhos meaning fire and pteron meaning wing in reference to yellow wing patches some guidebooks have binomial name written as phylidonyris pyrrhoptera however a review in 2001 ruled that genus name was masculine hence pyrrhopterus is correct specific name two subspecies are recognised nominate form p p pyrrhopterus over most of its range and p p halmaturinus which is restricted to kangaroo island and mount lofty ranges a 2004 molecular study showed its close relatives to be new holland honeyeater and white cheeked honeyeater three forming now small genus phylidonyris a 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear dna found white streaked honeyeater to also lie within clade ancestor of crescent honeyeater diverged from lineage giving rise to white streaked new holland and white cheeked honeyeaters around 7 5 million years ago dna analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to pardalotidae pardalotes acanthizidae australian warblers scrubwrens thornbills etc and maluridae australian fairy wrens in large superfamily meliphagoidea other common names for crescent honeyeater include egypt and horseshoe honeyeater gould called it tasmanian honeyeater description appearance crescent honeyeater measures in length with a wingspan of and weighs about it is sexually dimorphic with female a paler version of male male is dark grey with clear yellow wing patches with a broad black crescent outlined in white down sides of its breast and a white streak above his eye top of tail is black with yellow edges to feathers forming distinctive yellow panels on sides of tail white tips on undertail are usually only visible in flight underparts are pale brownish grey fading to white female is duller olive brown with faded yellow wing patches with similar though less clear crescentic markings both sexes have dark grey legs and feet deep ruby eyes and a long downcurved black bill gape is also black young birds are similar to adults though not as strongly marked and have dark grey bills duller brown eyes and yellow gapes male nestlings can be distinguished by their more extensive yellow wing patches from seven days old moulting patterns of species are poorly known crescent honeyeaters appear to replace their primary flight feathers between october and january while both subspecies have same general appearance female of halmaturinus has paler plumage than nominate race and both male and female have a smaller wing and tail and longer bill halmaturinus population on kangaroo island has a significantly shorter wing and longer bill than mount lofty population although this size variation of an insular form is at odds with allen s and bergmann s rules vocalisation crescent honeyeater has a range of musical calls and songs one study recorded chatter alarm calls similar to new holland honeyeater a number of harsh monosyllabic or tri syllabic contact calls and complex and diverse songs most common contact call is a loud carrying e while alarm call is a sharp and rapid chip chip chip male also has a melodic song which is heard throughout year at any time of day structure of song is complex and diverse and includes both a descending whistle and a musical two note call male s song is performed from an exposed perch or within tree canopy and it engages in mating displays song flights during breeding season when female is on nest and male nearby they utter low soft notes identified as whisper song distribution and habitat thumb right alt male crescent honeyeater feeding on a flower in a dense correa shrub feeding in a correa shrub there are records of scattered populations of crescent honeyeater on central tablelands mid north coast and in hunter region of new south wales and it is widespread in areas of new south wales south of dharug national park and east of bathurst in victoria it is widespread across an area from nsw border south west to with scattered populations recorded further west it is widespread in tasmania except in north east part of state where it is more sparsely distributed it is restricted to sclerophyll forest in eastern south australia where isolated populations have been recorded in mount lofty ranges and on kangaroo island local influxes have occurred outside its normal range in response to changes in habitat recorded population densities range from near orbost to in boola boola state forest also in victoria while crescent honeyeater occupies a wide variety of habitats including coastal heath rainforest wet sclerophyll forest mountain forest alpine woodland damp gullies and thick tea tree scrub they all demonstrate its preference for dense vegetation it has been frequently recorded in wet sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalypts and with a thick mid story and understory of shrubs such as blackwood silver wattle cassinia prostanthera and correa at higher altitudes it occurs in alpine heathlands and in woodlands of stunted eucalypt or conifers movements of crescent honeyeater within its range are incompletely known there is widespread evidence of seasonal migration to lower altitudes in cooler months yet a proportion of population remains sedentary autumn and winter migration to lowland coastal areas is seen in southern tasmania where it is not unusual to see it in urban parks and gardens as well as gippsland and new south wales central and south coast in sydney region some birds appear to move down from blue mountains to sydney for cooler months yet others remain in either location for whole year it is only seen in alpine and subalpine areas of snowy mountains in warmer snow free months mainly october to april other populations of crescent honeyeaters follow a more nomadic pattern of following food sources this has been recorded in blue mountains and parts of victoria behaviour thumb right juvenile male in tasmania australia thumb right alt a female crescent honeyeater feeding while hanging upside down from a spray of tubular flowers female feeding on nectar breeding crescent honeyeaters occupy territories during breeding season of july to march with pairs often staying on in territory at end of season and committing to one breeding site for several years banding studies have recaptured birds within metres of nest in which they were raised and one female was re trapped at banding place almost ten years later pairs nest solitarily or in loose colonies with nests around apart male defends territory which is used both for foraging and breeding though during breeding season he is more active in protecting area and therefore much more vocal during courtship male performs song flights soaring with quivering wings and continuously calling with a high piping note female builds nest close to boundary of territory usually near water low in shrubs it is a deep cup shaped bulky nest of cobweb bark grass twigs roots and other plant materials lined with grass down moss and fur long strips of bark from stringybark or messmate trees are often used clutch size is 2 or 3 occasionally 4 measuring by eggs are pale pink sometimes buff tinged with lavender and chestnut splotches base colour is darker at larger end female incubates and broods eggs but both sexes feed nestlings and remove fecal sacs although female does majority of caring for young young birds are fed insects with flies making up much of regurgitated material according to one study incubation period is 13 days followed by a fledging period of 13 days parent birds feed fledglings for around two weeks after they leave nest but young do not remain long in parents territory young are independent within 40 days of egg laying parent birds have been observed using a range of anti predator strategies female staying on nest until almost touched one or other of pair performing distraction displays fluttering wings and moving across ground female flying rapidly at intruder and both birds giving harsh scolding calls when a kookaburra tiger snake or currawong approached nests of crescent honeyeater are usually low in shrubs which makes birds and their young vulnerable to predation by birds and snakes however domestic and feral cats are most likely predators to hunt this species crescent honeyeaters pair in long term relationships that often last for whole year however while they are socially monogamous they appear to be sexually promiscuous one study found that only 42 of nestlings were sired by male partner at nest despite paternity guards such as pairing and territorial defence crescent honeyeaters observed exhibited a number of characteristics consistent with genetic promiscuity sexual dimorphism with sex specific plumages identifiable at nestling stage reduced male contribution to feeding and caring for young vigorous defence of territory by male and frequent intrusions into other territories by females which were tolerated by males holding those territories feeding crescent honeyeater is arboreal foraging mainly among foliage and flowers in understory and tree canopy on nectar fruits and small insects it has been recorded eating honeydew of psyllids soft scale and felt scale insects it feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar and gleaning foliage and bark and sallying for insects while regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in loose feeding flocks and gathering in large groups at productive food sources a study in forest near hobart in tasmania found that crescent honeyeater s diet was wholly composed of insects during breeding season but nectar was a significant component during winter insects consumed include moths and flies and tree trunks were site of foraging around two thirds of time and foliage a third it fed on nectar as plants came into flower in autumn and winter and then foraged in tasmanian blue gum eucalyptus globulus during breeding season in spring flowering of royal grevillea grevillea victoriae over summer in subalpine areas in snowy mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters it feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath astroloma it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of banksia species waratah telopea plate 3 tubular flowered genera including astroloma epacris and correa mistletoes of genus amyema and eucalypts in mount lofty ranges in south australia in bondi state forest it was also recorded feeding at cluster flower geebung persoonia confertiflora native holly lomatia ilicifolia tall shaggy pea arborescens silver wattle acacia dealbata and blackthorn bursaria spinosa local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in south australia populations on kangaroo island forage more often at adenanthos flowers than those in nearby fleurieu peninsula while latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms and at a higher diversity of plants overall conservation status while population numbers and distribution are sufficient for crescent honeyeater to be listed as of least concern for conservation numbers have fluctuated significantly over past twenty five years and currently seem to be in decline threats to crescent honeyeater include habitat destruction as alpine forests in which it breeds are being reduced by weed infestations severe bush fires drought and land clearing crescent honeyeater s dependence on long term partnerships and breeding territories means that breeding success is threatened by death of one partner or destruction of habitual territory influx of birds to urban areas also places them at increased risk of accidents and predation cats have been recorded preying on crescent honeyeaters and at least one guide urges cat owners to keep their cats in enclosures when outside house or to provide a stimulating indoor environment for them references external links crescent honeyeater category birds of new south wales category birds of south australia category birds of tasmania category
