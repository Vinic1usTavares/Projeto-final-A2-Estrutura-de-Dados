there are 19 229 known neos divided into several orbital subgroups a near earth object neo is any small solar system body whose orbit brings it to proximity with earth by convention a solar system body is a neo if its closest approach to sun perihelion is less than 1 3 astronomical units au if a neo s orbit crosses earth s and object is larger than across it is considered a potentially hazardous object pho most known phos and neos are asteroids but a small fraction are comets there are over 20 000 known near earth asteroids neas over a hundred short period near earth comets necs and a number of solar orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids large enough to be tracked in space before striking earth it is now widely accepted that collisions in past have had a significant role in shaping geological and biological history of earth neos have become of increased interest since 1980s because of greater awareness of potential danger asteroids as small as 20 m can damage local environment and populations larger asteroids penetrate atmosphere to surface of earth producing craters or tsunamis asteroid impact avoidance by deflection is possible in principle and methods of mitigation are being researched based on how well constrained orbit calculations of identified neos are two scales torino scale and more complex palermo scale rate a risk some neos have had temporarily positive torino or palermo scale ratings after their discovery but more precise calculations based on longer observation arcs led to a reduction of rating to or below 0 in all cases since 1998 united states european union and other nations are scanning for neos in an effort called spaceguard initial us congress mandate to nasa of cataloging at least 90 of neos that are at least in diameter which could cause a global catastrophe had been met by 2011 in later years survey effort has been expanded to smaller objects having potential for large scale though not global damage neos have low surface gravity and many have earth like orbits making them easy targets for spacecraft five near earth comets and five near earth asteroids have been visited by spacecraft a small sample was returned to earth in 2010 and similar missions are in progress preliminary plans for commercial asteroid mining have been drafted by private companies definitions thumb plot of orbits of known potentially hazardous asteroids size over and passing within of earth s orbit as of early 2013 alternate image major technical astronomical definition for near earth objects neos are small solar system bodies with orbits around sun that by definition lie partly between 0 983 perihelion and 1 3 aphelion astronomical units au sun earth distance away from sun thus neos are not necessarily currently near earth but they can potentially approach earth relatively closely however term is also used more flexibly sometimes for example for objects in orbit around earth or for quasi satellites which have a more complex orbital relationship with earth when a neo is detected like all other small solar system bodies it is submitted to international astronomical union s iau s minor planet center mpc for cataloging mpc maintains separate lists of confirmed neos and potential neos orbits of some neos intersect that of earth so they pose a collision danger these are considered potentially hazardous objects phos if their estimated diameter is above 140 meters for asteroids among phos potentially hazardous asteroids phas mpc maintains a separate list neos are also catalogued by two separate units of jet propulsion laboratory jpl of national aeronautics and space administration nasa center for near earth object studies cneos and solar system dynamics group phas are currently defined based on parameters relating to their potential to approach earth dangerously closely mostly objects with an earth minimum orbit intersection distance moid of 0 05 au or less and an absolute magnitude of 22 0 or brighter a rough indicator of large size are considered phas objects that cannot approach closer to earth i e moid than or are smaller than about in diameter i e h 22 0 with assumed albedo of 14 are not considered phas nasa s catalog of near earth objects also includes approach distances of asteroids and comets expressed in lunar distances history of human awareness of neos thumb 1910 drawing of path of halley s comet thumb near earth asteroid 433 eros was visited by a probe in 1990s first near earth objects to be observed by humans were comets their extraterrestrial nature was recognised and confirmed only after tycho brahe tried to measure distance of a comet through its parallax in 1577 and periodicity of some comets was recognised in 1705 when edmond halley first published his orbit calculations for returning object now known as halley s comet 1758 1759 return of halley s comet was first comet appearance predicted in advance it has been said that lexell s comet of 1770 was first discovered near earth object first near earth asteroid to be discovered was 433 eros in 1898 asteroid was subject to several observation campaigns primarily because measurements of its orbit enabled a precise determination of then imperfectly known distance of earth from sun in 1937 asteroid hermes was discovered when it passed earth at twice distance of moon hermes was considered a threat because it was lost after its discovery thus its orbit and potential for collision with earth were not known precisely hermes was re discovered in 2003 and is now known to be no threat for at least next century on june 14 1968 1 4 km diameter asteroid 1566 icarus passed earth at a distance of or 16 times distance of moon during this approach icarus became first minor planet to be observed using radar with measurements obtained at haystack observatory and goldstone tracking station this was first close approach predicted years in advance icarus had been discovered in 1949 and also earned significant public attention due to alarmist news reports a year before approach mit students launched project icarus devising a plan to deflect asteroid with rockets in case it was found to be on a collision course with earth project icarus received wide media coverage and inspired 1979 disaster movie meteor in which us and ussr join forces to blow up an earth bound fragment of an asteroid hit by a comet on march 23 1989 diameter apollo asteroid asclepius 1989 fc missed earth by if asteroid had impacted it would have created largest explosion in recorded history equivalent to 20 000 megatons of tnt it attracted widespread attention because it was discovered only after closest approach in march 1998 early orbit calculations for recently discovered asteroid showed a potential 2028 close approach from earth well within orbit of moon but with a large error margin allowing for a direct hit further data allowed a revision of 2028 approach distance to with no chance of collision by that time inaccurate reports of a potential impact had caused a media storm thumb center 600px known near earth objects as of january 0 55 july 23 2018 risk thumb asteroid 4179 toutatis is a potentially hazardous object that passed within 4 lunar distances in september 2004 and currently has a minimum possible distance of 2 5 lunar distances from late 1990s a typical frame of reference in searches for neos has been scientific concept of risk risk that any near earth object poses is viewed having regard to both culture and technology of human society through history humans have associated neos with changing risks based on religious philosophical or scientific views as well as humanity s technological or economical capability to deal with such risks thus neos have been seen as omens of natural disasters or wars harmless spectacles in an unchanging universe source of era changing cataclysms or potentially poisonous fumes during earth s passage through tail of halley s comet in 1910 and finally as a possible cause of a crater forming impact that could even cause extinction of humans and other life on earth potential of catastrophic impacts by near earth comets was recognised as soon as first orbit calculations provided an understanding of their orbits in 1694 edmond halley presented a theory that noah s flood in bible was caused by a comet impact human perception of near earth asteroids as benign objects of fascination or killer objects with high risk to human society has ebbed and flowed during short time that neas have been scientifically observed scientists have recognised threat of impacts that create craters much bigger than impacting bodies and have indirect effects on an even wider area since 1980s after confirmation of a theory that cretaceous paleogene extinction event in which dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago was caused by a large asteroid impact awareness of wider public of impact risk rose after observation of impact of fragments of comet shoemaker levy 9 into jupiter in july 1994 in 1998 movies deep impact and armageddon popularised notion that near earth objects could cause catastrophic impacts also at that time a conspiracy theory arose about supposed 2003 impact of fictitious planet nibiru which persisted on internet as predicted impact date was moved to 2012 and then 2017 risk scales there are two schemes for scientific classification of impact hazards from neos simple torino scale which rates risks of impacts in next 100 years according to impact energy and impact probability using integer numbers between 0 and 10 and more complex palermo technical impact hazard scale which ascribes ratings that can be any positive or negative real number these ratings depend on background impact frequency impact probability and time until possible impact on both scales risks of any concern are indicated by values above zero magnitude of risk annual background frequency used in palermo scale for impacts of energy greater than e megatonnes is estimated as for instance this formula implies that expected value of time from now until next impact greater than 1 is 33 years and that when it occurs there is a 50 chance that it will be above 2 4 megatonnes this formula is only valid over a certain range of e however another paper published in 2002 same year as paper on that palermo scale is based found a power law with different constants this formula gives considerably lower rates for a given e for instance it gives rate for of 10 megatonnes or more like tunguska explosion as 1 per thousand years rather than 1 per 210 years as in palermo formula however authors give a rather large uncertainty once in 400 to 1800 years for 10 megatonnes due in part to uncertainties in determining energies of atmospheric impacts that they used in their determination highly rated risks nasa maintains an automated system to evaluate threat from known neos over next 100 years which generates continuously updated sentry risk table all or nearly all of objects are highly likely to drop off list eventually as more observations come in reducing uncertainties and enabling more accurate orbital predictions in march 2002 became first asteroid with a positive rating on torino scale with about a 1 in 9 300 chance of an impact in 2049 additional observations reduced estimated risk to zero and asteroid was removed from sentry risk table in april 2002 it is now known that in next two centuries will pass earth at a safe closest distance perigee of on august 31 2080 thumb radar image of asteroid asteroid was lost after its 1950 discovery since its observations over just 17 days were insufficient to determine its orbit it was rediscovered on december 31 2000 it has a diameter of about a kilometer 0 6 miles it was also observed by radar during its close approach in 2001 allowing much more precise orbit calculations although this asteroid will not strike for at least 800 years and thus has no torino scale rating it was added to sentry list in april 2002 because it was first object with a palermo scale value greater than zero then calculated 1 in 300 maximum chance of impact and 0 17 palermo scale value was roughly 50 greater than background risk of impact by all similarly large objects until uncertainties in orbit calculations were further reduced using radar observations in 2012 and this decreased odds of an impact taking all radar and optical observations until 2015 into account probability of impact is assessed at 1 in 8 300 corresponding palermo scale value of 1 42 is still highest for all objects on sentry list table only one other object has a palermo scale value above 2 for a single impact date on december 24 2004 asteroid apophis at time known by its provisional designation was assigned a 4 on torino scale highest rating ever given as there was a 2 7 chance of earth impact on april 13 2029 by december 28 2004 additional observations had produced a smaller uncertainty zone which no longer included earth during 2029 approach 2029 risk of impact consequently dropped to zero but later potential impact dates were still rated 1 on torino scale 2036 risk was lowered to a torino rating of 0 in august 2006 calculations show apophis has no chance of impacting earth before 2060 in february 2006 has been assigned a torino scale rating of 2 due to a close encounter predicted for may 4 2102 after more precise calculations rating was lowered to 1 in may 2006 and 0 in october 2006 and asteroid was removed from sentry risk table entirely in february 2008 is listed with highest chance of impacting earth at 1 in 20 on september 5 2095 at only across asteroid however is much too small to be considered a potentially hazardous asteroid and poses no serious threat possible 2095 impact therefore rates only 3 32 on palermo scale observations during august 2022 close approach are expected to ascertain whether asteroid will impact earth in 2095 projects to minimize threat thumb 300px left neowise first four years of data starting in december 2013 animated april 20 2018 first astronomical program dedicated to discovery of near earth asteroids was palomar planet crossing asteroid survey started in 1973 by astronomers eugene shoemaker and eleanor link to impact hazard need for dedicated survey telescopes and options to head off an eventual impact were first discussed at a 1981 interdisciplinary conference in snowmass colorado plans for a more comprehensive survey named spaceguard survey were developed by nasa from 1992 under a mandate from united states congress to promote survey on an international level international astronomical union iau organised a workshop at vulcano italy in 1995 and set up spaceguard foundation also in italy a year later in 1998 united states congress gave nasa a mandate to detect 90 of near earth asteroids over diameter that threaten global devastation by 2008 several surveys have undertaken spaceguard activities an umbrella term including lincoln near earth asteroid research linear near earth asteroid tracking neat lowell observatory near earth object search catalina sky survey css campo imperatore near earth object survey japanese spaceguard association dlr asteroid survey and near earth object wise neowise as a result ratio of known and estimated total number of near earth asteroids larger than 1 km in diameter rose from about 20 in 1998 to 65 in 2004 80 in 2006 and 93 in 2011 original spaceguard goal has thus been met only three years late 893 neas larger than 1 km have been discovered or 97 of an estimated total of about 920 in 2005 original usa spaceguard mandate was extended by george e brown jr near earth object survey act which calls for nasa to detect 90 of neos with diameters of or greater by 2020 in january 2016 nasa announced creation of planetary defense coordination office to track neos larger than about in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort survey programs aim to identify threats years in advance giving humanity time to prepare a space mission to avert threat atlas project by contrast aims to find impacting asteroids shortly before impact much too late for deflection maneuvers but still in time to evacuate and otherwise prepare affected earth region another project transient facility which surveys for objects that change their brightness rapidly also detects asteroids passing close to earth scientists involved in neo research have also considered options for actively averting threat if an object is found to be on a collision course with earth all viable methods aim to deflect rather than destroy threatening neo because fragments would still cause widespread destruction deflection which means a change in object s orbit months to years prior to predicted impact also requires orders of magnitude less energy number and classification thumb cumulative discoveries of near earth asteroids known by size 1980 2019 near earth objects are classified as meteoroids asteroids or comets depending on size and composition asteroids can also be members of an asteroid family and comets create meteoroid streams that can generate meteor showers according to statistics maintained by cneos 19 470 neos have been discovered only 107 0 55 of them are comets whilst 19 363 99 45 are asteroids there are 1 955 neos that are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids phas there are 893 neas on sentry impact risk page at nasa website a significant number of these neas are equal to or smaller than 50 meters in diameter and none of listed objects are placed even in green zone torino scale 1 meaning that none warrant attention of general public observational biases one problem with estimating number of neos is that detections are influenced by a number of factors observational biases need to be taken into account when trying to calculate number of bodies in a population what is easily detected will be more counted for example it has been easier to spot objects on night side of earth there is less noise from twilight and searcher is looking at sunlit side of asteroids in daytime sky a searcher looking towards sun sees backside of object e g comparing a full moon at night to a new moon in daytime in addition opposition surge make them even brighter when earth is along axis of sunlight finally day sky near sun is bright light of sun hitting asteroids has been called full asteroid similar to a full moon and greater amount of light creates a bias that they are easier to detect in this case in year 2000 it was predicted that there are 900 near earth asteroids of at least kilometer size taking into account known observational biases studies of asteroid populations try to take into account observational selection biases to make a more accurate assessment finding observational biases can help determine neo populations for example one study noted that bodies in low eccentricity earth crossing orbits were favored making detection of aten more favored than apollos page 414 two of biggest near earth objects 433 eros and 1036 ganymed were naturally also among first to be detected 1036 ganymed is about in diameter as bigger asteroids they reflected more light one way around this bias is to use thermal infrared telescopes that observe their heat emissions evidencing this bias over half 53 of discoveries of near earth objects were made in 3 8 of sky in a 22 5deg cone facing directly away from sun and vast majority 87 were made in 15 of sky in a 45deg cone facing away from sun near earth asteroids thumb asteroid toutatis from paranal these are objects in a near earth orbit without tail or coma of a comet 19 363 near earth asteroids are known only 1 955 of which are phas neas survive in their orbits for just a few million years they are eventually eliminated by planetary perturbations causing ejection from solar system or a collision with sun or a planet with orbital lifetimes short compared to age of solar system new asteroids must be constantly moved into near earth orbits to explain observed asteroids accepted origin of these asteroids is that main belt asteroids are moved into inner solar system through orbital resonances with jupiter interaction with jupiter through resonance perturbs asteroid s orbit and it comes into inner solar system asteroid belt has gaps known as kirkwood gaps where these resonances occur as asteroids in these resonances have been moved onto other orbits new asteroids migrate into these resonances due to effect that provides a continuing supply of near earth asteroids compared to entire mass of asteroid belt mass loss necessary to sustain nea population is relatively small totalling less than 6 over past 3 5 billion years composition of near earth asteroids is comparable to that of asteroids from asteroid belt reflecting a variety of asteroid spectral types a small number of neas are extinct comets that have lost their volatile surface materials although having a faint or intermittent comet like tail does not necessarily result in a classification as a near earth comet making boundaries somewhat fuzzy rest of near earth asteroids are driven out of asteroid belt by gravitational interactions with jupiter many asteroids have natural satellites minor planet moons 66 neas were known to have at least one moon including three known to have two moons asteroid 3122 florence one of largest phas with a diameter of has two moons measuring across which were discovered by radar imaging during asteroid s 2017 approach to earth size distribution thumb known near earth asteroids by size while a small fraction of these asteroids has accurate direct diameter measurements from radar observations from images of asteroid surface or from stellar occultations size of vast majority of near earth asteroids can only be estimated on basis of their brightness and a representative asteroid albedo or surface reflectivity which is commonly assumed to be 14 such indirect size estimates are uncertain by a factor of 2 for individual asteroids since asteroid albedos can range at least as low as 0 05 and as high as 0 3 this makes their volume uncertain by a factor of 8 and their mass by even more since their density also has a significant uncertainty using this method an absolute magnitude of 17 75 roughly corresponds to a diameter of and an absolute magnitude of 22 0 corresponds to a diameter of diameters of intermediate precision better than from an assumed albedo but not nearly as precise as direct measurements can be obtained from combination of reflected light and thermal infrared emission using a thermal model of asteroid in may 2016 precision of such asteroid diameter estimates arising from wide field infrared survey explorer and neowise missions was questioned by technologist nathan although early original criticism did not pass peer review and faced criticism for its methodology itself a more recent peer reviewed study was subsequently published as of january 4 2019 and mostly using crude estimate from an absolute magnitude 897 neas listed by cneos including 156 phas measure at least 1 km in diameter and 8 452 known neas are larger than 140 m in diameter smallest known near earth asteroid is with an absolute magnitude of 33 2 corresponding to a diameter of about largest such object is 1036 ganymed with an absolute magnitude of 9 45 and a diameter of about in 2000 nasa reduced its estimate of number of existing near earth asteroids over one kilometer in diameter from 1 000 2 000 to 500 1 000 shortly thereafter linear survey provided an alternative estimate of in 2011 on basis of neowise observations estimated number of one kilometer neas was narrowed to of which 93 had been discovered at time while number of neas larger than 140 meters across was estimated at neowise estimate differed from other estimates in assuming a slightly lower average asteroid albedo which produces larger estimated diameters for same asteroid brightness this resulted in 911 then known asteroids at least 1 km across as opposed to 830 then listed by cneos in 2017 using an improved statistical method two studies reduced estimated number of neas brighter than absolute magnitude 17 75 approximately over one kilometer in diameter to estimated number of asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of 22 0 approximately over 140 m across rose to double wise estimate of which about a third are known as of 2018 number of asteroids brighter than which corresponds to about in diameter is estimated at about of which about 1 3 percent had been discovered by february 2016 number of asteroids brighter than larger than is estimated at about million of which about 0 003 percent had been discovered by february 2016 orbital classification thumb types of near earth asteroid orbits near earth asteroids are divided into groups based on their semi major axis a perihelion distance q and aphelion distance q atiras or have orbits strictly inside earth s orbit an asteroid s aphelion distance q is smaller than earth s perihelion distance 0 983 au that is which implies that asteroid s semi major axis is also less than 0 983 au atens have a semi major axis of less than 1 au and cross earth s orbit mathematically and apollos have a semi major axis of more than 1 au and cross earth s orbit mathematically and 1 017 au is earth s aphelion distance amors have orbits strictly outside earth s orbit an amor asteroid s perihelion distance q is greater than earth s aphelion distance 1 017 au amor asteroids are also near earth objects so in summary this implies that asteroid s semi major axis a is also larger than 1 017 au some amor asteroid orbits cross orbit of mars note some authors define atens differently they define it as being all asteroids with a semi major axis of less than 1 au that is they consider atiras to be part of atens historically until 1998 there were no known or suspected atiras so distinction wasn t necessary atiras and amors do not cross earth s orbit and are not immediate impact threats but their orbits may change to become earth crossing orbits in future 36 atiras 1 510 atens 10 199 apollos and 8 583 amors have been discovered and cataloged co orbital asteroids thumb five lagrangian points relative to earth and possible orbits along gravitational contours neas on a co orbital configuration have same orbital period as earth all co orbital asteroids have special orbits that are relatively stable and paradoxically can prevent them from getting close to earth trojans near orbit of a planet there are five gravitational equilibrium points lagrangian points in which an asteroid would orbit sun in fixed formation with planet two of these 60 degrees ahead and behind planet along its orbit designated l4 and l5 respectively are stable that is an asteroid near these points would stay there for millions of years even if perturbed by other planets and non gravitational forces earth s only confirmed trojan is circling earth s l4 point horseshoe librators region of stability around l4 and l5 also includes orbits for co orbital asteroids that run around both l4 and l5 seen from earth orbit can resemble circumference of a horseshoe or may consist of annual loops that wander back and forth librate in a horseshoe shaped area in both cases sun is at horseshoe s center of gravity earth is in gap of horseshoe and l4 and l5 are inside ends of horseshoe by 2016 12 horseshoe librators of earth have been discovered most studied and at about largest is cruithne which travels along bean shaped annual loops and completes its horseshoe libration cycle every 770 to 780 years is an asteroid on a relatively stable circumference of a horseshoe orbit with a horseshoe libration period of about 350 years quasi satellites quasi satellites are co orbital asteroids on a normal elliptic orbit with a higher eccentricity than earth s which they travel in a way synchronised with earth s motion since asteroid orbits sun slower than earth when further away and faster than earth when closer to sun when observed from earth quasi satellite appears to orbit earth in a retrograde direction in one year even though it is not bound gravitationally by 2016 five asteroids were known to be a quasi satellite of earth is earth s closest quasi satellite in an orbit that has been stable for almost a century orbit calculations until 2016 showed that all quasi satellites and four of horseshoe librators then known repeatedly transfer between horseshoe and quasi satellite orbits one of these objects was observed during its transition from a quasi satellite orbit to a horseshoe orbit in 2006 it is expected to transfer back to a quasi satellite orbit 60 years later temporary satellites neas can also transfer between solar orbits and distant earth orbits becoming gravitationally bound temporary satellites according to simulations temporary satellites are typically caught when they pass l1 or l2 lagrangian points and earth has at least one temporary satellite across at any given time but they are too faint to detect by current surveys only observed transition was that of asteroid which was a temporary satellite from september 2006 to june 2007 and has been on a solar orbit with a 1 003 year period ever since according to orbital calculations on its solar orbit passes earth at low speed every 20 to 21 years at which point it can become a temporary satellite again meteoroids in 1961 iau defined meteoroids as a class of solid interplanetary objects distinct from asteroids by their considerably smaller size this definition was useful at time because with exception of tunguska event all historically observed meteors were produced by objects significantly smaller than smallest asteroids observable by telescopes as distinction began to blur with discovery of ever smaller asteroids and a greater variety of observed neo impacts revised definitions with size limits have been proposed from 1990s in april 2017 iau adopted a revised definition that generally limits meteoroids to a size between 30 um and 1 m in diameter but permits use of term for any object of any size that caused a meteor thus leaving distinction between asteroid and meteoroid blurred near earth comets thumb halley s comet during its 0 10 au approach of earth in may 1910 near earth comets necs are objects in a near earth orbit with a tail or coma comet nuclei are typically less dense than asteroids but they pass earth at higher relative speeds thus impact energy of comet nucleus is slightly larger than that of a similar sized asteroid necs may pose an additional hazard due to fragmentation meteoroid streams which produce meteor showers may include large inactive fragments effectively neas although no impact of a comet in earth s history has been conclusively confirmed tunguska event may have been caused by a fragment of comet encke comets are commonly divided between short period and long period comets short period comets with an orbital period of less than 200 years originate in kuiper belt beyond orbit of neptune while long period comets originate in oort cloud in outer reaches of solar system orbital period distinction is of importance in evaluation of risk from near earth comets because short period necs are likely to have been observed during multiple apparitions and thus their orbits can be determined with some precision while long period necs can be assumed to have been seen for first and last time when they appeared during age of science thus their approaches cannot be predicted well in advance since threat from long period necs is estimated to be at most 1 of threat from neas and long period comets are very faint and thus difficult to detect at large distances from sun spaceguard efforts consistently focused on asteroids and short period comets cneos even restricts its definition of necs to short period comets 107 such objects have been discovered only 20 comets have been observed to pass within of earth including 10 which are or have been short period comets two of these comets halley s comet and have been observed during multiple close approaches closest observed approach was 0 au 5 88 ld for lexell s comet on july 1 1770 after an orbit change due to a close approach of jupiter in 1779 this object is no longer a nec closest approach ever observed for a current short period nec is 0 au 8 92 ld for comet tempel tuttle in 1366 this comet is parent body of leonid meteor shower which also produced great meteor storm of 1833 orbital calculations show that p 1999 soho a faint sungrazing comet and confirmed short period nec observed only during its close approaches to sun passed earth undetected at a distance of 0 au 4 70 ld on june 12 1999 comet swift tuttle which is also source of meteor shower which hits earth every year in august has a roughly 130 year orbit which passes close to earth after comet s 1992 return when only two previous returns in 1862 and 1737 have been identified orbital calculations showed that comet would pass very close to earth during its next return in 2126 with an impact within range of uncertainty by 1993 even earlier returns back to at least 188 ad have been identified and new orbital calculation eliminated impact risk predicting comet to pass earth in 2126 at a distance of 24 million kilometers in comet is expected to pass earth at less than 1 6 million kilometers artificial near earth objects thumb j002e3 discovery images taken on september 3 2002 j002e3 is in circle defunct space probes and final stages of rockets can end up in near earth orbits around sun and be re discovered by neo surveys when they return to earth s vicinity in september 2002 astronomers found an object designated j002e3 object was on a temporary satellite orbit around earth leaving for a solar orbit in june 2003 calculations showed that it was also on a solar orbit before 2002 but was close to earth in 1971 j002e3 was identified as third stage of saturn v rocket that carried apollo 12 to moon in 2006 two more apparent temporary satellites were discovered which were suspected of being artificial one of them was eventually confirmed as an asteroid and classified as temporary satellite other was confirmed as an artificial object but its identity is unknown another temporary satellite was discovered in 2013 and was designated as a suspected asteroid it was later found to be an artificial object of unknown origin is no longer listed as an asteroid by minor planet center in some cases active space probes on solar orbits have been observed by neo surveys and erroneously catalogued as asteroids before identification during its 2007 flyby of earth on its route to a comet esa s space probe rosetta was detected unidentified and classified as asteroid with an alert issued due to its close approach designation was similarly removed from asteroid catalogues when observed object was identified with gaia esa s space observatory for astrometry impacts when a near earth object impacts earth objects up to a few tens of metres across ordinarily explode in upper atmosphere usually harmlessly with most or all of solids vaporized while larger objects hit water surface forming waves or solid surface forming impact craters frequency of impacts of objects of various sizes is estimated on basis of orbit simulations of neo populations frequency of impact craters on earth and moon and frequency of close encounters study of impact craters indicates that impact frequency has been more or less steady for past 3 5 billion years which requires a steady replenishment of neo population from asteroid main belt one impact model based on widely accepted neo population models estimates average time between impact of two stony asteroids with a diameter of at least at about one year for asteroids across which impacts with as much energy as atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima approximately 15 of tnt at five years for asteroids across an impact energy of 10 megatons comparable to tunguska event in 1908 at 1 300 years for asteroids across at half a million years and for asteroids across at 18 million years some other models estimate similar impact frequencies while others calculate higher frequencies for tunguska sized 10 megaton impacts estimates range from one event every 2 000 3 000 years to one event every 300 years second largest observed impact after tunguska meteor was a 1 1 megaton air blast in 1963 near prince edward islands between south africa and antarctica which was detected only by infrasound sensors third largest but by far best observed impact was chelyabinsk meteor of february 15 2013 a asteroid exploded near this russian city with equivalent blast yield of 400 500 kilotons calculated orbit of pre impact asteroid is similar to that of apollo asteroid 2011 making latter meteor s possible parent body on october 7 2008 19 hours after it was first observed asteroid blew up above nubian desert in sudan it was first time that an asteroid was observed and its impact was predicted prior to its entry into atmosphere as a meteor 10 7 kg of meteorites were recovered after impact on january 2 2014 just 21 hours after it was first asteroid to be discovered in 2014 2 4 m blew up in earth s atmosphere above atlantic ocean far from any land meteor explosion was only observed by three infrasound detectors of comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization this impact was second to be predicted in advance asteroid impact prediction is however in its infancy and successfully predicted asteroid impacts are rare vast majority of impacts recorded by infrasound sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices are not predicted in advance observed impacts aren t restricted to surface and atmosphere of earth dust sized neos have impacted man made spacecraft including nasa s long duration exposure facility which collected interplanetary dust in low earth orbit for six years from 1984 impacts on moon can be observed as flashes of light with a typical duration of a fraction of a second first lunar impacts were recorded during 1999 leonid storm subsequently several continuous monitoring programs were launched largest observed lunar impact occurred on september 11 2013 lasted 8 seconds and was likely caused by an object in diameter close approaches framed right flyby of asteroid 2004 fh centre dot being followed by sequence other object that flashes by is an artificial satellite each year several mostly small neos pass earth closer than distance of moon on august 10 1972 a meteor that became known as 1972 great daylight fireball was witnessed by many people it moved north over rocky mountains from u s southwest to canada it was an earth grazing meteoroid that passed within of earth s surface and was filmed by a tourist at grand teton national park in wyoming with an 8 millimeter color movie camera on october 13 1990 earth grazing meteoroid was observed above czechoslovakia and poland moving at along a trajectory from south to north closest approach to earth was above surface it was captured by two all sky cameras of european fireball network which for first time enabled geometric calculations of orbit of such a body on march 18 2004 linear announced that a asteroid 2004 fh would pass earth that day at only about one tenth distance to moon and closest miss ever noticed until then they estimated that similar sized asteroids come as close about every two years on march 31 2004 two weeks after 2004 fh set a new record for closest recorded approach above atmosphere passing earth s surface only away about one earth radius or one sixtieth of distance to moon because it was very small 6 meters 20 feet was detected only hours before its closest approach if it had collided with earth it probably would have disintegrated harmlessly in atmosphere on february 4 2011 an asteroid designated estimated at in diameter passed within of earth setting a new record for closest approach without impact which still stands on november 8 2011 asteroid relatively large at about in diameter passed within 0 85 lunar distances of earth on february 15 2013 asteroid passed approximately above surface of earth closer than satellites in geosynchronous orbit asteroid was not visible to unaided eye this was first close passage of an object discovered during a previous passage and was thus first to be predicted well in advance exploratory missions some neos are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than is necessary for even moon due to their combination of low velocity with respect to earth and weak gravity they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation this makes them an attractive target for exploration missions to neas thumb 433 eros as seen by nasa s near probe thumb image mosaic of asteroid 101955 bennu target of nasa s osiris rex probe iau held a minor planets workshop in tucson arizona in march 1971 at that point launching a spacecraft to asteroids was considered premature workshop only inspired first astronomical survey specifically aiming for neas missions to asteroids were considered again during a workshop at university of chicago held by nasa s office of space science in january 1978 of all of near earth asteroids nea that had been discovered by mid 1977 it was estimated that spacecraft could rendezvous with and return from only about 1 in 10 using less propulsive energy than is necessary to reach mars it was recognised that due to low surface gravity of all neas moving around on surface of a nea would cost very little energy and thus space probes could gather multiple samples overall it was estimated that about one percent of all neas might provide opportunities for human crewed missions or no more than about ten neas known at time a five fold increase in nea discovery rate was deemed necessary to make a manned mission within ten years worthwhile first near earth asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft was asteroid 433 eros when nasa s near earth asteroid rendezvous near probe orbited it from february 2001 landing on asteroid surface in february 2002 a second near earth asteroid long peanut shaped was visited in september 2005 by jaxa s hayabusa mission which succeeded in taking material samples back to earth a third near earth asteroid long elongated 4179 toutatis was explored by s chang e 2 spacecraft during a flyby in december 2012 apollo asteroid ryugu is target of jaxa s hayabusa 2 mission space probe was launched in december 2014 is expected to arrive at asteroid in june 2018 and to return a sample to earth in december 2020 apollo asteroid 101955 bennu which has second highest cumulative palermo scale rating 1 71 for several close encounters between and 2199 is target of nasa s osiris rex probe new frontiers program mission was launched in september 2016 on its two year journey to bennu probe had searched for earth s trojan asteroids rendezvoused with bennu in august 2018 and had entered into orbit around asteroid in december 2018 osiris rex will return samples from asteroid in september 2023 in april 2012 company planetary resources announced its plans to mine asteroids commercially in a first phase company reviewed data and selected potential targets among neas in a second phase space probes would be sent to selected neas mining spacecraft would be sent in a third phase planetary resources launched two testbed satellites in april 2015 and january 2018 and first prospecting satellite for second phase is planned for a 2020 launch near earth object surveillance mission is planned for launch no earlier than 2025 to discover and characterize orbit of most of potentially hazardous asteroids larger than over course of its mission nasa to develop mission to search for near earth
