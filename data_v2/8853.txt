boelcke kaserne concentration camp also nordhausen was a subcamp of mittelbau dora concentration camp complex where prisoners were left to die after they became unable to work it was located inside a former luftwaffe barracks complex in nordhausen thuringia germany adjacent to several pre existing forced labor camps during its three month existence about 6 000 prisoners passed through camp and almost 3 000 died there under indescribable conditions more than a thousand prisoners were killed during bombing of nordhausen by royal air force on 3 4 april 1945 their corpses were found by us army units that liberated camp on 11 april photographs and newsreel footage of camp were reported internationally and made nordhausen notorious in many parts of world history in 1936 a luftwaffe barracks complex named after world war i flying ace oswald boelcke was constructed in suburbs of city of nordhausen thuringia from 1942 parts of barracks complex had housed forced laborers for a company involved in arms production additional prisoners arrived in june 1944 for forced labor with junkers and in mittelwerk tunnel system mostly for production of v 1 and v 2 rockets there was also a gestapo run special camp and other forced labor camps nearby but these were not part of mittelbau dora complex on 8 january 1945 ss which ran concentration camp system took over two two storey garages of luftwaffe barracks to use as housing for 6 000 prisoners who were forced to work in v 2 rocket production in nearby underground factories concentration camp prisoners were separated from forced laborers by an electrified fence topped with barbed wire and transported to work via a purpose built railway spur camp commander was ss obersturmfuhrer who had previously worked at auschwitz and deputy commander was ss previously a functionary at dora camp beginning in late january many jewish prisoners in poor physical condition arrived at mittelbau dora complex from auschwitz and gross rosen some prisoners weakened from their ordeal at other concentration camps never recovered from stress of transport often in open railway cars with inadequate food and water after arrival of 3 500 emaciated and ill prisoners from gross rosen in mid february ss decided to use barracks compound to house prisoners who were no longer able to work since dora had no gas chamber and transports to bergen belsen could not be arranged seriously ill prisoners from incoming transports and other subcamps of mittelbau dora were transported to boelcke kaserne to die some forced laborers were also sent there after becoming unable to work daily trains shuttled between dora and boelcke kaserne bringing incapacitated prisoners and removing corpses for cremation at dora on 1 april there were 5 700 prisoners in camp death rate approached one hundred per day on 2 april 3 000 prisoners were transported to mittelbau main camp and to a subcamp of mittelbau on afternoon of 3 april and again next day royal air force bombed nordhausen sick barracks was nearly destroyed barracks was located near railyards and factories which were considered military targets boelcke kaserne had not been marked with a red cross symbol ss guards hid in air raid shelters but did not allow prisoners to seek cover death toll from first raid was 450 in block for tuberculosis sufferers and second raid killed about 1 000 people ss evacuated from barracks after raid leaving dead and forcing dying prisoners to fend for themselves some prisoners were able to escape during bombing and hid in nearby woods conditions housing conditions were particularly bad because there were no bunks prisoners had to sleep in a thin layer of straw one of garages held four blocks of prisoners still able to work for whom conditions were slightly better but for all prisoners rations were grossly insufficient to sustain life according to encyclopedia of camps and ghettos it is difficult to describe in words conditions in second garage where prisoners were left to die more than 3 000 prisoners were forced into an area of only although there were toilets they did not work for lack of water and many prisoners were unable to move every so often floor would be hosed down in order to clean out excrement ss guards barely entered camp instead allowing prisoners to die from neglect ss doctor heinrich schmidt was largely responsible for inhuman conditions conditions were used to motivate prisoners in other subcamps to work hard lest they be sent to die at boelcke kaserne prisoners called it a living crematorium death rate was so high that a special work detail was formed to move corpses prisoners assigned to this duty could draw rations of dead boelcke kaserne housed largest percentage of jews in mittelbau dora complex except for one labor subcamp for jewish women forty percent of prisoners were polish of whom most were thought to be jews other main national groups were russians frenchmen and hungarian jews some were not concentration camp prisoners but forced laborers who could no longer work most of prisoner functionaries were german green triangle prisoners convicted criminals whose beatings and cruelty made situation even worse liberation and aftermath thumb left upright 1 3 us army newsreel of atrocities on 11 april advance parties of us 3rd armored division entered nordhausen with little opposition they found hundreds of dying prisoners lying amongst more than a thousand corpses including many children and babies some had been dead before air raid others were burned to death or died after air raid from neglect american soldiers were outraged one wrote no written word can properly convey atmosphere of such a charnel house unbearable stench of decomposing bodies sight of live human beings lying cheek by jowl with ten day dead a 15 april report describes camp as most horrifying example of nazi terrorism imaginable 3rd armored division continued eastward and was replaced on morning of 12 april by 104th infantry division according to some accounts soldiers of 104th infantry division killed german civilians in nordhausen who denied knowledge of atrocities believing that they were partially responsible prisoners in worst critical condition were taken to 51st field hospital other survivors were cared for in apartments confiscated from germans despite these efforts at least 59 former prisoners died of starvation and exhaustion by 14 30 on 13 april all survivors had been removed from camp us army forced about two thousand germans from nordhausen to bury corpses in mass graves a process which took until 16 april american soldiers photographed and filmed conditions at camp which were widely distributed in international media nordhausen became defining image of national socialist camp terror in many parts of world some american newspapers drew an explicit connection between atrocities at nordhausen and rocket production nearby thumb a witness identifies heinrich schmidt at dora trial josten and were tried at auschwitz trial in krakow and buchenwald trial at dachau respectively both were convicted and executed for crimes committed at other camps heinrich schmidt and an ss guard were tried in 1947 in dora trial at dachau for abuses at boelcke kaserne but they were acquitted for lack of evidence schmidt was tried again at third majdanek trial in 1979 for unrelated crimes and again acquitted no one else was tried for crimes committed at subcamp according to michael j neufeld atrocities at boelcke kaserne were minimized after war to protect careers of german rocket scientists who had worked at other subcamps of mittelbau dora many of these scientists including wernher von braun were recruited by us as part of operation paperclip since
