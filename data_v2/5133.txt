sea anemones are a group of marine predatory animals of order actiniaria they are named after anemone a terrestrial flowering plant because of colourful appearance of many sea anemones are classified in phylum cnidaria class anthozoa subclass hexacorallia as cnidarians sea anemones are related to corals jellyfish tube dwelling anemones and hydra unlike jellyfish sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle a typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near surface of water polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth tentacles can be retracted inside body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey they are armed with cnidocytes stinging cells in many species additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single celled dinoflagellates zooxanthellae or with green algae zoochlorellae that live within cells some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit sea anemones breed by liberating sperm and eggs through mouth into sea resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which after being planktonic for a while settle on seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps sea anemones also breed asexually by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities as trade depends on collection from wild anatomy thumb sea anemone anatomy 1 tentacles 2 mouth 3 retracting muscles 4 gonads 5 acontial filaments 6 pedal disk 7 ostium 8 coelenteron 9 sphincter muscle 10 mesentery 11 column 12 pharynx a typical sea anemone is a sessile polyp attached at base to surface beneath it by an adhesive foot called a basal or pedal disc with a column shaped body topped by an oral disc most are from in diameter and in length but they are inflatable and vary greatly in dimensions some are very large urticina columbiana and stichodactyla can both exceed a metre in diameter and metridium a metre in length some species burrow in soft sediment and lack a basal disc having instead a bulbous lower end which anchors them in place column or trunk is generally more or less cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures these include solid papillae fleshy protuberances adhesive papillae cinclides slits and small protruding vesicles in some species part immediately below oral disc is constricted and is known as capitulum when animal contracts oral disc tentacles and capitulum fold inside pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up column there may be a fold in body wall known as a parapet at this point and this parapet covers and protects anemone when it is retracted oral disc has a central mouth usually slit shaped surrounded by one or more whorls of tentacles ends of slit lead to grooves in wall of pharynx known as siphonoglyphs there are usually two of these grooves but some groups have a single one tentacles are generally tapered and often tipped by a pore but in some species they are branched club tipped or reduced to low knobs tentacles are armed with many cnidocytes cells that are both defensive and used to capture prey cnidocytes contain stinging nematocysts capsule like organelles capable of everting suddenly giving phylum cnidaria its name each nematocyst contains a small venom vesicle filled with actinotoxins an inner filament and an external sensory hair a touch to hair mechanically triggers a cell explosion which launches a harpoon like structure that attaches to organism that triggered it and injects a dose of venom in flesh of aggressor or prey at base of tentacles in some species lie elongated inflatable tentacle like organs armed with cnidocytes that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones one or both anemones can be driven off or suffer injury in such battles thumb actinodendron arboreum hell s fire anemone venom is a mix of toxins including neurotoxins that paralyzes prey so anemone can move it to mouth for digestion inside gastrovascular cavity actinotoxins are highly toxic to prey species of fish and crustaceans however clownfish small banded fish in various colours are not affected by their host anemone s sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles several other species have similar adaptions and are also unaffected see mutualistic relationships most sea anemones are harmless to humans but a few highly toxic species notably actinodendron arboreum and stichodactyla spp have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal digestive system sea anemones have what can be described as an incomplete gut gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to outside which operates as both a mouth and anus waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening mouth is typically slit like in shape and bears a groove at one or both ends groove termed a is ciliated and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through gastrovascular cavity mouth opens into a flattened pharynx this consists of an in folding of body wall and is therefore lined by animal s epidermis pharynx typically runs for about one third length of body before opening into gastrovascular cavity that occupies remainder of body gastrovascular cavity itself is divided into a number of chambers by mesenteries radiating inwards from body wall some of mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge at base of pharynx where they connect but others reach only partway across mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve and are symmetrically arranged around central lumen they have stomach lining on both sides separated by a thin layer of mesoglea and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes in some species these filaments extend below lower margin of mesentery hanging free in gastrovascular cavity as thread like acontial filaments these are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides blister like holes in wall of column for use in defence musculature and nervous system thumb striped colonial anemone a primitive nervous system without centralization coordinates processes involved in maintaining homeostasis as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli there are two nerve nets one in epidermis and one in gastrodermis these unite at pharynx junctions of septa with oral disc and pedal disc and across no specialized sense organs are present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors muscles and nerves are much simpler than those of most other animals although more specialised than in other cnidarians such as corals cells in outer layer epidermis and inner layer gastrodermis have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers these fibers are not true muscles because they are not freely suspended in body cavity as they are in more developed animals longitudinal fibres are found in tentacles and oral disc and also within mesenteries where they can contract whole length of body circular fibers are found in body wall and in some species around oral disc allowing animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter since anemone lacks a rigid skeleton contractile cells pull against fluid in gastrovascular cavity forming a hydrostatic skeleton anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which acts as a valve keeping gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid when longitudinal muscles relax pharynx opens and cilia lining siphonoglyphs beat water inwards and refilling gastrovascular cavity in general sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed and deflates it when resting or disturbed inflated body is also used to anchor animal inside a crevice burrow or tube lifecycle thumb left brooding anemone epiactis prolifera with developing young unlike other cnidarians anemones and other anthozoans entirely lack free swimming stage of their lifecycle polyp produces eggs and sperm and fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which develops directly into another polyp both sexual and asexual reproduction can occur sexes in sea anemones are separate in some species while other species are sequential hermaphrodites changing sex at some stage in their life gonads are strips of tissue within mesenteries in sexual reproduction males may release sperm to stimulate females to release eggs and fertilization occurs either internally in gastrovascular cavity or in water column eggs and sperm or larvae are ejected through mouth in many species eggs and sperm rise to surface where fertilisation occurs fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which drifts for a while before sinking to seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into a juvenile sea anemone some larvae preferentially settle onto certain suitable substrates mottled anemone urticina for example settles onto green algae perhaps attracted by a biofilm on surface brooding anemone epiactis prolifera is starting life as a female and later becoming hermaphroditic so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites as a female eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation and as a hermaphrodite eggs are routinely self fertilised larvae emerge from anemone s mouth and tumble down column lodging in a fold near pedal disc here they develop and grow remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives sea anemones have great powers of regeneration and can reproduce asexually by budding fragmentation or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission some species such as certain anthopleura divide longitudinally pulling themselves apart resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings transverse fission is less common but occurs in anthopleura and gonactinia prolifera with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up column before it splits horizontally some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration in this process a ring of material may break off from pedal disc at base of column which then fragments pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals alternatively fragments detach separately as animal creeps across a surface in metridium dianthus fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells and all new individuals had tentacles within three weeks sea anemone diaphana displays sexual plasticity thus asexually produced clones derived form a single founder individual can contain both male and female individuals when eggs and sperm gametes are formed they can produce zygotes derived from within founding clone or out crossing that then develop into swimming planula larvae anemones tend to grow and reproduce relatively slowly magnificent sea anemone for example may live for decades with one individual surviving in captivity for eighty years behaviour and ecology thumb right upright assortment of sea anemones from ernst haeckel s kunstformen der natur movement a sea anemone is capable of changing its shape dramatically column and tentacles have longitudinal transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract as well as bend and twist gullet and mesenteries can evert turn inside out or oral disc and tentacles can retract inside gullet with sphincter closing aperture during this process gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through mouth locomotion although some species of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment majority are mainly sessile attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc and tend to stay in same spot for weeks or months at a time they can move however being able to creep around on their bases this gliding can be seen with time lapse photography but motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to naked eye process resembles locomotion of a gastropod mollusc a wave of contraction moving from functionally posterior portion of foot towards front edge which detaches and moves forwards sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from substrate and drift to a new location gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim walking is by making a series of short looping steps rather like a caterpillar attaching its tentacles to substrate and drawing its base closer swimming is done by rapid movements of tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes coccinea can swim by flexing its column and sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by waves and currents there are no truly pelagic sea anemones but some stages in life cycle post metamorphosis are able in response to certain environmental factors to cast themselves off and have a free living stage that aids in their dispersal sea onion lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into sediment holding itself in place by expanding its basal disc to form an anchor if it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about tube dwelling anemones which live in parchment like tubes are in subclass ceriantharia and are only distantly related to sea anemones t

reach of their tentacles and immobilizing it with aid of their nematocysts prey is then transported to mouth and thrust into pharynx lips can stretch to aid in prey capture and can accommodate larger items such as crabs dislodged molluscs and even small fish stichodactyla helianthus is reported to trap sea urchins by enfolding them in its carpet like oral disc a few species are parasitic on other marine organisms one of these is larvae of which develop inside of jellyfish feeding on their gonads and other tissues before being liberated into sea as free living juvenile anemones mutualistic relationships although not plants and therefore incapable of photosynthesis themselves many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single celled algae species that reside in animals cells especially in tentacles and oral disc these algae may be either zooxanthellae zoochlorellae or both sea anemone benefits from products of algae s photosynthesis namely oxygen and food in form of glycerol glucose and alanine algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro feeders which sea anemones actively maintain algae also benefit by being protected by sea anemone s stinging cells reducing likelihood of being eaten by herbivores in aggregating anemone anthopleura colour of anemone is largely dependent on proportions and identities of zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present hidden anemone has a whorl of seaweed like pseudotentacles rich in zooxanthellae and an inner whorl of tentacles a daily rhythm sees pseudotentacles spread widely in daytime for photosynthesis but they are retracted at night at which time tentacles expand to search for prey thumb right clownfish among tentacles of a anemone several species of fish and invertebrates live in symbiotic or mutualism relationships with sea anemones most famously clownfish symbiont receives protection from predators provided by anemone s stinging cells and anemone utilises nutrients present in its faeces other animals that associate with sea anemones include cardinalfish such as banggai cardinalfish juvenile e myers r 1999 coral reef fishes

24 287 302 habitats sea anemones are found in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide greatest diversity is in tropics although there are many species adapted to relatively cold waters majority of species cling on to rocks shells or submerged timber often hiding in cracks or under seaweed but some burrow into sand and mud and a few are pelagic relationship with humans sea anemones and their attendant anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits and both are often harvested from wild as adults or juveniles these fishing activities significantly impact populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing densities of each in exploited areas besides their collection from wild for use in reef aquaria sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation and indirectly by effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and prey on which they feed in southern italy and southwestern spain anemone viridis is consumed as a delicacy whole animal is marinated in vinegar then coated in a batter similar to that used to make calamari
