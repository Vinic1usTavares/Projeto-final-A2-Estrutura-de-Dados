how snake lost its legs curious tales from frontier of evo devo is a 2014 book on evolutionary developmental biology by lewis i held jr title pays homage to rudyard kipling s just so stories but tales are strictly scientific explaining how a wide range of animal features evolved in molecular detail book has been admired by other biologists as both accurate and accessible context thumb upright 1 3 messenger rna distributions from front to back of fruit fly embryo model organism of held s laboratory lewis irving held jr is a professor of developmental genetics at texas tech university his laboratory is known for its research on pattern formation in fruit fly embryo his books on evolutionary developmental biology evo devo include discs genetic and cellular logic of pattern formation 2002 quirks of human anatomy an evo devo look at human body 2009 and deep homology uncanny similarities of humans and flies uncovered by evo devo 2017 in held s view quirks snake and deep homology form a trilogy on evo devo book contents how snake lost its legs is ostensibly organised into six chapters but in effect into three parts first chapter serves as an introduction and overview next four chapters provide what held calls meatier aspects of evo devo with many facts to chew over and many tough lessons to digest sixth he writes offers tastier treats first chapter introduces first two sided animal which lived some 600 million years ago held calls discovery that every bilaterally symmetric animal s body is shaped by same set of genes evo devo s greatest revelation that group of animals includes nematodes annelids molluscs and echinoderms among other phyla he explains with detailed diagrams of arthropod and chordate development and a brief richly cited but conversational text how that symmetry is produced thumb upright left how quetzal got its crest is one of reliably cited just so stories in book next four chapters are on fly butterfly snake and cheetah each consists of three to eight sections named in style of rudyard kipling s just so stories with titles like how butterfly got its spots or how snake elongated its body though a couple of sections use why rather than how as in why fly twirls his penis it rotates during embryonic development under control of different genes in these chapters held explains mechanics of evolutionary developmental biology complete with accounts of what genes such as hox hedgehog and engrailed do to shape bodies third part is a single chapter providing an evo devo bestiary a long list of stories such as how turtle got its shell how vampire bat reinvented running how quetzal got its crest and how firefly got its flashlight these are just so only in name since each one is reliably cited to recent research rather than an author s whimsy since by this point reader has been introduced to core elements of evo devo gene toolkit held makes each section brief 50 stories in 32 pages and minimally technical he discusses what evo devo system achieves in terms of each animal s structures and organs ecology and behaviour main text is supported by an accurate glossary and thorough index glossary terms are printed in boldface in text a helpful feature while glossary like text is cited to key research papers on which book is based book thus provides a wide overview of evo devo with guidance on how to read more deeply on any chosen aspect publication thumb king cheetah colour morph helps to elucidate how cheetah got his spots book was published by cambridge university press as a paperback in 2014 main text is 148 pages with an 8 page glossary of evo devo and over 2500 references taking up 122 pages it is illustrated with monochrome diagrams drawings and photographs in text and 8 pages of colour photographs held created diagrams and drawings reception taxonomist marc srour writes that held must be commended for not evo devo since need to combine precise genetic and developmental with phylogenetic systematics and homology inference means that simplifying whole ordeal for a lay audience is extremely tricky srour sets book alongside those of stephen jay gould and sean b carroll s endless forms most beautiful as a showcase of evo devo he writes that held has give n us a readable in depth look at evo devo and all questions it can answer from important to fascinating to weird cool facts you can repeat whenever you re at pub it s accessible to non biologists and laymen useful for teachers and undergrads and researcher s thumb left held discusses how snakes such as vipera ammodytes generate asymmetric patterns along their backs evolutionary biologist larry flammer warns readers that when they look at pictures or study held s diagrams they will be captivated by full page captions and probably drawn into effort to really understand what is happening graphics do indeed help immensely to do this flammer notes too that many of nuts and bolts of evolution deeper than just natural selection are on display in book revealing precisely what genetic physiological mechanisms are being selected for molecular biologist arnaud martin observes that as children we have all wondered about how and why of animal features and if you are reading this it is in fact quite possible that a similar inquisitiveness still burns within you tone of how snake lost its legs finds its roots in famous just so stories of rudyard kipling by tickling this curiosity with formulaic how leopard elephant camel got its spots trunk hump held s ability to captivate reader s imagination compares to mischievousness of kipling s pourquoi stories but reader is also encouraged to extrapolate from general principles by constant reminder that animals use a conserved set of developmental genes to construct their bodies martin finds evo devo fascinating inherently colorful and well placed to fulfill dual goal of etiological myths explaining origins and causes while also stirring imagination and awe overall latest opus by lewis held jr fits that niche nicely and shines by its ability to span essential concepts and empirical work with enough rhetoric al punch it is accessible to most readers with a light background in biology though not as suitable for university classroom as held s quirks of human anatomy see also endless forms most beautiful sean b carroll 2005 notes references sources
