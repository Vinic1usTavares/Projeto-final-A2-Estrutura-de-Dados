thumb evolutionary progress as a tree of life ernst haeckel 1866 thumb upright 1 4 lamarck s two factor theory involves 1 a complexifying force that drives animal body plans towards higher levels orthogenesis creating a ladder of phyla and 2 an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances use and disuse inheritance of acquired characteristics creating a diversity of species and genera popular views of lamarckism only consider an aspect of adaptive force orthogenesis also known as orthogenetic evolution progressive evolution evolutionary progress or progressionism is biological hypothesis that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in a definite direction towards some goal teleology due to some internal mechanism or driving force according to theory largest scale trends in evolution have an absolute goal such as increasing biological complexity prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include jean baptiste lamarck pierre teilhard de chardin and henri bergson term orthogenesis was introduced by wilhelm haacke in 1893 and popularized by theodor eimer five years later proponents of orthogenesis had rejected theory of natural selection as organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of directed evolution with emergence of modern synthesis in which genetics was integrated with evolution orthogenesis and other alternatives to darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists but notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared evolutionary biologist ernst mayr made term effectively taboo in journal nature in 1948 by stating that it implied some supernatural force letter from ernst mayr to r h flower evolution papers 23 january 1948 american paleontologist george gaylord simpson 1953 attacked orthogenesis linking it with vitalism by describing it as mysterious inner force modern supporters include e o wilson and simon conway morris while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give impression of progress in evolution philosopher of biology michael ruse notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms while unintentionally misleading image of march of progress from apes to modern humans has been widely imitated definition thumb upright theodor eimer term orthogenesis from ancient greek orthos orthos straight and genesis genesis origin was first used by biologist wilhelm haacke in 1893 theodor eimer was first to give word a definition he defined orthogenesis as general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction above all in specialized groups in 1922 zoologist michael f guyer wrote according to susan r in 1983 in 1988 francisco j ayala defined progress as systematic change in a feature belonging to all members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature he argued that there are two elements in this definition directional change and improvement according to some standard whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question therefore ayala suggested that science should focus on question of whether there is directional change without regard to whether change is improvement this may be compared to stephen jay gould s suggestion of replacing idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality in 1989 peter j bowler defined orthogenesis as in 1996 michael ruse defined orthogenesis as view that evolution has a kind of momentum of its own that carries organisms along certain tracks history thumb upright mediaeval great chain of being as a staircase implying possibility of progress ramon lull s ladder of ascent and descent of mind 1305 mediaeval possibility of progress is embedded in mediaeval great chain of being with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest concept indeed had its roots in aristotle s biology from insects that produced only a grub to fish that laid eggs and on up to animals with blood and live birth mediaeval chain as in ramon lull s ladder of ascent and descent of mind 1305 added steps or levels above humans with orders of angels reaching up to god at top pre darwinian orthogenesis hypothesis had a significant following in 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as lamarckism were being proposed french zoologist jean baptiste lamarck 1744 1829 himself accepted idea and it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics hypothesized mechanism of which resembled mysterious inner force of orthogenesis orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change and in invertebrate paleontology thought there was a gradual and constant directional change those who accepted orthogenesis in this way however did not necessarily accept that mechanism that drove orthogenesis was teleological had a definite goal charles darwin himself rarely used term evolution now so commonly used to describe his theory because term was strongly associated with orthogenesis as had been common usage since at least 1647 with darwin thumb upright reviewing darwin s origin of species karl ernst von baer argued for a directed force guiding evolution ruse observed that progress sic his capitalisation became essentially a nineteenth century belief it gave meaning to life it offered inspiration after collapse with malthus s pessimism and shock of french revolution of foundations of past russian biologist karl ernst von baer 1792 1876 argued for an orthogenetic force in nature reasoning in a review of darwin s 1859 on origin of species that forces which are not directed so called blind forces can never produce order in 1864 swiss anatomist albert von kolliker 1817 1905 presented his orthogenetic theory heterogenesis arguing for wholly separate lines of descent with no common ancestor in 1884 swiss botanist carl nageli 1817 1891 proposed a version of orthogenesis involving an inner perfecting principle gregor mendel died that same year nageli who proposed that an idioplasm transmitted inherited characteristics dissuaded mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics according to nageli many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed charles darwin saw this as a serious challenge replying that there must be some efficient cause for each slight individual difference but was unable to provide a specific answer without knowledge of genetics further darwin was himself somewhat progressionist believing for example that man was higher than barnacles he studied darwin indeed wrote in his 1859 origin of species darwin c 1859 on origin of species by means of natural selection or preservation of favoured races in struggle for life chapters 10 14 thumb upright henry fairfield osborn s 1934 version of orthogenesis aristogenesis argued that not mutation or natural selection created all novelty osborn supposed that horns of evolved into a baroque form way beyond adaptive optimum in 1898 after studying butterfly coloration theodor eimer 1843 1898 introduced term orthogenesis with a widely read book on orthogenesis and impotence of natural selection in species formation eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance that would be difficult to explain by natural selection to supporters of orthogenesis in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction eimer linked orthogenesis to neo lamarckism in his 1890 book organic evolution as result of inheritance of acquired characteristics according to laws of organic growth he used examples such as evolution of horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation gould described eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis arguing that eimer s criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation they were searching for alternative mechanisms as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species nineteenth and twentieth century numerous versions of orthogenesis see table have been proposed debate centred on whether such theories were scientific or whether orthogenesis was inherently vitalistic or essentially theological for example biologists such as maynard m metcalf 1914 john merle coulter 1915 david starr jordan 1920 and charles b lipman 1922 claimed evidence for orthogenesis in bacteria fish populations and plants john merle coulter 1915 a suggested explanation of orthogenesis in plants science vol 42 no 1094 pp 859 863 in 1950 german paleontologist otto schindewolf argued that variation tends to move in a predetermined direction he believed this was purely mechanistic denying any kind of vitalism but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to organism in 1964 george gaylord simpson argued that orthogenetic theories such as those promulgated by du nouy and sinnott were essentially theology rather than biology though evolution is not progressive it does sometimes proceed in a linear way reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages but such examples are entirely consistent with modern neo darwinian theory of evolution these examples have sometimes been referred to as orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on direction of change term orthoselection was first used by ludwig hermann plate and was incorporated

19th century for how evolution took place given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection many of these theories led solid blue arrows to some form of orthogenesis with or without invoking divine control dotted blue arrows directly or indirectly for example evolutionists like edward drinker cope believed in a combination of theistic evolution lamarckism vitalism and orthogenesis represented by a sequence of arrows on left of diagram development of modern darwinism is indicated by dashed orange arrows various alternatives to darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive evolutionary philosophy of american palaeontologist edward drinker cope is a case in point cope a religious man began his career denying possibility of evolution in 1860s he accepted that evolution could occur but influenced by agassiz rejected natural selection cope accepted instead theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during growth of embryo that ontogeny phylogeny which agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology cope did not go so far seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms as darwin had suggested each evolutionary step was however non random direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern orthogenesis and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan theistic evolution this left unanswered question of why each step should occur and cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change still rejecting natural selection as cause of adaptation cope turned to lamarckism to provide force guiding evolution finally cope supposed that lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth force substance to be concentrated in areas of body being most intensively used in turn it made these areas develop at expense of rest cope s complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies orthogenesis theistic evolution lamarckism and vitalism other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and lamarckism until modern synthesis in 1930s status in science thumb left upright 0 9 a satirical opinion of ernst haeckel s 1874 modern theory of descent of man showing a linear sequence of forms leading up to man illustration by g avery for scientific american 11 march 1876 stronger versions of orthogenetic hypothesis began to lose popularity when it became clear that they were inconsistent with patterns found by paleontologists in fossil record which were non rectilinear richly branching with many complications hypothesis was abandoned by mainstream of evolutionists when no mechanism could be found that would account for process and theory of evolution by natural selection came to prevail historian of biology edward j larson commented that modern synthesis of 1930s and 1940s in which genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated appeared to refute hypothesis for good as more was understood about these mechanisms it came to be held that there was no naturalistic way in which newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far sighted or have a memory of past trends orthogenesis was seen to lie outside methodological naturalism of sciences thumb ernst mayr considered orthogenesis effectively taboo in 1948 by 1948 evolutionary biologist ernst mayr as editor of journal evolution made use of term orthogenesis taboo it might be well to abstain from use of word orthogenesis since so many of geneticists seem to be of opinion that use of term implies some supernatural force with rise of evolutionary developmental biology in late 20th early 21st centuries however which is open to an expanded concept of heredity that incorporates physics of self organization ideas of constraint and preferred directions of morphological change have made a reappearance in evolutionary theory see for example for these and other reasons belief in evolutionary progress has remained a persistent heresy among evolutionary biologists including e o wilson and simon conway morris although often denied or veiled philosopher of biology michael ruse wrote that some of most significant of today s evolutionists are and that because of this we find absolute progressionism alive and well in their work he argued that progressionism has harmed status of evolutionary biology as a mature professional science presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist with humans at top of tower of time in smithsonian institution in washington d c while scientific american magazine could illustrate history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man ruse noted that at popular level progress and evolution are simply synonyms as they were in nineteenth century though confidence in value of cultural and technological progress has declined in popular culture thumb left upright 1 3 frontispiece to thomas henry huxley s 1863 evidence as to man s place in nature was intended to compare skeletons of apes and humans but unintentionally created a durable meme of supposed monkey to man progress in popular culture progressionist images of evolution are widespread historian jennifer tucker writing in boston globe notes that thomas henry huxley s 1863 illustration comparing skeletons of apes and humans has become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution she calls its history extraordinary saying that it is one of most intriguing and most misleading drawings in modern history of science nobody tucker observes supposes that monkey to man sequence accurately depicts darwinian evolution origin of species had only one illustration a diagram showing that random events create a process of branching evolution a view that tucker notes is broadly acceptable to modern biologists but huxley s image recalled great chain of being implying with force of a visual image a logical evenly paced progression leading up to homo sapiens a view denounced by stephen jay gould in wonderful life thumb upright man is but a worm by edward linley sambourne punch s almanack for 1882 popular perception however had seized upon idea of linear progress edward linley sambourne s man is but a worm drawn for punch s almanack mocked idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes primitive men a victorian beau and darwin in a pose that according to tucker recalls michelangelo s figure of adam in his fresco adorning ceiling of sistine chapel this was followed by a flood of variations on evolution as progress theme including new yorker s 1925 rise and fall of man sequence running from a chimpanzee to neanderthal man socrates and finally lawyer william jennings bryan who argued for anti evolutionist prosecution in scopes trial on state of tennessee law limiting teaching of evolution tucker noted that rudolph franz zallinger s 1965 road to homo sapiens fold out illustration in f clark howell s early man showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man fitted discoveries not into a branching darwinian scheme but into framework of original huxley diagram howell ruefully commented that powerful and emotional graphic had overwhelmed his darwinian text thumb one of many versions of progressionist meme astronomy evolution 2 artwork by giuseppe donatiello 2016 sliding between meanings scientists ruse argues continue to slide easily from one notion of progress to another even committed darwinians like richard dawkins embed idea of cultural progress in a theory of cultural units memes that act much like genes dawkins can speak of progressive rather than random trends in evolution dawkins and john krebs deny earlier darwinian prejudice that there is anything inherently progressive about evolution but feeling of progress comes from evolutionary arms races which remain in dawkins s words by far most satisfactory explanation for existence of advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess ruse concludes his detailed analysis of idea of progress meaning a progressionist philosophy in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary thought came out of that philosophy before darwin ruse argues evolution was just a pseudoscience darwin made it respectable but only as popular science there it remained frozen for nearly another hundred years until mathematicians such as fisher provided both models and status enabling evolutionary biologists to construct modern synthesis of 1930s and 1940s that made biology a professional science at price of ejecting notion of progress that ruse argues was a significant cost to people biologists still firmly committed to progress as a philosophy facilitated variation biology has largely rejected idea that evolution is guided in any way but evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by genes of developmental genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology an example is development of wing pattern in some species of heliconius butterfly which have independently evolved similar patterns these butterflies are mullerian mimics of each other so natural selection is driving force but their wing patterns which arose in separate evolutionary events are controlled by same genes see also devolution directed evolution in protein evolutionism evolution of biological complexity history of
