on 14 september 1982 a medical evacuation helicopter flight operated by bristow helicopters crashed during early hours of morning in driving rain and poor visibility over north sea all six crew members on board died when their aircraft plunged into sea near murchison platform while trying to locate baffin seal seismic survey vessel accidents investigation branch of united kingdom issued final report on cause of crash on 22 june 1984 it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine a conclusive cause of accident although adverse weather total darkness and a difficult mission profile were all major factors accident details background large petroleum reserves under north sea have been exploited since 1965 treasure finder semi submersible accommodation platform supported a number of offshore oil rigs and normally carried a group of four bell 212 support helicopters for inter rig transfers of passengers and freight and medical evacuation treasure finder also contained hospital facilities servicing brent oilfield on 14 september 1982 a crewman on baffin seal seismic survey vessel suffered an injury and captain sent a request for medical assistance to treasure finder baffin seals helicopter deck was obstructed so rescue helicopter would not be able to land on vessel but instead would have to winch casualty aboard to accomplish this helicopter took off with a full crew of pilot co pilot winch operator doctor and medic flight summary bell 212 lifted off at 2 25 am all times are utc on a course to baffin seal s reported location with a plan to lower two medical personnel onto ship and if necessary winch them back onboard with injured crewman at 2 31 am co pilot told approach control that they were unable to establish marine vhf communication with vessel and asked for navigational assistance from murchison platform witnesses on platform and its stand by vessel later saw helicopter pass by in a northeasterly direction in driving rain and poor visibility at 2 36 am approach control informed helicopter that survey vessel had a searchlight and could turn it on and point it vertically to assist in location and co pilot replied a minute later that they could see baffin seal and were in radio communication at 2 41 am approach control attempted to call helicopter but received no reply last transmission from aircraft was on marine radio at 2 42 am five miles north of murchison platform letting down to surface contact after repeated attempts to contact helicopter were unsuccessful approach control declared an alert at 2 50 am four helicopters a royal air force nimrod a united states orion and several support vessels in area searched for missing aircraft at 10 23 am two inflated life rafts were spotted floating upside down northeast of murchison platform other pieces of helicopter debris and three bodies were found and recovered northeast of this platform during day on 17 september an underwater locator beacon led searchers to bulk of wreckage and two more bodies from platform at below water company operations at time of accident bristow helicopters was largest private operator of helicopters in united kingdom with a fleet of 70 aircraft bristow was responsible for providing four search and rescue helicopters based on treasure finder with pilots and crew normally fourteen pilots were on rig and a similar number ashore of which four were qualified for nighttime search and rescues pilot of accident aircraft who was also chief pilot for brent field was one of only two such qualified pilots available that night other night qualified pilot had flown extensively earlier that day accident was one of a series suffered by bristow helicopters in north sea in just over a year these included 12 august 1981 loss of another bell 212 and 13 august 1981 loss of a westland wessex soon after crash former labour secretary of state for social services david called for a trade department inquiry into safety of helicopter operations in north sea oil industry accident brought total number of dead from north sea helicopter accidents by all uk operators to 40 accident aircraft bell 212 registered as g was a twin engine two bladed medium helicopter manufactured on 18 july 1975 for flight rear bench seats were removed to allow fitting a rescue winch leaving only two rear seats available and remaining two cabin crew using safety harnesses aircraft had a certificate of airworthiness that was valid until 30 january 1983 and a certificate of maintenance that was valid until 27 october 1982 or 7 567 5 airframe hours airframe had a total of 7 532 25 hours at time of accident gross weight of aircraft and estimated center of gravity were both within authorized limits aircraft had two liferafts installed and all six personnel were wearing immersion survival suits and life vests with personal locator beacons aircraft was also equipped with a beacon and an underwater locator beacon both activated by immersion in salt water available navigation equipment installed included a decca navigator system vor and adf receivers during flight co pilot had asked for non directional beacon on murchison platform to be turned on to assist in finding baffin seal but beacon remained off until after accident because platform s radio operator was fixing an equipment issue investigation two oilfield diving support vessels were placed at service of investigators on day of accident kommandor michael and british voyager equipped with sonar underwater video equipment lifting gear and an underwater location beacon receiver kommandor michael was also equipped with two remote control unmanned submersibles while british voyager carried two manned submersibles after locating wreckage on sea floor on 17 september at in about of water one of british voyagers submersibles performed a video survey and located bodies of two of missing aircrew due to water depth impact damage to airframe and a prolonged period of dangerous weather it was not until 10 october that semi submersible lifting vessel uncle john was able to retrieve wreckage for analysis damage to airframe showed that it had sustained a severe impact to front right quarter consistent with a high speed impact with ocean surface while nose down banked to right with both main and tail rotors spinning investigators did not document any pre impact damage to helicopter its engines transmission rotors avionics or other systems nor were there any documented physiological impairments to aircrew evidence recovered from navigational systems and position of and damage to wreckage indicated helicopter lost altitude during a turn to right while flying at a low altitude searching for baffin seal investigation was unable to determine a specific cause of accident flight took place in darkness and weather conditions of high wind and rain soon after aircrew had been awakened and at a very low altitude while attempting to locate a difficult target in such conditions there was a low margin for safety and any loss of altitude would have been fatal see also list of accidents and incidents involving helicopters 1981
