tang shipwreck or batu hitam shipwreck is wreck of an arabian dhow which sank en route from africa to china around 830 ce ship completed outward journey but sank on return journey approximately off coast of belitung island indonesia it is unclear why ship was so far from its expected route back from china belitung is to south east of singapore strait by and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling from java sea which is south of belitung island wreck has given archaeologists two major discoveries biggest single collection of tang dynasty artefacts found in one location so called tang treasure and arabian dhow which gives a new insight into trade routes between china and middle east during that period treasure has been kept as one collection and during excavation efforts to preserve integrity of site and its cargo have resulted in detailed archaeological evidence this evidence has given new insight into construction methods used in shipbuilding and items and style of artefacts has revealed previously unknown facts about trade between two areas discovery and route thumb 450px alt map of middle east north east africa and asia with red lines from china past

indonesian company dig was subsequently financed and excavated by tilman walterfang and his team at seabed explorations under a license of co operation with original salvage company and after a request from indonesian government security was provided by indonesian navy excavations spanned two expeditions one which commenced in august 1998 and second in 1999 seabed explorations provided vessels and financed government naval operations to safeguard wreck site before and during monsoon season route it is unclear why ship was so far from its expected route shown in red on map to right as most ships leaving china for arabia would have sailed through south china sea they would then turn north west after passing southern vietnam continuing through singapore strait into straits of malacca between peninsular malaysia and sumatra belitung is some distance from this route and it is unclear how vessel came to be in this area belitung is to south east of singapore strait by and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling from java sea which is south of belitung island to strait of malacca north of island ship and construction thumb alt an arabian dhow a ship constructed with a covered area at rear and no real superstructure they are used as cargo vessels and have one or two masts with triangular sails shipwreck is of a dhow similar in size and construction to this one in oman shipwrecked dhow was approximately wide and long and is remarkable for two reasons it is first ancient arabian ship to be found and excavated and its planks were sewn together using a thin rope made of coconut fibres rather than using more traditional methods of pegs or nails used in arabia in later centuries wreck timbers were found under a sediment that preserved remains of wooden vessel without which wreck would have been lost due to marine worms wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of hull was preserved this has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed something which has not been seen before as no arabian ship of this type had previously been found nor any with their cargo intact pieces of original timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some of types of wood used it is possible that ship was constructed in western asia and bought by arabian merchants to be used for oman to china route cargo contains many arabian inspired artefacts construction techniques ship was constructed around a long keel of thickness which is believed to have survived intact front of ship had a angle of rake at bow where stem post was joined to keel with mortise and tenon joints and secured with diameter rope hull planks were stitched onto frames and keel through holes spaced at intervals boat had a keelson for added strength which rested on half frames michael flecker chief excavating archaeologist at site compared wrecked ship to three types of same period and concluded that wreck most resembled lashed lug ships of south east asia first used in 5th century he said that fully stitched boats were found from african coast oman in red sea on indian coast and as far as maldives he notes that roman references by procopius in 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar fashion used in indian seas though arabian ships of this type have not been found before they are mentioned in text including late tang ling biao lu yi strange things noted in south according to john guy curator of metropolitan museum of art book describes ships of foreign merchants as being stitched together with fiber of coir palms and having their seams caulked rather than using iron nails to secure their planks wood types samples of wood from shipwreck were sent for analysis at forest and forest products division of commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro in australia analysis was conducted by jugo ilic of csiro a wood identification specialist many of samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified as lack of cellulose remaining in wood cells prevented successful analysis many types of wood have been positively identified teak grandis was used for through beams and is resilient to teredo worm of family ceiling was made from a genus cupressus tree which was possibly cupressus torulosa stem post is made of rosewood from family leguminosae now called fabaceae and either genus dalbergia or pterocarpus wooden box found in stern area of shipwreck was made from genus artocarpus of mulberry family moraceae species used for hull planks was not positively identified but is thought to be amoora of family timber for frames was similarly not definitively determined although one frame was probably of amoora or of genus afzelia of family fabaceae afzelia is interesting in that three main species a africana a and a are mostly found in a small part of africa stretching from mid western coast in a thin band towards east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles ship could originally have been said to be of arabian or indian origin as there is little to differentiate between ships of area during that period in regard to construction techniques though its frame uses a species of tree that is only found in a small part of africa after analysing hull form timber species and construction methods ilic concluded that wreck was of indian or arabian origin india was considered more probable place of construction but arabian construction was not ruled out as timber used was commonly imported to middle east for use in shipbuilding flecker concluded that wreck was an arabian ship in his 2010 chapter from sackler exhibition catalogue arguing that from an analysis of construction methods and materials and hull form author has determined that belitung wreck is an arab vessel legacy present day knowledge of original materials and methods used in construction of this particular arab dhow stems largely from shipwreck itself jewel of muscat reconstruction a replica made as an exact copy of wreck has shown that ship resembles a a type of ship still found in oman today amongst hull of shipwreck were large lumps of concretion containing artefacts from ship s cargo dated to tang dynasty of china around 800 ad and from where wreck gets its other names tang shipwreck or tang treasure ship ship s timbers and artefacts were shown to public for first time in 2011 world debut exhibition of collection of artefacts as well as timbers from ship took place in artscience museum adjacent to singapore s marina bay sands significance of discovery of shipwreck led to decision to construct jewel of muscat as an exact reconstruction of shipwrecked dhow cargo and tang treasure wreck held three main types of wares in form of bowls changsha ware produced in kilns in majority of 60 000 items were originally packed in either straw cylinders or dusun storage jars white ware manufactured in ding kilns and including earliest known intact blue and white dishes and yue ware from zhejiang province one changsha bowl was inscribed with a date 16th day of seventh month of second year of reign or 826 ad this was later confirmed by radiocarbon dating of star anise found amongst wreck cargo had a surprising variety of influences and markets including buddhist lotus symbols motifs from central asia and persia koranic inscriptions and green splashed bowls popular in iran included in cargo were items of varying purposes from spice jars martaban and ewers to funeral urns and gilt silver boxes cargo was described by john guy of metropolitan museum of art in new york as richest and largest consignment of early ninth century southern chinese gold and ceramics ever discovered in a single hoard cargo also included spices and resin and metal ingots used as ballast there were also special items found which include a gold cup largest tang dynasty gold cup ever found and a large silver flask decorated with a pair of ducks gold cup has pictures of people in various actions on its sides such as musicians and a persian dancer it also has images of two men on its thumb plate with features that appear to be non chinese as they are depicted with curly hair alt thumb 220px bowls from kilns in

a monumental ewer with incised floral lozenges and clouds made of glazed stoneware with copper green splashes over a white slip probably from kilns henan alt tilman walterfang s company formed a contract of cooperation with original indonesian salvage company and as a result cargo was not sold off piece by piece to collectors although there were instances of some looting from site particularly between two excavation periods walterfang kept cargo intact as one complete collection so that it could be studied in its original context something which has given an unparalleled insight into china s industrial capacity and global trade according to julian raby director of arthur m sackler gallery it was housed in a private conservation facility for six years where artefacts were painstakingly conserved including desalination studied and carefully restored by walterfang s company seabed explorations ltd of new zealand work was carried out with assistance of german conservator andreas who trained at germanisches in mainz artefacts were authenticated by professor geng a senior research fellow at palace museum in beijing geng is deputy director of beijing s forbidden city and one of china s foremost experts on antique ceramics cargo was purchased for around 32 million usd by a private company sentosa leisure group now sentosa development corporation and singaporean government in 2005 and loaned to singapore tourism board debut exhibit of treasure ran from 19 february 2011 to 31 july 2011 at artscience museum in singapore display was put on with collaboration of smithsonian institution freer gallery of art arthur m sackler gallery singapore tourism board and national heritage board of singapore exhibition was then scheduled to travel world for approximately five years to venues which include museums of major importance throughout asia australia europe middle east and united states in april 2015 it was announced that asian civilisations museum would house tang shipwreck collection treasure has now found a permanent home as tang shipwreck in khoo teck gallery of asian civilisations museum in singapore controversy sackler gallery part of smithsonian institution was due to host us premiere exhibition of belitung cargo in early 2012 a date set to coincide with smithsonian museum s 25th anniversary celebration on 28 june 2011 it was reported that museum was postponing show sackler gallery has received condemnation of exhibition due to time frame and nature of original excavation of artefacts with arguments put forwards about whether display should be allowed according to new york times a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from national academy of sciences including robert mccormick adams a former leader of smithsonian wrote to head of smithsonian institution g wayne clough on 5 april 2011 claiming that proceeding with exhibition would severely damage stature and reputation of institution proponents of arguments against display say that excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to crew and cargo new york times article goes on to say that further comments were made by society for american archaeology council of american maritime museums and international committee for underwater cultural heritage as well as groups within smithsonian including members of anthropology department and senate of scientists at its national museum of natural history all asking that smithsonian reconsider exhibition there are also claims that exhibiting artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations kimberly l faulk a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of non governmental advisory council on underwater archaeology said that by proceeding with exhibition smithsonian which is a research institution as well as a network of museums would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting looting of archaeological sites proponents of arguments to display works claim that excavation was indeed legal as work was carried out in accordance with indonesian law at request of indonesian government and in accordance with international laws at time james p delgado director of maritime heritage at united states department of commerce national oceanic and atmospheric administration said that allowing any of finds from an excavation to be sold betrays most basic aspects of research with new york times going on to report that he delgado wished belitung shipwreck had been academically excavated but unlike some of his colleagues he said that instead of canceling exhibition smithsonian could use it to educate public about consequences of commercialization of underwater heritage walterfang has stated that overall situation would without doubt be described as less than ideal and that indonesian government fearful of looting ordered seabed explorations to begin an immediate round clock recovery operation some academics have expressed more definitive support for tilman walterfang s excavation and treatment of belitung vessel and cargo lu a researcher at institute of southeast asian studies in singapore states in newsletter of international institute for asian studies leiden netherlands that excavation of belitung has been acknowledged as an admirable example of what can be achieved under difficult conditions in southeast asia she points out that unlike some other commercial operators walterfang s company ensured that ship structure itself was properly recorded cargo was kept together rather than dispersed and finds were well conserved studied catalogued and published lu ends by highlighting efficacy of public private arrangement it is difficult to imagine how this particular project could have been financed or organized without commercial involvement http nsc edu sg documents iias newsletter belitung controversy pdf page 42 prof victor h mair professor of chinese language and literature in department of east asian languages and civilizations at university of pennsylvania philadelphia united states defends smithsonian exhibition claiming that educational and historical value of collection is simply enormous and those who have called for cancellation of exhibition are in effect and in fact denying access to wealth of information embodied in belitung shipwreck both to lay public and to qualified researchers dr sean kingsley director of wreck watch international reminds that wrecks like these should be feel good factors at times when world has very serious and painful natural economic and civil disasters to contend with and it hardly needs stating that no european and american museum collection is whiter than white in an interview with science journal g wayne clough 12th secretary of smithsonian institution assuaged animosities between critics and proponents of exhibition so i don t think there s anything negative here i think smithsonian tried to do it right when we heard concerns we asked community to come together and talk about it and we listened and some people in that audience had their minds changed as a matter of fact but not everybody so i think it s time in a situation like this to pause and for profession itself to say okay there s a problem what are you going to do about it and you remember united states never signed unesco treaty conventions by international organisations underwater archaeology resolutions that were adopted on 10 september 1993 by international congress of maritime museums icmm state that they also say that icmm members should recognize that artefacts from underwater sites are integral parts of archaeological assemblages which should remain intact for research and display and that a commercially exploited heritage site is one in which primary motive for investigation is private financial gain united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco ratified a set of rules for preserving and excavating underwater sites at convention on protection of underwater cultural heritage during 15 october 5 november 2001 though rules set out at meeting do include preserving artefacts in situ preservation in situ of underwater cultural heritage shall be considered as first option before allowing or engaging in any activities directed at this heritage as preferable option they go on to say see also cirebon shipwreck artscience museum jewel of muscat belitung notes references external links a photograph of jewel of muscat housed in
