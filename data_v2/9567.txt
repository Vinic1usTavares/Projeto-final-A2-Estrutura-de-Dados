wood siding railway station was a halt in bernwood forest buckinghamshire england it opened in 1871 as a terminus of a short horse drawn tramway built to assist transport of goods from and around duke of buckingham s extensive estates in buckinghamshire and to connect duke s estates to aylesbury and buckingham railway at quainton road in 1872 a lobbying campaign by residents of town of brill led to tramway being converted for passenger use and extended a short distance beyond wood siding to brill railway station becoming known as brill tramway railway was cheaply built and ungraded and used poor quality locomotives services were very slow initially limited to a speed of in 1890s it was planned to extend tramway to oxford but scheme was abandoned instead operation of line was taken over by metropolitan railway in 1899 between 1908 and 1910 station was completely rebuilt on a bridge over newly built chiltern main line of great western railway which passed directly beneath station in 1933 metropolitan railway was taken into public ownership and became metropolitan line of london transport as a result wood siding became a station on london underground network despite being over from city of london london transport s new management aimed to move away from goods services to concentrate on passenger services as line served a very lightly populated rural area new management believed it very unlikely that it could ever be made viable wood siding was closed along with rest of line from 30 november 1935 all infrastructure associated with station was removed in 1936 remains of bridge

london s metropolitan railway mr reached aylesbury and shortly afterwards connected to a br line with local mr services running to verney junction from 1 april 1894 through trains from mr s london terminus at baker street commenced on 1 january 1897 duke of buckingham had long had an interest in railways and had served as chairman of london and north western railway from 1852 to 1861 in early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to carry freight from his estates in buckinghamshire to a br s line at quainton road because proposed line ran on land owned by duke of buckingham and by winwood charity trust who consented to its construction line did not need parliamentary approval and construction could begin immediately first stage of line known as wotton tramway was a line from quainton road via wotton to a coal siding at kingswood and opened on 1 april 1871 intended for use by horse trams line was built with longitudinal sleepers to avoid horses tripping on sleepers in november 1871 tramway was extended to wood siding in a surviving fragment of bernwood forest from town of brill and from nearest settlement at dorton lobbying from residents and businesses in brill for introduction of passenger services on line led to a further extension from wood siding to brill railway station at foot of brill hill of a mile 1 2 km from hilltop town of brill itself in mid 1872 two mixed trains ran each day in each direction and line was renamed brill tramway duke bought two aveling and porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives for line each with a top speed of

up oxford aylesbury tramroad company o atc with intention of extending line from brill to oxford rail services from london to oxford were very poor at this time despite being an extremely roundabout route had connection from quainton road to oxford been built it would have been shortest route between oxford and city of london metropolitan railway leased brill tramway from 1 december 1899 and from then on mr metropolitan line of london underground from july 1933 operated all services on line throughout operation of brill tramway track and stations remained in ownership of oxford aylesbury tramroad company mr had an option to purchase line outright but it was never taken up services and facilities station was positioned on southern edge of wood a surviving part of bernwood forest it was on western side of level crossing over kingswood lane intended primarily for goods use wood siding initially had no facilities for passengers and platform was simply a raised earth bank despite lack of passenger facilities wood siding was starting point for first passenger service to operate on line on 26 august 1871 an excursion service ran from wood siding to london hauled by great western railway gwr it carried around 150 people for a total of 105 passenger fares with each child counted as half an adult and was drawn by horses between wood siding and quainton road and by locomotive from quainton road to aylesbury where carriages were attached to 7 30 am gwr service via princes risborough to london arriving at 10 00 am experiment was not a success sharp overhanging branches along route posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in week before excursion day itself was extremely rainy and ticket sales were lower than expected return train from london to quainton road was delayed in slough and excursion eventually arrived back at wood siding at 2 00 am in 1894 crude stations on brill tramway were rebuilt in anticipation of extension to oxford other stations on line were provided with buildings containing a booking office waiting rooms and toilets but wood siding station was equipped with a small corrugated iron waiting room with shelf and drawer for passengers a low passenger platform was also built as well as passenger platform a short siding led to a raised wooden platform alongside through line to brill which served both as a buffer stop for siding and as a loading platform for milk station was staffed by a single porter responsible for opening gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight mainly milk a small unheated hut was provided for his use original aveling porter locomotives were slow and noisy and could be heard by porter long before their arrival but more advanced locomotives introduced by metropolitan railway were quieter and quicker a ladder was installed against a large oak for porter to watch for oncoming trains after 1899 transfer of services to metropolitan railway mr introduced a single brown marshall passenger carriage on line unlike other stations on line platform height at wood siding was not raised at this time to accommodate new carriage from 1872 to 1894 station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction and from 1895 to 1899 number was increased to three per day following 1899 transfer of services to metropolitan railway station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935 right thumb 300px full extent of brill tramway system chiltern main line ran directly underneath station at wood siding but did not stop there halt at dorton replaced brill

stopping at four intermediate stations between wood siding and quainton road to pick up and set down goods passengers and livestock trains ran very slowly in 1887 trains took between 15 and 20 minutes to travel approximately one mile from wood siding to brill and a little over 1 hour 20 minutes from wood siding to junction station with main line at quainton road improvements to line carried out at time of transfer to oxford aylesbury tramroad and use of mr s better quality rolling stock reduced journey time from wood siding to quainton road to about 30 minutes in 1910 new bicester cut off line of great western railway chiltern main line was routed directly through wood siding but no interchange station was built gwr was to run in a cutting beneath existing station wood siding station and its siding were rebuilt at gwr s expense between 1908 and 1910 to stand on a wide bridge above gwr s line with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace and serving a lightly populated area stations at wood siding and brill saw relatively little passenger use and wood siding was removed from passenger timetable by 1931 trains continued to stop on request in 1932 last year of private operation brill and wood siding stations saw only 3 272 passenger journeys and raised only ps191 about ps in in passenger receipts withdrawal of services on 1 july 1933 metropolitan railway along with london s other underground railways aside from small waterloo city railway was taken into public ownership as part of newly formed london passenger transport board lptb thus despite it being over and over two hours travel from city of london wood siding became a london underground station as a cost cutting measure wood siding became unstaffed and porter s hut was sold as a garden shed from then on train crew would work crossing gate it was now officially a part of london underground network but wood siding in common with all metropolitan line stations north of aylesbury was never shown on tube map frank pick managing director of underground group from 1928 and chief executive of lptb aimed to move network away from freight services and saw lines beyond aylesbury via quainton road to brill and verney junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes concluding that over ps2000 about ps in would be saved by closing brill tramway as a consequence lptb decided to abandon all passenger services beyond aylesbury brill tramway was closed on 1 december 1935 with last trains running on 30 november services on brill tramway were withdrawn completely following transfer to public ownership lptb considered verney junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a diversionary route and they continued to maintain line and operate
