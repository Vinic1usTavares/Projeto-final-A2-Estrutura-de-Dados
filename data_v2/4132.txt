brougham castle pronounced is a medieval building about south east of penrith cumbria england castle was founded by robert i de vieuxpont in early 13th century site near confluence of rivers eamont and lowther had been chosen by romans for a roman fort called brocavum castle is scheduled as an ancient monument along with fort as brougham roman fort and brougham castle in its earliest form castle consisted of a stone keep with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade when castle was built robert de vieuxpont was one of only lords in region who were loyal to king john vieuxponts were a powerful land owning family in north west england who also owned castles of appleby and brough in 1264 robert de vieuxpont s grandson also named robert was declared a traitor and his property was confiscated by henry iii brougham castle and other estates were eventually returned to vieuxpont family and stayed in their possession until 1269 when estates passed to clifford family through marriage with outbreak of wars of scottish independence in 1296 brougham became an important military base for robert clifford 1st baron de clifford he began castle wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger more impressive stone walls and a large stone gatehouse was added importance of brougham and robert clifford was such that in 1300 he hosted king edward i of england at castle robert s son roger clifford was executed as a traitor in 1322 and family estates passed into possession of king edward ii of england although they were returned once his son edward iii became king region was often at risk from scots and in 1388 castle was captured and sacked following this cliffords began spending more time at their other castles particularly skipton castle in yorkshire brougham descended through several generations of cliffords intermittently serving as a residence however by 1592 it was in a state of disrepair as george clifford 3rd earl of cumberland was spending more time in southern england due to his role as queen s champion castle was briefly restored in early 17th century to such an extent that king james i of england was entertained there in 1617 hmc vol 6 london 1995 p 141 in 1643 lady anne clifford inherited estates including castles of brougham appleby and brough and set about restoring them brougham castle was kept in good condition for a short time after lady anne s death in 1676 however thomas tufton 6th earl of thanet who had inherited clifford estates sold furnishings in 1714 empty shell was left to decay as it was too costly to maintain as a ruin brougham castle inspired a painting by j m w turner and was mentioned at start of william wordsworth s poem prelude as well as becoming subject of wordsworth s song at feast of brougham castle upon restoration of lord clifford shepherd to estates and honours of his ancestors castle was left to ministry of works in 1930s and is today maintained by its successor english heritage background thumb left 300px brougham castle was built in north part of a roman fort near confluence of river eamont and river lowther site of brougham castle has been fortified since romans erected fort of brocavum at intersection of three roman roads with rivers eamont and lowther flowing nearby and meeting to west site had natural defences and area was fertile and easy to cultivate a civilian settlement grew around fort when angles arrived in area they named place brougham meaning village by fort between end of roman rule in early 5th century and norman conquest in late 11th century cumbria was a turbulent area although site was a defendable position there is no evidence that brougham was refortified during this time in 1092 william ii also known as william rufus captured cumbria south of solway firth and established a new border far north of brougham site at brougham remained unfortified carlisle castle secured border and castles at appleby and brough both south east of brougham protected line of communication from carlisle to yorkshire in 1203 barony of westmorland containing appleby brough and brougham was granted to robert de vieuxpont by king john a favourite of john s vieuxpont was one of only a few lords loyal to him in northern england whose inhabitants became so discontented with king s rule that they eventually rebelled around 1214 vieuxpont asserted control over more land including half manor of brougham it was in this atmosphere of unrest that brougham castle was founded under vieuxponts vieuxpont was one of only a few supporters of king in northern england and he most likely began construction of brougham castle as soon as he acquired land at this stage castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber palisade first three storeys of stone keep date from this period it was entered through first floor via a forebuilding to east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall building in stone was an expensive and time consuming process no records tell us how much brougham cost to construct but there are records for other stone construction for example late 12th century stone keep at peveril castle in derbyshire would have cost around ps200 although something on a much larger scale such as vast chateau gaillard cost an estimated ps15 000 to ps20 000 and took several years to complete in 1216 when a scottish army invaded eden valley and alan of galloway occupied westmorland brougham castle played no part in county s defence probably because it was unfinished construction would have been suspended until alan retreated in 1217 vieuxpont received control over king s revenues from cumberland and these helped fund construction of castle brougham castle was constructed in northern part of old roman fort and stone from ruins was probably used to help build castle when robert de vieuxpont died in 1228 his only son john was a minor so his property was taken into care of a warden john de vieuxpont died in 1241 before he came of age new heir john s son robert was not old enough to inherit so family s lands remained in wardship during this time estates fell into disrepair and this probably included brougham castle when robert de vieuxpont came of age in around 1257 he inherited considerable debts he was one of northern lords that revolted in support of simon de montfort in second barons war 1264 1267 by june 1264 vieuxpont was dead as he was considered a traitor his property was confiscated by king henry iii in 1266 king pardoned vieuxpont posthumously and his two daughters inherited family estates guardians of two girls who at time were too young to marry divided vieuxpont lands with expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage isabel vieuxpont was given in marriage to roger clifford son of her guardian and with her of westmorland and castles of brougham and appleby transferred to cliffords clifford family thumb 300px east of brougham castle gatehouse right was built by robert clifford as was stone wall enclosing castle keep next to gatehouse is a survival from when robert de vieuxpont founded brougham castle by 1269 roger clifford had married isabel vieuxpont and possession of brougham castle as well as her other property descended through clifford family in 1283 roger predeceased his wife who died in 1292 at 18 their son robert was not old enough to take possession of his lands during his three year minority his estates suffered from neglect and poaching when wars of scottish independence began in 1296 robert clifford played a prominent role in conflict as furthest north of his castles brougham became clifford s most important base and he spent a lot of time there it was during this period that clifford undertook an extensive building programme timber palisade surrounding site was replaced with a stone curtain wall a four storey stone residential tower called tower of league was built in castle s south west corner a fourth storey was added to keep and a double gatehouse attached to its northern side construction of a new stone hall to south of keep may indicate that during war there was a larger garrison present than in peacetime or it may have been built in anticipation of a royal visit in july 1300 edward i himself a renowned castle builder visited brougham with a large household of followers and prince of wales although it is not certain whether king stayed at castle historians believe it to have been likely in 1309 robert clifford was granted a licence to crenellate brougham castle this has been taken as an indication that by this point rebuilding was complete licences to crenellate granted permission for a person to fortify a site they were also proof of a relationship with or favour from monarch who was one responsible for granting permission edward i died in 1307 and his successor edward ii was distracted from war with scotland by internal quarrels enabling scottish to roam further south through england in 1310 or 1311 robert clifford was given skipton castle it was farther from border than brougham and at a time when scottish raids were ravaging westmorland clifford chose to spend more time and effort building at skipton clifford was killed at battle of bannockburn in 1314 which ended english counter offensive into scotland at time of robert s death his son roger de clifford 2nd baron de clifford was only 14 and not old enough to inherit therefore clifford estates experienced another period of control through guardians suffering from scottish raids to such an extent that in 1317 king granted roger ps200 towards maintenance of his castles bartholomew de badlesmere 1st baron badlesmere was responsible for upkeep of brougham castle and some other clifford properties including appleby castle between 1316 and 1318 he spent on garrisons at brougham and appleby though was supported by king who gave ps1 270 towards their upkeep funds to pay garrison were not easily gathered from clifford estates and they were accused of poaching and pillaging in 1320 roger clifford was given his inheritance but probably spent more time at skipton he was executed as a traitor in 1322 after his capture at battle of boroughbridge brougham castle was amongst clifford lands confiscated and given to andrew de harcla for supporting king against uprising however by 1323 harcla too had been executed for treason and castle came into possession of edward ii in may 1323 a truce was signed between scots and english resulting in a reduction in garrison strength throughout northern england thumb left 300px plan of brougham castle when edward iii replaced edward ii on throne robert clifford roger s younger brother was granted most of lands that had been confiscated by 1333 robert had united under his control all estates which had belonged to vieuxpont family hostilities between england and scotland resumed in 1332 when edward balliol invaded to seize scottish throne for himself he was expelled from scotland in december 1333 on entering westmorland balliol sought refuge with clifford family staying at castles of appleby brougham brough and pendragon robert clifford was not heavily involved in renewed conflict although he did take part in battles in 1332 1337 and 1342 when value of his property was assessed on his death in 1344 estates of brougham were suffering from war with indications that brougham castle was in a state of disrepair having endured 1340s without funds for maintenance two minorities followed until roger clifford 5th baron clifford came of age in 1354 another truce between scotland and england was signed in 1357 this time lasting until 1384 although roger clifford spent much time at appleby which was westmorland s county town he was responsible for rebuilding domestic buildings at brougham castle including hall he was ordered by king to maintain a force of 40 men at arms and 50 mounted archers near west end of scottish border region and some were likely stationed at brougham need for extra accommodation is a possible reason why clifford began rebuilding in august 1388 scottish launched an attack into england with one force advancing east and were eventually confronted at battle of otterburn in northumberland and another raiding west reaching as far as brough to south east during this time brougham castle was briefly captured by scottish forces roger clifford died at skipton castle in 1389 and clifford family began to lose interest in westmorland cliffords preferred their properties in yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in westmorland which had been ravaged by wars with scotland brougham castle is not known to have been in use as a residence again until 1421 when a man was accused of forging coins in castle although little is known about brougham during this period historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken and a rivalry emerged between clifford family and house of neville that would later have consequences for brougham familial enmity meant that earl of salisbury a neville used his position as lord of penrith to antagonise cliffords it is likely that brougham castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to penrith in wars of roses 1455 1485 two families were on opposing sides cliffords supporting house of lancaster and nevilles supporting house of york when yorkist edward iv took throne in 1461 lands of john clifford 9th baron de clifford were confiscated in 1471 edward iv granted sir william parr brougham castle and other properties which had belonged to cliffords a year later henry clifford john s son and heir was pardoned and when lancastrian henry tudor took throne as henry vii henry clifford appealed for return of clifford estates this was granted in november 1485 henry clifford lived until 1523 under him and his son also called henry who later became earl of cumberland castle was intermittently in use as a residence for family after brough castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 it is likely that brougham became new administrative centre and focus of local lordship as earl of cumberland henry controlled penrith and carlisle although he was an unpopular landlord when north of england rose up in pilgrimage of grace in 1536 henry was one of those targeted by rebels he confronted rebel leaders at kirkby stephen in february 1537 and after his defeat he retreated to brougham castle after pilgrimage of grace was suppressed there were reforms of regional government in north west one of results was that title of earl of cumberland no longer gave clifford of penrith and carlisle with brougham castle once again becoming cliffords northern most castle henry died in 1542 and his son henry clifford 2nd earl of cumberland inherited family estates during rising of north in which catholic magnates rebelled against elizabeth i henry remained loyal to tudor dynasty despite cliffords being a catholic family he dismantled appleby castle to prevent it from being used against royal forces and at same time put brougham at service of elizabethan government although there was no fighting at castle under second and third earls henry and george castle was still used as a residence with third earl being born at brougham castle however it was under george that building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted george clifford spent much time either in southern england in his role as queen s champion or at skipton an inventory of castle s contents in 1595 demonstrates that structure was a neglected furnished place and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair clifford thumb left 300px a portrait of lady anne clifford s family she is shown in left and right panels aged 15 and 56 respectively central piece shows her parents george and margaret and her two brothers who died in childhood when george clifford died in 1605 his wife margaret became dowager countess and began repairing brougham castle which became her favoured residence margaret contended with claims to ownership of family estates from her brother in law francis clifford 4th earl of cumberland but held onto brougham castle her daughter lady anne clifford continued restoration of castle and other clifford properties only one of margaret s three children to survive childhood anne inherited clifford estates after her mother died in 1616 inheritance was not without incident earl of cumberland again asserted his claim to clifford estates however privy council found in favour of anne solution was only temporary and in april 1617 king decided that earl of cumberland was rightful heir and clifford estates passed to francis clifford later same year james i visited scotland and on his return journey he stayed at castles of carlisle brougham and appleby where expensive banquets were given in his honour it is estimated that festivities cost around ps1 200 after this brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected francis clifford died in 1641 and death of his son henry clifford 5th earl of cumberland in 1643 left line without a direct male heir at this point clifford estates reverted to lady anne english civil war broke out in 1641 brougham was one of several castles in generally royalist cumberland and westmorland that were garrisoned by cavalier forces sir john lowther garrison commander stated that he took control of brougham castle not because it was strategically important but to deny parliamentarians of its use whilst under royalist control lady anne donated income from her estates to upkeep of her castles in june 1648 appleby endured a four day siege before capitulating to parliamentarians but lightly manned brougham castle succumbed easily to colonel john lambert although many castles in cumberland and westmorland were dismantled so they could not be used again brougham was spared this fate most likely because it was not strategically important in 1650 lady anne clifford began repairing appleby and brougham repairs were mostly complete by 1653 but continued for several years afterwards work costing an estimated ps40 000 by this time brougham castle was no longer a serious fortification and had become anne s country house she laid out a garden on site of old roman fort which led to discovery of such roman artefacts as coins and three altars a stone wall was built around garden enclosing an area from gatehouse to south end of roman fort picturesque ruin thumb 300px brougham castle in mezzotint by william say after j m w turner 1825 lady anne clifford died at brougham castle in 1676 and her grandson nicholas tufton 3rd earl of thanet inherited clifford estates he died in 1679 and over next five years possession passed through his three younger brothers under youngest thomas tufton 6th earl of thanet brougham castle suffered particular neglect in 1714 he decided that appleby castle was a sufficient residence and sold contents of brougham castle for ps570 only tower of league was left untouched but in 1723 its contents were also sold for ps40 by 1750s castle s only practical use was as a ready source of building material for village of brougham which prospered due to investment from earl of thanet in 1794 a record of dilapidated state of castle noted that much of interior walls have lately been removed also for purposes of building houses for adjoining during late 18th century lake district became a popular visitor attraction and sensibilities of romanticism such historic ruins as brougham castle in his poem prelude william wordsworth recounted exploring ruins of brougham as an adolescent with his sister brougham also provided inspiration for another of wordsworth s poems song at feast of brougham castle upon restoration of lord clifford shepherd to estates and honours of his ancestors fallen castle attracted sightseers and antiquarians such as william gilpin and richard warner in his diary journey to lake district from cambridge 1779 william wilberforce described brougham castle as a very fine ruin painter j m w turner visited brougham in 1809 and 1831 and on first occasion produced a sketch which would be starting point of a later watercolour to avoid castle decaying further charles tufton 10th earl of thanet spent repairing structure in 1830 and his successor henry tufton 11th earl of thanet undertook further repairs in late 1840s costing henry tufton died in 1849 and castle ownership fell to maintenance was too expensive for family and by 1859 cattle were being kept in its gatehouse and visitors complained that parts of romantic ruin had become inaccessible without sufficient funds castle quickly fell into marked decay in 1915 ancient monuments board declared brougham castle a monument whose preservation was regarded as being of national importance with introduction of bus services in area castle experienced renewed interest from public and in late 1920s around 2 000 people visited annually in 1927 2nd baron hothfield granted guardianship of brougham castle to office of works although he retained ownership organisation repaired castle at cost of ps5 925 in 1930s an additional ps1 050 was spent removing masonry added in 1840s brougham castle survives essentially as it was when main repairs were finished in 1930s castle is a scheduled monument meaning it is a nationally important historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change until 1984 when a survey of standing structure was conducted little archaeological investigation had taken place at brougham castle survey was part of a monograph on castle detailing its history and phasing of structure brougham is one of only a few castles in cumbria to have undergone extensive archaeological investigation today castle is open to public and a museum is run by english heritage successor of office of works layout thumb 300px approach to 14th century gatehouse with 13th century keep on left path to brougham castle leads from east to west to south or left of someone approaching castle are earthworks of roman fort and location of 17th century garden ground is terraced and to north land slopes down towards river eamont a moat runs alongside east south and west faces of castle its width varying between and lying up to deep although moat is now dry it is likely that it used to be filled with water castle is an irregular polygon measuring about along west side along south wide in east and on north side brougham castle is entered through a three storey double gatehouse originally coat of arms of roger clifford and his wife was carved above entrance to gatehouse but in 19th century this was replaced by current inscription thys made roger by henry tufton 11th earl of thanet inscription was originally above entrance of great hall built by roger clifford 5th baron clifford erected on slope inclining down to river gatehouse was constructed in early 14th century by robert de clifford 1st baron de clifford complex has three components inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between inner gatehouse survives to a height of in east ground floor passage through building is vaulted and there was a portcullis at east end a postern gate was hidden behind a buttress in north side of gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving castle floors above passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to keep allowing people to move between two without having to go outside in 17th century lady anne clifford converted top floor into her bedroom like inner gatehouse outer section had a square plan and upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room building survives to a height of in east below outer gatehouse was a dungeon and at ground floor level on north side guardroom large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences although very top of gatehouse no longer survives it would have been crested by machicolations thumb left outer wall of brougham castle keep can be seen in background adjoined to gatehouse is 13th century keep a keep contained main domestic accommodation in a castle usually high status and also provided last place of refuge if surrounding enclosure fell during an assault brougham s keep has a square plan and is between high although originally would have stood taller access to each floor was granted by a spiral staircase in north east corner with each floor consisting of a single large room garderobe was located in north west corner it had long been assumed that keep was built in last quarter of 12th century due to its simple design square design use of narrow buttresses at each corner and entrance through a forebuilding are consistent with other keeps built in late 12th century by 13th century brougham s keep would have been old fashioned compared to polygonal structures introduced in 13th century however historian henry summerson who assessed historic documents for castle concluded that construction could not have begun earlier than first quarter of 13th century wooden floors no longer survive and use of rooms in keep is mostly conjectural but it is likely that ground floor would have served as a storage room with first floor being used as a hall and accommodation for guards and second floor providing rooms for lord a final fourth storey was added in early 14th century keep would have been entered at first floor level through east side where it was abutted by a forebuilding despite keep s importance to castle structure little survives of building today south east of keep was hall built by roger clifford in late 14th century as a replacement for an earlier hall it provided space for castle s garrison swelled by anglo scottish wars and was a location for lord to eat with his soldiers hall had large windows which may have detracted from building s defensive capability although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters kitchen which served entire castle was set in south east corner of fortification along south wall were arranged more lodgings a well and a chapel latter another addition by roger clifford in south west corner of castle was tower of league built around 1300 by roger clifford it included further rooms for accommodation but notably would also have allowed defenders to fire on an enemy emerging from gatehouse four storeys tall and with a single room at each level presence of a garderobe and fireplace on each floor suggests that tower was reserved for high status visitors tower s square plan is typical of such structures built in northern england at this time as seen at castles such as warkworth and egremont although it contrasts with rounded towers preferred in south folklore antiquary william stukeley visited brougham castle in 1725 and recorded local beliefs about certain monuments of stone south of brougham castle they are generally by country people said to be done by michael scot a noted conjuror in their opinion who was a monk of holme abbey in cumberland they have a notion too that one turquin a giant lived at brougham castle and there is a tower there called pagan tower and sir lancelot de lake lived at and slew him turquin or tarquin is also associated in folklore with ruins of castle nearby folklorist marjorie rowling identified him with another legendary local giant hugh but jennifer westwood and jacqueline simpson prefer to derive him from sir tarquin an adversary of sir lancelot in thomas malory s le morte d arthur they believe that this story unlocalized by malory probably became associated with north west england because king arthur was often said to hold his court in carlisle see also brougham hall a nearby ruined hall castles in great britain and ireland list of castles in england references notes bibliography external links
