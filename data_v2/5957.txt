and action packed second act but found that plot was too slow in first half and most of characters were under developed series was also nominated for a primetime emmy award for main title design development after success of previous live action promotional shorts landfall and life 343 industries studio in charge of development for halo franchise wanted to use a live action series to appeal to an audience of people unfamiliar with halo games director of franchise business management at 343 industries matt explained intended audience by saying that you see something that looks like a video game you re going to get same crowd you always get live action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop characters series is used to introduce character thomas lasky to halo universe before his role in video game halo 4 developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than master chief whose face is never seen to not only convey an understanding of universe but to better engage unfamiliar viewers microsoft considers series next step between advertising material and a full length film after failure of a previous effort and aimed to produce a standalone series that could be enjoyed without necessarily playing games budget for series was almost usd 10 million microsoft s largest investment in a live action promotion director stewart hendler said we re either best funded web series of all time a sort of mid road healthy tv pilot or a super low budget movie when idea of directing a video game based web series was pitched to hendler he declined saying he was not interested in video game adaptions unless subject was halo hendler was already a fan of series having read novels and played games potential writers were interviewed by 343 industries and some were selected to write a draft of a script aaron and todd helbing wrote a pitch set on harvest first planet to be attacked by covenant see halo contact harvest although 343 industries decided not to use it helbing brothers script was most complete and demonstrated best understanding of halo universe so they were chosen to write forward unto dawn final plot was developed by 343 industries frank o connor and with intention of introducing a new character to tie into halo 4 which their harvest script did not and to explore least well known part of halo universe in addition to providing input on script 343 industries had a representative on set at all times to ensure that series did not break canon shooting and special effects thumb left warthog prop built by weta workshop alt an image of warthog prop used in forward unto dawn a four wheel drive off road vehicle with a mounted minigun series was shot over twenty five days in may 2012 in forests around vancouver at simon fraser university and at additional stages in burnaby herzog and company production team was in vancouver for three months with set design by legacy effects same company that worked on previous shorts warthog a off road vehicle with a mounted minigun that appears in forward unto dawn is same one that was produced by weta workshop and used in landfall stunt driver found that prop handles roads extremely well for something that size and that height and four wheel steering was an advantage for drifting many chase shots were made using a mercedes benz ml 55 pursuit vehicle with a camera boom mounted to roof another rig involved towing warthog on a low trailer so that cameras could focus on an actor while vehicle was being driven visual effects supervisor john sullivan hired arc productions to create just under 500 shots with computer generated imagery between a quarter and a third of what a blockbuster film would feature covenant that appear are all completely computer generated as is academy s space elevator weapons muzzle flashes and a few shots of master chief hendler felt that visual effects were area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of budget on master chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production one scene involves a covenant elite stalking cadets in armoury geometry of elite already exists for halo video games but it couldn t be directly transferable to mental ray renderer so it had to be re in and maya outdoor attack on academy was filmed at simon fraser university and required reconstruction and laser measurement to add aliens and weapons lighting effects in a convincing manner a later scene in forest was too complex to use same techniques lacking geometric shapes of university campus instead arc visual effects supervisor terry bradley scattered leds on set by measuring distance between leds studio could model area with software and then used sketchup and maya to add weapons fire shattering of pink needles fired by covenant was rendered in houdini as shots hit concrete and master chief s armour opening sequences of each episode show cortana an artificial intelligence aboard spaceship forward unto dawn as she malfunctions five sequences were entirely computer generated by animation team of blacklist a production company setting forward unto dawn takes place on a fictional planet circinius iv one of many that humans have colonized outside of solar system protagonist thomas lasky is aboard a spaceship named infinity in forward unto dawn portrays his memory of events on circinius iv in 2526 when he is a cadet at corbulo academy a training facility for children of high ranking unsc officers unsc is training cadets for war with insurrectionists on various colony planets a covenant army attacks academy causing confusion and panic although not made clear in forward unto dawn covenant are a theocratic collection of alien species that are religiously offended by humanity and seek to eradicate it events portrayed in forward unto dawn are some of earliest encounters with covenant and characters other than master chief were unaware of their existence casting and characters production team was responsible for casting but microsoft maintained a final say decision to use alex instead of steve downes previous voice artist of master chief was approved by microsoft actors playing cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes cast members drove themselves to overexertion in training causing some to vomit which they saw as a bonding experience tom green plays protagonist thomas lasky a cadet at corbulo academy and ty olsson plays adult rendition lasky is ambivalent about his role in military considering diplomacy a better option to warfare lasky is from a military family his mother is a colonel and his brother played by max carver was an odst orbital drop shock troopers a special forces unit in halo universe but thomas is uninterested in becoming an officer green portrayed lasky as a regular teenager unsure of his future as research for role green was required to watch previous shorts and read halo encyclopedia that 343 industries uses to preserve halo canon executive producer josh feldman considers lasky an important character in halo universe beyond just forward unto dawn and halo 4 daniel cudmore was cast to play role of master chief largely due to his height and physique director stewart hendler wanted to contrast size of master chief to that of teenage cadets cudmore is 203 centimetres 6 8 tall whereas actors playing cadets were deliberately chosen to be short scrawny freshmen in order to accurately portray master chief cudmore watched landfall shorts by neill blomkamp and read halo novels for history of character having already played games cudmore expressed interest in history of master chief character s view on war and his role as a soldier as he was only required to portray a utilitarian character in series cudmore thinks character is torn between aiding cadets and completing his mission but master chief s confidence and actions inspire cadets legacy effects took a body scan of cudmore then overlaid a 3d model provided by microsoft and edited it to get proportions correct a prototype was 3d printed and then used to make moulds for final suit majority of suit is rubber over a foam bodysuit similar to a wetsuit with a fibreglass helmet cudmore compared wearing it to walking through water although he had to perform stunts in suit as it was made only for his body cudmore repeatedly watched video of his movements immediately after they were shot to ensure that they were deliberate but without appearing robotic trying to make his movements a little larger than life but still with a sense of humanity to them both hendler and frank o connor praised cudmore not just for his physique but for moving in a fluid manner in cumbersome suit anna popplewell plays chyler silva a cadet who contrary to lasky s beliefs is a full supporter of war against insurrectionists popplewell portrays silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence she had a romantic connection with lasky that was interrupted by covenant attack popplewell was new to halo series when cast for role but thinks that characters and aesthetic of series have potential to draw in a new audience other characters include cadets april a senior cadet and squad leader played by brewster chen played by osric chau who is only cadet without a military family and has gained entry to academy through his own achievements tchakova played by kat de walter vickers played by iain belcher and michael sullivan played by masam holden episodes no title directed by written by original air date release on april 30 2012 microsoft studios announced that forward unto dawn would play on

is approximately one metre 3 long and has scenes from both video game and web series critical reaction reviewers were divided on what standard to expect of series and what to compare it to budget was beyond that of other web series but not on par with a film ign reviewer jesse schedeen considered cadets other than lasky and silva to be ready made cannon fodder having received minimal development this detracted from quality of third episode as a betrayal by cadet tchakova had little impact due to her shallow development however schedeen did appreciate green s acting in last episode noting that silva s death scene was handled very well particularly as it forced tom green to shed his calm exterior and react much more emotionally in his later review of blu ray schedeen complimented audio and video quality as well as inclusion of many vignettes documentary featurettes and commentaries james plath of movie metropolis also found characters lacking in first half but noted that in second half characters of lasky and silva actually move beyond cliches and pick up a personality along way plath was impressed by soundtrack thinking it worthy of any big screen action flick and also complimented special effects saying cgi work is enhanced by high definition not exposed by it overall however he thought that despite action being exciting pedestrian first half and only adequate acting would prevent forward unto dawn appealing to an audience beyond existing gamers official xbox magazines reviewer edwin evans appreciated direction of series stewart hendler s well judged editing keeps script from sinking under weight of its own melodrama and his close ups never overstay their welcome hiding weaknesses of inexperienced but talented cast he also echoed plath s thoughts on slow first
