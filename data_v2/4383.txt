suss jew is a 1940 nazi german propaganda film produced by terra film at behest of joseph goebbels and considered one of most antisemitic films of all time otto 77 entry for 31 may 1943 in dieter borkowski wer weiss ob wir uns erinnerungen an eine berliner jugend frankfurt am main 1980 pp 42 43 film was directed by veit harlan who wrote screenplay with eberhard wolfgang moller and ludwig metzger leading roles were played by ferdinand marian and harlan s wife kristina soderbaum werner krauss and heinrich george played key supporting roles film has been characterized as one of most notorious and successful pieces of antisemitic film propaganda produced in nazi germany it was a great success in germany and was seen by 20 million people although film s budget of 2 million reichsmarks was considered high for films of that era box office receipts of 6 5 million reichsmarks made it a financial success heinrich himmler urged members of ss and police to watch movie after war some of leading cast members were brought to trial as part of denazification process they generally defended their participation in film on grounds that they had only done so under duress despite significant evidence to support their arguments susan tegel author of nazis and cinema amazon page nazis and cinema characterizes their postwar attempts to distance themselves from film as crass and self serving however she concedes that their motives for accepting roles seem to have been more driven by opportunistic ambition than by antisemitism veit harlan was only major movie director of third reich to stand trial for crimes against humanity after three trials harlan was given a light sentence because he convinced courts that antisemitic content of film had been dictated by goebbels and that harlan had worked to moderate antisemitism eventually harlan was reinstated as a citizen of federal republic of germany and went on to make nine more films he remained a controversial figure and target of protests together with die rothschilds and der ewige jude both released in 1940 film remains one of most frequently discussed examples of use of film to further nazi antisemitic agenda in 2000s two documentary films and a drama were released that explore history and impact of this movie background joseph suss oppenheimer thumb alt satirical depiction of joseph suss oppenheimer with iron gallows of stuttgart as an emblem on bottom engraving 1738 joseph suss oppenheimer joseph suss oppenheimer was an 18th century court jew in employ of duke karl alexander of wurttemberg in stuttgart as a financial advisor for duke karl alexander duke of wurttemberg he also gained a prominent position as a court jew and held reins of finances in his duchy he established a duchy monopoly on trade of salt leather tobacco and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory in process he made a number of enemies who claimed among other things that he was involved with local gambling houses when karl alexander died suddenly oppenheimer was arrested and accused of various things including fraud embezzlement treason lecherous relations with court ladies accepting bribes and trying to reestablish catholicism jewish community tried unsuccessfully to ransom him after a heavily publicized trial during which no proofs were produced he was sentenced to death when his jailers demanded that he convert to christianity he refused he was taken to gallows on 4 february 1738 and given a final chance to convert to christianity which he refused to do feuchtwanger s novel although story of duke karl alexander and joseph suss oppenheimer constituted a relatively obscure episode in german history it became subject of a number of literary and dramatic treatments over course of more than a century earliest of these having been wilhelm hauff s 1827 novella most successful literary adaptation was lion feuchtwanger s novel titled jud suss 1925 based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew as a jew feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of suss to be antisemitic but rather as a study of tragedy caused by human weaknesses of greed pride and ambition with an interest in exploring challenges confronting jews in diaspora feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with issues of conversion and antisemitism he was particularly struck by fact that suss could have saved himself by converting to christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so opting instead to return to formal jewish observance and piety ashley dukes and paul kornfeld wrote dramatic adaptations of feuchtwanger novel german born american director lothar mendes directed a british financed film adaptation of novel in 1934 this film entitled power in u s starred famous conrad veidt who played cesar in cabinet of dr caligari 1919 and was an early effort to expose nazi anti semitism it prompted nazi propaganda ministry to make their own version of film which starred distinguished german star werner krauss who had played doctor in caligari plot film begins with coronation of karl alexander duke of wurttemberg heinrich george a man much beloved by his swabian people who swears an oath to obey laws of dukedom according to traditional wurttemberg loyalty and honesty however duke soon becomes frustrated because wurttemberg diet provincial council refuses him funds needed to maintain a lifestyle comparable to his neighboring sovereigns in particular he wants a personal bodyguard an opera company and a ballet company lacking funds even to purchase coronation gifts for duchess hilde von stolz duke sends a courtier to frankfurt to borrow money from joseph suss oppenheimer ferdinand marian suss shows emissary jewels and jewelry that are obviously beyond duke s means and then says that it would be his honor to provide duke with jewelry at a substantial discount however suss insists on presenting items to duke personally despite a ban against jews entering city that has been in force for over a century armed with a pass from duke suss cuts his hair shaves his beard and dons christian clothes so that he can enter wurttemberg disguised as a christian as his carriage gets into an accident suss gets a lift from dorothea sturm kristina soderbaum to city duke is delighted with jewelry and suss willingly defers payment suss offers to provide financing for duke s bodyguard opera and ballet as well eventually duke discovers that he owes suss 350 000 thalers but suss demurs saying that all he wants in payment is authority to maintain roads and bridges of dukedom for 10 years and right to levy tolls for their use and upkeep duke will receive a percentage of proceeds thereby freeing him from financial limits imposed by council new tolls cause price of food and other essentials to rise enriching both suss and duke suss gains authority to levy taxes on salt beer wine and wheat as well he also assists in procuring local women for duke thus engaging in corruption of their morals increase in price of basic necessities causes people of wurttemberg to suffer great privation oppressive taxes and brutal collection methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly suss goes so far as to destroy half of a blacksmith s house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes when blacksmith attacks suss s coach with a sledgehammer suss has blacksmith hanged on grounds that an attack on duke s minister is tantamount to an attack on duke himself after some initial resistance duke yields to suss s request for repeal of law prohibiting jews from living in wurttemberg a horde of dirty disreputable jews are then shown moving into city suss enables them to enrich themselves at expense of populace aged rabbi loew werner krauss criticizes suss for his excessively opulent lifestyle as duke s finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall warning that lord punishes jews who forget who they are but suss pays him no heed suss relentlessly pursues dorothea sturm and schemes to marry her but his plans are frustrated when her father council chairman eugen klopfer intervenes dorothea and her fiance faber malte jaeger marry in secret suss then has dorothea s father imprisoned on grounds that he is a leader of conspiracy against duke when council objects to duke s increasing usurpation of power and abrogation of constitution suss suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing council and restructuring government so that duke can reign as an absolute monarch suss tells duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that as a sign of their gratitude jews of wurttemberg will provide all requisite funds suss argues that he would be most effective if duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from laws of wurttemberg duke refuses at first but ultimately grants suss s request as part of an attempt to thwart duke s planned coup d etat faber is sent on a mission to get help from outside city but is arrested as he tries to leave city despite being tortured he refuses to reveal identities of his co conspirators dorothea goes to suss to beg for her husband s release but suss demands that she have sex with him as price for her husband s freedom suss rapes dorothea who then escapes and drowns herself suss keeps his promise to free faber who subsequently discovers his wife s drowned corpse suss suggests to duke that two of them go to ludwigsburg on pretext of meeting emperor s emissary and return to wurttemberg only after planned coup has established him as an absolute monarch however before foreign mercenaries arrive to effect suss s coup people of wurttemberg rise up under leadership of obrist roder wurttemberg soldiers refuse to fire on their fellow citizens and several of townspeople go to ludwigsburg to confront duke and suss as they are presenting their grievances duke suffers a fatal heart attack suss is taken into custody by rebels and subjected to a lengthy trial on charges that include treason and financial improprieties however he is ultimately convicted primarily on charge that he had sex with a christian woman suss is executed pleading to last that he was nothing more than a faithful servant of late duke all other jews are then given three days to leave wurttemberg as film draws to a close

joseph goebbels adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels believed that film was a very potent tool for molding public opinion nazis first established a film department in 1930 and goebbels had taken a personal interest in use of film to promote nazi philosophy and agenda soon after nazi takeover goebbels was insisting in speeches that role of german cinema was to serve as vanguard of nazi military as they set forth to conquer world he asked them to produce films with sharp racial contours that portrayed men and society as they are in reality according to richard levy of 1100 feature films produced under nazis only a handful demonstrated explicit antisemitic content and even there antisemitism was often secondary to film s plot two films however were designed to translate national socialism s antisemitic ideology to a popular audience der ewige jude eternal jew 1940 and jud suss jew suss 1940 in november 1938 goebbels made a series of attacks against jews in german media that after murder of a german diplomat in paris by a jew resulted in anti jewish riots known as kristallnacht kristallnacht was considered by hitler to have been a political disaster both within germany and internationally and he became furious with goebbels not only did brutality instigated by goebbels evoke harsh criticism internationally mixed reaction in german media evidenced a lack of broad based support among germans for antisemitic violence hitler expressed his frustration and anger at mixed response from german media and insisted that instead of openly calling for violence against jews as goebbels had in instigating pogrom nazi propaganda should elucidate events of foreign policy in such a way that german people themselves would call for violence against jews in response to hitler s reprimand goebbels launched a campaign to promote antisemitic views of nazis to german populace he ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film hitler preferred films such as der ewige jude which presented nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly however goebbels disliked crudeness of such straight forward approaches preferring much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal although goebbels did not generally take an active role in production of particular films he elected to do so in case of major propaganda films such as jud suss saul friedlander suggests that goebbels intent was to counter three films whose messages attacked persecution of jews throughout history by producing antisemitic versions of those films with identical titles after viewing lothar mendes sensitive 1934 british financed film jew suss starring great german exile from nazism conrad veidt goebbels was adamant that a new film version had to be made although metzger had been trying to pitch a movie based on life of joseph suss oppenheimer for many years impetus for movie came from joseph goebbels desire to make an antisemitic response to mendes philo semitic film adaptation of lion feuchtwanger s 1925 novel jud suss because mendes movie was so sympathetic to subject scriptwriters shifted their model to wilhelm hauff s 1827 novella however even after harlan rewrote original script result was not antisemitic enough to suit goebbels propaganda needs so he personally intervened in editing process to point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to film s ending to show suss as humbled rather than defiant thus message of film was diametrically opposed to intent of feuchtwanger s novel at same time however film evokes feuchtwanger s texts twisting and reversing core of jewish writer s work although inspired by historical details of suss s life novel novella and film only loosely correspond to historical sources available at baden wurttemberg christiane schonfeld who examines connections between feuchtwanger s jud suss play and novel and veit harlan s propaganda film writes lion feuchtwanger considered harlan s film an adaptation of his novel jud suss that perverted and reversed intentions of his text as he writes in his open letter to seven berlin actors after having read a review of film in an nsdap newspaper even without having seen film lion feuchtwanger had no doubt that veit harlan and his collaborators had expropriated his novel and adapted it to purposes of nazi propaganda synopsis of film narrative provided in review highlighted a perversion of plot of feuchtwanger s text that author instantly recognised he identifies focal point of distortion when he refers to desperate young woman and sexual abuse she endures she is indeed a prime example of nazis ruthless misrepresentation and her character her rape and tragic death prove nazis deliberate abuse of jewish writer s work susan tegel ascribes genesis of project more to opportunism than to ideological antisemitism tegel s assessment echoes klaus s assertion that recognized stars of german stage and screen were less aligned with nazi philosophy and more motivated by professional ambition and illusion that goebbels would fulfill them metzger and moller script ludwig metzger had been trying to promote his proposal for a film on life of joseph suss oppenheimer since as early as 1921 but without any success publication of feuchtwanger s book and mendes film adaptation of it irritated metzger because he himself had been incubating idea for many years in january or february 1939 metzger now a scriptwriter for terra mentioned his idea to wolfgang ebbecke with whom he was working on script for central rio ebbecke shot down idea raising a number of objections including fact that mendes had already done a film on same topic in england and concern that german audiences might confuse proposed film with feuchtwanger s novel which was not antisemitic undaunted by ebbecke s objections metzger took his idea to teich story editor at terra but was once again turned down finally metzger approached propaganda ministry directly where his proposal was received like a bomb hitting its target teich was informed that terra should proceed with metzger s proposal and so he reluctantly presented idea to head of studio when studio head refused to approve project goebbels had him fired and replaced by peter paul brauer a minor director with no experience in producing films as head of studio brauer assigned himself task of directing film however project stalled out for a number of reasons including challenges in recruiting a suitable cast and difficulties in producing a script acceptable to goebbels at goebbels direction metzger was given a contract by terra to write a script for proposed film he decided to base his script on 1827 hauff novella rather than more recent and better known 1925 feuchtwanger novel however when goebbels read metzger s draft of script he deemed it to be insufficiently antisemitic for his propaganda campaign to remedy script s deficiencies goebbels assigned playwright eberhard wolfgang moller to assist metzger even though moller had no experience as a screenwriter moller s role was to ensure that script met goebbel s ideological objectives moller decided to abandon hauff s novella as basis of script dismissing hauff as too sentimental about emancipation of jews and poles in meantime brauer was working on recruiting a cast but with little success actors being considered for lead role of joseph suss oppenheimer included gustaf grundgens rene rudolf richard siegfried brauer paul and ferdinand marian grundgens declined citing his responsibilities as director of prussian state theatre marian also declined veit harlan when nazi germany conquered poland in september 1939 it was faced with disposition of large jewish population in view of german populace s tepid response to orchestrated violence of kristallnacht nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move german popular sentiment in favor of nazi final solution to jewish question frustrated with delays on jud suss project goebbels ordered fritz head of his film department to sack brauer and bring in veit harlan to take over as director after war harlan claimed that no other director would touch project and that he himself had tried to decline role of director filmmaker leni riefenstahl in her 1987 memoir confirmed that harlan had told her of goebbels s insistence that he direct film and of his ardent desire to get out of project harlan had even written to goebbels volunteering for military service in order to avoid making film goebbels responded to this by informing harlan that if he enlisted he would do his military service at front according to harlan goebbels screamed at him i can crush you like a bug on wall when harlan asked riefenstahl to intercede for him with goebbels she demurred citing her own conflicts with propaganda minister instead of intervening on his behalf riefenstahl advised harlan to move to switzerland however harlan expressed fear for his life and impact it would have on his wife script rewrite according to harlan s postwar testimony he told goebbels that metzger moller script was nothing more than dramatized sturmer referring to a nazi weekly propaganda publication he argued that such a piece of poor writing would lead not to portrayal of a despicable jew but rather to just a despicable film goebbels wanted harlan to include sequences depicting jewish ritual slaughter but harlan demurred arguing that portraying such cruelty would make audiences sick to their stomachs harlan complained to goebbels that all characters were negative to this goebbels retorted that harlan would not turn down role of richard iii just because he was a negative character however goebbels acceded to harlan s insistence on rewriting script and harlan spent from november 1939 to march 1940 revising script although he kept much of what metzger and moller had written after war harlan claimed that his script was less antisemitic than metzger moller script he even claimed that mendes script was more antisemitic than his however in rebuttal haggith and newman point out that harlan added an important sequence in which suss is responsible for execution of a blacksmith a sequence which served to increase audience s hatred for suss pre production feeling that a project of this significance required top caliber actors and frustrated at delay in casting film goebbels personally participated in recruitment of lead actors for example he insisted that ferdinand marian and werner krauss take on key roles in film however goebbels had to employ a combination of accommodation generous compensation pressure intimidation and even threats of reprisal in order to fill lead roles in film with top german cinema stars of day harlan claimed that virtually every actor was performing under duress daniel azuelos ascribes cast s reluctance to an unwillingness to be typecast as jews david welch identifies werner krauss as having asked goebbels to make a public pronouncement stating that krauss was not jewish but merely playing a part as an actor in service of state in order to address their concerns goebbels issued a disclaimer stating that those actors playing parts of jews were in fact of pure aryan blood similarly josef skvorecky also notes that all major cast members as well as harlan himself tried in various ways to avoid participation in project however skvorecky ascribes a rather different motivation to cast than one that azuelos propounds skvorecky attributes reluctance of actors to participate in what he characterizes as a politically most correct film as an indication of how aware most german artists were of fact that antisemitism under hitler changed from prejudice to murder while cast members could have declined roles that were offered to them skvorecky asserts that such action would have required extraordinary courage dire consequences of such an act of defiance were only too easy to imagine according to skvorecky goebbels either outwitted actors he desired for cast or knew about compromising circumstances in their lives and used this knowledge for bludgeoning them into acceptance elaborating on compromising circumstances skvorecky writes one of paradoxes of this sinister film is how many participants in violently racist project had either jewish spouses or relatives were disciples of jewish artists and known friends or jews or had been before nazi takeover left leaning intellectuals even communists for example skvorecky points out that veit harlan s first wife was dora gerson a german jewish actress and cabaret singer who later died in auschwitz harlan himself had flirted with socialism although werner krauss was openly antisemitic and an ardent nazi his daughter in law was jewish ferdinand marian had a half jewish daughter from his first marriage and former husband of his second wife was a jew thumb alt photograph of heinrich george and his dog taken in 1930 heinrich george thumb alt photograph of werner krauss werner krauss heinrich george was active in communist party before nazi takeover he had worked with fellow left wingers theatre director erwin piscator and dramatist bertolt brecht and had starred in lead role of film berlin alexanderplatz 1931 after nazi takeover george was identified as a non desirable actor because of his earlier political affiliations and was barred from working in cinematic productions however he was able to reach an accommodation with nazi regime and was eventually appointed director of schiller theater berlin in 1938 from that point onwards george actively collaborated with nazis and agreed to star in nazi propaganda films such as jud suss and kolberg 1945 as well as appearing in numerous newsreels george had a stocky build and a berlin accent which made him readily recognizable to german audiences his prestige as a leading actor of day made him an extraordinarily valuable catch for nazis cooke and silberman describe him as actor most closely tied with fascist fantasies of autocratic and populist leader george s affiliation with nazis would have fatal consequences for him after war when soviets arrested him as a nazi collaborator he died in 1946 while interned in nkvd special camp nr 7 located in sachsenhausen according to harlan it was goebbels who insisted that harlan s wife kristina soderbaum play leading female role according to antje soderbaum is frequently identified as most singularly representative of nazi ideal as quintessential nazi star as a beautiful swedish blonde soderbaum had baby doll looks that epitomized model aryan woman in fact she had already played role of innocent aryan in a number of feature films and was well known to german audiences her youth and beauty made her a symbol of health and purity and thus an exemplary specimen of nazi ideal of womanhood in a number of her films she had been imperiled by threat of rassenschande racial pollution because two of her films ended with her committing suicide by drowning she was given mock honorary title drowned corpse of reich harlan argued to goebbels that soderbaum having just given birth was too weak to take on role goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet nurse could be hired to care for infant he further offered to halt shooting if soderbaum became ill harlan later reported that soderbaum was so upset by entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native sweden to avoid having to play part of dorothea in end however she decided to stay and performed role story was different in case of ferdinand marian who is often characterized as having established a reputation as a matinee idol initially marian was repulsed by proposal that he play title role of jud suss and demurred for almost a year as a result he was not confirmed in role until about a week before shooting was scheduled to begin according to kristina soderbaum marian was afraid that playing such an unappealing character would damage his image with film audiences she recalled that marian had told goebbels that his stage persona was one of a bon vivant and a lover and that suss in contrast was a truly unpleasant character goebbels rebutted marian s argument by pointing out that he had just seen marian s portrayal of iago asking was he a nice bon vivant when marian responded but that was shakespeare herr minister goebbels screamed into his face saying and i am joseph goebbels marian finally agreed to play part of suss for fear of reprisal against members of his family marian had a daughter from his first marriage to jewish pianist irene former husband of his second wife was also jewish making her son and marian s stepson half jewish goebbels however used not only intimidation but also cajoling and generosity to achieve his goals ferdinand marian requested compensation of 50 000 marks for taking on role of suss an amount double anything he had received for previous roles when asked to approve this amount goebbels did so citing importance of film and need for a high caliber cast to ensure its success according to his biographer friedrich knilli marian never forgave himself for having accepted role of suss knilli ascribes marian s alcoholism and alleged suicide after war to his feelings of guilt of all cast members werner krauss was one most clearly identified as an antisemite his consummate skills in characterization had earned him title of man with a thousand faces there is some difference of opinion regarding number of roles that krauss played in film while it is generally recognized that with exception of marian s title role other five speaking parts that depicted jews were all played by krauss gottfried reinhardt asserts that krauss played no less than thirteen jews in movie roles that krauss played in film are often characterized as portraying antisemitic stereotypes in an interview harlan explained that decision to have krauss play all roles was meant to show how all these different temperaments and characters pious patriarch wily swindler penny pinching merchant and so on were all ultimately derived from same jewish root katrin sieg describes krauss face as eerily appearing in different guises whenever camera pans across a crowd of jews creating what sieg calls a paranoid effect of deja vu production shooting began in march 1940 and with exception of some scenes which were shot on location in prague most of filming took place at ufa studios in berlin babelsberg scenes showing entry of jews into wurttemberg and worshipping in a synagogue were filmed in prague where jewish extras were coerced into performing total cost of production was approximately two million reichsmarks a rather high figure for german feature films of that era however between 1940 and 1943 it grossed over 6 2 million reichsmarks thus making it a blockbuster in contrast to commercial failure of der ewige jude david culbert attributes film s box office success in large part to its lavish sets its effective crowd scenes its skillful script and splendid acting by most of principals editing according to harlan s postwar testimony goebbels was infuriated when he saw harlan s first version of film because it was not antisemitic enough for his purposes harlan reported that goebbels accused him of being incapable of thinking in political terms goebbels told him that he should produce political films and not kind of films that he would make in peacetime goebbels dissatisfaction was centered on relationship between dorothea leading female character and suss he complained that harlan had transformed suss a monster into a romeo harlan testified that goebbels removed him from editing process and insisted on many changes mostly with intent of making suss more unambiguously evil film was extensively re edited to remove ambiguities that portrayed suss in too sympathetic a light to suit goebbels antisemitic agenda for example goebbels insisted on dropping a scene in which dorothea responds to suss s wooing with a smile scenes in which suss was depicted as too pleasant were simply dropped in some scenes new lines were scripted for marian to read in order to make his character less sympathetic other scenes were added including a new ending to replace original one written by harlan harlan claimed that he had wanted to make hanging of suss appear to have been a great injustice for final execution scene harlan had written a defiant speech in which suss condemned german authorities when goebbels was shown a rough cut copy he was infuriated insisting that suss must not be portrayed in any way as a martyr demanding that suss must be humbled and humiliated at end he had harlan s speech replaced with one in which suss cravenly begged for his life while harlan s account of goebbels involvement in film has been treated by a number of sources as factual haggith and newman assert that it is difficult to find any evidence of significant interference by goebbels aside from casting and appointment of harlan they point out that it was in harlan s interest to shift blame to goebbels after war release and reception film premiered at venice film festival on 8 september 1940 and received rave reviews earning top award unlike most of other major antisemitic films produced during third reich it was a great box office success in germany and abroad it ranked sixth out of thirty most popular german films of war years within third reich it was number one film of 1939 1940 season viewed by audiences totaling over twenty million at a time when population of germany was some seventy million in france film was released in february 1941 and was screened until 1944 gaining an estimated one million viewers heinrich himmler ordered that film be shown to ss units about to be sent against jews to non jewish populations of areas where jews were about to be deported and to concentration camp guards children under age of fourteen were prohibited from seeing film there were reports of anti jewish violence after audiences viewed film in particular teenagers seemed particularly prone to be instigated to violence by film stefan a guard at auschwitz concentration camp later said that after they were shown jud suss and similar films guards would beat up jewish prisoners next day in early 1941 company nordisk sought permission to distribute film in sweden but it was banned by censor during war movie was never screened in public in sweden although german embassy arranged screenings for special invitees statens 1946 86 den i sverige under 1939 1945 stockholm 1946 p 179 feuchtwanger was horrified and incensed at way in which his work had been manipulated and distorted calling harlan s film a schandwerk a shameful work in 1941 he wrote an open letter to seven actors based on sentiments expressed in letter it appears that feuchtwanger was shocked that these men whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work would agree to participate in goebbels antisemitic propaganda film

directed propaganda movie kolberg 1945 was only film director of third reich to be charged with crimes against humanity harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither nazi nor antisemitic he claimed that goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content he recounted ways in which he had been forced to endure goebbels constant haranguing and meddling in production of film in end court condemned film but exonerated director while harlan had not acted nobly court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for content of film after war all cast members also disclaimed responsibility pleading that they had been coerced into participating in film according to his biographer friedrich knilli marian never came to terms with his having accepted role of suss and became an alcoholic dying shortly after war in a 1946 car accident some have attributed accident to suicide both heinrich george and werner krauss were placed under arrest because of their past affiliation with nazi party although heinrich george had been a member of german communist party before nazi takeover he was nonetheless interned as a nazi collaborator at soviet special camp in sachsenhausen where he died in 1946 werner krauss was banned from performing on stage and in films in germany he was required to undergo a de nazification process from 1947 to 1948 ultimately he was rehabilitated to extent of being invited to german film festivals in 1954 he was awarded order of federal republic of germany in 1955 he received high decoration of republic of austria in first few years after war kristina soderbaum was often heckled off stage and even suffered indignity of having rotten vegetables thrown at her in subsequent years she frequently expressed regret for her roles in antisemitic films although soderbaum continued to play roles in film she was never offered a leading role after war eventually she became a photographer of celebrities distribution harlan was required by court order to destroy what was then believed to be only remaining negative of jud suss and he reportedly did this in april 1954 a few years later however copies of film began to turn up to embarrassment of west german government after a lengthy investigation it was determined that another negative existed in east germany and it was used it to make prints that were dubbed in arabic and distributed in middle eastern countries such as egypt and lebanon though that negative has never been located it has been widely

online with commentary by film historian eric rentschler jud suss dvd available from international historic films analysis historical accuracy although film claimed to be historically accurate plot presents only a few historically accurate details and significantly departs from historical record on a number of key points some of these departures were based on feuchtwanger novel and mendes film adaptation of it others were introduced by goebbels and harlan according to wallace it is generally recognized that narratives of both films are only loosely related by being rooted in same chapter of wurttemberg history joseph suss oppenheimer did serve duke karl alexander as a court jew when duke died suddenly suss was in fact brought to trial and subsequently executed in an iron cage more or less as depicted in film haggith and newman assert that much of rest of harlan s film is pure invention for example film presents grounds for suss s execution as being abuse of power and sexual relations with a christian woman according to shay hazkani these accusations are not mentioned in any of historical essays about real suss relationship to previous works thumb alt cover of lion feuchtwanger s 1925 novel jud suss cover of lion feuchtwanger s 1925 novel jud suss although lion feuchtwanger believed that harlan s film relied heavily on his novel and characterize film as based primarily on wilhelm hauff s novella and assert that it only uses a few characters from feuchtwanger s novel even these characters and their actions are distorted to support film s antisemitic message because goebbels envisioned a film that would be a response to mendes film adaptation of feuchtwanger s novel harlan s plot shares a similar structure to plot of mendes film with a few crucial changes which feuchtwanger characterized as shameful distortions feuchtwanger himself referred to harlan s film as a schandwerk a shameful work and wrote an open letter to seven berlin actors two of them having played lead roles in film he asserted that harlan s film had distorted his novel so much that it was a perversion of it he further called into question their motives for making film in light of their familiarity with him and his novel haines and parker characterize feuchtwanger s works and mendes film adaptation as diametrically opposed to nazi anti semitism for feuchtwanger suss was a forerunner that symbolized evolution in european philosophy and cultural mentality representing a shift towards eastern philosophy from nietzsche to buddha from old to new covenant in his novel feuchtwanger portrayed greed pride and ambition as human weaknesses found in both jews and gentiles and which could be overcome by denial of desire in contrast to feuchtwanger s philosophical meditation on tension between eastern and western philosophy harlan s film casts these as uniquely jewish traits and presents jews as a dangerous and recklessly underestimated threat stereotypes of jews film employs a number of negative stereotypes of jews as being materialistic immoral cunning untrustworthy and physically unattractive at one extreme jews are portrayed as cut throat capitalists at other they are depicted as poor filthy immigrants mike davis writes that a thousand years of european anti semitism were condensed into cowering rapist suss with his dirty beard hook nose and whining voice character of suss is based on stereotype of grasping jewish moneylender there is an early scene in which suss is shown to possess a fortune in jewels and jewelry in another he tells an innocent german girl that his home is world reflecting nazi stereotype of jews as rootless wanderers in contrast to germans love of their german homeland several conversations between jewish characters perpetuate nazi line that jews are inherently hostile to non jews according to david welch nazis issued a guide to press explaining how to interpret film guide emphasized that a key point of film was that once jews like suss got into positions of responsibility and power they exploited power not for good of community but for their own racial ends racial pollution in both feuchtwanger s novel and harlan s film dramatic climax is rape however feuchtwanger posits that suss has a hidden daughter whom duke discovers rapes and who then dies by drowning novel then focuses on suss s grappling with desire for revenge and tragedy resulting from his decision to exact vengeance for loss of his daughter harlan replaced rape of suss s daughter by duke with suss s rape of an aryan woman thus completely inverting feuchtwanger s plot device from a father s tragic quest for vengeance to punishment of a jew for having sexual relations with a christian christiane schonfeld writes that t he jew as sexual beast and vampire sucking life spirit from individual and community alike is an all too common motif in anti semitic propaganda and is put to effective use in harlan s film michael writes jud suss openly mobilized fears and sexual aggression and exploited them for anti semitic incitement according to michael kater film was shown to a large number of german girls in order to warn them of sexual devastation that jews had wrought in past and to remind them of nuremberg race laws of 1935 in an interview with der film given before release of film harlan pointed out that suss was ultimately sentenced to death not for his financial machinations which were technically legal but for violating an ancient law which prohibited jews from having sexual relations with christian women he then cites this as being an interesting parallel to nuremberg laws there is also suss s role as a purveyor of women for duke and his relentless pursuit of an aryan woman for sexual purposes even after she rebuffs his first attempt to seduce her from nazi perspective this was rassenschande a racial pollution a crime against german blood heroine s suicide is a proper response of a german to such a tragedy jew in disguise one antisemitic theme that is introduced at beginning of film is portrayal of suss as typical jew in disguise a concept which welch describes as inherent of jew and his ability to assimilate himself into whichever society he chooses suss is presented to audience first in traditional ghetto attire and then a quick cutaway to a shot of him in elegant clothes riding in a carriage on his way to stuttgart thus suss is shown to be hiding his true identity as a marginalized jew and posing as a respected member of german society however despite suss s attempts to fit into wurttemberg high society harlan will not let audience forget that he is ultimately depicted as a dirty jew and underlines this point by juxtaposing him with elderly rabbi low in an interview with der film a german film magazine harlan explained it is meant to show how all these different temperaments and characters pious patriarch wily swindler penny pinching merchant and so on are ultimately derived from same roots around middle of film we show purim festival a victory festival which jews celebrate as a festival of revenge on christians here i am depicting authentic jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in poland in contrast to this original jewry we are presented with suss elegant financial adviser to court clever politician in short jew in disguise cited in effectiveness of film stephen lee writes that hitler s vision of kind of film that was likely to engage german public proved to be less effective than more subtle approach advocated by goebbels for example documentary film der ewige jude eternal jew that hitler commissioned was so crude and strident that many audiences were repelled by grotesque imagery and film was a box office flop failure of der ewige jude convinced goebbels that most effective approach for disseminating propaganda was subtle and indirect lee writes that goebbels had learned to introduce propaganda as a subliminal message within context of a story with which audience could identify nazi antisemitic message was more subtly and artfully presented in feature film format that goebbels preferred richard levy attributes effectiveness of film in part to an arguably engaging story and casting of some of leading german stars of that period including ferdinand marian heinrich george kristina soderbaum and werner krauss he characterizes film s antisemitic message as being integrated into film s story and strategy rather than overwhelming it or seeming to stand apart from it edgar feuchtwanger attributes success of film to it being a combination of virulent anti semitism with a compelling love story full of sex and violence however stephen brockman cautions against making all too sweeping assumptions about how effective jud suss was as a propaganda tool to support his argument he points to anecdotal evidence that rather than being perceived as a despicable jew marian s portrayal of suss was considered to be quite sympathetic so much so that he received fan mail from women who had become infatuated with his character david culbert notes that t hose who have condemned jew suss as a lifeless production are presuming understandably a morally abhorrent film cannot possibly have redeeming artistic merit however culbert argues that while one can understand such reasoning it is actually a fallacy he argues that those who dismiss harlan as a loud mouthed opportunist who could direct crowd scenes have failed to understand structure of script whose brilliance is due to harlan rather than to his predecessors metzger and moller culbert attributes much of film s success to marian s performance he describes marian as making use of techniques and gestures perfected in his stage portrayal of iago in shakespeare s othello according to culbert construction of harlan s plot owes much to shakespeare recent documentary films from early twenty first century film became subject of a number of
