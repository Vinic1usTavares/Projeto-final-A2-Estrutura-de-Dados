that by 19th century had extended its rule over virtually all of madagascar son of a vazimba mother and a man of newly arrived hova people originating in southeast madagascar andriamanelo ultimately led a series of military campaigns against vazimba beginning a several decade process to drive them from highlands conflict that defined his reign also produced many lasting innovations including development of fortified villages in highlands and use of iron weapons oral tradition furthermore credits andriamanelo with establishing a ruling class of nobles andriana and defining rules of succession numerous cultural traditions including ritual of circumcision wedding custom of vodiondry and art of malagasy astrology sikidy are likewise associated with this king early life andriamanelo

produced two sons andriamanelo and his younger brother andriamananitany as well as a sister named rafotsindrindramanjaka in a bid to counteract further fracturing of their kingdom rafohy and rangita decided that while vazimba had historically been ruled by queens andriamanelo would inherit crown upon his mother s death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother this system of succession ordered by queens to be followed for all time was called fanjakana organized government and applied to families as well in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within family upon their death and that authority would be handed to designated younger child in event of death of elder child

cover rolling hills andriamanelo waged war against vazimba in an effort to expel them from highlands among distinguishing features of andriamanelo s reign was expansion of his territory around sacred hill of alasora through a military campaign against vazimba to push these legendary primitive first settlers of madagascar toward west of island after andriamanelo had successfully expanded his kingdom to include alasora to south and to north continued presence of a vazimba stronghold at analamanga located between two halves of his realm and effectively separating them posed too great a threat to unity of his kingdom to allow situation to stand he resolved to capture analamanga and drive vazimba from his territory an ambition partially realized during his reign popular legend attributes andriamanelo s military successes to several innovations including discovery of iron smelting and propagation of iron tipped spear ogot 1992 p 430 against vazimba who fought with weapons of clay kent 1970 p 93 he also fortified his capital at alasora by creating hadivory dry moats defensive trenches and vavahady town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier thereby rendering town more resistant to vazimba attacks however his attempt to establish merina dominance in central highlands was thwarted when he proved unable to seize analamanga de la vassiere abinal 1885 p 62 this vazimba stronghold would not fall until at last conquered by andriamanelo s grandson andrianjaka you 1905 p 34 warfare was not only strategy by which andriamanelo sought to

son ralambo only one of andriamanelo s children to survive to adulthood six earlier pregnancies ended in stillbirth or death of child in infancy andriamanelo is typically portrayed as a civilizing king in contrast to primitive vazimba against whom he waged war as such oral history credits him with discovering such diverse arts as silversmithing and astrology sikidy in addition to iron working he reputedly introduced knowledge about construction and use of pirogues 1895 p 206 and was first in highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through construction of dikes in valleys around alasora 2009 p 84 merina rite of circumcision described by bloch 1986 in great detail continued to be practiced by merina monarchy through end of 19th century in precisely way first established by andriamanelo generations before many elements of these rituals continue to form part of circumcision traditions of merina families in 21st century many of innovations attributed to andriamanelo were not his personal invention rather their origins can be traced back to southeastern part of island that hova had left behind as they migrated into central highlands astrology for instance had been introduced early to island by way of trade contacts between coastal malagasy communities and arab seafarers similarly archaeological evidence proves existence of iron implements in madagascar at least four centuries prior to war between andriamanelo and vazimba 1993 pp 478 483 suggesting that while technology was not discovered during his reign andriamanelo may have been among first sovereigns in imerina to make wide scale use of it in military campaigns rules of succession thumb alt red earthen wall alasora was first highland village to be fortified to protect inhabitants throughout andriamanelo s war with vazimba andriamanelo s antecedents rafohy and rangita had jointly decreed a system of social order whereby designated heir should have a younger sibling who would succeed him however this decree proved challenging upon first instance of its application according to oral tradition upon rafohy s designation of elder son andriamanelo as her successor her younger son andriamananitany initially claimed to accept her decree however andriamananitany soon began building a new village named village of god and copied system of fortifications introduced by his older brother at alasora reportedly constructing them even faster than andriamanelo word spread that andriamananitany wished to undermine his older brother s rule upon learning of andriamanelo s consequent wrath andriamananitany promptly abandoned his village of god and sought permission from his brother to build a village called village of submission where according to one version of oral history he may have attempted to construct another defensive trench de la vassiere abinal 1885 p 61 due to this provocative behavior was murdered by a group of hova possibly at andriamanelo s command raison jourde 1983 pp 241 242 consumed with remorse king sought to rectify situation by arranging a marriage between his brother s orphaned son and andriamanelo s own sister orphan s aunt rafotsindrindramanjaka he declared that child from this union would if female be wed to his own son ralambo if male he would become ralambo s successor a girl was born and she was promised to ralambo as his future wife with stipulation that child born of their union would rule after ralambo in this way andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected queens decree by ensuring that a child of his brother s line and his own would rule after him raison jourde 1983 p 238 because of this decree ralambo s first son by his second wife was passed over in line of succession in favor of andrianjaka ralambo s son by rafotsindrindramanjaka andriamanelo was also reportedly first to formally establish andriana as a caste of merina nobles thereby laying foundation for a stratified and structured society miller rowlands 1989 p 143 from this point forward term hova was used to refer only to non noble free people of society which would later be renamed merina by andriamanelo s son ralambo vodiondry marriage tradition of vodiondry still practiced to this day throughout highlands is said to have originated with andriamanelo according to oral history after sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with ramaitsoanala sole daughter of vazimba king rabiby andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry meat from hindquarters of a sheep which he believed to be tastiest portion kent 1970 pp 308 309 value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by ralambo who upon discovering edibility of zebu meat declared hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout kingdom to be his royal due from time of andriamanelo forward it became a marriage tradition for groom to offer vodiondry to bride s family over time customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic sums of money and other gifts death and succession thumb tomb of andriamanelo in alasora andriamanelo ruled until his death at an advanced age around 1575 and was succeeded by his only surviving son ralambo he was buried in alasora in an earthen ditch according to oral tradition placement of his tomb may have been to south east of royal compound rather than to north as was customary this anomaly may have been intended to symbolically indicate andriamanelo s otherness as a man of mixed ethnic background a similar tomb to north of alasora compound may have been that of andriamanelo s mother these two earthen tombs are considered oldest known royal style tombs in imerina raison jourde 1983 p 131 references bibliography further reading
