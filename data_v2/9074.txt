also spelled christ lay in death s bonds or christ lay in snares of death 4 is a cantata for easter by german composer johann sebastian bach one of his earliest church cantatas it is agreed to be an early work partly for stylistic reasons and partly because there is evidence that it was probably written for a performance in 1707 bach went on to complete many other works in same genre contributing complete cantata cycles for all occasions of liturgical year john eliot gardiner describes it as bach s first known attempt at painting narrative in music is a chorale cantata a style in which both text and music are based on a hymn in this instance source was martin luther s hymn of same name main hymn for easter in lutheran church composition is based on seven stanzas of hymn and its tune which was derived from medieval models bach used unchanged words of a stanza of chorale in each of seven vocal movements in format of chorale variations for all stanzas and he used its tune as a cantus firmus after an opening sinfonia variations are arranged symmetrically chorus duet solo chorus solo duet chorus with focus on central fourth stanza about battle between life and death all movements are in e minor and bach achieves variety and intensifies meaning of text through many musical forms and techniques is bach s first cantata for easter in fact his only extant original composition for first day of feast and his earliest surviving chorale cantata it was related to his application for a post at a lutheran church at muhlhausen he later twice performed it as thomaskantor in leipzig beginning in 1724 when he first celebrated easter there only this second version survives it is scored for four vocal parts and a baroque instrumental ensemble with two components an instrumental choir of cornetto and three trombones doubling choral voices only in 2nd leipzig performance in 1725 were these used and a string section of two violins two violas and continuo while this scoring reflects resources at bach s disposal cornetto and brass players would have been available because of city band tradition in leipzig it was old fashioned and exemplifies a 17th century chorale concerto style lost scoring of earlier performances was perhaps similar gardiner calls bach s setting of luther s hymn a bold innovative piece of musical drama and observes his total identification with spirit and letter of luther s fiery dramatic hymn composition history background thumbnail alt interior of a church facing rear with organ on third tier front of organ is decorated with small baroque golden ornaments restored wender organ which bach played in arnstadt at new church now bach church bach is believed to have written in 1707 he was a professional organist aged 22 employed from 1703 in arnstadt as organist of new church which replaced burned today known as bach church at age 18 he had inspected new organ built by johann friedrich wender was invited to play one sunday and was hired organ was built on third tier of a theatre like church bach s duties as a church musician involved some responsibility for choral music but exact year he began composing cantatas is unknown is one of a small group of cantatas that survive from his early years according to musicologist martin many details of score reflect practice in arnstadt kantor church musician was responsible for church music in upper church and new church where bach was organist he typically conducted music in upper church and would appoint a choir prefect for vocal music in new church wolff notes that subjecting his works to questionable leadership of a prefect was not what bach would have done therefore most cantatas of period are not for sunday occasions but restricted to special occasions such as weddings and funerals is only exception but was most likely composed not for arnstadt but for an application to a more important post at divi blasii church in muhlhausen bach s early cantatas thumb upright alt disputed portrait of young bach with brown curled hair dressed festively portrait of young bach disputed bach s early cantatas are chorale concertos in style of 17th century different from recitative and aria cantata format associated with neumeister that bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714 wolff points out relation of bach s early cantatas to works by dieterich buxtehude with whom bach had studied in lubeck shows similarities to a composition of johann pachelbel based on same easter chorale although there is no evidence that bach and pachelbel met bach grew up in thuringia while pachelbel was based in same region and bach s elder brother and teacher johann christoph bach studied with pachelbel in erfurt another of pachelbel s works appears to be referenced in early bach cantata and there has been recent speculation that bach wanted to pay tribute to pachelbel after his death in 1706 texts for early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns features characteristic of his later cantatas such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry were not yet present although bach may have heard them in oratorios by buxtehude or even earlier instead these early cantatas include 17th century elements such as motets and chorale concertos they often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata following table lists seven

lucas cranach elder portrait of martin luther 1529 luther wrote text of hymn and derived melody from a traditional older tune prescribed readings for feast day were from first letter to corinthians christ is our easter lamb and from gospel of mark resurrection of jesus reformer martin luther wrote several hymns in german to be used in church services his hymn was based on latin hymn and first published in 1524 it became a main easter hymn in german lutheranism hymn stresses struggle between life and death third stanza refers to sting of death as mentioned in 1 corinthians 15 fifth stanza relates to paschal lamb sacrificial blood its blood marks our doors refers to marking of doors before exodus from egypt final stanza recalls tradition of baking and eating easter bread with old leaven alluding again to exodus in contrast to word of grace concluding christ would alone nourish soul in contrast to most chorale cantatas that bach composed later in leipzig text of chorale is retained unchanged which he did again only in late chorale cantatas performances thumb upright alt photo of interior of church with organ featured prominently organ of divi blasii church in muhlhausen where cantata was possibly first performed survives in a version from 1720s when bach held position of thomaskantor director of church music in leipzig there is documentary evidence suggesting that this easter sunday cantata was premiered in 1707 it is known that bach performed a cantata of his own composition at easter in 1707 as a part of his application for post of organist of divi blasii church in muhlhausen and this may have been by this time bach was already demonstrating ingenuity in keyboard music as known from early works in neumeister collection is a significant milestone in his vocal music it was completed seven years before his sequence of weimar cantatas begun in 1714 with and 17 years before he started a complete annual cycle of chorale cantatas in leipzig in middle of 1724 with bach would have been attracted to muhlhausen for its status as a free imperial city and tradition of vocal music in its churches wolff notes that bach possibly sent two other cantata scores with his application and once he knew date of audition may have composed in addition a month after easter on 24 may 1707 an agreement was reached to hire bach who seems to have been only candidate considered seriously bach performed cantata again while thomaskantor in leipzig notably at his first easter there on 9 april 1724 he also performed it following year on 1 april 1725 in his second cycle of leipzig cantatas a cycle of chorale cantatas based on lutheran hymns it followed in cycle some forty newly composed cantatas this early work fits cycle in sense that it is based on a chorale but its style is different from others music scoring and structure bach structured cantata in eight movements an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to stanzas of hymn

for instance found in 17th century church cantatas by bach s ancestors see archiv and in jesus christus ist um willen a passion setting from early 18th century or older which bach had performed a few years after composing cantata in first half of 18th century standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts one viola part and continuo cornett used in cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age by second quarter of 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from bach s compositions brass instruments were only used for 1 april 1725 version of work other

after soprano begins each choral statement alto line is derived from chorale tune while viola parts principally reinforce alto and tenor voices violin parts are independent and as traupman carr notes further activate texture with a virtually continuous exchange of sixteenth note snippets figure in violins known as sigh reflects christ s suffering in grip of death final halleluja is faster giving up fantasia format for a four part fugue and in motet style with all instruments doubling voices style of movement recalls 16th century stile antico although style is still unmistakably bach s versus

music almost freeze on first words death and word imprisoned is marked by a sharp dissonance of soprano and alto in halleluja voices imitate each other on long notes in fast succession creating a sequence of suspensions versus 3 third stanza jesus christ god s son is a trio of tenor two obbligato violins and continuo tenor sings chorale melody almost unchanged violins illustrate first how

until they fall away one by one in final halleluja in all four voices bass descends nearly two octaves versus 5 stanza five here is true easter lamb is sung by bass alone accompanied at first by a descending chromatic line in continuo which has been compared to crucifixus of mass in b minor but changing to a dance like passage of continuous eighth notes when voice enters for every line of stanza bass sings a chorale tune then repeats words in counterpoint to part of tune repeated in strings sometimes transposed taruskin describes this with its antiphonal exchanges between singer and massed strings this setting sounds like a parody of a passacaglia style venetian opera aria vintage 1640 bass sings final victorious spanning two octaves versus 6 so we celebrate high festival is a duet for soprano and tenor accompanied only by ostinato continuo chorale is shared by voices with soprano singing it in e minor tenor in b minor movement is a dance of joy word joy is rendered in
