in october 1978 uganda invaded kagera salient in northern tanzania initiating uganda tanzania war ugandans met light resistance and in november president idi amin of uganda announced annexation of all tanzanian land north of kagera river tanzanians organised a counter attack later in november and successfully ejected ugandan forces from their country relations between tanzania and uganda had been tense since colonel idi amin overthrew ugandan president milton obote in 1971 tanzanian president julius nyerere supported obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972 uganda also disputed its border with tanzania claiming that kagera salient a 1865 square kilometre 720 square mile stretch of land between official border and kagera river 29 kilometres 18 miles to south should be placed under its jurisdiction situation remained bleak through 1978 when amin s regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissension in armed forces in early october ugandan forces began making small incursions into kagera on 25 october uganda army launched a large attack over border but was repulsed by tanzanian artillery army attacked again on 30 october quickly overwhelming small tanzanian contingent in region and completely occupying kagera salient amin declared that uganda was annexing region and shortly thereafter ugandans destroyed only bridge over kagera river easing their commanders concerns about a tanzanian counter attack uganda army pillaged land stealing cattle automobiles and personal belongings from homes approximately 1 500 civilians were shot and killed and thousands more fled south tanzania was caught unprepared for war but nyerere after being assured by his commanders ordered a mobilisation and instructed tanzania people s defence force tpdf to prepare a counter attack mozambique sent a battalion to tanzania as a gesture of support organisation of african unity attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but nyerere rejected attempts at mediation uganda army officers ignored intelligence reports of tanzanian plans in favour of looting and thus were caught unprepared when tpdf initiated operation chakaza most ugandan soldiers fled in face of artillery bombardment and amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing uganda army from kagera a claim which was bitterly contested by tanzania tanzanian troops used pontoons and a bailey bridge to move heavy equipment across river and probed area by january 1979 tpdf had re secured kagera salient nyerere did not initially intend on expanding war beyond defending tanzanian territory after amin failed to renounce his claims to kagera and oau failed to condemn ugandan invasion he ordered tpdf to attack uganda resulting in amin s overthrow in april following conclusion of war tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate kagera but social services and standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years uganda tanzania war is remembered in tanzania as kagera war background thumb left idi amin pictured became president of uganda following a 1971 coup in 1971 colonel idi amin launched a military coup that overthrew president of uganda milton obote precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring tanzania tanzanian president julius nyerere had close ties with obote and had supported his socialist orientation amin installed himself as president of uganda and ruled country under a repressive dictatorship nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of new government and offered asylum to obote and his supporters uganda twice launched military attacks against tanzanian border that year with approval of nyerere ugandan exiles organised a small army of guerillas and attempted unsuccessfully to invade uganda and remove amin in 1972 amin blamed nyerere for backing and arming his enemies and retaliated by bombing tanzanian border towns though his commanders urged him to respond in kind nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by president of somalia siad barre resulting in signing of mogadishu agreement which stipulated that ugandan and tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other s governments nevertheless relations between two presidents remained tense nyerere frequently denounced amin s regime and amin made repeated threats to invade tanzania during same time relations between tanzania and kenya grew sour and east african community subsequently collapsed uganda also disputed its border with tanzania claiming that kagera salient a 1865 square kilometre 720 square mile stretch of land between official border and kagera river 29 kilometres 18 miles to south should be placed under its jurisdiction maintaining that river made for a more logical border border had originally been negotiated by british and german colonial officials before world war i meanwhile in uganda amin announced an economic war in which thousands of asian immigrants were expelled from country and their businesses placed under management of africans reform had disastrous consequences for economy which were further exacerbated by a united states boycott of ugandan coffee on account of government s failure to respect human rights at same time amin expanded power of armed forces in his government placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with patronage most of beneficiaries of his actions were muslim northerners particularly those of nubian and sudanese extract who were increasingly recruited into army amin violently purged of southern ethnic groups from armed forces and executed political opponents in 1977 a split in uganda army developed between supporters of amin and soldiers loyal to vice president of uganda mustafa adrisi who held significant power in government and wanted to purge foreigners from military in april 1978 adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident when he was flown out of country for treatment amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios he also announced arrest of multiple police officials and during following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers shakeup strained amin s narrow base of power in military that had been declining in face of worsening economic situation which eliminated patronage opportunities fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse growing tension amin began withdrawing from public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops at around same time he began accusing tanzania of violating uganda s border in may amin falsely claimed that tanzanian troops had attacked rakai district he also appealed to his allies president gaafar nimeiry of sudan and leader muammar gaddafi of libya to intervene and resolve potentially explosive situation claiming that tanzanian forces were moving within 4 8 kilometres three miles of ugandan border towns in july radio uganda erroneously declared that obote was planning another tanzanian supported overthrow attempt nyerere ignored allegations in reality since may ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards border at amin s direction and in violation of mogadishu agreement only one tanzanian company was near border region and obote s partisans were in a refugee camp in july brigadier yusuf himid of tanzania people s defence force tpdf warned uganda to cease its repeated provocations against tanzania as tensions with tanzania increased a number of amin s high ranking military commanders began to advocate war with neighboring state they were opposed by other ugandan generals who argued that uganda army was not ready for an open conflict though desiring to annex part of tanzania for some time president amin initially sided with more cautious commanders in august amin dispatched several agents to eliminate a battalion planning to mutiny in favour of adrisi battalion was tipped off to attack and managed to ambush and kill amin s forces by early october several mutinies had broken out across uganda parts of suicide battalion revolted at bondo while other uprisings took place in tororo masaka mbarara mutukula and kampala where amin was allegedly ambushed and almost killed by revolting soldiers revolts were defeated by loyal troops but many mutineers managed to flee while unrest and confusion spread in uganda army prelude thumb right alt map of africa with tanzania and uganda highlighted uganda red and tanzania blue in africa war broke out between uganda and tanzania in october 1978 with several ugandan attacks across border culminating in invasion of kagera salient circumstances surrounding outbreak of war are not clear and numerous differing accounts of events exist including several conspiracy theories many have argued that invasion was an attempt by amin and his inner circle to distract ugandan military from worsening political and economic situation at home obote wrote that decision to invade kagera was a desperate measure to extricate amin from consequences of failure of his own plots against his own army several uganda army soldiers blamed lieutenant colonel juma butabika for starting war including colonel abdu kisuule who accused butabika of engineering an incident at border to create a pretext for invading tanzania according to amin s son remo rumors of a potential tanzanian invasion led members of ugandan high command to call for a preemptive attack on tanzania several other uganda army officers have offered more mundane explanations for invasion according to which isolated conflicts along border resulted in a spiral of violence that culminated in open warfare among incidents identified as start point of war are cases of cattle rustling tribal tensions a fight between an ugandan woman and a tanzanian woman at a market as well as a bar fight between a ugandan soldier and tanzanian soldiers or civilians several ugandan soldiers who endorsed bar fight theory disagreed on confrontation s exact circumstances but concurred that incident occurred on 9 october in a tanzanian establishment they also agreed that after butabika was informed of altercation he unilaterally ordered his unit suicide battalion to attack tanzania in reprisal soldiers stated that amin was not informed of this decision until later and went along with it to save face one ugandan commander bernard rwehururu stated that butabika lied to amin about his reasons for attacking kagera claiming that he was repulsing a tanzanian invasion according to american journalists tony avirgan and martha honey bar incident occurred on 22 october when a drunken ugandan intelligence officer was shot and killed by tanzanian soldiers after firing on them that evening radio uganda declared that tanzanians had abducted a ugandan soldier and reported that amin threatened to do something if he was not returned another theory describes invasion as result of ugandan troops chasing mutineers over tanzanian border there are several different variations of this account which was mostly circulated by non ugandan sources ugandan diplomat paul and local managing director for royal dutch shell reported that soldiers of simba battalion had shot new sudanese recruits and that when other ugandan forces were sent to contain them they fled over border on 30 october other versions attribute mutinies to elements of chui battalion or suicide battalion researcher stated that about 200 mutineers reportedly took refuge in kagera salient according to this version of events amin ordered simba battalion and suicide battalion to pursue deserters whereupon they invaded tanzania a ugandan soldier interviewed by drum claimed that initial actions of invasion were in fact a three way fight between loyalist uganda army soldiers ugandan deserters and tanzanian border guards with most of deserters and a number of tanzanians being killed a few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in tanzanian villages researchers andrew mambo and julian schofield discounted this theory as unlikely noting that battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to amin s cause throughout war and instead supported notion that butabika escalated a dispute at border into an invasion tpdf had received only very limited intelligence about a possible ugandan invasion and was unprepared for this eventuality as tanzanian leadership generally believed that amin would not consider attacking tanzania while his own country was affected by political economic and military instability even beyond demilitarised zone established by mogadishu agreement there were almost no defences tanzania had tense relations with zaire kenya and malawi and only forces defending land along ugandan border was 202nd brigade based in tabora it was led by an elderly commander brigadier himid near frontier was understrength 3rd battalion led by lieutenant colonel morris singano its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling in early september tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of ugandan patrols near border some equipped with armoured personnel carriers and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights by middle of month ugandan aircraft began crossing into tanzanian airspace singano reported unusual activity to brigade headquarters in tabora and was assured that anti aircraft guns would be sent to him these never arrived and by october singano s warnings had become increasingly panicked initial actions thumb left when uganda army invaded kagera it deployed several ot 64 skot armoured personnel carriers example in ugandan service pictured in middle of day on 9 october ugandan troops made their first incursion into tanzania when a motorised detachment moved into kakunyu and set two houses on fire a tanzanian observation post witnessed event and messaged singano via radio who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on ugandan positions a ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed and two soldiers were killed ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage in evening radio uganda reported that a tanzanian invasion had been repulsed tanzanian foreign ministry denied allegation on 12 october on 10 october ugandan mig fighters bombed tanzanian forests ugandan artillery continuously bombarded tanzanian territory so singano requested that his 120 mm mortars largest calibre artillery he had be moved to front line they were brought into action four days later and ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing over next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire gradually expanding across whole border tanzanian leaders felt that amin was only making provocations singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent on 18 october ugandan migs bombed bukoba capital of west lake region despite facing ineffectual tanzanian anti aircraft fire bombings caused little damage however explosions reverberations shattered windows and incited population to panic following day west lake regional commissioner mohamed kissoky hosted a meeting with government and chama cha mapinduzi ccm state political party officials he told them that border conflict was result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that we are great friends with uganda and idi amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people despite kissoky s appeal for calm bukoba residents continued to panic their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from north aside from kissoky tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about conflict and radio tanzania did not report on it in contrast radio uganda reported a tanzanian invasion of ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles and detailed that tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres 9 miles into uganda killing civilians and destroying property amin told residents in mutukula that in spite of attack he still hoped for good relations with tanzania at same time radio uganda s language broadcasts which were closely monitored and understood by west lake residents virulently criticised nyerere and claimed that tanzanians wished to fall under ugandan jurisdiction to escape former s rule meanwhile ugandan regime came under increased internal strain dozens of soldiers of masaka garrison deemed disloyal were executed rival state research bureau agents got in a shootout in kampala and more agents were killed while attempting to arrest a former finance minister invasion first attack thumb ugandan attack included numerous armoured vehicles including t 55 tanks example pictured at dawn on 25 october tanzanian observers equipped with a telescope noticed large amounts of ugandan vehicular activity in mutukula singano received radio reports on situation at his headquarters in kyaka 32 kilometres 19 miles south of border and just south of kagera river several minutes later three other observation posts reported ugandan manoeuvers on other side of border singano went to a hill near kyaka from where he witnessed ugandan artillery open fire fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength platoon of 20 tpdf soldiers opposite of mutukula who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with uganda army all other tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards kagera river realising that an invasion was underway singano ordered platoon near mutukula to retreat to kyaka over 2 000 soldiers under command of lieutenant colonel marajani lieutenant colonel juma butabika and colonel abdu kisuule attacked kagera ugandan forces were equipped with t 55 and m4a1 sherman tanks along with ot 64 skot apcs as well as alvis saladin armored cars and advanced in two columns under direct command of butabika and kisuule respectively despite encountering no or only light resistance ugandan advance was slowed by terrain as butabika s column got stuck in mud near and had to wait for hours before being able to get any further singano began monitoring ugandan radio frequencies and was able to overhear transmissions between marajani and republic house uganda army s headquarters in kampala marajani reported heavy resistance despite fact that all tpdf personnel had withdrawn from border area believing that his enemies were confused about situation at mid morning singano ordered an artillery unit to front to put up resistance it was equipped with 122mm 4 8in mortars a 120mm 4 7in howitzer and a few 85mm 3 3in guns stationed in area around unit set up its artillery 10 kilometres 6 2 miles from ugandans and fired several shells causing them to retreat across border throughout rest of day ugandan migs crossed into tanzanian airspace where they were harassed by inconsequential anti aircraft fire one tanzanian soldier suffered minor injuries in clashes thumb left ugandan aircraft attacked bukoba pictured on 18 and 27 october 1978 sound of gunfire could be heard from bukoba and tanzanian civilians in west lake region became increasingly anxious about situation realising veracity of singano s warnings in light of action tanzanian commanders dispatched a six strong anti aircraft team equipped with sam 6 shoulder fired heat seeking missiles from tabora to front unit arrived in bukoba on 27 october shortly before its arrival three migs attacked bukoba area most of their bombs landed in lake victoria and nearby forests though one landed 50 metres 164 ft from hospital creating a large crater aside from some broken windows raid caused little damage but population was frightened and by afternoon roads leading out of town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot by next morning bukoba was almost completely deserted except for tpdf personnel tanzanian missile team moved to kyaka from where they successfully shot down a mig pilot ejected before his jet crashed and managed to safely return to uganda meanwhile in area surrounding bukoba displaced persons from town and border region began gathering those equipped with vehicles such as united nations development programme personnel drove to mwanza for tens of thousands who could not move as far situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce some merchants began engaging in price gouging local officials attempted to alleviate problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles this became unfeasible as singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery tanzanian state run news media did not report on conflict adding to confusion of civilians most of bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in countryside meanwhile singano petitioned his superiors in tabora for reinforcements they assured him that assistance was on its way but no troops ever arrived over next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile at same time ugandans prepared a new attack amin ordered based gonda battalion to aid invasion but its commander lieutenant colonel bananuka had only been appointed a few days before war s outbreak bananuka consequently did not travel to front line himself but still sent troops of gonda battalion under command of his second in command to tanzanian border second attack thumb right alt map of kagera region with missenyi district highlighted uganda occupied area north of kagera river modern day missenyi district red on 30 october approximately 3 000 ugandan troops invaded tanzania along four routes through mutukula and minziro commanded by uganda army chief of staff yusuf gowon and equipped with tanks and apcs they only faced ineffectual rifle fire from several dozen members of tanzania people s militia militiamen were easily overwhelmed and several were killed singano could see invasion from high ground in kyaka but held his artillery fire for fear of harming fleeing civilians thousands of them streamed towards kagera river in panic though they had been warned about minefields laid on north bank some civilians and their cattle went through them and were killed after stepping on explosives despite minimal resistance from tanzanian forces marajani had his troops advance with caution they slowly occupied kagera salient shooting at soldiers and civilians alike before reaching river and kyaka bridge in evening hampered by their minimal ammunition reserves 3rd battalion had by then retreated south of river uganda army air force indiscriminately bombed military and civilian targets during invasion singano was in kyaka with 19 men but soon they and all other tpdf forces in area retreated to seven kilometres south of crossing though land between river and bukoba was left virtually undefended by tpdf s withdrawal marajani ordered uganda army to halt its advance at north end of bridge kagera salient thus occupied undisciplined ugandan soldiers soon started to loot in area approximately 1 500 civilians were shot and killed while an additional 5 000 went into hiding in bush ccm officials were hunted down and decapitated and many women and girls were raped about 2 000 civilians were kidnapped and taken to uganda of these several hundred particularly young women were abducted and moved to a forced labor camp in some of them were forced to work as house servants while others were employed at sugar works with no pay except housing and food many were probably used by soldiers as concubines personal belongings from homes were taken especially kitchenware as were tin roofs from peasants houses bulldozers and cars were stolen and those of latter that would not start were stripped of their parts entire sugar works and a sawmill were dismantled and transported into uganda many livestock were taken including goats chickens and sheep as well as 13 000 cattle from state ranch latter were brought to mbarara where they were divided up among ugandan soldiers and their friends remaining structures were destroyed by drunk uganda army troops with mortars in total 108 million worth in economic assets were lost a ugandan soldier later stated in an interview that looting was ordered by ugandan government agents who instructed troops to give strong resistance and to loot anything we found valuable and hand these to government gowon later gained notoriety for an incident during looting spree when he allegedly demoted a captain for refusing to hand over a stolen tractor to him on 1 november radio uganda announced liberation of kagera salient and declared that kagera river marked new border between uganda and tanzania amin toured area and posed for photographs with abandoned tanzanian war materiel ugandan official press declared that area had been seized in 25 minutes amin announced that region would thereafter be known as kagera river district and that in commemoration of ugandan victory his youngest son was renamed kagera and a medal was to be minted for veterans of invasion singano s unit eventually set up artillery atop high ground near southern end of kyaka bridge to cover crossing ugandan commanders feared that bridge could be used in a counter attack and thus resolved for it to be destroyed on 1 and 2 november ugandan migs conducted sorties in an attempt to destroy crossing but each time they were met with heavy tanzanian anti aircraft fire and several were destroyed wishing to avoid further losses ugandans sought a demolitions expert to detonate bridge they approached british manager of kilembe mines who agreed to allow one of his civilian staff and his explosives to be utilised early in morning on 3 november demolitions expert sneaked onto bridge and planted explosive charges tanzanians did not see him in darkness ugandans detonated charges at dawn destroying 75 metre 246 ft centre section of bridge but leaving its pillars intact several high ranking ugandan commanders including butabika and gowon believed that they had made a tanzanian counter attack impossible or at least unlikely by destroying bridge later in day tanzanian anti aircraft units in accidentally shot down three of their own migs who had unexpectedly entered their sector tanzanian reaction due to poor communications tanzanian government was only informed of full extent of invasion after an entire day after initial reports of attack reached dar es salaam nyerere convened a meeting with his advisers and tpdf commanders in his beach residence he was unsure of his force s ability to repel ugandan invasion but tpdf chief abdallah twalipo was confident that army could eject ugandans from tanzania twalipo stated that this would require a large operation which would take time to organise nyerere told him to get started and meeting ended on 31 october tanzanian government made its first public acknowledgment of hostilities with uganda on radio tanzania s regularly scheduled 07 00 new bulletin announcer declared that ugandan troops had occupied territory in northwest portion of country and that army was preparing a counter attack on 2 november nyerere declared war on uganda international reactions six african leaders condemned kagera invasion as ugandan aggression mengistu haile mariam of ethiopia didier ratsiraka of madagascar agostinho neto of angola seretse khama of botswana samora machel of mozambique and kenneth kaunda of zambia last four were leaders of members of frontline states a coalition of countries committed to ending apartheid in south africa and rhodesia of which tanzania was also a member though they deprecated uganda mengistu and machel attributed its attack on tanzania as a western imperialist to disrupt frontline states efforts to stop racism in southern africa danish prime minister anker jorgensen also condemned attack as an attempt to distract frontline states cuban foreign minister called ugandan invasion deplorable and appealed for an end to conflict united states secretary of state cyrus vance called upon uganda to withdraw its forces and in response amin accused united states of interfering in an african dispute with aim of creating a second vietnam united kingdom upset with amin s hostility to its interests and what it perceived as an attack on a fellow member of british commonwealth condemned invasion and put pressure on british oil companies to sever trade with uganda british government also requested that france and italy halt trade of oil with uganda governments of canada jamaica and guyana also condemned incursion governments of guinea mali senegal and several other african states refrained from condemnation instead calling for a cessation of hostilities and requesting that both sides respect charter of organisation of african unity oau oau itself remained neutral on issue on 5 november kenyan president daniel moi cautiously appealed for uganda to withdraw its troops if they had violated tanzania s border following day representatives of oau flew to kampala to speak with amin and try and reach a solution moi also told amin that he would be willing to act as a mediator between uganda and tanzania ugandan government offered to accept mediation from libya one of its allies but tanzanian officials dismissed proposal nyerere was exasperated by suggestion that he accept mediation telling oau diplomats on one occasion how do you mediate between somebody who breaks into your house and victim of assault oau chairman privately confided to a british official that nyerere was determined to fight uganda and that mediation was useless oau ultimately refrained from condemning ugandan invasion nyerere appealed to kenya to halt shipments of fuel to uganda but his request went unheeded amin s close adviser bob astles told indian diplomat singh that he had visited moi in kenya who had given him assurances that kenya shall give uganda every transit facility that we need and that he will tell president nyerere not to interfere in uganda s internal affairs tanzanian counter attack planning nyerere ordered tanzania to undertake full mobilisation for war at time tpdf consisted of four brigades among them only southern brigade led by brigadier james luhanga which had just performed well in war games was ready to be moved to front line however it was headquartered in thus making it farther from kagera than other brigades after a long trek via rail and road unit reached bukoba kyaka area and established camp additional soldiers were sent from tabora prime minister edward handed orders to tanzania s regional commissioners to martial all military and civilian resources for war there was not enough motor transportation to efficiently move tpdf personnel to front as most military vehicles were in poor condition tpdf requisitioned buses and trucks from state and private enterprises to alleviate problem promising compensation to business owners if their vehicles were damaged or destroyed under their use factories were instructed to increase output and make goods for military use civilian population was warned of possible shortages on 2 november nyerere flew to beira mozambique for a previously scheduled meeting with president machel both as active members of frontline states were concerned about implications of tanzania uganda conflict in regards to efforts to ending white minority rule in rhodesia nyerere and machel developed second front thesis which reasoned that ugandan attack was made in an effort to distract tanzania from its efforts to support black rhodesian liberation movements they agreed to withdraw tanzanian battalion stationed at mozambique rhodesia border and machel offered nyerere assistance of a mozambican battalion as a gesture of support 800 strong unit was quickly flown to tanzania and moved to kagera despite being informed of tanzanian preparations for a counter offensive ugandan military did not set up any proper defenses such as trenches most of commanders on front line and members of high command ignored intelligence reports and instead focused on looting kagera salient gowon in particular was blamed for his handling of situation ignorant of most military tactics or strategy he believed that he had secured victory by destroying kyaka bridge and did not take warnings by his subordinate officers seriously in contrast amin allegedly realised his precarious situation and attempted to defuse conflict without losing face on 5 november amin a former boxing champion publicly suggested that he and nyerere participate in a boxing match which in lieu of military action would determine outcome of conflict ugandan president suggested that muhammad ali could act as referee nyerere ignored message three days later amin pledged to withdraw from tanzanian territory nyerere responded with a pledge to kick aggressor out operation chakaza tanzania initially aimed for its counter offensive called operation chakaza to begin on 6 november but it had to be delayed however by second week of november it had assembled 8 000 10 000 troops on southern bank of kagera river tpdf chief of staff major general took command of troops which initiated a heavy artillery bombardment of northern bank triggering flight of many uganda army soldiers on night of 14 november a few tanzanian soldiers crossed river in boats and finding no ugandans returned without incident astles telephoned journalists in nairobi to erroneously report that a large tanzanian amphibious operation had been foiled by uganda army and that 300 tanzanian soldiers had died when their boats overturned and they were attacked by crocodiles that day amin sensing that other african states did not support his position and irrationally fearing that soviet union was about give tanzania new weapons declared unconditional withdrawal of all ugandan troops from kagera and invited oau observers to witness it tanzanian government denounced statement as a complete lie while foreign observers were unable to reach a consensus on veracity of supposed withdrawal oau reacted by claiming that its mediation had succeeded thumb left tanzanians used a bailey bridge example pictured to cross kagera river and launch their counter attack meanwhile at front tanzanian commanders decided to transport heavy equipment across kagera river via pontoon bridge at 03 00 on 19 november tanzanian lieutenant colonel ben msuya dispatched a contingent to northern bank to cover a team which was assembling pontoons within three hours bridge was completed and tanzanians began clearing mines they had left behind along northern bank before ugandan invasion one soldier was killed and three wounded when they accidentally detonated one but by 12 00 all of mines had been removed on 20 november tanzanian patrols began exploring area along northern bank of kagera river discovering dead civilians and destroyed property left by uganda army two days later patrols reached ugandan border finding no ugandan troops except for a small contingent in minziro which they did not engage ugandan command and control descended into chaos amid counter offensive and only a few officers attempted to organise any resistance four ugandan mig 21s carried out air raids amid operation chakaza attempting to bomb bukoba air strip and mwanza airfield whereas attack on bukoba caused minimal damage two planes that targeted mwanza were hit by anti aircraft fire one mig crashed and its pilot was taken prisoner while other piloted by ali kiiza managed to return to entebbe on 23 november three tpdf brigades under brigadiers luhanga mwita marwa and silas crossed pontoon bridge and began occupying kagera salient once tanzanian soldiers appeared en masse kagera residents who had been in hiding revealed themselves they were quickly evacuated to areas south of river wounded civilians were taken to bukoba hospital for treatment following day a bailey bridge purchased from united kingdom was installed over broken span of kyaka bridge on 25 november tanzanians began moving tanks and bm 21 rocket launchers across it though small groups of ugandan troops roamed countryside nyerere to chagrin of his officers toured kagera a few tanzanian soldiers died in traffic accidents while deploying ugandan government announced in late november that it had withdrawn all forces from kagera salient and that all fighting had ceased it flew 50 foreign diplomats to border and they reported that there was little evidence of ongoing conflict tanzanian officials denounced withdrawal statement asserting that ugandan troops had to be forcibly removed from tanzanian territory and announcing that some remained in country nyerere s government also declared that 193 people in northwestern tanzania were arrested on suspicion of espionage on 29 november sudanese diplomat philip concurred that ugandan troops had completely withdrawn though nyerere subsequently argued that they had been forcibly expelled while conducting patrols in salient tanzanians discovered 120 bodies of ugandan soldiers on hill tpdf had not operated in area before and tanzanians did not believe their artillery had struck location though circumstances surrounding ugandans deaths remained unclear tanzanian government publicly stated that men had been executed in uganda and then dumped in tanzania on 4 december tpdf s 206th and southern brigades secured mutukula on tanzanian side of border without incident while 207th under brigadier john butler walden retook minziro tanzanian soldiers found that most of village s population had been murdered on 25 december tpdf began bombarding ugandan territory with bm katyusha saba saba rocket launchers by early january all ugandan troops had been ejected from kagera tanzanians later claimed to have captured some libyan radio technicians during operation chakaza aftermath strategic situation morale and discipline of uganda army deteriorated as tanzanians pushed it out of kagera and attacked it along border after invasion was repulsed tanzanians feared that uganda army would try again to seize their territory tanzanian commanders felt that as long as ugandan troops controlled high ground at mutukula uganda along frontier they posed a threat to salient able to see ugandan troops encamped on high ground through binoculars during his tour of kagera nyerere was moved to agree with his officers and ordered them to capture town sporadic clashes occurred along border over next two months until night of 21 january 1979 when southern brigade renamed 208th brigade crossed over ugandan border it attacked and seized mutukula following day tanzanians then destroyed town and shot civilians to avenge pillaging in kagera effects of invasion on tanzania radio tanzania broadcast stories of atrocities in kagera throughout tanzania using first hand accounts and interviews tales of pillaging and destruction created public outcry and demands for amin to be overthrown singano s decision to withdraw his forces from salient during invasion generated a debate among tpdf officer corps for several years his supporters argued that since he had been denied essential reinforcements from his superiors his choice to observe and report on ugandans progress was best course of action his detractors asserted that he was obligated as a soldier to put up as much resistance as possible to invasion despite being heavily outnumbered invasion came at a time when tanzania s economy was showing signs of recovery from a severe drought in 1974 1975 all planned government projects were suspended in every ministry except defence and administration was instructed not to fill vacancies on 15 november minister of finance edwin declared that government was raising taxes on numerous commodities to help fund war effort a 10 per cent temporary war tax was raised on soft drinks beer clothing and cigarettes nyerere stated in january 1979 that tpdf operation to expel ugandans had necessitated a tremendous diversion of country s resources away from development work fearing resumption of hostilities in kagera salient region s 40 000 residents were initially resettled south of river in camps at nsheshe nyankere kyamulaile and burigi social services in displacement camps were minimal or nonexistent effects of invasion on uganda invasion of kagera was largely met by apathy within ugandan populace many ugandan civilians who had grown disillusioned with amin s regime were supportive of tanzanians during invasion they were not happy when they saw killed tanzanians during invasion s early stages and pleased with tanzanian victories during invasion s later stages many ugandans started to hide anti amin insurgents thereby aiding them in sabotaging ugandan war effort by destroying railway lines electricity supply lines and petrol stations confronted with these developments ugandan government resorted to brutal suppression such as arresting and killing all without proper documents in order to eliminate suspected dissidents unrest also mounted in military as many ugandan soldiers felt that their commanders had handled invasion incompetently or had even betrayed them to tanzanians resulting in increasing mistrust among uganda army legacy course

were seized by tanzanian and ugandan rebel forces and destroyed with explosives in revenge for destruction caused by ugandans in kagera nyerere originally planned to halt his forces and allow ugandan rebels to attack kampala and overthrow amin as he feared that scenes of tanzanian troops occupying city would reflect poorly on his country s image abroad however ugandan rebel forces did not have strength to defeat libyan units coming to amin s aid so nyerere decided to use tpdf to take kampala city fell on 11 april and amin was deposed british government supplied tanzania with several million

not achieved a standard of living in parity with that of pre war era minister for home affairs responded by saying government would not offer financial assistance to kagera residents affected by war

government strengthened its presence in kagera after war bolstering its police station in kyaka and establishing several others in border towns for security reasons villagers were prohibited from
