suillus lakei commonly known as matte jack lake s bolete or western painted suillus is a species of fungus in suillaceae family it is characterized by distinctive reddish brown tufted fibers or small scales on cap and presence of a woolly veil on stem caps can reach diameters of up to while stems are between long and usually thick on underside of cap is a layer of spongy yellow to yellow brown angular pores these pores are covered with a whitish partial veil when young a mycorrhizal fungus s lakei grows in association with douglas fir and can be found where this tree occurs it is native to northwestern north america but has been introduced to europe south america and new zealand mushroom is edible but opinions vary considerably as to its quality taxonomy and naming american mycologist william alphonso murrill originally named species boletinus lakei after mycologist e r lake of oregon agricultural college now oregon state university lake collected type specimen from corvallis oregon in late november 1907 rolf singer later transferred species to genera and boletinus in 1940 and 1945 respectively in their 1964 monograph on north american suillus species alexander h smith and harry delbert thiers transferred species to suillus simultaneously they described s lakei variety pseudopictus that they said had been misidentified by collectors as suillus pictus now called suillus spraguei because of its reddish and scaly cap singer considered suillus amabilis to be same species as s lakei but smith and thiers later examined type material of both and concluded that they were distinct species engel and colleagues described a variety in 1996 s lakei var landkammeri based on boletinus subsp landkammeri described by czech mycologists albert pilat and mirko in 1949 nomenclatural databases index fungorum and mycobank consider this synonymous with s lakei mushroom is commonly known as western painted suillus matte jack or lake s slippery cap description thumb left pore surface of a young specimen cap of s lakei is up to in diameter and initially convex but flattens out somewhat in maturity cap is fleshy dry yellowish to reddish brown but fades with age it is covered with pressed down hairs or minute tufted scales in center with yellowish flesh visible between scales heavy rain can wash fibrils off cap surface leaving a sticky glutinous layer behind older specimens may be nearly smooth in age remnants of partial veil sometimes hang from edge of cap cap margin is initially curved or rolled inwards but unrolls as it grows and in maturity may be curled upward thumb left variety pseudopictus has red cap and prominent scales tubes that comprise pore surface on underside of cap are deep angular pores are up to 2 5 mm wide and radially arranged pores range in color from yellow to brownish yellow to ochre and stain brownish or reddish brown when bruised they are covered by a partial veil in young specimens flesh is thick yellow and either unchanged in color when bruised or broken or turns pinkish red stem is long and usually thick yellow sometimes with reddish streaks and solid and yellow within species usually lacks glandular dots on stem that are characteristic of some suillus species stem is either equal in width throughout its length or tapered downwards tissue of stem base may weakly stain bluish green when cut although this reaction is not usually apparent in mature specimens ring is delicate and floccose resembling woolly tufts and soon disappears or leaves a thin whitish ring on stem spore print is cinnamon to brown in color variety found in italy has a light yellow cap and purple red scales variety pseudopictus has a cap that is redder and more scaly than more common form spores are spindle shaped to elliptical have a smooth surface and dimensions of 8 11 to 3 4 um there are both two and four spored basidia spore bearing cells and they are club shaped hyaline translucent with dimensions of 28 36 by 10 12 um cystidia are plentiful and are found in bundles lined along tube mouths as cheilocystidia or more commonly singly along sides of tubes as pleurocystidia these structures are thin walled cylindrical and measure 48 60 by 7 9 um scales on cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together clamp connections are rare in hyphae edibility suillus lakei is edible although opinions vary considerably as to its quality it has been called choice as well as rather coarse and tasteless or mediocre laboratory tests indicate fruit bodies to have antimicrobial activity and contain alkaloids and tannins similar species mushrooms with an appearance similar to s lakei can often be distinguished by their associations with trees for example eastern north american species s spraguei grows in association with eastern white pine cap of s spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background s and s always grow with larch s ponderosus which grows in mixed coniferous forests has a gelatinous veil smith and thiers note that it is difficult to tell difference between two if s ponderosus has lost its veil since colors of species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them s decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink orange with hairs or scales s caerulescens is a similar species in western north america it can be distinguished by strong blue staining that develops when stem is injured habitat and distribution suillus lakei is indigenous to rocky mountains and western parts of north america its range extends south into mexico fruit bodies grow solitarily or in groups on ground in young conifer stands or grassy parkland fruiting occurs in late summer and autumn suillus lakei forms ectomycorrhizae with douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii and its distribution coincides with this tree it is one of most common bolete species found in northwestern montana and idaho in a study of host specificity in pure culture in laboratory s lakei failed to form healthy with eucalyptus roots hyphae were covered in mucilage like deposits and appeared to be collapsed it has also been noted to prefer poor exposed soil such as that found on road banks and campgrounds it can often be found with mushroom gomphidius another species that associates with douglas fir both douglas fir and suillus lakei are non native introduced species in europe fungus has been found in several central and south european countries following intentional introduction of douglas fir these include bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria czech republic germany hungary italy and slovakia it is considered endangered in czech republic suillus lakei has also been reported in south island of new zealand and south america argentina and chile see also list of north american boletes
