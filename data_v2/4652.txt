ottoman force led by admiral sinan pasha invaded gozo and besieged cittadella governor de offered terms of surrender but they were refused and castle fell within a matter of days castle was then

northern walls were also rebuilt by hospitallers although they retained a medieval form walls surrounding suburb rabat were probably demolished at this point reconstruction to rinaldini s and cassar s designs was completed in around 1622 gozo s population stayed within walls of cittadella between dusk and dawn until this curfew was lifted on 15 april 1637 castle remained only fortified refuge against attack for island s inhabitants until fort chambray was built in mid 18th century soon after reconstruction was complete cittadella s defences were again criticized in 1640s plans were made to demolish citadel and build a new fortress at mines were actually built under bastions to destroy them if necessary but demolition was never done engineer antonio maurizio valperga suggested to rebuild wall around suburb and further strengthen cittadella but there were no funds for this proposal by early 18th century cittadella had assumed role of a fortress with a significant proportion of its houses falling into ruin or being in a poor state an attack on gozo took place in 1708 and in 1715 engineer louis francois d de made same suggestions as valperga but a lack of funds prevented any work
