kirk comments with a degree of compassion that this creature last of its kind was probably not inherently evil but simply desperate production writing thumb upright alt a man wearing a brown suit looks up to right man trap originated in first pitch for star trek by gene roddenberry pictured man trap appeared in gene roddenberry s original pitch for star trek as title of a show with a different plot crew face several apparitions that are wish fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood roddenberry 1964 p 14 traps increase in subtlety until crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality lee erwin who had previously worked on lieutenant with roddenberry was commissioned to produce a treatment an outline featuring a salt devouring vampire was handed in on april 8 1966 meanwhile george clayton johnson had been assigned a storyline tentatively titled chicago ii in which crew of enterprise visit a planet where culture was that of 1920s mob era chicago johnson was hired after story editor john d f black recommended him to producers johnson decided to use 1953 science fiction novel syndic by cyril m kornbluth as basis for story asherman 1988 p 136 roddenberry felt that johnson s treatment did not match his vision for star trek but did not want to lose him entirely and asked him to write man trap cushman osborn 2013 p 166 erwin was paid in full for his version and given a separate kill fee because it would not be used roddenberry wanted to see more action so creature s ability to create apparitions was added to script from original pitch stan robertson at nbc suggested to roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly to find out roddenberry asked kellam de forest research alexander 1995 p 267 who said that while it had never happened in reality a quick death would be likely johnson suggested that creature in man trap could be last of its species he compared its situation to reduction in numbers of american bison roddenberry found idea intriguing thumb left upright alt a man with a white beard and a hat writer george clayton johnson in 2006 man trap was his only star trek credit erwin was paid a further fee to terminate his contract and johnson wrote a first draft teleplay titled damsel with a dulcimer while writing johnson consulted black who advised him to place creature on enterprise quickly to increase pace of episode asherman 1988 p 137 this draft was delivered on may 23 but nbc felt that hallucinations were being overused same plot device had appeared in pilot episode cage johnson wrote a further draft on may 31 which reduced number of apparitions and was well received by robert h justman roddenberry and justman made further tweaks one was to restore name man trap from erwin s original treatment another removed a scene which introduced mccoy s apprehension when using transporter gross altman 1993 p 27 johnson further edited script but complained about change in name after a second edit by johnson it was passed from justman to story editor black while former felt that script still needed work black felt it was nearly ready cushman osborn 2013 p 168 following black s review roddenberry re wrote script between june 16 and 21 cushman osborn 2013 p 165 johnson felt this re write had ed story cushman osborn 2013 p 169 black later said that roddenberry removed a large part of johnson s work and that johnson s original work was better than roddenberry s edited version johnson was pleased with final episode although he was concerned that viewers might not understand star trek after watching man trap owing to differences in characterization between this episode and rest of series he admitted that he did not like spock and was concerned that character would not be understood after this episode roddenberry was pleased with johnson s work and offered him further writing work on what are little girls made of which had been written by robert bloch roddenberry only wanted johnson to polish script johnson feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch turned down offer but expressed desire to work on show again he later wrote a story outline titled rock a bye baby or die in which enterprise would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes kirk as its father this was not commissioned so man trap was johnson s only work on franchise asherman 1988 p 138 guest appearances thumb upright alt a woman holds a clipboard while standing next to a filing cabinet jeanne bal pictured in a promotional picture for mr novak portrayed nancy crater whose image creature copied in this episode jeanne bal was cast as nancy crater mccoy s former love interest actress had previously guest starred in perry mason and was one of main performers in sitcom love and marriage alfred ryder was well known for his numerous appearances in similar genre series such as wild wild west and outer limits after his appearance as robert crater in man trap he appeared in science fiction series invaders cushman osborn 2013 p 171 actors playing two of crewmen who died on screen later appeared in other episodes of star trek michael zaslow seen in man trap as darnell appeared in i mudd and later had a long running role in soap opera guiding light as roger thorpe john arndt appeared in four further episodes of original series direction and filming all previous episodes of star trek had overrun their filming schedules and producers were concerned that not enough time had been allotted to each production marc daniels was recruited as director of man trap among his varied directing credits were episodes of i love lucy for desilu productions pre production began during six scheduled filming days for enemy within but that episode ran long filming for man trap commenced around 3 20 p m on june 22 and continued until 7 10 p m several futuristic looking salt shakers were sourced for scenes in man trap but due to concerns that they would not be recognized they were instead used from man trap onward as mccoy s tools in sickbay asherman 1986 p 36 first full day of filming on june 23 was predominantly shot on set representing bridge of enterprise two small establishing shots were postponed until filming of next episode following day corridor scenes were filmed as was climactic scene featuring creature s death at that point daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule after a break for weekend production resumed on june 27 for scenes in botany lab briefing room and sickbay one of grace lee whitney s favorite sets to work on throughout series was lab which was sickbay redecorated as she enjoyed working with george takei animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under table and whitney later recalled that operator could see right up her skirt throughout shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using puppet for sickbay scenes when spock bleeds daniels decided that vulcans should have green blood cushman osborn 2013 p 173 roddenberry disliked idea and unsuccessfully attempted to have it corrected in post production by end of fifth day of shooting daniels estimated that he was now only half an hour behind schedule cushman osborn 2013 p 174 days six and seven were spent on sets used to show surface of m 113 while design of planet did not match johnson s vision he was pleased with it nonetheless ruins were constructed out of cardboard boxes covered in gunite a spray on cement like product to give them a rocky appearance production wrapped on june 30 at 2 55 p m bob justman later referred to daniels as savior of series for delivering man trap on schedule and when director for naked time dropped out daniels took over and shot episode back to back with man trap a quarter of a day faster than schedule solow justman 1996 pp 203 204 by end of original series daniels had filmed more episodes than any other director whitney denney 1998 p 96 during production of man trap daniels introduced a system in which actors unneeded on a shoot went to a cast table area to practice upcoming scenes rather than return to their dressing rooms producers felt that this both sped up filming process and improved quality of performances cast table system continued to be used throughout production of original series even when daniels was not directing in post production justman recommended adding an opening narration roddenberry agreed and wrote new lines for a captain s log alexander courage recorded music for this episode on august 19 asherman 1986 p 31 same day as theme from star trek using a 25 piece orchestra while roddenberry liked theme he hated music created specifically for man trap optical effects were created more quickly than usual howard a anderson jr took two months three times faster than for some episodes overall production costs for man trap came in under budget at 185 401 cushman osborn 2013 p 175 creature thumb right upright alt a drawing of a shaggy looking humanoid creature it has a round mouth with small sharp teeth inside of creature s fingers have suckers on them like an octopus a drawing of creature from man trap which became known to fans as salt vampire producers spent some time considering creature s appearance justman suggested to gene roddenberry that it could be some sort of terrifying young lady with a similar appearance to green skinned orion slave girl seen in cage but blue skinned and with orange hair while roddenberry thought that idea was good he already had an agreement with nbc that it would be an animal cushman osborn 2013 p 167 johnson envisaged creature as a refugee with ashen skin wearing clothing daniels had some apprehension about using a monster of week format asking do you go for cheap thrills or a more intelligent approach he said that crew decided to treat everything as if it were real in order to help audience buy into it gross altman 1993 p 28 it was johnson who suggested creature should be a shapeshifter having used idea in an episode of twilight zone he wrote called four of us are dying creature was designed by wah chang and dancer sandra gimpel wore costume on screen she had previously appeared as a in cage head of creature costume was sculpted in clay then covered in a plaster cast once cast was removed liquid latex was applied to create a flexible single piece mask westmore et al 2000 p 36 which was then painted chang added a white wig and attached glass lenses to mask for eyes once gimpel was wearing mask cuts were made into its wrinkles to offer actress some limited vision while wearing it gloves were modified by chang to give fingers appearance of tentacles with suction cups william ware theiss created rest of costume out of a fur bodysuit westmore et al 2000 p 37 johnson praised both chang and gimpel saying that while latter embodied character design work meant that in final scene it was as if crew had to kill a helpless dog cushman osborn 2013 p 172 after filming costume was kept in justman s office becoming first in an ever growing number of alien costumes accumulated there it reappeared on screen in squire of gothos although referred to officially as m 113 creature during production it was called salt sucker and fans of show have taken to referring to alien as salt vampire solow justman 1996 p okuda mirek 1994 p 188 later appearances don lanning was part of team working on creature effects for 2009 film star trek he was key sculptor for production and personally revamped some of aliens from original series including salt vampire seen in man trap he described original design as hokey and said that he tried to change it to something organic new version of creature was unused in film which pleased lanning creature did return in star trek online a massively multiplayer online role playing game rather than a single salt vampire 20 player pve mission mine trap saw a romulan colony overrun with them themes thumb right upright alt a black and white photo of a caucasian man with dark hair wearing a sweater paula m block and terry j erdmann wrote that dr mccoy pictured would have been troubled for some time after death of creature at his hands in his book influence of star trek on television film and culture lincoln geraghty wrote that episodes such as man trap demonstrated a recurring theme within series more barren planet more likely that characters will be in danger other episodes which he said supported this view included cage and what are little girls made of geraghty 2008 p 84 geraghty also pointed out that elsewhere in original series predominant view was that alien predators such as salt vampire were a lower life form which should be destroyed he said that in man trap alternative argument is presented that such creatures should not be killed however geraghty felt that writers tried to prevent viewers from feeling sympathy for creature by revealing its true appearance as it died geraghty 2008 p 87 paula m block and terry j erdmann also discussed killing of creature in their book star trek original series 365 saying that it was right thing to do but suggested that nature of death would have troubled mccoy for some time after event although this was not shown in series block erdmann 2010 p 50 a vampiric alien is a recurring idea in science fiction television series such as blake s 7 episode sand babylon 5 episode soul hunter and television film babylon 5 river of souls muir 2000 p 196 theme had already been used in written form in gustave le rouge s 1908 french science fiction work le prisonnier de la planete mars block and erdmann also discussed another part of episode where spock is in charge on bridge and uhura begins to flirt with him calling it a quintessential scene of series due to characters sexual interest in each other they suggested this may have been inspiration for spock uhura relationship introduced in 2009 reboot film star trek block erdmann 2010 p 49 nichelle nichols who played uhura later said that she felt there were hints of an uhura spock relationship in other episodes of original series reception broadcast a month prior to premiere of star trek desilu held a screening for nbc executives to help decide which episode to broadcast first and several stories were considered solow justman 1996 p 163 executives were concerned that mudd s women one potential choice would have reviewers discussing space hookers they felt another possibility where no man has gone before contained too much exposition even though it was filmed as a second pilot final choice was between man trap and naked time justman felt that naked time would make it easier for viewers to understand characters but later agreed with nbc s decision to show man trap first in book inside star trek real story he suggests that it was scarier and more exploitable than others man trap was sixth episode produced although roddenberry initially disagreed with nbc s decision he and production executive herbert franklin solow came to believe it was correct choice shatner 1993 p 163 shatner also disagreed with network feeling that man trap was worst episode out of those available episode was first episode of star trek broadcast in united states
