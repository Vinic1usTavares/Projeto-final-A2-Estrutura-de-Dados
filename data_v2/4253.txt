installation at max orange line s southeast park avenue max station in oak grove an unincorporated area neighboring milwaukie design of unfinished creative work called for a yellow painted deer with a child s face and was intended to represent interaction between nearby riparian forest and people living in oak grove in its concept proposal art installation is described as thumb right alavi s second more humanized rendering of sculpture two renderings of alavi s design were made available to public first computer generated image did not include context which arguably provoked debate over its design while second was more humanized and illustrated how installation could interact with people and surrounding environment trimet confirmed at least two changes to sculpture s original design a move to southeast to avoid crossing into trolley trail or milwaukie s boundaries and removal of its mosaic tile facade to reduce costs in october 2011 artist presented a revised concept to trimet s public art advisory committee sculpture s color and dimensions were unchanged but it would be made of glass reinforced concrete its surface treatment remained undetermined but alavi wanted one that would be natural or inherent to material to achieve a reflective glowing and magical appearance committee preferred reflective appearance seen in artist s original design and requested material samples at his final presentation which was scheduled to take place in december history and public reaction upon public release rebirth design became a target for ridicule in june 2011 milwaukie neighborhood association leaders sent a letter to public art advisory committee expressing their disappointment with proposed deer concept hoping to see changes to its final design some residents thought sculpture should be more accessible and less expensive conversely oak lodge community council chairwoman who also served as a member of art committee hoped sculpture could serve as a community space and reach icon status in a formal letter trimet s general manager responded to neighborhood associations by encouraging residents to communicate directly with art committee by inviting members to neighborhood association leadership meetings agency s spokeswoman also told committee leaders that public was welcome to share their preferences regarding work s dimensions fabrication methods form and materials oak grove and milwaukie residents also disagreed about whether or not those in latter city had a say about sculpture which would have been within area s boundaries according to first design in october 2011 at a public meeting to address trimet s projected budget gap one milwaukie resident asked agency to abandon its plans to fund rebirth saying that a lot of people think that thing s just ugly why are they spending money on something that s an unnecessary add on at same time they re talking about cutting bus routes again agency s general manager responded that all possibilities would be considered though trimet officials confirmed that cuts to its public art program were not an option and max orange line s budget was separate from trimet s financial problems in november 2011 trimet s public art coordinator confirmed alavi s withdrawal from project saying artist for park avenue did his due diligence he did everything possible to make that a reality but sometimes it s not realistic according to oregonian alavi was unable to meet public art advisory committee s technical requirements and remain under budget one committee member admitted form itself was something a lot of people out in community weren t happy with in first place so once mosaic piece was taken away it kind of devalued it alavi released following statement debate over sculpture s proposed design by trimet art committee and members of public reached near yelling match status resulting in animosity and general nastiness following alavi s withdrawal art committee made plans to reconvene and consider other design proposals for site critical response in articles providing updates about sculpture s status oregonian called work larger than life style highway art and twilight zone bambi angela webber of daily journal of commerce expressed her love for sculpture and disappointment in public s reaction she wrote this makes me so sad apparently this giant baby faced deer statue isn t pretty enough for milwaukie i imagine folks of milwaukie just don t get it following confirmation about artist s withdrawal journal s aaron spencer said local residents are being deprived of sculpture s disturbing fantastical whimsy in an article called let s save giant baby faced deer statue he wrote as we all know i love this statue i love it a lot and i think we can save it there
