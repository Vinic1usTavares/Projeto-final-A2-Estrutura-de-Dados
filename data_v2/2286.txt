pteropus suborder is a genus of megabats which are among largest in world they are commonly known as fruit bats or flying foxes among other colloquial names they live in tropics and subtropics of asia including indian subcontinent australia east africa and some oceanic islands in indian and pacific oceans there are at least 60 extant species in genus flying foxes eat fruit and other plant matter and occasionally consume insects as well they locate resources with their keen sense of smell most but not all are nocturnal they navigate with keen eyesight as they cannot echolocate they have long life spans and low reproductive outputs with females of most species producing only one offspring per year their slow life history makes their populations vulnerable to threats such as overhunting culling and natural disasters six flying fox species have been made extinct in modern times by overhunting flying foxes are often persecuted for their real or perceived role in damaging crops they are ecologically beneficial by assisting in regeneration of forests via seed dispersal they benefit ecosystems and human interests by pollinating plants flying foxes are relevant to humans as a source of disease as they are reservoirs of rare but fatal disease agents including australian bat lyssavirus which causes rabies and hendra virus seven known human deaths have resulted from these two diseases nipah virus is also transmitted by flying foxes it affects more people with over 100 attributed fatalities they have cultural significance to indigenous people with appearances in traditional art folklore and weaponry their fur and teeth were used as currency in past some cultures still use their teeth as currency today taxonomy and etymology genus name pteropus was coined by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1762 prior to 1998 genus authority was sometimes given to german naturalist johann christian polycarp erxleben although brisson publication 1762 predated erxleben publication 1777 thus giving him preference under principle of priority some authors gave preference to erxleben as genus authority because brisson s publication did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in 1998 international commission on zoological nomenclature iczn decided that brisson s 1762 publication was a rejected work for nomenclatural purposes despite rejecting majority of publication iczn decided to conserve a dozen generic names from work and retain brisson as authority including pteropus type species of genus is mauritian flying fox pteropus niger described as vespertilio niger by robert kerr in 1792 decision to designate p niger as type species was made by iczn through their plenary powers over biological nomenclature pteropus comes from ancient greek pteron meaning wing and pous meaning foot phrase flying fox has been used to refer to pteropus bats since at least 1759 description external characteristics thumb flying fox in flight flying fox species vary in body weight ranging from across all species males are usually larger than females large flying fox has longest forearm length and reported wingspan of any species but some species exceed it in weight its wingspan is up to and it can weigh up to indian and great flying foxes are heavier at and respectively outside this genus giant golden crowned flying fox genus acerodon is only bat with similar dimensions most flying fox species are considerably smaller and generally weigh less than smaller species such as masked temminck s guam and dwarf flying foxes all weigh less than pelage is long and silky with a dense underfur in many species individuals have a mantle of contrasting fur color on back of their head shoulders and upper back they lack tails as common name flying fox suggests their heads resemble that of a small fox because of their small ears and large eyes females have one pair of mammae located in chest region their ears are long and pointed at tip and lack tragi outer margin of each ear forming an unbroken ring toes have sharp curved claws while microbats only have a claw on each thumb of their forelimbs flying foxes additionally have a claw on each index finger skull and dentition thumb skull of black eared flying fox skulls of pteropus species are composed of 24 bones snout is made of 7 cranium of 16 and mandible is a single bone it has a large and bulbous braincase like all mammals flying foxes have three middle ear ossicles which assist in transmitting sound to brain flying fox skulls continue to develop after they are born compared to adults young flying foxes have very short snouts as they reach maturity maxilla elongates gaining bone between zygomatic processes and canine teeth based on grey headed flying fox s development pups are born with some milk teeth already erupted canines and incisors by 9 days old all milk teeth have emerged with a dental formula of and a total of 20 teeth by 140 days old 4 6 months all milk teeth have fallen and been replaced by permanent teeth canines are usually replaced first followed by premolars incisors and then molars adult dental formula is for a total of 34 teeth occlusal surface of molars is generally smooth but with longitudinal furrows internal systems flying foxes have large hearts and a relatively fast heart rate resting individuals have a heart rate of 100 400 beats per minute flying foxes have simple digestive tracts time between ingestion and excretion is as short as 12 minutes they lack both a cecum and an appendix stomach has marked cardiac and fundic regions intelligence megabats including flying foxes have greatest encephalization quotient brain size relative to body size of any bat family at 1 20 this value is equivalent to that of domestic dogs flying foxes display behaviors that indicate a reliance on long term information storage though they have wide ranging movements and cover thousands of square kilometers annually they are consistently able to locate same resource patches and roosts they will visit these resource patches consistently in a strategy known as trap lining they can also be conditioned to perform behaviors such as one study where spectacled flying foxes were trained to pull a lever using juice as a reinforcement in a follow up to initial study individuals who had learned to pull lever to receive juice still did so 3 5 years later senses smell thumb prominent eyes of spectacled flying fox flying foxes rely heavily on their sense of smell they have large olfactory bulbs to process scents they use scent to locate food for mothers to locate their pups and for mates to locate each other males have enlarged androgen sensitive sebaceous glands on their shoulders that they use for scent marking their territories particularly during mating season secretions of these glands vary by species of 65 chemical compounds isolated from glands of four species no compound was found in all species males also engage in urine washing meaning that they coat themselves in their own urine sight flying foxes do not echolocate and therefore rely on sight to navigate their eyes are relatively large and positioned on front of their heads giving them binocular vision like most mammals though not primates they are dichromatic they have both rods and cones they have blue cones that detect short wavelength light and green cones that detect medium to long wavelengths rods greatly outnumber cones however as cones comprise only 0 5 of photoreceptors flying foxes are adapted to seeing in low light conditions evolutionary history flying foxes are poorly represented in fossil record relative to current number of extant species has one of most incomplete fossil records of any bat group as of 2014 no flying fox fossils are known from before holocene many flying foxes live in tropics however where conditions for fossilization are poor based on molecular evolution flying foxes diverged from a common ancestor with rousettus 28 18 million years ago and from their sister taxa neopteryx and acerodon 6 6 10 6 million years ago neopteryx acerodon and are all relatively closely related to flying foxes as they are other members of its subfamily phylogenetic analysis indicates that flying foxes diversified rapidly in an explosive evolutionary radiation creating many taxa in a relatively short time frame most flying fox lineages emerged after with two major clades created one consisting of indian ocean species and other of melanesian micronesian australian and insular southeast asian species flying foxes likely originated on mainland asia molecular data suggests that there were at least three colonization events into indian ocean one event resulted in livingstone s fruit bat and pemba flying fox which are westernmost flying foxes a second colonization event resulted in rodrigues flying fox to rodrigues island while a third event resulted in several species diverging to mauritius seychelles madagascar and aldabra with one possible exception of masked flying fox p flying foxes are likely monophyletic there are over 60 extant species of flying fox flying foxes are now present from western indian ocean midway through pacific ocean as far east as cook islands they are found in tropical and subtropical climates biology and ecology reproduction and life cycle thumb female spectacled flying fox with pup many species of flying fox are polygynandrous meaning that each individual will mate with several other individuals samoa flying fox is a notable exception because it is monogamous flying fox sexual behaviors include oral sex in addition to intercourse with fellatio and cunnilingus observed between opposite sexes as well as homosexual fellatio in at least one species bonin flying fox opposite sex oral sex is associated with increased duration of intercourse while same sex fellatio is hypothesized to encourage colony formation of otherwise antagonistic males in colder climates flying fox gestation length varies among species gestation length is 140 190 days 4 6 6 3 months females have a litter size of one young at a time called a pup twins have been occasionally documented in some species however twins can be fraternal identical or result of pups are altricial and sparsely furred at birth so dependent on their mothers for care pups are relatively small at birth weighing approximately 12 of mother s weight bats in other genera can have pups that weigh as much as 30 of mother s weight at birth they cling to their mothers abdomens gripping her fur with their thumb claws and teeth females carry pups for first several weeks of life after this females may leave pups behind at roost at night while they forage as with nearly all bat species males do not assist females in parental care while male flying foxes of at least one species bismarck masked flying fox can lactate it is unclear if lactation is functional and males actually nurse pups or if it is a result of stress or malnutrition pups fledge beginning at 3 months old but may not be weaned until 4 6 months old pups may stay with their mothers until age one flying foxes do not reach sexual maturity until 1 5 2 years old females can have up to two litters annually though one is norm due to long weaning period most flying foxes are seasonal breeders and give birth in spring though mariana fruit bat seems to have breeding with new pups documented throughout year females remain fertile with no decrease in reproductive capability for at least first 12 or 13 years of life flying foxes like all bats are long lived relative to their size in wild average lifespans are likely 15 years however individuals part of populations that face excessive disturbance may have lifespans as short as 7 1 years in captivity individuals can live approximately 20 28 years longest lived flying fox was an indian flying fox who lived in captivity it lived to age 31 years and 5 months social systems thumb a roosting colony of indian flying foxes most flying fox species are gregarious and form large aggregations of individuals called colonies or camps large flying fox forms colonies of up to 15 000 individuals while little red flying fox forms colonies of up to 100 000 individuals a few species and subspecies such as s flying fox p dasymallus and ceram fruit bat are solitary colony size varies throughout year in response to biological needs grey headed flying fox forms harems during breeding season consisting of one male and up to six females these colonies break up after breeding season is over in bonin flying fox colony formation is based on both sex and age of individuals as well as season in winter breeding season adult females will form colonies that include a few adult males likely harems adult males who do not roost with females will form colonies with other adult and subadult males subadults will form mixed sex subadult groups with each other in summer however individuals are solitary with exception of nursing females who roost with their pups diet and foraging flying foxes consume 25 35 of their body weight daily they are generalists that will consume a variety of items to meet their nutritional needs food items include fruit flowers nectar and leaves they will sometimes deliberately consume insects such as cicadas as well in australia eucalypt blossoms and pollen are preferred food sources followed by melaleuca and banksia flowers they feed on a wide variety of crops as well causing conflicts with farmers crops eaten by flying foxes include sisal cashew pineapple areca breadfruit jackfruit neem papaya citrus fig mango banana avocado guava sugar cane tamarind grapes and more in captivity recommended diet for flying foxes consists of two thirds hard fruits like pears and apples and one third soft fruits bananas and other high fiber fruits should only be offered occasionally as flying foxes are not adapted to high fiber diets protein supplements are recommended for captive flying foxes other supplements such as vitamin c calcium sulfate and glucosamine can be recommended periodically majority of flying fox species are nocturnal and forage at night a few island species and subspecies are diurnal however hypothesized as a response to a lack of predators diurnal taxa include p melanotus natalis mauritian flying fox caroline flying fox p p insularis and seychelles fruit bat foraging resources are often far from roosts with individuals traveling up to to reach them flying foxes can travel at for three hours or more and can reach top speeds of some colonial species will forage in groups especially when resources are abundant less social species will forage alone when they land on a tree with food they will hang onto branch with their clawed hind feet and use their clawed thumbs to pull branches bearing flowers or fruits towards them as they forage on fruit flying foxes will compress fruit against palate with tongue to squeeze out and consume juices rest of fruit is then discarded in ejecta pellets role in ecosystems flying foxes have important roles as seed dispersers and pollinators they help spread seeds in fruit they eat by discarding them in ejecta pellets or through their guano in madagascar fig seeds have better germination success if they have passed through gut of a flying fox which is important because fig trees are a vital pioneer species in regenerating lost forest even though flying foxes can have a gut transit time as fast as 12 minutes seeds can be retained in gut for as long as 20 hours as flying foxes travel large distances seeds can be deposited up to from parent tree they are particularly important in fragmented forests as many other frugivores are terrestrial and often confined to forest fragments flying foxes have capability to spread seeds beyond forest fragments through flight flying foxes pollinate a variety of plants including economically valuable durian they forage on its nectar in such a way that flowers and eventual fruit production are not usually harmed flying fox pollination has a positive effect on durian reproductive success suggesting that both flying foxes and durian trees benefit from this relationship conservation conservation status thumb upright 1 1 iucn status of pteropus species of 62 flying fox species evaluated by iucn as of 2018 3 are considered critically endangered aru flying fox livingstone s fruit bat and flying fox another 7 species are listed as endangered 20 are listed as vulnerable 6 as near threatened 14 as least concern and 8 as data deficient a further 4 are listed as extinct dusky flying fox large palau flying fox small mauritian flying fox and guam flying fox over half of species are threatened today with extinction and in particular in pacific a number of species have died out as a result of hunting deforestation and predation by invasive species six flying fox species are believed to have gone extinct from 1864 to 2014 guam large palau small mauritian dusky large samoan and small samoan flying foxes legal status all species of pteropus are placed on appendix ii of cites and ten on appendix i which restricts international trade individual species have different legal protections from hunting and domestic trade that reflect environmental laws of countries where they are found in some countries such as bangladesh sri lanka and thailand flying foxes are absolutely protected from harm under wildlife preservation and security act of 2012 fauna and flora protection ordinance of 1937 and wildlife protection and reservation act of 1992 respectively however in thailand flying fox poaching and illegal bushmeat trade still occurs outside of protected areas large flying fox and small flying fox are particularly prone to poaching and roost disturbance in other countries such as australia japan and united states some species of conservation concern are protected under national environmental legislation while others are not in australia two flying foxes are listed under environment protection and biodiversity conservation act of 1999 grey headed and spectacled flying foxes are listed as vulnerable farmers can apply for permits to kill flying foxes when they are causing crop damage several flying fox species occur in japan bonin flying fox has been a natural monument of japan since 1969 which means that it is illegal to capture or disturb them without appropriate permits two subspecies of ryukyu flying fox p d dasymallus and p d daitoensis are also listed as natural monuments flying foxes are not designated game species in japan and therefore cannot be legally hunted per wildlife protection and hunting law bonin flying fox and p d daitoensis are also listed as national endangered species meaning that they cannot be killed or harmed furthermore sale or transfer of live or dead individuals in whole or part is also prohibited without permits despite not occurring in continental united states several species and subspecies are listed under its endangered species act of 1973 pteropus mariannus mariannus a subspecies of mariana fruit bat is listed as threatened while rodrigues flying fox and guam flying fox are listed as endangered additionally u s government has been petitioned to list aru flying fox and bonin flying fox as threatened or endangered in countries such as india and pakistan flying foxes explicitly have no legal protection in india they are listed as vermin under wildlife protection act of 1972 pakistan s only flying fox indian flying fox is listed under schedule 4 of punjab wildlife protection preservation conservation and management act of 1974 meaning that it has no legal protections and can be hunted in mauritius flying foxes were formerly protected but are now legally culled at a large scale in 2015 mauritian government passed native terrestrial biodiversity and national parks act which legalized culling of mauritian flying fox in mauritius over 40 000 mauritian flying foxes were culled in a two year period reducing its population by an estimated 45 this decision was viewed with controversy with researchers stating because they spread seeds and pollinate flowers flying foxes are vital for regenerating lost forests legal protection can vary within a country as well such as in malaysia under 1990 protection of wild life amendment order flying foxes can be hunted with a permit each permit is good for killing up to 50 flying foxes permits cost us 8 each however under protection of wildlife act of 1972 flying foxes can be killed without permits if they are causing damage or if there is reason to believe that it is about to cause serious damage to crops in 2012 malaysian state of terengganu issued a moratorium on hunting flying foxes in sarawak all bat species are listed as protected and hunting them is not legal factors causing decline anthropogenic sources thumb upright 1 2 abandoned grey headed flying fox pups after a cyclone flying foxes species are declining or going extinct as a result of several human impacts to their environments in addition to natural phenomena their populations are especially vulnerable to threats because litter size is usually only individual and females generally only have one litter per year even when nearly every female 90 successfully produces and raises young if a population s mortality rate exceeds 22 annually then it will steadily decline invasive species such as brown tree snake can seriously impact populations brown tree snake consumes so many pups that it reduced recruitment of guam population of mariana fruit bat to essentially zero many flying fox species are threatened by overhunting while they have long been a dietary component of indigenous people expanding human population and more efficient weapons have resulted in population declines local extinctions and extinctions overhunting is believed to be primary cause of extinction for small mauritian flying fox and guam flying fox flying foxes are also threatened with excessive culling due to conflict with farmers they are shot beaten to death or poisoned to reduce their populations mortality also occurs via accidental entanglement into netting used to prevent bats from eating fruit culling can dramatically reduce flying fox populations in mauritius over 40 000 mauritian flying foxes were culled in a two year period reducing its population by an estimated 45 flying foxes are also killed by electrocution in one australian orchard it is estimated that over 21 000 bats were electrocuted to death in an 8 week period farmers construct electrified grids over their fruit trees to kill flying foxes before they can consume their crop grids are questionably effective at preventing crop loss with one farmer who operated such a grid estimating that they still lost of fruit to flying foxes in a year some electrocution deaths are also accidental such as when bats fly into overhead power lines climate change causes flying fox mortality and a source of concern for species persistence extreme heat waves in australia have been responsible for deaths of more than 30 000 flying foxes from 1994 to 2008 females and young bats are most susceptible to extreme heat which affects a population s ability to recover flying foxes are threatened by sea level rise associated with climate change as several taxa are endemic to low lying atolls natural sources because many species are endemic to a single island they are vulnerable to random events such as typhoons a 1979 typhoon halved remaining population of rodrigues flying fox typhoons result in indirect mortality as well because they defoliate trees flying foxes are more visible and easily hunted by humans food resources for bats become scarce after major storms and flying foxes resort to riskier foraging strategies such as consuming fallen fruit off ground there they are more vulnerable to depredation by domestic cats dogs and pigs flying foxes are also threatened by disease such as tick paralysis tick paralysis affects spectacled flying fox and is responsible for an estimated 1 of its annual mortality captive breeding thumb upright 0 8 a rodrigues flying fox flying at zurich zoologischer garten several species of endangered flying fox are bred in captivity to augment their population sizes critically endangered livingstone s fruit bats were taken from wild starting in 1995 to create a captive breeding program all captive individuals remain property of government 17 individuals were collected from wild with breeding there are 71 in captivity as of 2017 individuals are held at jersey zoo and bristol zoo though program has been successful in increasing population caretakers of captive population have had to deal with husbandry issues such as obesity and cardiomyopathy relative to their wild counterparts captive bats have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of muscle mass problem is pronounced in dominant males which are most sedentary addressing these concerns involves increasing flight space so that animals can exercise adequately keepers are also exploring ways of distributing food within enclosures to encourage exercise endangered rodrigues flying fox has been bred in captivity with great success by 1979 only 70 100 individuals were left in world in 1976 25 individuals were removed from wild by durrell wildlife conservation trust to begin a breeding program in 1988 breeding program was called undoubtedly most important breeding project now in operation by 2016 there were 180 individuals in 16 zoos across united states alone worldwide 46 zoos participate in rodrigues flying fox breeding program as of 2017 relationship to people food thumb an indonesian dish made with flying fox meat many flying foxes species are killed for bushmeat bushmeat harvest is often unsustainable often resulting in severe population decline or local extinction flying foxes are killed and sold for bushmeat in several countries in southeast asia south asia and oceania including indonesia malaysia papua new guinea philippines bangladesh india fiji and guam flying fox consumption is particularly common in countries with low food security and lack of environmental regulation in some cultures in region however eating flying fox meat is taboo in locals are repulsed by idea of eating flying foxes because flying foxes urinate on themselves in predominately muslim regions such as much of indonesia flying foxes are rarely consumed because of halal dietary restrictions north sulawesi has greatest demand for flying fox bushmeat despite being in muslim majority indonesia north sulawesi is predominately christian therefore many locals do not follow halal guidelines prohibiting flying fox consumption in manado most local people consume flying fox meat at least once a month frequency of flying fox consumption increases tenfold around holidays locals believe that unique meat from undomesticated animals should be served on special occasions to enliven atmosphere suggestions to make flying fox bushmeat trade more sustainable include enforcing a quota system for harvesting encouraging hunters to release female and juvenile individuals and providing economic alternatives to those who make a living selling flying fox bushmeat in guam and commonwealth of northern mariana islands consumption of mariana fruit bat exposes locals to neurotoxin beta l alanine bmaa which may later lead to neurodegenerative diseases bmaa may become in humans who consume flying foxes flying foxes are exposed to bmaa by eating cycad fruits medicine flying foxes are killed for use in traditional medicine indian flying fox for example has many perceived medical uses some believe that its fat is a treatment for rheumatism tribes in region of india eat cooked flesh of indian flying fox to treat asthma and chest pain healers of kanda tribe of bangladesh use hair from indian flying foxes to create treatments for fever with shivering transmitting disease thumb right date palm sap collection a primary exposure route for nipah virus thumb right known outbreaks as of 2014 flying foxes are natural reservoirs of several viruses some of which can be transmitted to humans notably flying foxes can transmit which cause rabies in australia rabies virus is not naturally present australian bat lyssavirus is only lyssavirus present australian bat lyssavirus was first identified in 1996 it is very rarely transmitted to humans transmission occurs from bite or scratch of an infected animal but can also occur from getting infected animal s saliva in a mucous membrane or an open wound exposure to flying fox blood urine or feces is not a risk of exposure to australian bat lyssavirus since 1994 there have been three records of people getting infected with it all three were in queensland and each case was fatal flying foxes are also reservoirs of such as hendra virus and nipah virus hendra virus was first identified in 1994 it also rarely occurs humans from 1994 to 2013 there have been seven reported cases of hendra virus affecting people four of which were fatal hypothesized primary route of human infection is via contact with horses that have come into contact with flying fox urine there are no documented instances of direct transmission between flying foxes and humans as of 2012 there is a vaccine available for horses to decrease likelihood of infection and transmission nipah virus was first identified in 1998 in malaysia since 1998 there have been several nipah outbreaks in malaysia singapore india and bangladesh resulting in over 100 casualties a 2018 outbreak in kerala india resulted in 19 humans infected of which 17 died overall fatality rate is 40 75 humans can contract nipah virus from direct contact with flying foxes or their fluids through exposure to an intermediate host such as domestic pigs or from contact with an infected person a 2014 study of indian flying fox and nipah virus found that while nipah virus outbreaks are more likely in areas preferred by flying foxes presence of bats in and of itself is not considered a risk factor for nipah virus infection rather consumption of date palm sap is a significant route of transmission practice of date palm sap collection involves placing collecting pots at date palm trees indian flying foxes have been observed licking sap as it flows into pots as well as defecating and urinating in proximity to pots in this way humans who drink palm sap can be exposed to bats viruses use of bamboo skirts on collecting pots lowers risk of contamination from bat fluids flying foxes can transmit several non lethal diseases as well such as menangle virus and nelson bay virus these viruses rarely affect humans and few cases have been reported while other bat species have been suspected or implicated as reservoir of diseases such as sars and ebola flying foxes are not suspected as hosts for either causative virus pests thumb netting used to protect crops from wildlife such as flying foxes flying foxes are often considered pests due to damage they cause to orchard crops flying foxes have been cited as particularly destructive to almonds and mangoes in maldives lychee in mauritius areca in india and stone fruits in australia orchard damages from other animals are often misattributed to flying foxes though and economic damage can be difficult to quantify or exaggerated to prevent fruit damage farmers may legally or illegally cull flying foxes in 1800s australian government paid farmers bounties to kill flying foxes though practice has since been discontinued alternatives to culling include placing barriers between bats and fruit trees such as netting or harvesting fruit in a timely manner to avoid attracting as many flying foxes netting is most effective way to prevent crop loss though some farmers find it cost prohibitive it costs us 4 400 44 000 to net of crops other methods of preventing fruit loss may also involve use of scare guns chemical deterrents or night time lights alternatively planting singapore cherry trees and other decoy crops next to an orchard can be effective as flying foxes are much more attracted to their fruits than many other orchard crops location of flying fox camps can be a disturbance to humans in batemans bay australia locals report being so disturbed by flying fox vocalizations in morning that they lose sleep flying foxes can fly into power lines and cause electricity outages their guano and body odor are also unpleasant to smell presence of flying fox colonies can cause nearby property values to decline in culture thumb left upright 0 9 a flying fox depicted in aboriginal art thumb upright 0 7 ceremonial axe decorated with flying fox fur braid in new caledonia thumb right upright 0 7 flying fox braided fur cord used as currency in loyalty islands flying foxes are featured in indigenous cultures and traditions a folklore dreamtime story from new south wales north coast in australia features an impatient flying fox wanting great spirit to teach him how to be a bird only to be hung upside down on a branch they were also featured in aboriginal cave art as evinced by several surviving examples in tonga flying foxes are considered sacred all flying foxes are property of king meaning non royal persons cannot harm them in any way tongan legend states that a colony of flying foxes at are descendants of a pair of flying foxes gifted to king of tonga by princess of samoa in indian village of a colony of indian flying foxes roosts in a banyan tree villagers believe that flying foxes are under protection of muni and do not harm bats a shrine to muni is beneath tree if locals believe that they have offended muni by failing to protect bats they will pray and perform puja after offering sweet rice coconut and bananas to those attending ceremony flying foxes are also featured in folk stories from papua new guinea stories with flying foxes include a legend about a cockatoo stealing feathers from flying fox resulting in it becoming nocturnal another story features a flying fox that can transform into a young man flying fox stole a woman away from her husband to take as his wife another legend states that a flying fox man was responsible for introducing yams to their people indigenous societies in oceania used parts of flying foxes for functional and ceremonial weapons in solomon islands people created barbs out of their bones for use in spears in new caledonia ceremonial axes made of jade were decorated with braids of flying fox fur flying fox wings were depicted on war shields of people of indonesia they believed that wings offered protection to their warriors there are modern and historical references to flying fox byproducts used as currency in new caledonia braided flying fox fur was once used as currency on island of makira which is part of solomon islands indigenous peoples still hunt flying foxes for their teeth as well as for bushmeat canine teeth are strung together on necklaces that are used as currency teeth of insular flying fox are particularly prized as they are usually large enough to drill holes in makira flying fox is also hunted though despite its smaller teeth deterring local peoples from using flying fox teeth as currency may be detrimental to species with lavery and noting species that provide an important cultural resource can be highly treasured emphasizing sustainable hunting of flying foxes to preserve cultural currency may be more effective than encouraging abandonment of cultural currency even if flying foxes were no longer hunted for their teeth they would still be killed for bushmeat therefore retaining their cultural value may encourage sustainable hunting practices lavery stated it s a positive not a negative that their teeth are so culturally valuable practice of hunting bats shouldn t necessarily be stopped it needs to be managed sustainably other uses flying foxes and other bat species in southeast asia are often killed and sold as mummies mummified bodies or skeletons of these bats are often shipped to united states where they are sold in souvenir or curiosity shops or online through vendors such as etsy or ebay from 2000 to 2013 over 100 000 dead bats were imported to united states bat conservationist merlin tuttle wrote i ve seen huge losses mostly due to various kinds of over harvesting especially at cave entrances either for food or for sale as mummies despite sometimes being advertised as sustainable practice could lead to overharvesting and depletion of flying fox species with tuttle saying it is a virtual certainty that bats you ve seen advertised are not sustainably harvested species references category bats of asia category bats of
