bougainville battle of pearl ridge 30 31 december 1944 was an engagement of second world war fought between australian and japanese forces on bougainville island part of wider bougainville campaign battle took place in central sector of island shortly after australians had taken over responsibility from americans believing that ridge was held by less than a company of japanese on 30 december australian 25th infantry battalion launched a four pronged attacked ridge defending force however had been greatly reinforced by elements of 38th independent mixed brigade and was closer to a battalion in strength after being held up on right of their advance australians dug in overnight and repulsed a strong japanese counterattack before resuming attack on 31 december by late in afternoon japanese had been swept off ridge australians later established an observation post on ridge which had commanding views of whole island and throughout remainder of campaign used it to control artillery fire as they advanced towards japanese enclaves in north and south of island background strategic situation japanese had captured bougainville in early 1942 and had subsequently built it into a significant base with large numbers of aircraft and troops in order to protect fortress at rabaul following this allied planners determined that their key strategy in region would be reduction of base at rabaul to do this they needed airfields within range and as such it was decided to secure western part of bougainville landing around torokina in november 1943 heavy fighting followed landing but after a large scale japanese counter attack was defeated in march 1944 japanese withdrew from us lodgement and subsequently a period of relative quiet followed as us forces limited themselves to patrolling and establishing outposts rather than large scale operations in late 1944 as part of buildup of us forces for an offensive in philippines allied planners decided to free up us forces in region by having australian forces replace them in aitape wewak area of new guinea bougainville and on new britain advanced australian elements began arriving on bougainville in september and by november december 1944 four brigades from australian ii corps took over responsibility for bougainville from divisions of us xiv corps that had been stationed there previously allied intelligence reports and estimates regarding japanese strength varied but considered position of australians was that there were around 17 500 japanese on island although understrength these troops were reported to still be capable of conducting effective combat operations and continued to pose a threat to allied base at torokina as such in mid december after a period of information gathering it was decided that australian ii corps consisting of militiamen from 3rd division and 11th brigade would go on offensive a three pronged campaign was subsequently planned in northern central and southern sectors of island after war it was found that australian intelligence estimates were significantly in error with japanese strength being more than 40 000 preliminary moves initially brigadier john field s 7th brigade was given responsibility for central sector and in november brigade began operations to clear japanese from high features in sector along numa numa trail due to steep terrain which was covered with thick jungle and punctuated with numerous waterways australians could only establish a small frontage with one battalion forward on trail with its constituent companies spread singly in a line across razorback ridge line on 23 november in what was first australian operation of campaign following relief of americans australian 9th infantry battalion captured a japanese outpost on a feature known to australians as little george supported by machine guns mortars and artillery two australians were killed or died of wounds while six others were wounded this attack was followed up by a second in mid december when 9th captured a japanese outpost on artillery hill shortly after this australian 25th infantry battalion under lieutenant colonel john mckinna relieved 9th infantry battalion at artillery hill and began patrolling operations towards japanese position on pearl ridge a feature which due to its height offered commanding views of entire island according to james this ridge was one of strongest positions along numa numa trail and it dominated high ground across empire range japanese had been using ridge to observe australian movements to west and was also point where three main east west overland routes across island converged battle australians spent christmas day patrolling forward in concert with royal australian air force boomerang fighters from no 4 squadron raaf carrying out reconnaissance flights ahead of their position throughout evening japanese launched an attack against one of australian companies but this was turned back by defenders for several days australian battalion commander formulated a plan to capture pearl ridge possession of which would enable australians to block japanese attempts to approach main allied base around torokina and would disrupt movement of japanese troops along north south axis of island hindering their ability to reinforce isolated pockets believing that ridge was held by two understrength companies from japanese 81st infantry regiment approximately 80 90 men who had withdrawn there after fighting on little george and artillery hill australians decided to commit only a battalion to capture it on morning of 30 december after 40 minutes of airstrikes from royal new zealand air force corsairs who had been guided onto their targets by raaf boomerangs roughly 800 strong 25th battalion carried out an attack supported by artillery and machine gun fire with four companies advancing across a frontage stretching across ridge unbeknown to australians however two companies from 81st infantry regiment had been reinforced by men from japanese 38th independent mixed brigade under major general kijima and they actually numbered 550 they had heavily fortified ridge establishing a series of bunkers and pillboxes between weapons pits that were linked with trenches however due to steep terrain they were only able to move three mortars onto position and there were no other heavy weapons they were also unable to haul bulk water to position and had to rely on constant resupply by foot left thumb men from australian 25th battalion during battle of pearl ridge 30 december 1944 alt soldiers in battle gear advance up a hill establishing air posts and supply dumps on artillery hill and werda s knoll australians advanced from artillery ridge where battalion headquarters was established well forward for attack a broad front assault with all four companies forward australian commander s tactic was a departure from narrow front attacks that had been mounted against little george and artillery hill although left most australian company c company under captain wallace bruce advancing from werda s knoll managed to reach ridge pushing through thick bamboo and killing several japanese due to terrain lieutenant bruce shaw s a company on far right of australian line and having stepped off from artillery hill was forced into advancing across a narrow razorback only wide along which japanese were able to concentrate a significant amount of fire from north east from a feature dubbed pear hill confronted by a deep bomb crater which blocked their path australians became pinned as more artillery fire was brought down on ridge in support of attack an attempt was made to outflank japanese position in front of razorback although this too proved unsuccessful as japanese defenders began rolling grenades down slope after australians had suffered a number of casualties attack on right was called off and shaw s company was ordered to form a defensive position and await further orders australian commander mckinna then ordered two companies in centre captain charles gabel s b company and d company under captain malcolm just to dig in where they were while left most company under bruce who had reached japanese track on north eastern side of ridge also dug in with intention of holding its position until daybreak that night japanese made a minor attack against c company but this was turned back with artillery and small arms following day australians resumed their attack in doing so mckinna ordered d company to renew assault aiming for pear hill on right hand side of australian line although it required a more physically draining approach march over artillery hill and through dense scrub tactic proved to be more successful than previous day s efforts pear hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited australian frontage to just three men side by side who had to cut their way through thick bamboo with machetes weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons including vickers machine guns australians found it heavy going it took majority of afternoon to reach crest of hill where they were to form up for final assault a thirty minute pause followed after which an artillery barrage was called down upon japanese defenders on their right a company began to draw japanese fire and at 15 30 hours d company attacked ridge across a thin saddle by late afternoon japanese defenders had pulled back from ridge leaving australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with d company securing main position while b company skirted north of barton s knoll and secured a secondary position below ridge which australians dubbed baker s brow meanwhile on australian left western side of battlefield a heavy machine and snipers held up c company s advance after dark around 22 00 hours japanese began probing defences around position that c company had established at first this was limited to minor harassment tactics in an effort to locate australian positions a company was also probed in early morning japanese launched a strong counter attack from south and south east of c company s position amidst heavy fighting japanese fought their way into two forward australian pits and close quarters fighting ensued after an hour attack was repulsed with artillery support and at first light on australians sent out patrols which found ridge abandoned throughout morning and into early afternoon australians undertook mopping up operations before ridge was finally cleared in early afternoon with control of pearl ridge australians secured a vantage point from where they could see from one side of bougainville to other a distance of over this would later facilitate further operations around island providing australians were a vantage point for artillery observation aftermath during course of battle australians lost 10 killed and 25 wounded while 34 japanese bodies were found on position with several more lying in irretrievable positions down steep slopes in addition one japanese soldier was taken prisoner according to australian official historian gavin long attack on pearl ridge was a significant gain for australians not only strategically but morally having been put in against a force of roughly equal size consisting of troops who were significantly more experienced than australians whose only previous combat experience had been two years earlier during battle of milne bay long argues that battle highlighted effectiveness of training 25th infantry battalion had undertaken prior to deploying to bougainville james also supports this view stating that mckinna s skilled leadership and aggressive nature had also been a strong factor meanwhile for japanese loss of pearl ridge damaged prestige of 38th mixed independent brigade with japanese commanders ascribing loss to poor support from their artillery and mortars james attributes this to limited infrastructure in area and lack of defensive construction or development undertaken following japanese capture of island in 1942 thumb left australian artillerymen fire a 25 pounder from pearl ridge march 1945 alt gunners load and fire an artillery piece following battle of pearl ridge australians launched a full scale offensive to counter japanese resistance on island focused on southern sector as a result of this decision 7th brigade was moved from central sector to southern sector where majority of japanese forces were located they would subsequently see heavy fighting around slater s knoll in march and april 1945 11th brigade under brigadier john stevenson then took control of both central and northern sectors in order to free up troops for main offensive in south and brigade subsequently cycled its three infantry battalions through position while pursuing a limited advance in north attacking tsimba ridge in january february 1945 after advancing along coast from kuraio mission brigade maintained a battalion group element on pearl ridge during this phase and carried out extensive patrols forward of position while artillery from 4th field regiment was brought up to foot of escarpment from where they could fire on japanese positions under control of forward observers on pearl ridge initially this artillery consisted of a battery of short 25 pounders but it was later replaced by longer range long 25 pounders in an effort to improve australian line of communications in sector engineers from 16th field company later constructed a road using a bulldozer that had to haul itself up ridge via a steel cable that was manhandled up to a point just below ridge over course of eight days a light rail system was also established between barges hill and pearl ridge due to terrain around ridge australians had to allocate a significant amount of resources to bring in supplies to forces later stationed around pearl ridge rate of effort required to bring stores forward was of significant concern to australian corps commander lieutenant general stanley savige to extent that his orders to commander of 11th brigade stipulated no further advances in sector with exception of patrolling to prevent movement of japanese reinforcements towards south and for information gathering purposes these patrols subsequently went out with native police guides exploiting quite deep into jungle over several days over long distances one was even pushed to eastern coast around numa numa plantation and proved quite successful for australians in harassing japanese in area over course of 14 weeks at least 236 japanese were killed by these patrols while australians lost four killed and 19 wounded four japanese were also captured in mid april 23rd brigade under brigadier arnold potts took control of central sector and in june a new offensive was opened in area this lasted through until end of war in august after war 25th infantry battalion was awarded battle honour of pearl ridge for battle this honour
