action of trespass or ejectment at end of his opinion in fletcher v peck 1810 marshall had stated that ejectment could not be obtained against holder of aboriginal title taney court 1836 1864 in marsh

a dispute between states of new york and massachusetts as to a large tract of land of which locus in quo was a part in 1786 that dispute was settled by a cession from massachusetts to new york of government sovereignty and jurisdiction of lands in controversy and by a cession from new york to massachusetts of right of preemption of soil from native indians and all other right or title of new york to same this dispute was resolved on december 16 1786 by treaty of hartford an interstate compact providing that lands would be part of territory of new york but massachusetts would retain pre

to refer to these difficulties raised by indians resulted in a modification of it by a second treaty seneca nation of new york was established in 1848 tonawanda band of seneca indians seceded from seneca nation and achieved independent federal recognition after decision in 1857 prior history thumb right holland land office alt a photo of holland land office facts john blacksmith was a member of tonawanda band of seneca indians and sachem of wolf clan blacksmith had constructed a indian sawmill and yard on his enclosed tract within tonawanda reservation in pembroke genesee county new york circa 1826 blacksmith had not received compensation for value of his improvements sawmill and yard as provided for by 1838 and 1842 treaties blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 411 12 it is enough for purposes of question now before us to know that in may 1842 was agreed that indian title to four different tracts of land known as buffalo cattaraugus allegany and tonawanda reservations was valued at 202 000 that indians should retain occupation and enjoyment of allegany and cattaraugus reservations and they thereby conveyed to ogden and fellows whole of buffalo and tonawanda reservations that indians should be paid consideration for that grant as follows 100 000 should be regarded as value of their title to whole four tracts and 102 000 as value of their improvements on same four tracts and so much of those sums should be paid by ogden and fellows as value of title and improvements on buffalo and tonawanda tracts should bear to value of title and improvements on all tracts such amount to be determined by arbitrators to be chosen as therein mentioned because he forcibly refused to let treaty arbitrators onto his property for survey blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 413 arbitrators were unable to award as to amount to be paid to each individual for his improvements on tonawanda tract for reason that that portion of nation which was in possession of that tract refused to let them perform their duty in this respect and removed them by force from tract when they went there as they did twice for purpose of making their examinations and award ogden land company claimed title to tonawanda reservation by virtue of its right of pre emption consummated by treaties fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 367 blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 411 this right was duly vested in ogden and fellows by proper conveyances from state of massachusetts and they thus became seized of all white man s right over these lands except that of sovereignty which still remains in state of new york indian title however was not yet extinguished and indians were in actual possession of land and before ogden and fellows could enjoy any benefit from this grant from state of massachusetts it was necessary for them to acquire indian right agents of company expelled and dispossessed blacksmith with force of arms fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 367 john blacksmith sued joseph fellows and robert

court held for blacksmith fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 367 blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 413 upon this state of facts jury under charge of court found a verdict for plaintiff on trial below court ruled that defendants had failed to make out any title or right of possession and refused to charge that fellows had made out a title to close in question that fellows at end of two years was entitled to possession notwithstanding omission of arbitrators to award as to amount to be paid to plaintiff as value of his improvements that such failure of arbitrators could not prejudice fellows unless it had been caused by him and that plaintiff as an individual indian could not maintain action supreme court general term new york supreme court general term circuit court denied a new trial holding that payment of appraisal value of improvements determined by arbitrator was a condition precedent to conveyance in treaty blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 413 supreme court at general term denied motion for a new trial on ground that award of arbitrators in full as required by indenture of conveyance and treaty was a condition precedent to grantee s right of possession id at 420 welles j dissenting circuit court decided and ruled generally without passing upon objections separately that defendants had failed to establish any right or title to close in question in defendant fellows court of appeals before new york court of appeals fellows was represented by j c spencer who made three arguments blacksmith v fellows oral arguments 7 n y at 409 11 first he argued that right to bring an action for trespass based on aboriginal title accrued only to an indian nation not an individual indian as spencer noted seneca nation itself was prohibited by law from bringing an action by a private attorney blacksmith v fellows oral arguments 7 n y at 401 citing laws 1841 ch 234 ss 8 2 r s 3d ed 432 laws 1845 p 147 second he argued that fellows title was valid blacksmith v fellows oral arguments 7 n y at 410 defendant fellows had legal title in fee in premises ogden and fellows were owners of preemptive right granted to massachusetts and by virtue of treaty and grant of 1842 they acquired a perfect title to tonawanda reservation it was released and confirmed to them third he argued that seneca s rights under treaty were only enforceable against federal government and did not affect defendant s title as a condition precedent blacksmith v fellows oral arguments 7 n y at 410 distribution of moneys awarded for individual improvements was an arrangement between government of united states and seneca nation with which ogden and fellows had no concern their obligation was discharged by payment of gross sum into treasury nothing in treaty required of individual improvements to be made at same time with other nor that report of it should be made in same instrument court reporter did not publish martindale s responses court of appeals 6 1 sided with blacksmith judge john worth edmonds delivered majority opinion joined by chief judge charles h ruggles and judges addison gardiner freeborn g jewett alexander s johnson and watson judge welles dissented and judge gridley was absent court of appeals held that blacksmith could independently bring claim for trespass for which he need only show a right to possession blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 414 this might be true if action was founded only upon title so it might be true if it was founded upon occupancy in common which we know is usual with indian tribes but this action is not founded upon either basis but upon separate possession of plaintiff bill of exceptions shows that he was alone and separately from all others in possession of locus in quo when trespass was committed and that was enough to enable him to maintain an action for a wrong done to that possession court of appeals also held that fellows title was invalid because payment of compensation was a condition precedent blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 414 15 there is no particular form of words necessary to constitute a condition precedent true test is intention of parties and it is very evident to me that it was intention of parties that occupiers of land should not be compelled to give up possession of them until two conditions had been complied with one that such an award should be obtained and filed in war office and other that value of improvements should be paid to president and consideration for conveyance be paid or secured to satisfaction of secretary of war welles in dissent agreed that blacksmith could individually sue for trespass but disagreed that appraisal was a condition precedent he would have reversed and granted a new trial with costs blacksmith v fellows 7 n y at 418 19 welles j dissenting court of

present at opinion announcement for fellows because he was at home working on opinion in dred scott v sandford which was announced next day armstrong 1990 at 60 taney court had inherited from preceding marshall court voluminous decisions on status of aboriginal title in united states none of those decisions was cited in either opinion dred scott in dicta opined following on aboriginal title situation of blacks was altogether unlike that of indian race latter were situated in territories to which white race claimed ultimate right of dominion but that claim was acknowledged to be subject to right of indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper and neither english nor colonial governments claimed or exercised any dominion over tribe or nation by whom it was occupied nor claimed right to possession of territory until tribe or nation consented to cede it justice john catron concurring in dred scott also noted in dicta that b ecause congress has express power to regulate commerce among indian tribes and to prohibit intercourse with indians that therefore dr emerson s title might be defeated within country ceded by indians to united states as early as 1805

unanimous opinion of court affirming judgment of new york court of appeals effect of treaty court observed neither treaty made any provision as to mode or manner in which removal of indians or surrender of reservations was to take place grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of two reservations or of four as case would have been under first treaty plaintiff in this case was expelled by force and unless this mode of removal can be sustained recovery against defendants for trespass was right and must be affirmed fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 370 court noted that previous removals of indians had been undertaken by federal government according to usage and practice of government by its authority and under its care and fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 370 71 a ny other mode of a forcible removal court argued would not be consistent with peace of country or with duty of government to these dependent people who have been influenced by its counsel and authority to change their habitations fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 371 because treaty had been negotiated with them as a quasi nation possessing some of attributes of an independent people and to be dealt with accordingly court held that unless otherwise expressly stipulated only federal government had authority or power to execute agreement court remarked that senecas were in a state of and hold relation to government as a ward to his guardian nature of that relationship between seneca and federal government was incompatible with seneca being expelled by irregular force and violence or even through intervention of courts of justice thus court held that private beneficiaries of native american treaties could neither expel tribes by force or by a cause of action for ejectment fellows v blacksmith 60 u s at 372 court observed that this interpretation is in accordance with usages and practice of government in providing for removal of indian tribes from their ancient possessions with fitness and propriety of thing itself and with text of treaty court concluded we hold that performance was not a duty that belonged to grantees but for government under treaty validity of treaty court did not accept plaintiffs arguments that treaty was invalid because it was not signed by tribal leaders with authority to cede relevant lands or because signatories were fraudulently induced to sign analogizing to enrolled bill rule only citation of case law in opinion court held that treaty after executed and ratified by proper authorities of government becomes supreme law of land and courts can no more go behind it for purpose of annulling its effect and operation conditions precedent because its aforementioned holdings required affirmance court did not
