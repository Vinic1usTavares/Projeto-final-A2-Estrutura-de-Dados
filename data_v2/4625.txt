bridge from louisville into jeffersonville indiana access to big four bridge is limited to pedestrian and bicycle use a pedestrian ramp on kentucky side was opened on february 7 2013 original approaches that carried rail traffic onto main spans were first removed in 1969 earning big four bridge nickname bridge that goes nowhere george rogers clark memorial bridge downstream which carries u s 31 across river was previously only bridge allowing bicyclists and pedestrians to travel between louisville and neighboring indiana cities of new albany clarksville and jeffersonville in february 2011 kentucky and indiana announced that two states along with city of jeffersonville would allocate 22 million in funding to complete big four bridge project creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link louisville and jeffersonville indiana would spend up to 8 million and city of jeffersonville would provide 2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a ramp to big four bridge kentucky pledged 12 million to replace deck on bridge and connect it to spiral ramp that was completed in waterfront park on february 7 2013 louisville ramp was opened for pedestrian and bicycle traffic initially planned for august 2013 jeffersonville ramp opened on may 20 2014 description big four bridge is a six span bridge totaling long with a clearance of northernmost span is a riveted 8

railway history thumb unissued share of louisville and jeffersonville bridge company thumb photo of big four bridge in baird s history of clark county indiana published in 1909 big four bridge was first conceived in jeffersonville in 1885 by various city interests louisville and jeffersonville bridge company was formed in 1887 to construct big four bridge after a charter by state of indiana kentucky also chartered company in 1888 riverboat industry a big economic factor in jeffersonville had requested that bridge be built further upstream from falls of ohio but united states army corps of engineers approved building site even after vocal protestations construction construction began on october 10 1888 big four bridge would be only louisville bridge with serious accidents during its building thirty seven individuals died during its construction first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson that was supposed to hold back river water flooded drowning workers another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson big four bridge had one of biggest bridge disasters in united states occurring on december 15 1893 when a construction crane was dislodged by a severe wind causing falsework support of a truss to be damaged and truss with forty one workers on it to fall into ohio river twenty of workers survived but twenty one died accident almost cost more lives as a ferry crossing ohio river just barely missed being hit by truss hours later a span next to damaged span also fell into river but was unoccupied at time causing no injuries as a result falsework was reinforced to prevent further occurrences and also to prevent strong winds from causing similar damage by using special bracing on bottom frame of truss also a new rule was enforced never trust a bolted joint any longer than is necessary to put a riveted one in place thumb left belle of louisville crossing under bridge in 2008 great steamboat race big four bridge was finally completed in september 1895 due to various accidents louisville and jeffersonville bridge company was financially strapped after building bridge and later in 1895 sold it to indianapolis based cleveland cincinnati chicago and st louis railway also known as big four railroad this gave railway its first entry into louisville market although railroad would have likely used bridge even if they had not bought it as they desired access to louisville rail operation one effect of opening of big four bridge was increased transportation of freight by rail significantly decreasing number of packet boats that at one time crossed ohio river by dozens on february 19 1904 a baltimore and ohio train accidentally crossed big four bridge due to engineer dick foreman falling asleep and going wrong way at otisco indiana fireman kept shoveling coal and did not pay attention it was conductor that finally noticed error midway across big four bridge wayward train had to back up all way back to otisco on september 12 1905 first interurban crossed big four bridge in january 1918 two interurbans collided on big four bridge killing three and injuring twenty aboard due to increasing weight of rail traffic contracts were finalized in june 1928 to build a bigger big four bridge which opened on june 25 1929 new big four bridge was built on piers of old bridge a novel building process as it sped up time necessary to build new bridge old one served to reinforce new one as it was being built old piers would still be used but falsework was entirely removed during construction big four bridge s usual rail traffic was routed over kentucky indiana terminal bridge interurbans that used big four bridge would instead disembark at sellersburg indiana and have passengers board buses into louisville for duration of big four s reconstruction adjacent highway bridge in 1961 john f kennedy memorial bridge was built to carry i 65 over ohio river because of location of big four bridge and growth of kennedy interchange interchange had to avoid columns that were on approach to bridge causing interchange to have several two lane ramps rather than a single stretch of highway and helped earn nickname spaghetti junction ownership in 1988 oscar arias president of costa rica contacted louisville mayor jerry abramson to inquire about buying bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in costa rica as he believed it would be cheaper to import bridge than build a new one at time city did not actually own bridge and plan never went through post railway use thumb 300px 1975 picture of bridge big four bridge fell into disuse after big four railroad s parent company new york central railroad was merged into penn central in 1968 big four bridge s former traffic was then routed over louisville s fourteenth street bridge by 1969 both approach spans had been removed and sold for scrap as a result big four bridge became first louisville bridge to fall out of use and gained nickname bridge that goes nowhere during 1970s and 1980s local radio station 102 fm lit up big four bridge as part of their bridge gap christmas promotion which was used as a fund raiser for needy local families some of lights spelled out lrs 102 after unsuccessful litigation to stop project big four bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of louisville waterfront park and ongoing revitalization of louisville riverfront this conversion had been proposed and planned since 1990s indiana department of transportation pledged 1 million for project to build a ramp to big four bridge on indiana side on riverside drive and jeffersonville pledged 200 000 early estimates were that indiana ramp would cost 2 8 million but was likely to increase kentucky ramp was expected to cost 4 million ramp foundation is already done fixing big four bridge was expected to cost 3 million and take 18 months only other facility still standing that was owned by cleveland cincinnati chicago and st louis railway is spring street freight house however mayor of jeffersonville tom galligan called for a redesign of entrance ramp to bridge on indiana side stressing that proposed ramp would be unattractive and that building of column on a flood plain would probably not be possible galligan pointed out that neither united states coast guard nor army corps of engineers had approved of planned galligan said he would rather have a ramp that reached over floodwall and ended on mulberry street causing a less severe incline on and off bridge previous plans to access big four bridge included building an elevator plans for bicycling included a suspension ramp that would allow bicyclists to leave big four bridge without dismounting their bikes due to length of time any new downtown bridge would take to be built and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across ohio river when george rogers clark bridge is closed which happens yearly during thunder over louisville bicyclists preferred idea of converting big four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or clark bridge by mid july 2009 work had begun to convert bridge to a pedestrian walkway with approach ramps bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile in february 2013 pedestrians were allowed to access completed bridge from ramp on kentucky side with construction still continuing on indiana ramp indiana ramp opened on may 20 2014 lighting along bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents originally lighting was to be similar to those on kentucky side which has computer controlled lights that can show various colors indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties during thunder over louisville big four bridge sets limit on how close private boats can get to fireworks which are centered three bridges away on george rogers clark memorial bridge waterfront development corporation spent 500 000 in upgrades to louisville waterfront park near bridge which took place from late 2015 to early 2016 improvements included additional landscaping a new path west from ramp and a plaza underneath bridge fires thumb 300px closeup of may 7 2008 fire between its closing as a rail bridge and its reopening as a pedestrian span bridge has seen occasional fires two in 1970s one in 1987 and one in 2008 in 1987 christmas lights posted on bridge to promote a toy drive started fire both jeffersonville and louisville fire departments fought six to eight hours to put out blaze on may 7 2008 bridge caught fire a quarter mile 400 m north of louisville end shortly after noon above ohio river suspected to have started from an electrical problem this fire was more troublesome due to age and condition of bridge wood trusses on bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale due to fire on bridge ten years before louisville fire rescue chief greg frederick decided that firefighters were not to be sent onto bridge a boat from harrods creek fire department was used to put out fire as louisville s fire boat did not have a hose that could reach blaze on bridge it took two and a half hours to control fire navigation lights used for heavy barge traffic were being changed at time of report coast guard shut down river traffic for about a mile around bridge due to falling debris an official
