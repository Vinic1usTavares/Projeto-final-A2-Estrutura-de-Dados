monkey island received generally positive reviews critics praised game s story writing humor voice acting and characterization 1up com described guybrush as telltale s strongest and most expressive character yet game s music and graphics were also lauded complaints focused primarily on perceived erratic quality of game s puzzle design a weak supporting cast in early chapters and game s control system tales of monkey island garnered several industry awards and was telltale s most commercially successful project until back to future game gameplay like its predecessors tales of monkey island

island games tales of monkey island allows players to combine certain items to create new items for instance player can combine a number of voodoo ingredients with a cutlass to produce a magical cutlass game world is explored with a pc keyboard and mouse or wii nunchuk s analog stick contrary to previous telltale adventure games player holds and drags mouse to move guybrush rather than point

escape crossroads of afterlife and thwart lechuck s rise to power development production developed by telltale games under license from lucasarts tales of monkey island marked a first collaboration between two companies telltale games had been founded by former lucasarts employees in wake of 2004 cancellation of sam max freelance police following that event lucasarts appeared to have abandoned adventure game genre while telltale games had considered developing a monkey island game since their inception company s design director dave grossman credited greenlighting of tales of monkey island to correct alignment of interested parties this included then new president of lucasarts darrell rodriguez who helped push for adventure game development within his company mark darin co designer and writer for tales of monkey island attributed revival of interest to rise of digital distribution within video game industry which by reducing financial risk allowed companies such as telltale to develop something different from endless clones of popular games telltale started designing tales of monkey island in late 2008 production commenced early in 2009 thumb left upright series creator ron gilbert was involved in planning project and developing story arc alt a caucasian man with average length brown hair wearing an open casual shirt and a t shirt gestures while making a speech from a podium following hints by telltale games that they would soon announce a major new series tales of monkey island was unveiled at june 2009 electronic entertainment expo its roughly 50 person development team was headed by dave grossman who co designed first two monkey island games escape from monkey island and sam max hit road co designer michael stemmle contributed design and story writing in collaboration with mark darin and sean vanaman series creator ron gilbert was involved in brainstorm sessions for game but did not have a large role in its development however development team asserted that gilbert s thumbprints are all over game tales of monkey island counterparts a lucasarts developed enhanced remake of secret of monkey island on his blog gilbert wrote that he was very excited for both telltale s adaptation and lucasarts reimagining of original game and stated that it s strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of its own while gilbert and grossman were engaged in development of tales of monkey island third co designer of original two games tim schafer was not associated with project grossman said that gilbert s leadership role at hothead games had made procuring his assistance legal wrangling and that including schafer as well would have been too much trouble schafer later said that he was really happy for new game and that project was in good hands under grossman s lead game s limited edition slipcover artwork was painted by sam max creator steve purcell who was responsible for box art of both secret of monkey island and monkey island 2 lechuck s revenge purcell created three different rough covers to present to telltale games though company valued purcell s own opinion on which was best having not been satisfied with elaine s appearance on cover of secret of monkey island purcell was keen to have another attempt to portray character in his artwork final artwork showing guybrush and elaine brandishing on a ship emerging from fog was favored as purcell felt it was appropriately eerie grossman said that game s simultaneous release on windows and wiiware was due to telltale s business model company alternates its game releases between wiiware and xbox live arcade as they want to give wii a little love as well concurrent development of wii version created issues last minute changes to pc version could put an episode over size limit for wiiware games first episode was released for windows on july 7 2009 with wii version following twenty days later telltale distributed game through their own website and later made it available for download from steam and amazon com xbox live was omitted from initial release as both telltale s wallace gromit s grand adventures and lucasarts special edition of secret of monkey island were debuting on system while telltale had not announced plans to port tales of monkey island to mac os they did so on february 11 2010 it was among first games available for newly released mac os steam client a playstation network version was released in june 2010 due to consumer demand generated by game s original announcement a playstation 3 release had not been possible at launch as telltale s game engine was not built to run on platform an ipad enhanced ios port was being developed in 2010 first episode was released on app store in december 2010 and rest of episodes followed on june 23 2011 as a bonus players were offered chance to download first episode for free until july 22 2011 telltale games has not ruled out option of porting game to xbox live and linux however a port for iphone enhanced ios version was developed and first episode was released in november 2011 with four remaining episodes that followed suit in a few months ending with release of chapter 5 on february 23 2012 design thumb right 275px art direction was one area where lucasarts collaborated with telltale lucasarts was keen to promote a version of guybrush that combined character s appearances in monkey island 2 and curse of monkey island while remaining consistent with art style of secret of monkey island special edition lucasarts helped provide feedback and refinements for telltale s artists to achieve this alt several concept images of a man s head with a goatee beard and a ponytail on top row image shows several refinements and changes between initial and final designs while second row contrasts silhouettes of two versions as with telltale s other products tales of monkey island was developed and released in five episodic segments grossman explained that telltale prefers to tell stories this way rather than as continuous narratives that are too long for people to play comfortably however unlike their previous games each episode is not a standalone tale it is a single chapter in a larger plot this allowed telltale to advance story like that of a television series in which character relationships develop in minds of audience over several months each episode is designed to be gratifying on its own with a satisfying conclusion however it then provides a cliffhanger to tantalize player a little more according to grossman tales of monkey island is set after an imaginary monkey island 5 which he views as a blockbuster epic 40 hour gigantic experience like earlier games its story would have followed guybrush s actions in time between escape from monkey island and tales of monkey island beginning of tales of monkey island would have marked its conclusion grossman maintained that both story and gameplay of tales of monkey island were designed to be accessible for newcomers to series and commented that knowledge of characters and their history will add a nostalgic layer to sly references but is by no means necessary stemmle likened game s episodic development to a relay race and development of a full game such as escape from monkey island to a marathon this production method meant that certain aspects such as game s graphics were worked on until release deadline each episode took around four months to complete only a few environmental resources were reused between episodes while telltale games had built previous games such as sam max save world and wallace gromit s grand adventures around one set of locations using protagonists homes and nearby streets consistently in each episode developers forwent such central hubs and comfort zones in tales of monkey island instead having each episode move off to a new primary location only occasionally revisiting past locations however reusable skeletons and animations were developed for supporting cast including generic body types that could be visually altered to suit each character while four of these were created size constraints resulted in only two being included in final game by game s third episode telltale became unsatisfied with this system and began diversifying facial features and providing supporting characters with unique silhouettes and animations thumb left 260px tales of monkey island was first telltale product to dedicate significant resources to cinematography this ship battle scene presented a challenge for developers as it was considered too static lighting and weather effects creating a thunderstorm violent camera movements simulating rough waters and ship collisions and character animation suggesting strong winds were added to present a more engaging scene alt two age of sail ships sail close together in rough waters off coast of a small island in a rainstorm a pirate on closer ship inspects a cannon while an undead pirate on aftcastle of other ship performs a magical ritual on a monkey creating a glowing green circle in air above them a woman is tied up towards front of undead pirate s ship game s artistic direction was developed by former lucasarts members derek sakai and dave bogan both of them had worked on curse of monkey island escape from monkey island and several earlier lucasarts adventure games game s final art direction was an attempt to combine realistic look of first two monkey island games with whimsical stylized graphics of third while those games feature entirely two dimensional graphics and their successor escape from monkey island is largely pre rendered tales of monkey island is rendered in full 3d grossman explained that both telltale s art department and game engine are oriented toward 3d graphics development and that company enjoys benefits 3d offers in areas of animation and cinematography improved capacity for latter resulted in appointment of a cinematic director someone to help designers locate scenes needing more dramatic activity and to assist animators and choreographers in creating it during development necessity of this position was highlighted by a ship battle scene in launch of screaming narwhal which was initially static and unexciting this was remedied by changing time of day from dusk to night adding rain and other weather effects and using camera movement to simulate rough waters regarding puzzle design in tales of monkey island stemmle said that he and his fellow designers when they were younger believed that they needed to stump player however stemmle now considers it a lot better to make players feel smart therefore designers included a hint system to prevent players from becoming stuck grossman explained that telltale s designers would bear in mind how players would mentally progress through puzzles and consider what realisations we expected them to have and whether those expectations are realistic due to a tight development schedule puzzles in first episode were not optimized for game s control system which was re designed late in development initially game was to feature point and click controls as had been used in majority of telltale s previous games however a direct control method similar to one seen in wallace gromit s grand adventures was decided upon after much of first episode had been planned as direct control in that game had been designed for an xbox controller developers reworked idea into a click and drag mouse system for tales of monkey island telltale believed that this control method made for a less passive and more engaging player experience and provided more freedom for cinematic camera work than was possible with point and click aside from providing monkey island license to telltale lucasarts role in game s development involved collaboration and approval of game s script character concept art and puzzle design as remake of secret of monkey island had begun development before tales of monkey island lucasarts shared their art style guide with telltale so that two products art direction would be similar in particular lucasarts wished that character of guybrush would be comparable to appearance of character in special edition lucasarts largely based their vision for guybrush s new visuals in tales of monkey island on how character appeared in curse of monkey island integrating various aspects from lechuck s revenge that commonly resonated through fan art such as character s blue coat and beard in addition to using their own stylized art direction telltale concept artist ryan jones worked closely with lucasarts jeff sengalli on developing appearance of guybrush and other characters sengalli providing feedback and refinement in such areas as character silhouettes facial features and clothing vanaman noted that lucasarts was open to telltale s creative direction for game and did not put their foot down over any aspects of their vision audio thumb right upright voice actor dominic armato was enthusiastic to reprise role of guybrush threepwood alt man with medium length dark brown hair and a beard smiles for a camera man is wearing a gray t shirt with an image of evolution from a monkey to a pirate michael land composer behind preceding monkey island games returned to score tales of monkey island in house telltale composer jared emerson johnson said that his own role in game s music was technical and administrative and that while he had been willing to assist land sound of monkey island universe is all about mike s vision so he was left alone to do his thing as only he can soundtrack was recorded in midi format to reduce data size for wii version for windows version files were converted to wav for increased quality in each episode s production music was among last elements to be finalized as it could not be finished until all cutscenes were properly timed dominic armato voice actor of guybrush from curse of monkey island onward reprises his role as that character lucasarts encouraged telltale to retain as much of original cast as possible particularly armato who was described by lucasarts david collins as ultimate monkey island fanboy armato enjoyed his opportunity to voice guybrush again he had believed that series would never be continued due to length of time since escape from monkey islands release armato voiced character in both tales of monkey island and special edition of secret of monkey island in former game he attempted to make guybrush sound more mature and experienced than his younger incarnation in latter because of armato s understanding of character voice directors gave him considerable flexibility in his performance elaine marley s voice actress in curse of monkey island alexandra boyd was also brought back for her role boyd was unable to travel to telltale s studio in california instead she recorded her lines in london while communicating with voice director via skype however earl boen original voice actor for lechuck had retired from acting and was not initially available to reprise his role character was instead voiced by adam harrington in first episode and replaced by kevin blackton as human lechuck in chapters two to four boen returned to voice demon lechuck at end of fourth episode and stayed on for game s fifth and final chapter telltale later had boen re record lines for lechuck s demon incarnation in first episode for dvd release to make actors portrayals more forceful telltale implemented a lip sync system capable of presenting a large range of facial expressions on character models marketing to promote tales of monkey island telltale games posted a series of fan made flash short films on their website entitled i wonder what happens in tales of monkey island series was created by german animator marius fietzek who co wrote it with andrei constantinescu series artwork was produced by martin koehler presented as a cartoon version of tales of monkey island shorts speculated on game s story and content and depicted hypothetical events for upcoming chapters first episode debuted on july 5 2009 two days before release of launch of screaming narwhal second and third episodes followed on august 6 and september 16 respectively penultimate episode was released on october 22 for final installment released on december 4 fietzek recruited of german hip hop band die vier to do a musical number emerson johnson described series as absolutely fantastic and said that it really seems like these games appeal to people in a way that spurs huge amounts of excellent creative energy he noted that telltale was passing videos around for a good week after they were posted a week after release of first episode telltale held a contest called game designer for a day which gave fans opportunity to submit and vote for a line of dialog to be used as an accusation against guybrush winning line he dug up my perfectly good x was submitted by liz johnston of okanagan british columbia canada and was subsequently added to trial scene in fourth chapter while johnston s name was included in chapter s credits telltale produced tales of monkey island merchandise which they sold from their online store these included a poster print of steve purcell s cover artwork for game and a set of promotional badges latter had previously been available at conventions such as e3 further merchandise including a tankard a set of tarot cards and a deluxe edition dvd was made available in early march 2010 for september 19 2009 international talk like a pirate day telltale games made game s first episode available for free on their website customers who had already purchased all five episodes were instead eligible for a free episode from one of telltale s other series reception sales tales of monkey island was a commercial success and it exceeded telltale s sales projections while no figures for game have been released game was company s most successful project until it was outstripped by back to future game which was released a year and a half later telltale ceo dan conners noted that game had been top selling product on steam for a few days according to telltale s marketing department game was predominately purchased as a full season rather than as individual episodes this was attributed to strong narrative between episodes in contrast to telltale s previous work critical vg series reviews gr no launch of screaming narwhal pc 79 wii 79 siege of spinner cay mc2 pc 77 wii 79 game3 lair of leviathan pc 82 wii 80 trial and execution of guybrush threepwood pc 80 wii 84 rise of pirate god mc5 pc 81 wii 83 critics believed that first chapter launch of screaming narwhal was a respectable start to game ryan scott of gamespy wrote that puzzles generally challenge player just enough without becoming too frustrating while eurogamer s kristan reed stated that their quality was bang on time after time however criticism was directed toward certain puzzles designs particularly toward that of one maze puzzle writing and story were lauded with several reviews commending dialogue s humor adventure gamers staff writer evan dickens felt that writing did not match up to quality of lechuck s revenge however although chapter s supporting cast was considered weak critics enjoyed introduction of de singe to series voicework for main characters was praised as was land s soundtrack critics were mostly complimentary toward episode s graphics with new straits times bruno chan and sunday times david phelan praising updated interpretation of curse of monkey islands art style while 1up com s bob mackey called guybrush most convincingly expressive telltale character yet however concerns were voiced over erratic graphical quality between characters game s controls were subject to reproof by a number of reviews several preferred keyboard controls over telltale s new click and drag system response to siege of spinner cay was similar to that of preceding episode critics were divided over quality of chapter s puzzles destructoid reviewer brad nicholson criticized their design as tight and constricted and dickens felt that they varied wildly in quality in contrast they were praised as pleasantly non linear by reed and called logical and sensible by palgn s adam ghiggino need for extended travel between locations in order to complete mundane tasks was criticized episode s writing was lauded by reviewers particular praise was bestowed on chapter s opening scene which introduces morgan leflay nevertheless story was disparaged by reuben lees of herald sun for feeling more like a bridge to open up further plotlines in later episodes a point echoed by other reviewers while supporting cast was again criticized reviewers enjoyed development of main characters roles critics admired chapter s audio work with dickens calling kevin blackton s rendition of human lechuck a real standout graphical tweaks over launch of screaming narwhal were also appreciated critics considered lair of leviathan to be stronger than previous chapters on review aggregator sites gamerankings and metacritic its windows version holds highest rating out of all tales of monkey island episodes episode s puzzles were commended ign s steve butts opined that telltale s puzzle design had moved forward quite a bit compared to both preceding chapters and their earlier sam max games one puzzle in particular involving pirates holding a face pulling contest was praised by reviewers dickens described chapter s story as strong and advancing and ghiggino felt that it continued fine monkey island tradition of being bizarre hilarious and pretty interesting several reviews drew comparisons to 1883 book adventures of pinocchio due to game s setting inside a giant manatee episode s writing received near unanimous praise and response to supporting cast was much improved over preceding episodes praise centered particularly around murray a demonic disembodied skull criticism of lair of leviathan primarily focused on chapter s brevity and lack of varied locations reviewers were more ambivalent toward fourth episode trial and execution of guybrush threepwood reception of its puzzles was mixed ghiggino described many as frustrating for wrong reasons and dickens while praising several as challenging and creative believed that there were definite misfires butts criticized arbitrary design of several puzzles but noted that they were exactly what we ve come to expect from series nevertheless episode s titular trial sequence was lauded reaction to chapter s plot was mostly positive with eduardo reboucas of game revolution commenting that it moves along at a steady pace and ends with a dramatic bang and suns nick francis praising emotional storylines weaving between some of characters several reviews praised twists in story although adventure classic gaming s mark opined that darker turn late in episode was detrimental to otherwise light hearted series episode s writing was praised as was use of returning monkey island character stan as trial s prosecutor critics were divided over effectiveness of reusing setting of launch of screaming narwhal final episode rise of pirate god was thought by critics to be a fitting end to series response to chapter s puzzles was mostly positive though several reviewers maintained reservations about difficulty and innovation of many of them level design which requires players to backtrack between locations was not well received chapter s climactic battle was thought to be sufficient though timing issues caused gamecritics tera kirk to describe it as almost as frustrating as it is clever nevertheless story received strong praise particularly for role reversal between guybrush and lechuck destructoid s anthony burch noted that chapter completely and intentionally inverts monkey islands own cliches similarly writing and dialogue were commended as was voice acting with critics praising earl boen s reprisal of demon lechuck and armato s work as guybrush reviewers complimented graphics for both ghostly crossroads and fire ravaged real world butts expressed that levels all benefit from great color choices and fantastic lighting effects that really support mood of monkey island received awards
