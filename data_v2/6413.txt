applied it to children s learning of verbs in particular his work with alan prince published in 1989 critiqued connectionist model of how children acquire past tense of english verbs arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding ed to make regular forms sometimes in error but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one pinker is also author of eight books for general

in 2007 interview with point of inquiry podcast pinker states that he would defend atheism as an empirically supported view he sees theism and atheism as competing empirical hypotheses and states that we re learning more and more about what makes us tick including our moral sense without needing assumption of a deity or a soul it s naturally getting crowded out by successive naturalistic explanations research and theory thumb 300px pinker discussing his book enlightenment now at csicon pinker s research on visual cognition begun in collaboration with his thesis adviser stephen kosslyn showed that mental images represent scenes and objects as they appear from a specific vantage point rather than capturing their intrinsic three dimensional structure and thus correspond to neuroscientist david marr s theory of a two and a half dimensional sketch nature of language faculty and its implications for evolution of language he also showed that this level of representation is used in visual attention and in object recognition at least for asymmetrical shapes contrary to marr s theory that recognition uses viewpoint independent representations in psycholinguistics pinker became known early in his career for promoting computational learning theory as a way to understand language acquisition in children he wrote a tutorial review of field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition and a series of experiments on how children acquire passive dative and locative constructions these books were language learnability and language development 1984 in pinker s words ing a theory of how children acquire words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue and learnability and cognition acquisition of argument structure 1989 in pinker s words focus ing on one aspect of this process ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences such as intransitive verbs transitive verbs and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects he then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be processes required for human language retrieving whole words from memory like past form of irregular has written a piece on irregular verbs stating that i like irregular verbs of english all 180 of them because of what they tell us about history of language and human minds that have perpetuated it bring namely brought and using rules to combine parts of words like past form of regular verb walk namely walked in 1988 pinker and alan prince published an influential critique of a connectionist model of acquisition of past tense a textbook problem in language acquisition followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire past tense this included a monograph on children s regularization of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book words and rules ingredients of language pinker argued that language depends on two things associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words and use of rules to manipulate symbols for grammar he presented evidence against connectionism where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory in favour of older alternative theory use of words and rules combined by generative phonology he showed that mistakes made by children indicate use of default rules to add suffixes such as ed for instance and comed for broke and came he argued that this shows that irregular verb forms in english have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually and that children making these errors were predicting regular ed ending in an open ended way by applying a mental rule this rule for combining verb stems and usual suffix can be expressed as d where v is a verb and d is regular ending pinker further argued that since ten most frequently occurring english verbs be have do say make are all irregular while 98 2 of thousand least common verbs are regular there is a massive correlation of frequency and irregularity he explains this by arguing that every irregular form such as took came and got has to be committed to memory by children in each generation or else lost and that common forms are most easily memorized any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead in 1990 pinker with paul bloom published paper natural language and natural selection arguing that human language faculty must have evolved through natural selection pinker s bloom p 1990 natural language and natural selection behavioral and brain sciences 13 4 707 784 article provided arguments for a continuity based view of language evolution contrary to then current discontinuity based theories that see language as suddenly appearing with advent of homo sapiens as a kind of evolutionary accident this discontinuity based view was prominently argued by two of main authorities linguist noam chomsky and stephen jay gould paper became widely cited and created renewed interest in evolutionary prehistory of language and has been credited with shifting central question of debate from did language evolve to how did language evolve article also presaged pinker s argument in language instinct pinker s research includes delving into human nature and what science says about it in his interview on point of inquiry podcast in 2007 he provides following examples of what he considers defensible conclusions of what science says human nature is sexes are not statistically identical their interests and talents form two overlapping distributions any policy that wants to provide equal outcomes for both men and women will have to discriminate against one or other individuals differ in personality and intelligence people favor themselves and their families over an abstraction called society humans are systematically self deceived each one of us thinks of ourselves as more competent and benevolent than we are people crave status and power he informs listeners that one can read more about human nature in his book blank slate pinker also speaks about evolutionary psychology in podcast and believes that this area of science is going to pay off he cites fact that there are many areas of study such as beauty religion play and sexuality that were not studied 15 years ago it is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied popularization of science thumb 200px pinker in 2011 human cognition and natural language pinker s 1994 language instinct was first of several books to combine cognitive science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology it introduces science of language and popularizes noam chomsky s theory that language is an innate faculty of mind with controversial twist that faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language that it needs to be taught that people s grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking sapir whorf hypothesis that language limits kinds of thoughts a person can have and that other great apes can learn languages pinker sees language as unique to humans evolved to solve specific problem of communication among social hunter gatherers he argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized behavior in other species such as a spider s web weaving or a beaver s dam building pinker states in his introduction that his ideas are deeply influenced by chomsky he also lists scientists whom chomsky influenced to open up whole new areas of language study from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics eric george miller roger brown morris halle and alvin liberman brown mentored pinker through his thesis pinker stated that brown s funny and instructive book words and things 1958 was one of inspirations for language instinct reality of pinker s proposed language instinct and related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based has been contested by many linguists one prominent opponent of pinker s view is geoffrey sampson whose 1997 book educating eve language instinct debate has been described as definitive response to pinker s book more at language instinct debate sampson argues that while it may seem attractive to argue nature side of nature versus nurture debate nurture side may better support creativity and nobility of human mind sampson denies there is a language instinct and argues that children can learn language because people can learn anything others have sought a middle ground between pinker s nativism and sampson s culturalism cowley s j 2001 baby bathwater and language instinct debate language sciences 23 1 69 91 assumptions underlying nativist view have also been criticised in jeffrey elman s rethinking innateness a connectionist perspective on development which defends connectionist approach that pinker attacked in his 1996 book impossible minds machine intelligence researcher igor aleksander calls language instinct excellent and argues that pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism accompanied by a strong dislike of standard social sciences model or sssm pinker s term which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture further aleksander writes that while pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly aleksander concludes that while he doesn t support sssm a cultural repository of language just seems easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic state machine to play two other books how mind works 1997 and blank slate 2002 broadly surveyed mind and defended idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are adaptive pinker is an ally of daniel dennett and richard dawkins in many disputes surrounding adaptationism another major theme in pinker s theories is that human cognition works in part by combinatorial symbol manipulation not just associations among sensory features as in many connectionist models on debate around blank slate pinker called thomas sowell s book a conflict of visions wonderful and explained that tragic vision and utopian vision are views of human nature behind right and left wing ideologies in words and rules ingredients of language 1999 pinker argues from his own research that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup respectively and that language can be understood as an interaction between two words and rules is also title of an essay by pinker outlining many of topics discussed in book book from perspective of generative linguistics charles yang in london review of books writes that this book never runs low on hubris or hyperbole book s topic english past tense is in yang s view unglamorous and pinker s attempts at compromise risk being in no man s land between rival theories giving example of german yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes governed by rules and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long words they can t be learnt individually as there are untold numbers of combinations all pinker and are doing is turning over rocks at base of intellectual landslide caused by revolution in stuff of thought 2007 pinker looks at a wide range of issues around way words related to thoughts on one hand and to world outside ourselves on other given his evolutionary perspective a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved how a mind adapted to stone age life could work in modern world many quirks of language are result pinker is critical of theories about evolutionary origins of language that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition he sees language as being tied primarily to capacity for logical reasoning and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a spandrel a feature not adaptive in its own right but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical and thus selected for in how mind works pinker reiterates immanuel kant s view that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio motor cognitive functions pinker compares music to auditory cheesecake stating that as far as biological cause and effect is concerned music is useless this argument has been rejected by daniel levitin and joseph carroll experts in music cognition who argue that music has had an important role in evolution of human cognition l music cognitive function origin and evolution of musical emotions psychology 2011 2 2 i 1999 is music most important thing we ever did music development and evolution preprint html preprint pdf in suk won yi ed music mind and science pp 10 39 seoul seoul national university press in his book this is your brain on music levitin argues that music could provide adaptive advantage through sexual selection social bonding and cognitive development he questions assumption that music is antecedent to language as opposed to its progenitor noting that many species display music like habits that could be seen as precursors to human music levitin daniel 2006 this is your brain on music science of a human obsession new york dutton penguin pinker has also been critical of whole language reading instruction techniques stating in how mind works dominant technique called whole language insight that spoken language is a naturally developing human instinct has been garbled into evolutionarily improbable claim that reading is a naturally developing human instinct in appendix to 2007 reprinted edition of language instinct pinker cited why our children can t read by cognitive psychologist diane mcguinness as his favorite book on subject and noted one raging public debate involving language went unmentioned in language instinct reading wars or dispute over whether children should be explicitly taught to read by decoding sounds of words from their spelling loosely known as phonics or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text rich environment often called whole language i tipped my hand in paragraph in sixth chapter of book which said that language is an instinct but reading is not like most psycholinguists but apparently unlike many school boards i think it s essential for children to be taught to become aware of speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters better angels of our nature thumb upright 1 5 violence in middle ages detail from mars in das c 1475 1480 image is used by pinker in better angels of our nature with comment as illustrations suggest knights did not restrict their killing to other knights pinker steven 2011 better angels of our nature allen lane p66 in better angels of our nature published in 2011 pinker argues that violence including tribal warfare homicide cruel punishments child abuse animal cruelty domestic violence lynching pogroms and international and civil wars has decreased over multiple scales of time and magnitude pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed in his view it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them better angels of our nature he outlines six major historical declines of violence that all have their own socio cultural economic causes pacification process rise of organized systems of government has a correlative relationship with decline in violent deaths as states expand they prevent tribal feuding reducing losses civilizing process consolidation of centralized states and kingdoms throughout europe results in rise of criminal justice and commercial infrastructure organizing previously chaotic systems that could lead to raiding and mass violence humanitarian revolution 18th 20th century abandonment of institutionalized violence by state breaking on wheel burning at stake suggests this is likely due to spike in literacy after invention of printing press thereby allowing proletariat to question conventional wisdom long peace powers of 20th century believed that period of time to be bloodiest in history this led to a largely peaceful 65 year period post world war i and world war ii developed countries have stopped warring against each other and colonially adopted democracy and this has led a massive decline on average of deaths new peace decline in organized conflicts of all kinds since end of cold war rights revolutions reduction of systemic violence at smaller scales against vulnerable populations racial minorities women children homosexuals animals book was welcomed by many critics and reviewers who found its arguments convincing and its synthesis of a large volume of historical evidence compelling it also aroused criticism on a variety of grounds such as whether deaths per capita was an appropriate metric pinker s atheism lack of moral leadership excessive focus on europe though book covers other areas interpretation of historical data questionable methodologies and its image of indigenous people summary at myth of brutal savage english writing style in 21st century in his seventh popular book sense of style thinking person s guide to writing in 21st century 2014 pinker attempts to provide a writing style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today s academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand in a november 2014 episode of point of inquiry podcast host lindsay beyerstein asked pinker how his style guide was different from many guides that already exist his answer he also indicated that 21st century was applicable because language and usage change over time and it has been a long time since william strunk wrote elements
