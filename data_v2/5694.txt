bernard zuel of sydney morning herald stated that timberlake morphs into michael hutchence at his most lizard like according to spence d of ign beat is a throwback from future past of disco s demented dimension song contains a rolling synth bassline and truncated percussion that according to zuel comes across as both alluring and ever so slightly sinister it contains slow breaks that according to jamil ahmad of musicomh wrap this record round you like walking into an exclusive club with a million dollar sound system you know you are going to have one of those nights pace of song changes with its chorus which mikey migo cited as being a bit off setting futuresex lovesound is brimming over with attitude sharp beats and rhythm according to linda mcgee of rte ie song which was described as being suavely portentous by pitchfork media s tim finney was cited as being a mixture between carnal strut of nine inch nails closer and masochistic flutter of junior boys finney said song derives its charm from its lofty aspirations like a familiar lover staging an elaborately exaggerated seduction according to alexis petridis of guardian futuresex lovesound and other opening songs of album are heavily influenced by david bowie s diamond dogs 1974 song sounds horny which can be seen through lines slide a little bit closer to me little girl daddy s on a mission to please chorus of song reminded 411mania s mikey migo of prince s new power generation critical response mikey migo of 411mania wrote that song is a welcomed change from timberlake s past work she stated that song has qualities of prince that i ve never seen anyone muster up before amanda murray of sputnikmusic called song musically and melodically great but criticized its lyrics she wrote that lyrics sound like dialogue of a low rent porn film highlighting lines she s pressed up on me i think she s ready to blow and all i need is a moment alone to give you my tongue and get you out of control according to murray it makes one question exactly what films timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical she concluded that futuresex lovesound establishes a pattern for rest of futuresex lovesounds infectiously catchy and in many cases accomplished pop music marred by retarded lyrics in a review of futuresex lovesounds ben williams of new york cited album s first five tracks including futuresex lovesound as updating early 1980s minneapolis sound tense drum machines high pitched synth and staccato funk bass lines while reviewing album stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic noted that first three songs of album include word sex in their titles as if mere repetition of word will magically conjure a sex vibe when in truth it has opposite effect it makes it seem that justin is singing about it because he s not getting it lucy davies of bbc music stated that it is initially difficult to listen to lyrics of opening tracks and give an objective opinion she wrote that it is like timberlake is trying to find redeemable qualities about some guy who has zero social skills and stares at women on his own from corner of a bar only he seems to have found some similarly unreconstructed creepy friends shouting words of encouragement to his clunky chat up lines like timbaland live performances futuresex lovesound was used as opening song on timberlake s futuresex loveshow in 2007 his
