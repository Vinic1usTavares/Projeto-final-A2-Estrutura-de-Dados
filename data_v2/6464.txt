gabon africa gaboon viper is usually found in rainforests and nearby woodlands mainly at low altitudes but sometimes as high as 1500 m spawls et al 2004 mention a maximum altitude of 2100 m according to broadley and cock 1975 it is generally found in environments that are parallel to those occupied by its close relative b which is normally found in more open country broadley dg cock ev 1975 snakes of rhodesia longman africa salisbury in tanzania this species is found in secondary thickets cashew plantations and in agricultural land under bushes and in thickets in uganda they are found in forests and nearby grasslands they also do well in reclaimed forest areas cacao plantations in west africa and coffee plantations in east africa they have been found in evergreen forests in zambia in zimbabwe they only occur in areas of high rainfall along forested escarpment in east of country in general they may also be found in swamps as well as in still and moving waters they are commonly found in agricultural areas near forests and on roads at night behavior primarily nocturnal gaboon vipers have a reputation for being slow moving and placid they usually hunt by ambush often spending long periods motionless waiting for suitable prey to pass by on other hand they have been known to hunt actively mostly during first six hours of night in kumasi ghana they were regularly killed around some stables in an open area with forest some 500 meters away a sign that they were hunting rats in grassland they are usually very tolerant snakes even when handled and rarely bite or hiss unlike most vipers however bites by bad tempered individuals do occur locomotion is mostly rectilinear in a sluggish walking motion of ventral scales they may writhe from side to side when alarmed but only for short distances ditmars 1933 even described them as being capable of ditmars rl 1933 reptiles of world revised edition new york macmillan company 329 pp 89 plates if threatened they may hiss loudly as a warning doing so in a deep and steady rhythm slightly flattening head at expiration of each breath despite this they are unlikely to strike unless severely provoked however they are one of fastest striking snakes in world so care should be taken in handling them there have been numerous descriptions of their generally unaggressive nature sweeney 1961 wrote they are so docile that they can be handled as freely as any non venomous species although this is absolutely not recommended in lane 1963 ionides explained he would capture specimens by first touching them lightly on top of head with a pair of tongs to test their reactions hissing and anger was rarely displayed so tongs were usually set aside and snakes firmly grasped by neck with one hand and body supported with other as he picked them up and carried them to a box for containment he said snakes hardly ever struggled parry 1975 described how this species has a wider range of eye movement than other snakes along a horizontal plane eye movement can be maintained even if head is rotated up or down to an angle of up to 45deg if head is rotated 360deg one eye will tilt up and other down depending on direction of rotation also if one eye looks forward other looks back as if both are connected to a fixed position on an axis between them in general eyes often flick back and forth in a rapid and jerky manner when asleep there is no eye movement and pupils are strongly contracted pupils dilate suddenly and eye movement resumes when animal wakes up feeding because of their large heavy body size adults have no trouble eating prey as large as fully grown rabbits when prey happens by they strike with very fast precision from any angle once they strike their prey they hang on to it with their large fangs rather than letting it go and waiting for it to die this behaviour is very different from behaviour of other species of vipers these snakes feed on a variety of birds and mammals such as doves many different species of rodents including field mice and rats as well as hares and rabbits there are also reports of more unlikely prey items such as tree monkeys brush tailed porcupine and even small royal antelope neotragus reproduction during peak sexual activity males engage in combat this starts with one male rubbing its chin along back of other second male will then raise its head as high as possible as they both do same necks intertwine when heads are level they turn towards each other and push their bodies intertwine as they switch positions they become oblivious to everything else continuing even after they fall off a surface or into water sometimes they intertwine and squeeze so tightly that their scales stand out from pressure they have also been observed to strike at each other with mouths closed occasionally combatants will tire and break off fight by mutual consent resting for a while before resuming once more event is settled when one of two succeeds in pushing other s head to ground and raising its own by 20 30 cm in captivity combat may occur four or five times a week until courtship and copulation ends gestation takes about seven months which suggests a breeding cycle of two to three years a five year breeding cycle may also be possible usually they give birth in late summer b g gabonica produces 8 43 live young venom thumb a gaboon viper showing its fangs bites from this species are extremely rare due to their unaggressive nature and because their range is limited to rainforest areas due to their sluggishness and unwillingness to move even when approached bites most often occur due to persons accidentally stepping on a gaboon viper but even then in some cases this does not guarantee a bite marais j 2004 a complete guide to snakes of southern africa cape town struik 214 pp however when a bite does occur it should always be considered a serious medical emergency even an average bite from an average sized specimen is potentially fatal antivenom should be administered as soon as possible to save victim s life if not affected limb snake s cytotoxic venom itself is not considered particularly toxic based on tests conducted in mice in mice is 0 8 5 0 mg kg iv 2 0 mg kg ip and 5 0 6 0 mg kg sc brown jh 1973 toxicology and pharmacology of venoms from poisonous snakes springfield illinois charles c thomas 184 pp lcccn 73 229 however venom glands are enormous and each bite produces largest quantities of venom of any venomous snake this is partially due to fact that unlike many african vipers such as puff adder gaboon viper does not release after a bite which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom yield is probably related to body weight as opposed to milking interval brown 1973 gives a venom yield range of 200 1000 mg of dried venom a range of 200 600 mg for specimens 125 155 cm in length has also been reported spawls and branch 1995 state from 5 to 7 ml 450 600 mg of venom may be injected in a single bite a study by marsh and whaler 1984 reported a maximum yield of 9 7 ml of wet venom which translated to 2400 mg of dried venom they attached alligator clip electrodes to angle of open jaw of anesthetized specimens length 133 136 cm girth 23 25 cm weight 1 3 3 4 kg yielding 1 3 7 6 ml mean 4 4 ml of venom two to three electrical bursts within a space of five seconds apart were enough to empty venom glands gaboon vipers used for study were milked between seven and 11 times over a 12 month period during which they remained in good health and potency of their venom remained same based on how sensitive monkeys were to venom whaler 1971 estimated 14 mg of venom would be enough to kill a human being equivalent to 0 06 ml of venom or 1 50 to 1 1000 of what can be obtained in a single milking marsh and whaler 1984 wrote that 35 mg 1 30 of average venom yield would be enough to kill a man of branch 1992 suggested that 90 100 mg would be fatal in humans due to rarity of these type of snakebites further investigation is needed in humans a bite from a gaboon viper causes rapid and conspicuous swelling intense pain severe shock and local blistering other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements defecation urination swelling of tongue and eyelids convulsions and unconsciousness blistering bruising and necrosis may be extensive there may be sudden hypotension heart damage and dyspnoea blood may become with internal bleeding that may lead to and local tissue damage may require surgical excision and possibly amputation to any affected limb healing may be slow and
