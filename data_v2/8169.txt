outside right and his key skills were dribbling passing crossing and shooting a dedicated and extremely fit professional his habit of chewing on a toothpick during games made him instantly

176 goals in 740 league and cup appearances he played for chirk before joining northwich victoria in 1892 his career took off when he signed with manchester city in 1894 and turned professional in

of wrexham he started work at black park colliery as a pit pony driver at age of 12 his family were primitive methodists and meredith himself remained a lifelong teetotaller he spent eight years working in mines and worked during a tough time for industry enduring a 25 pay cut which led to strike action in 1893 this experience helped to shape his political views which would become significant later in his life an interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers elias eldest was a train driver for lancashire and yorkshire railway his work allowed him to take meredith to watch professional teams such as everton football was a keen pastime for miners and standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east wales was high as a result chirk won welsh cup five times between 1887 and 1894 with miners making up a large proportion of team all meredith brothers played football but sam two years older than billy was first to make an impression he left chirk to attempt a professional career and went on to play for stoke city as a full back meredith made his debut for chirk first team in september 1892 club played in combination a league which contained a mixture of town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities at end of his first season meredith played in 1893 welsh cup final which chirk lost 2 1 to wrexham meredith formed a solid understanding with inside right william owen a former wales international chirk withdrew from combination and entered only welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by coal miners strike in an attempt to make ends meet meredith not only played for chirk but accepted an offer to play for football league club northwich victoria as well who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses northwich were a struggling side who withdrew from football league at end of 1893 94 season after finishing bottom of second division club won just three league matches meredith featured in each win back at chirk meredith gained his first honour as part of team that beat westminster rovers to win 1894 welsh cup club career first spell at manchester city meredith s performances for northwich gained attention of several other clubs in football league bolton wanderers full back di jones a former chirk player spoke with him about a possible move but bolton secretary j j bentley felt meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight lawrence furniss an official at ardwick had first noticed him while refereeing a northwich match meredith also played in both meetings between clubs that season later in 1894 ardwick by then known as manchester city vigorously pursued meredith s signature two club officials travelled to wales to meet player one was secretary manager joshua parlby other either furniss or chairman john chapman pair were met with suspicion anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals and were only allowed to speak to meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues meredith did not wish to abandon life in chirk his mother was particularly against idea it is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away our boys are happy and healthy satisfied with their work and innocent amusements if billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished meredith did eventually sign for manchester city but as an amateur he continued to work at pit for at least a year commuting back and forth for matches meredith made his manchester city debut in november 1894 in a 5 4 loss to newcastle united following week he played his first home match for club at hyde road and scored two goals against newton heath who later became manchester united in first manchester derby to take place in league newton heath won match 5 2 he turned professional in january 1895 and ended 1894 95 season with 12 goals in 18 appearances just three strikes behind top scorer pat finnerhan who had played an extra 12 games in his first full season at manchester city meredith finished as top scorer he was appointed club captain in his second season at club aged just 21 club finished as second division runners up in 1895 96 but were denied promotion after heavy defeats to west bromwich albion and small heath in test matches after departure of strike partner pat finnerhan to liverpool in march 1897 meredith remained as city s star player his new partner for 1897 98 season was william smith known as stockport smith to differentiate him from another william smith in team whilst billie gillespie was placed at centre forward meredith provided gillespie with many crosses into box picking up numerous assists as gillespie outscored meredith by 19 goals to 12 meredith also acted as a mentor for slightly younger gillespie steering him away from drinking sessions by taking him along on fishing trips final match of season saw meredith score his first hat trick for club in an emphatic 9 0 win against burton swifts city dominated second division in 1898 99 season and won promotion as champions helping them to keep them in winning ways in close season was late signing jimmy ross a veteran forward who meredith considered to be his favourite hero meredith claimed 30 goals in 35 games including hat tricks against grimsby town loughborough darwen and barnsley meredith scored city s first goal in first division on opening day of 1899 1900 season in a 4 3 defeat to blackburn rovers at ewood park on 2

settled into corner of jack fryer s net athletic news reported that for real brilliance right wing meredith and ross took biscuit first division defences managed to limit meredith s contribution in 1900 01 campaign by singling him out for rough treatment though liverpool manager tom watson felt compelled to write a letter to manchester city denying that a liverpool director had stated that all that opposition had to do was watch meredith rest are no good he finished season with just seven goals in 35 appearances meredith found net eight times in 38 games in 1901 02 campaign as city were

figures took control behind scenes and began to sign promising young scottish players new manager tom maley was more willing than his predecessor to confront meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate city attack city won immediate promotion as second division champions in 1902 03 with meredith scoring 22 goals in 37 appearances and claiming a hat trick against chesterfield town maley managed to find him a suitable inside right partner in jimmy bannister who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed ball through to meredith he also played sammy frost at half back who was able to win ball and bring meredith into play and signed outside left frank booth to balance attack maley encouraged teamwork meaning there was less pressure on meredith from opposition defenders meredith was partnered with george livingstone for 1903 04 campaign who was able to supply him and rest of team with quality passes drawn against a strong sunderland outfit in first round of fa cup meredith was raider in chief as city claimed a 3 2 victory at hyde road city then defeated woolwich arsenal and middlesbrough to reach semi finals there they faced wednesday at goodison park and meredith scored one goal bundled in by gillespie and claimed two assists as city won game 3 1 their opponents in final at crystal palace were mid table second division outfit bolton wanderers and meredith was cautiously optimistic before match stating we ought to win if we play anything like our normal game cup is ours but this is cup final and well anything might happen with just over 20 minutes played livingstone found meredith with a long ball who then beat goalkeeper dai davies to score only goal of game bolton supporters long maintained that meredith had been offside as captain meredith was handed trophy by prime minister arthur balfour he scored nine goals in 36 games in 1904 05 season as city came within two points and two places of champions newcastle united season ended in controversial circumstances at villa park and with a 3 2 defeat to aston villa ending any hopes of winning league sandy turnbull and villa captain alex leake exchanged blows football association launched an investigation into violence and findings shocked sporting world as meredith was suspended for entirety of 1905 06 season for unsuccessfully attempting to bribe alex leake no evidence was taken from meredith who denied charge and evidence was not made public club fearful of fa sanctions refused to pay meredith during campaign he was transfer listed in may 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe leake on orders of manager tom maley and that illegal payments were common practice at hyde road fa acted on his information and fined manchester city ps900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players boardroom members and staff members manchester united thumb right meredith in manchester united colours in may 1906 while still serving his ban meredith moved to manchester united he joined on a free transfer and received a ps500 signing on fee from united manchester city reluctantly accepted transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising meredith a benefit match and he was willing to forego on agreement if club instead granted his transfer he returned from suspension on 1 january 1907 and marked his debut at bank street with an assist for sandy turnbull to score only goal of game against aston villa in addition to turnbull meredith was joined at united by former city teammates jimmy bannister and herbert burgess this new forward line made team into a powerful force as they already possessed a dominant half back line in captain charlie roberts dick duckworth and alex bell they ended 1906 07 season in eighth place in first division manager ernest mangnall signed jimmy turnbull and forward line of meredith bannister jimmy turnbull and sandy turnbull were dominant in 1907 08 campaign united won title

knocking out brighton everton blackburn rovers burnley and newcastle united their cup final opponents at crystal palace were bristol city captained at centre half by billy wedlock england captain and staunch opponent of players union a sandy turnbull goal settled tie which was described as quite a boring game meredith himself dismissed reports of match stating it was a good game for dashing keen thrilling football great goalkeeping and narrow escapes at either end meredith and his teammates celebrated victory with music hall stars such as george robey united finished fifth in 1909 10 and exited fa cup at first round with a defeat to burnley at turf moor however club continued to advance under generous chairmanship of john henry davies and old trafford was opened in february 1910 harold halse was to partner meredith at inside right for 1910 11 season but proved too much of a free spirit and was replaced by jack a plodder who understands what meredith requires a defeat at villa park in penultimate game of season left united needing to beat third place sunderland and hope that aston villa failed to beat liverpool united were a goal down when meredith provided enoch west with a cross which west sent into net for equalising goal four more goals came and they won game 5 1 and left field as champions of england for second time meredith played in 1911 fa charity shield as

new manager john bentley led united to a fourth place finish in 1912 13 he dropped meredith to blood a young jackie sheldon by this time meredith made headlines primarily due to his squabbling with club over them stalling payment of his benefit matches and his dissatisfaction at being dropped club dropped to 14th spot in 1913 14 and only avoided relegation on last day of 1914 15 season after bribing liverpool to lose 2 0 at old trafford meredith this time played no part in resulting bribery scandal he instead claimed to be baffled as to why his teammates refused to pass to him during game during first world war he actually played a match against united making a guest appearance for port vale with vale recording a 5 2 victory at old recreation ground frustrated with club for delaying payments over his benefit match he also played as a guest for manchester city after war ended he demanded a free transfer and was repulsed that club demanded a transfer fee stating that transfer market was a degrading business for players on 7 may 1921 at 46 years 281 days he became united s oldest ever player when he took to field in a league game against derby county return to manchester city in 1921 he returned to manchester city on a free transfer he played 25 first team games in 1921 22 season helping city to record a derby victory over rivals manchester united he featured once in 1922 23 campaign playing club s final game at hyde road he played four fa cup and two first division games in 1923 24 season mangnall now his manager at city shocked manchester when he selected meredith for cup game with brighton hove albion at goldstone ground but was vindicated with a 5 1 victory meredith also scored a goal though this was due to a poor mistake from brighton goalkeeper he played both games against cardiff city in next round a 0 0 draw at maine road and 1 0 win at ninian park and claimed an assist in goal that settled tie his last match was against newcastle united in semi finals at age of 49 years and 245 days making him city s oldest ever player game ended in a 2 1 defeat international career meredith won his first cap for wales in a 2 2 draw with ireland on 16 march 1895 in belfast he won 12 caps in 1890s but was forced to miss six games as his club would not let him play in games that clashed with league fixtures wales could compete with ireland but were regularly beaten by scotland and england on 26 march 1900 wales played for first time in south wales at cardiff arms park and meredith scored a goal to earn welsh a celebrated 1 1 draw with england after serving his suspension he returned to wales for british home championship title victory in 1907 nation s first success in competition in those three games he scored against ireland in a 3 2 victory and captained wales to a 1 0 win over scotland and a 1 1 draw with england wales were denied a late penalty against english and meredith was later recorded to have said never mind little wales will win some day against england may i be there at death after draws with ireland and scotland meredith wept unashamedly as he helped wales to beat england 2 1 at highbury to claim 1920 british home championship it was only his second victory against english in 20 attempts and it marked last of his 48 caps though his record number of caps was later surpassed at 45 years and 229 days he remains oldest player to win a wales cap he was actually chosen by selectors for 71 consecutive matches but only made 48 appearances as his clubs regularly refused to release him for international duty style of play meredith was able to avoid injury throughout his career despite extremely physical nature of game during period this was due in part to his extraordinary balance and agility which allowed him to avoid clumsy challenges and toughness he had built up from spending his adolescence working in mines a model professional he spent his spare time improving his game with extra training sessions and maintained peak physical fitness by avoiding alcohol and tobacco his gimmick was to chew on a toothpick during matches and this unusual trait was picked up on by cartoonists of time writing a 1947 critique of stanley matthews meredith criticised lack of direct play on show in 1940s and stated that when he was playing that i knew what was expected of me to beat wing half and full back take ball down to corner flag and centre his ball control skills were unparalleled leaving opposition players unable to tackle him he also was an extremely accurate passer and crosser of ball his dribbling and crossing gave him a large advantage over rival wingers who relied solely on speed to beat opposition full backs in addition to wing play he was also highly skilled at sending in long range shots across face of goal and could be relied upon to meet crosses from his left winger with a powerful volley meredith had to deal with extremely physical defences and was often boxed into corner of pitch by as many as four players as his talents became widely regarded more well organised defences would designate him with a man marker to try and isolate him from his teammates this often left him reliant on an unselfish inside right partner willing to fetch and carry ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return a hard working wing half would also improve meredith s effectiveness by winning ball and sending him a pass down flank best teams he played in also had a centre forward able to make most of his accurate crosses players union meredith organised first meeting of players union pu in december 1907 meredith had previously been involved with association footballers union afu first attempt by football players in england to organise a trade union players union like afu before it sought relaxation of restrictions on transfers and wages others made argument that a free market wage structure would ruin amateur principles sport was founded on but meredith felt that these words rang hollow considering that club directors and shareholders made vast profits at first annual meeting in december 1908 pu stated their aims as to allow unlimited wages right to transfer from club to club and for players to take a percentage of any transfer fee with union threatening strike action particularly at international matches in april 1909 football association insisted that all players agree to leave union and pledge loyalty to fa manchester united refused to issue revised contracts to its players and fa suspended entire squad club then refused to pay players in lieu of their suspension and so players instead took away ornaments from club s office before mangnall persuaded them to return items players continued to train and captain charlie roberts came up with name of outcasts f c fa organised a meeting of 200 players excluding outcasts but a rambling speech from chairman charles clegg failed to win them over and an agreement was reached where pu would be recognised by fa in october 1909 union balloted its members over organisation s membership of general federation of trade unions result of vote a decisive no to support effectively supported fa s position that professional footballers were fundamentally different from workmen in other industries meredith resumed league football in november 1909 bemoaning his view that many players refuse to take things seriously and continue to live a kind of schoolboy life personal life and legacy he married ellen negus in 1901 and couple had two daughters he was a supporter of liberal party he ran businesses throughout his career with little success and was declared bankrupt in july 1909 after his outfitting shop was damaged by fire during 1910s he ran a public house despite being
