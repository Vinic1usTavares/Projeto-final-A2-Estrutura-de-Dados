1924 cuba hurricane is earliest officially classified category 5 atlantic hurricane on saffir simpson scale sshs and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on cuba at category 5 intensity other being hurricane irma in 2017 both are also tied for strongest cuban landfall in terms of maximum sustained winds hurricane formed on october 14 in western caribbean slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward by october 16 storm attained hurricane status to east of yucatan peninsula and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop on october 18 hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and on next day reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph 270 km h shortly thereafter it struck extreme western cuba at peak intensity becoming strongest hurricane on record to hit country later hurricane weakened greatly striking southwestern florida with winds of 90 mph 150 km h in a sparsely populated region while crossing state it weakened to tropical storm status and after accelerating east northeastward it was absorbed by a cold front on october 23 to south of bermuda across western caribbean sea developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds strong winds in western cuba caused severe damage with two small towns nearly destroyed about 90 people were killed in country all in pinar del rio province later hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern florida which caused flooding and crop damage damage was light in state and there were no casualties meteorological history on october 14 a tropical depression was first observed over western caribbean sea just off eastern honduras coast it was a large and weak tropical cyclone moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying on october 15 it is estimated depression attained tropical storm status and its strengthening became more steady next day storm reached hurricane status about 130 mi 215 km southeast of cozumel quintana roo around that time it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off east coast of yucatan peninsula by october 18 hurricane completed loop during which its winds increased to 115 mph 185 km h this is equivalent of a major hurricane or a category 3 on saffir simpson hurricane scale estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations beginning late on october 18 as system tracked north northeastward toward cuba hurricane underwent rapid deepening evidenced by a ship wind report of 120 mph 193 km h this wind report was initially thought to be peak intensity of cyclone however subsequent research confirmed further deepening based on very low pressures recorded across region a ship in radius of maximum winds reported a reading of 922 mbar barometer on ship was found to be 5 mbar too high resulting in a pressure of 917 mbar additionally a station on land reported a pressure of 932 mbar 27 52 inhg based on readings hurricane research division estimated hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 910 mbar very near western coast of cuba this suggested peak winds of 165 mph 270 km h late on october 19 hurricane made landfall in extreme western cuba in pinar del rio province jose carlos millas director of national observatory at havana believed that this hurricane was one of most severe ever experienced in our latitudes after exiting cuba into gulf of mexico hurricane weakened greatly on october 20 it passed a short distance west of key west florida and very early on october 21 hurricane moved over marco island with winds of 90 mph 150 km h cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through state deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over miami it then accelerated east northeastward moving over abaco islands in bahamas gradually weakening storm began interacting with an approaching cold front late on october 23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was absorbed by front shortly thereafter impact and records as a developing tropical cyclone storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in swan islands off coast of honduras heavy rainfall occurred throughout jamaica causing street flooding and several mudslides but little damage no disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel storm brushed eastern belize while located off coast producing 3 62 inches 21 9 mm of rainfall and light winds in extreme western cuba damage was very severe from strong winds likened to impact of a tornado severe damage was reported in los arroyos and arroyos de mantua in latter location around a dozen people were killed 50 were injured and nearly every building in town was severely damaged heavy losses also occurred to tobacco crop across western pinar del rio province hurricane destroyed all communication links further from center capital city of havana recorded southerly winds of 72 mph 116 km h as well as a minimum pressure of about 999 mbar 29 50 inhg around country hurricane capsized several ships primarily fishing vessels death toll in country was estimated at around 90 in days after storm cuban president zayas authorized about 30 000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in pinar del rio several days prior to striking florida outer circulation began producing rainfall across state storm warnings were issued along east and west coastlines northward to cedar key and titusville later hurricane warnings were issued for much of same area and schools in tampa area were closed as storm was expected to move ashore hurricane first affected florida when it passed west of key west where sustained winds of 66 mph 107 km h along with gusts to 74 mph 120 km h were reported little damage occurred in region limited to downed trees this was due to advance warning by u s weather bureau which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property later hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern florida damage was reported in fort myers and punta gorda and communications were temporarily cut although no deaths were reported heavy rainfall was reported along its path and one location accumulated 23 22 inches 590 mm in a 24 hour period this established a new one day rainfall record in state a station in miami recorded 12 18 inches 309 mm and wind gusts in area approached hurricane force combination of winds and rain damaged 5 of local citrus and avocado crop rainfall flooded streets homes and commercial buildings in miami area and hundreds of people were left without telephone access no impact was reported in bahamas after a reanalysis of hurricanes between 1921 and 1925 national hurricane centers atlantic reanalysis project determined that this hurricane attained maximum sustained winds of 165 mph 270 km h making it a category 5 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale hurricane is earliest known to have attained intensity besting 1928 okeechobee hurricane which was previously thought to be earliest storm of this intensity it is also one of only two on record to make landfall in cuba at category 5 status with other being hurricane irma of 2017 which also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph 270 km h a hurricane in 1846 that hit country was also thought to have struck at category 5 status although storm existed prior to start of atlantic hurricane database when steamship toledo recorded an atmospheric pressure of 922 mbar 27 22 inhg in storm it was lowest pressure recorded in an atlantic hurricane breaking previous record of 924 mbar 27 28 inhg in atlantic hurricane of 1853 record during this storm lasted until 1932 cuba hurricane when a minimum pressure of 915 mbar 27 02 inhg was reported reading of 932 mbar 27 52 inhg at los arroyos in mantua pinar del rio remains lowest pressure recorded on land in cuba see also list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes list of florida
