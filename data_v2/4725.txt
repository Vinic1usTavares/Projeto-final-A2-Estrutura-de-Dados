in historiography western roman empire refers to western provinces of roman empire at any time during which they were administered by a separate independent imperial court in particular this term is used to describe period from 395 to 476 where there were separate courts dividing governance of empire in western and eastern provinces with a distinct imperial succession in separate courts terms western roman empire and eastern roman empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were de facto independent contemporary romans did not consider empire to have been split into two separate empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two separate imperial courts as an administrative expediency western roman empire collapsed in 476 and western imperial court was formally dissolved in 480 eastern imperial court survived until 1453 though empire had seen periods with more than one emperor ruling jointly before view that it was impossible for a single emperor to govern entire empire was institutionalised to reforms to roman law by emperor diocletian following disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of crisis of third century he introduced system of tetrarchy in 286 with two separate senior emperors titled augustus one in east and one in west each with an appointed caesar junior emperor and designated successor though system would collapse in a matter of years east west administrative division would endure in one form or another over coming centuries as such western roman empire would exist intermittently in several periods between 3rd and 5th centuries some emperors such as constantine i and theodosius i governed as sole augustus across roman empire on death of theodosius i in 395 he divided empire between his two sons with honorius as his successor in west governing from mediolanum and arcadius as his successor in east governing from constantinople in 476 after battle of ravenna roman army in west suffered defeat at hands of odoacer and his germanic foederati odoacer forced deposition of emperor romulus augustulus and became first king of italy in 480 following assassination of previous western emperor julius nepos eastern emperor zeno dissolved western court and proclaimed himself sole emperor of roman empire date of 476 was popularized by 18th century british historian edward gibbon as a demarcating event for end of western empire and is sometimes used to mark transition from antiquity to middle ages odoacer s italy and other barbarian kingdoms many of them representing former western roman allies that had been granted lands in return for military assistance would maintain a pretence of roman continuity through continued use of old roman administrative systems and nominal subservience to eastern roman court in 6th century emperor justinian i re imposed direct imperial rule on large parts of former western roman empire including prosperous regions of north africa ancient roman heartland of italy and parts of hispania political instability in eastern heartlands combined with foreign invasions and religious differences made efforts to retain control of these territories difficult and they were gradually lost for good though eastern empire retained territories in south of italy until eleventh century influence that empire had over western europe had diminished significantly papal coronation of frankish king charlemagne as roman emperor in 800 marked a new imperial line that would evolve into holy roman empire which presented a revival of imperial title in western europe but was in no meaningful sense an extension of roman traditions or institutions great schism of 1054 between churches of rome and constantinople further diminished any authority emperor in constantinople could hope to exert in west background as roman republic expanded it reached a point where central government in rome could not effectively rule distant provinces communications and transportation were especially problematic given vast extent of empire news of invasion revolt natural disasters or epidemic outbreak was carried by ship or mounted postal service often requiring much time to reach rome and for rome s orders to be returned and acted upon therefore provincial governors had de facto autonomy in name of roman republic governors had several duties including command of armies handling taxes of province and serving as province s chief judges prior to establishment of empire territories of roman republic had been divided in 43 bc among members of second triumvirate mark antony octavian and marcus aemilius lepidus antony received provinces in east achaea macedonia and epirus roughly modern greece albania and coast of croatia bithynia pontus and asia roughly modern turkey syria cyprus and cyrenaica these lands had previously been conquered by alexander great thus much of aristocracy was of greek origin whole region especially major cities had been largely assimilated into greek culture greek often serving as lingua franca thumb upright 1 15 left roman republic before conquests of octavian octavian obtained roman provinces of west italia modern italy gaul modern france gallia belgica parts of modern belgium netherlands and luxembourg and hispania modern spain and portugal these lands also included greek and carthaginian colonies in coastal areas though celtic tribes such as gauls and were culturally dominant lepidus received minor province of africa roughly modern tunisia octavian soon took africa from lepidus while adding sicilia modern sicily to his holdings upon defeat of mark antony a victorious octavian controlled a united roman empire empire featured many distinct cultures all experienced a gradual romanization while predominantly greek culture of east and predominantly latin culture of west functioned effectively as an integrated whole political and military developments would ultimately realign empire along those cultural and linguistic lines more often than not greek and latin practices and to some extent languages themselves would be combined in fields such as history e g those by cato elder philosophy and rhetoric rebellions and political developments minor rebellions and uprisings were fairly common events throughout empire conquered tribes or oppressed cities would revolt and legions would be detached to crush rebellion while this process was simple in peacetime it could be considerably more complicated in wartime in a full blown military campaign legions were far more numerous as for example those led by vespasian in great jewish revolt to ensure a commander s loyalty a pragmatic emperor might hold some members of general s family hostage to this end nero effectively held domitian and quintus petillius cerialis governor of ostia who were respectively younger son and brother in law of vespasian nero s rule was ended by a revolt of praetorian guard who had been bribed in name of galba praetorian guard a figurative sword of damocles was often perceived as being of dubious loyalty primarily due its role in court intrigues and in overthrowing several emperors including pertinax and aurelian following their example legions at borders increasingly participated in civil wars for instance legions stationed in egypt and eastern provinces would see significant participation in civil war of 218 between emperor macrinus and elagabalus as empire expanded two key frontiers revealed themselves in west behind rivers rhine and danube germanic tribes were an important enemy augustus first emperor had tried to conquer them but had pulled back after disastrous battle of teutoburg forest whilst germanic tribes were formidable foes parthian empire in east presented greatest threat to empire parthians were too remote and powerful to be conquered and there was a constant parthian threat of invasion parthians repelled several roman invasions and even after successful wars of conquest such as those implemented by trajan or septimius severus conquered territories were forsaken in attempts to ensure a lasting peace with parthians parthian empire would be succeeded by sasanian empire which continued hostilities with roman empire controlling western border of rome was reasonably easy because it was relatively close to rome itself and also because of disunity among germans however controlling both frontiers simultaneously during wartime was difficult if emperor was near border in east chances were high that an ambitious general would rebel in west and vice versa this wartime opportunism plagued many ruling emperors and indeed paved road to power for several future emperors by time of crisis of third century usurpation became a common method of succession philip arab trebonianus gallus and aemilianus were all usurping generals turned emperors whose rule would end with usurpation by another powerful general crisis of third century thumb upright 1 15 roman gallic and palmyrene empires in 271 ad leftwith assassination of emperor alexander severus on 18 march 235 roman empire sank into a 50 year period of civil war now known as crisis of third century rise of bellicose sasanian empire in place of parthia posed a major threat to rome in east as demonstrated by shapur i s capture of emperor valerian in 259 valerian s eldest son and heir apparent gallienus succeeded him and took up fight on eastern frontier gallienus son saloninus and praetorian prefect silvanus were residing in colonia agrippina modern cologne to solidify loyalty of local legions nevertheless marcus postumus local governor of german his assault on colonia agrippina resulted in deaths of saloninus and prefect in confusion that followed an independent state known in modern historiography as gallic empire emerged its capital was augusta modern trier and it quickly expanded its control over german and gaulish provinces all of hispania and britannia it had its own senate and a partial list of its consuls still survives it maintained roman religion language and culture and was far more concerned with fighting germanic tribes fending off germanic incursions and restoring security gallic provinces had enjoyed in past than in challenging roman central government however in reign of claudius gothicus 268 to 270 large expanses of gallic empire were restored to roman rule at roughly same time several eastern provinces seceded to form palmyrene empire under rule of queen zenobia in 272 emperor aurelian finally managed to reclaim palmyra and its territory for empire with east secure his attention turned to west invading gallic empire a year later aurelian decisively defeated tetricus i in battle of chalons and soon captured tetricus and his son tetricus ii both zenobia and were pardoned although they were first paraded in a triumph history tetrarchy thumb upright 1 05 organization of empire under tetrarchy diocletian was first emperor to divide roman empire into a tetrarchy in 286 he elevated maximian to rank of augustus emperor and gave him control of western empire while he himself ruled east in 293 galerius and constantius chlorus were appointed as their subordinates caesars creating first tetrarchy this system effectively divided empire into four major regions as a way to avoid civil unrest that had marked 3rd century in west maximian made mediolanum now milan his capital and constantius made trier his in east galerius made his capital sirmium and diocletian made nicomedia his on 1 may 305 diocletian and maximian abdicated replaced by galerius and constantius who appointed maximinus ii and valerius severus respectively as their caesars creating second tetrarchy tetrarchy collapsed after unexpected death of constantius in 306 his son constantine great was declared western emperor by british legions but several other claimants arose and attempted to seize western empire in 308 galerius held a meeting at carnuntum where he revived tetrarchy by dividing western empire between constantine and licinius however constantine was more interested in conquering whole empire than he was in stability of tetrarchy and by 314 began to compete against licinius constantine defeated licinius in 324 at battle of chrysopolis where licinius was taken prisoner and later murdered after constantine unified empire he refounded city of byzantium in modern day turkey as nova roma new rome later called constantinople and made it capital of roman empire tetrarchy was ended although concept of physically splitting roman empire between two emperors remained although several powerful emperors unified both parts of empire this generally reverted in an empire divided into east and west upon their deaths such as happened after deaths of constantine and theodosius i further divisions thumb upright 1 15 division of roman empire among caesars appointed by constantine i from west to east territories of constantine ii constans i dalmatius and constantius ii after death of constantine i may 337 this was formal division of empire until dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between constans and constantius left roman empire was under rule of a single emperor but with death of constantine in 337 empire was partitioned between his surviving male heirs constantius his third son and second by his wife fausta maximian s daughter received eastern provinces including constantinople thrace asia minor syria egypt and cyrenaica constantine ii received britannia gaul hispania and mauretania and constans initially under supervision of constantine ii received italy africa illyricum pannonia macedonia and achaea provinces of thrace achaea and macedonia were shortly controlled by dalmatius nephew of constantine i and a caesar not an augustus until his murder by his own soldiers in 337 west was unified in 340 under constans who was assassinated in 350 under order of usurper magnentius after magnentius lost battle of major and committed suicide a complete reunification of whole empire occurred under constantius in 353 constantius ii focused most of his power in east under his rule city of byzantium only recently re founded as constantinople was fully developed as a capital at constantinople political economic and military control of eastern empire s resources would remain safe for centuries to come city was well fortified and located at crossroads of several major trade and military routes site had been acknowledged for its strategic importance already by emperors septimius severus and caracalla more than a century prior in 361 constantius ii became ill and died and constantius chlorus grandson julian who had served as constantius ii s caesar assumed power julian was killed in 363 in battle of samarra against persian empire and was succeeded by jovian who ruled for only nine months following death of jovian valentinian i emerged as emperor in 364 he immediately divided empire once again giving eastern half to his brother valens stability was not achieved for long in either half as conflicts with outside forces barbarian tribes intensified in 376 visigoths fleeing before ostrogoths who in turn were fleeing before huns were allowed to cross river danube and settle in balkans by eastern government mistreatment caused a full scale rebellion and in 378 they inflicted a crippling defeat on eastern roman field army in battle of adrianople in which emperor valens also died defeat at adrianople was shocking to romans and forced them to negotiate with and settle visigoths within borders of empire where they would become semi independent foederati under their own leaders right thumb upright 1 15 division of empire after death of theodosius i 395 ad superimposed on modern borders more than in east there was also opposition to christianizing policy of emperors in western part of empire in 379 valentinian i s son and successor gratian declined to wear mantle of pontifex maximus and in 382 he rescinded rights of pagan priests and removed altar of victory from roman curia a decision which caused dissatisfaction among traditionally pagan aristocracy of rome theodosius i later decreed edict of thessalonica which banned all religions except christianity political situation was unstable in 383 a powerful and popular general named magnus maximus seized power in west and forced gratian s half brother valentinian ii to flee to east for aid in a destructive civil war eastern emperor theodosius i restored him to power in 392 frankish and pagan magister militum arbogast assassinated valentinian ii and proclaimed an obscure senator named eugenius as emperor in 394 forces of two halves of empire again clashed with great loss of life again theodosius i won and he briefly ruled a united empire until his death in 395 he was last emperor to rule both parts of roman empire before west fragmented and collapsed theodosius i s older son arcadius inherited eastern half while younger honorius got western half both were still minors and neither was capable of ruling effectively honorius was placed under tutelage of half roman half barbarian magister militum flavius stilicho while rufinus became power behind throne in east rufinus and stilicho were rivals and their disagreements would be exploited by gothic leader alaric i who again rebelled in 408 following massacre by roman legions of thousands of barbarian families who were trying to assimilate into roman empire neither half of empire could raise forces sufficient even to subdue alaric s men and both tried to use alaric against other half alaric himself tried to establish a long term territorial and official base but was never able to do so stilicho tried to defend italy and bring invading goths under control but to do so he stripped rhine frontier of troops and vandals alans and suevi invaded gaul in large numbers in 406 stilicho became a victim of court intrigues and was killed in 408 while east began a slow recovery and consolidation west began to collapse entirely alaric s men sacked rome in 410 reign of honorius left thumb solidus of emperor honorius honorius younger son of theodosius i was declared augustus and as such co emperor with his father on january 23 in 393 upon death of theodosius honorius inherited throne of west at age of ten whilst his older brother arcadius inherited east western capital was initially mediolanum as it had been during previous divisions but it was moved to ravenna in 402 upon entry of visigothic king alaric i into italy ravenna protected by abundant marshes and strong fortifications was far easier to defend and had easy access to imperial fleet of eastern empire but made it more difficult for roman military to defend central parts of italy from regular barbarian incursions ravenna would remain western capital 74 years until deposition of romulus augustulus and would later be capital of both ostrogothic kingdom and exarchate of ravenna despite moved capital economic power remained focused on rome and its rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of italy and africa in particular after emperor gallienus had banned senators from army commands in mid 3rd century senatorial elite lost all experience of and interest in military life in early 5th century wealthy landowning elite of roman senate largely barred its tenants from military service but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend entire western empire west s most important military area had been northern gaul and rhine frontier in 4th century when trier frequently served as a military capital of sorts for empire many leading western generals were barbarians reign of honorius was even by western roman standards chaotic and plagued by both internal and external struggles visigothic foederati under alaric magister militum in illyricum rebelled in 395 gildo comes africae and magister utriusque militiae per rebelled in 397 and initiated war stilicho managed to subdue gildo but was campaigning in raetia when visigoths entered italy in 402 stilicho hurrying back to aid in defending italy summoned legions in gaul and britain with which he managed to defeat alaric twice before agreeing to allow him to retreat back to illyria thumb barbarian invasions and invasion of usurper constantine iii in western roman empire during reign of honorius 407 409 weakening of frontiers in britain and gaul had dire consequences for empire as imperial government was not providing military protection northern provinces expected and needed numerous usurpers arose in britain including marcus 406 407 gratian 407 and constantine iii who invaded gaul in 407 britain was effectively abandoned by empire by 410 due to lack of resources and need to look after more important frontiers weakening of rhine frontier allowed multiple barbarian tribes including vandals alans and suebi to cross river and enter roman territory in 406 honorius was convinced by minister olympius that stilicho was conspiring to overthrow him and so arrested and executed stilicho in 408 olympius headed a conspiracy that successfully orchestrated deaths of key individuals related to faction of stilicho including his son and families of many of his federated troops this led many of soldiers to instead join with alaric who returned to italy in 409 and met little opposition despite attempts by honorius to reach a settlement and six legions of eastern roman soldiers sent to support him negotiations between alaric and honorius broke down in 410 and alaric sacked city of rome though sack was relatively mild and rome was no longer capital of even western empire event shocked people across both halves of empire as this was first time rome viewed at least as symbolic heart of empire had fallen to a foreign enemy since gallic invasions of 4th century bc eastern roman emperor theodosius ii successor of arcadius declared three days of mourning in constantinople without stilicho and following sack of rome honorius reign grew more chaotic usurper constantine iii had stripped roman britain of its defenses when he crossed over to gaul in 407 leaving romanized population subject to invasions first by picts and then by saxons angli and jutes who began to settle permanently from about 440 onwards after honorius accepted constantine as co emperor constantine s general in hispania gerontius proclaimed maximus as emperor with aid of general constantius honorius successfully defeated gerontius and maximus in 411 and shortly thereafter captured and executed constantine iii with constantius back in italy gallo roman senator jovinus revolted after proclaiming himself emperor with support of gallic nobility and barbarian burgundians and alans honorius turned to visigoths under king athaulf for support athaulf defeated and executed jovinus and his proclaimed co emperor sebastianus in 413 around same time as another usurper arose in africa heraclianus heraclianus attempted to invade italy but failed and retreated to carthage where he was killed with roman legions withdrawn northern gaul became increasingly subject to frankish influence franks naturally adopting a leading role in region in 418 honorius granted southwestern gaul gallia aquitania to visigoths as a vassal federation honorius removed local imperial governors leaving visigoths and provincial roman inhabitants to conduct their own affairs as such first of barbarian kingdoms visigothic kingdom was formed escalating barbarian conflicts thumb upright 1 15 germanic and hunnic invasions of roman empire 100 500 ad left honorius death in 423 was followed by turmoil until eastern roman government installed valentinian iii as western emperor in ravenna by force of arms with galla placidia acting as regent during her son s minority theodosius ii eastern emperor had hesitated to announce death of honorius and in ensuing interregnum joannes was nominated as western emperor joannes rule was short and forces of east defeated and executed him in 425 thumb upright 0 75 stone carved relief depicting

aetius rose to rank of magister militum aetius was able to stabilize western empire s military situation somewhat relying heavily on his hunnic allies with their help aetius undertook extensive campaigns in gaul defeating visigoths in 437 and 438 but suffering a defeat himself in 439 ending conflict in a status quo ante with a treaty meanwhile pressure from visigoths and a rebellion by bonifacius governor of africa induced vandals under king gaiseric to cross from spain to tingitana in what is now morocco in 429 they temporarily halted in numidia in 435 before moving eastward with aetius occupied in gaul western roman government could do nothing to prevent vandals conquering wealthy african provinces culminating in fall of carthage on 439 and establishment of vandal kingdom by 400s italy and rome itself were dependent on taxes and foodstuffs from these provinces leading to an economic crisis with vandal fleets becoming an increasing danger to roman sea trade and coasts and islands of western and central mediterranean aetius coordinated a counterattack against vandals in 440 organizing a large army in sicily however plans for retaking africa had to be abandoned due to immediate need to combat invading huns who in 444 were united under their ambitious king attila turning against their former ally huns became a formidable threat to empire aetius transferred his forces to danube though attila concentrated on raiding eastern roman provinces in balkans providing temporary relief to western empire in 449 attila received a message from valentinian iii s sister offering him half western empire if he would rescue her from an unwanted marriage that her brother was forcing her into with a pretext to invade west attila secured peace with eastern court and crossed rhine in early 451 with attila wreaking havoc in gaul aetius gathered a coalition of roman and germanic forces including visigoths and burgundians and prevented huns from taking city of forcing them into retreat at battle of plains roman germanic coalition met and defeated hunnic forces though attila escaped attila regrouped and invaded italy in 452 with aetius not having enough forces to attack him road to rome was open valentinian sent pope leo i and two leading senators to negotiate with attila this embassy combined with a plague among attila s troops threat of famine and news that eastern emperor marcian had launched an attack on hun homelands along danube forced attila to turn back and leave italy when attila died unexpectedly in 453 power struggle that erupted between his sons ended threat posed by huns internal unrest and majorian thumb western roman empire during reign of majorian in 460 ad during his four year long reign from 457 to 461 majorian successfully restored western roman authority in hispania and most of gaul despite his accomplishments roman rule in west would last less than two more decades valentinian iii was intimidated by aetius and was encouraged by roman senator petronius maximus and chamberlain heraclius to assassinate him when aetius was at court in ravenna delivering a financial account valentinian suddenly leaped from his seat and declared that he would no longer be victim of aetius drunken depravities aetius attempted to defend himself from charges but valentinian drew his sword and struck weaponless aetius on head killing him on spot on march 16 following year valentinian himself was killed by supporters of dead general possibly acting for petronius maximus with end of theodosian dynasty petronius maximus proclaimed himself emperor during ensuing period of unrest petronius was not able to take effective control of significantly weakened and unstable empire he broke betrothal between huneric son of vandal king gaiseric and eudocia daughter of valentinian iii this was seen as a just cause of war by king gaiseric who set sail to attack rome petronius and his supporters attempted to flee city at sight of approaching vandals only to be stoned to death by a roman mob petronius had reigned only 11 weeks with vandals at gates pope leo i requested that king not destroy ancient city or murder its inhabitants to which gaiseric agreed and city gates were opened to him though keeping his promise gaiseric looted great amounts of treasure and damaged objects of cultural significance such as temple of jupiter optimus maximus severity of vandal sack of 455 is disputed though with vandals plundering city for a full fourteen days as opposed to visigothic sack of 410 where visigoths only spent three days in city it was likely more thorough avitus a prominent general under petronius was proclaimed emperor by visigothic king theodoric ii and accepted as such by roman senate though supported by gallic provinces and visigoths avitus was resented in italy due to ongoing food shortages caused by vandal control of trade routes and for using a visigothic imperial guard he disbanded his guard due to popular pressure and general ricimer used opportunity to depose avitus counting on popular discontent after deposition of avitus eastern emperor leo i did not select a new western augustus prominent general majorian defeated an invading force of alemanni and was subsequently proclaimed western emperor by army and eventually accepted as such by leo majorian was last western emperor to attempt to recover western empire with his own military forces to prepare majorian significantly strengthened western roman army by recruiting large numbers of barbarian mercenaries among them gepids ostrogoths burgundians huns bastarnae suebi scythians and alans and built two fleets one at ravenna to combat strong vandalic fleet majorian personally led army to wage war in gaul leaving ricimer in italy gallic provinces and visigothic kingdom had rebelled following deposition of avitus refusing to acknowledge majorian as lawful emperor at battle of arelate majorian decisively defeated visigoths under theoderic ii and forced them to relinquish their great conquests in hispania and return to foederati status majorian then entered rhone valley where he defeated burgundians and reconquered rebel city of lugdunum with gaul back under roman control majorian turned his eyes to vandals and africa not only did vandals pose a constant danger to coastal italy and trade in mediterranean but province they ruled was economically vital to survival of west majorian began a campaign to fully reconquer hispania to use it as a base for reconquest of africa throughout 459 majorian campaigned against suebi in northwestern hispania vandals began to increasingly fear a roman invasion king gaiseric tried to negotiate a peace with majorian who rejected proposal in wake of this gaiseric devastated mauretania part of his own kingdom fearing that roman army would land there having regained control of hispania majorian intended to use his fleet at to attack vandals before he could fleet was destroyed allegedly by traitors paid by vandals deprived of his fleet majorian had to cancel his attack on vandals and conclude a peace with gaiseric disbanding his barbarian forces majorian intended to return to rome and issue reforms stopping at arelate on his way here ricimer deposed and arrested him in 461 having gathered significant aristocratic opposition against majorian after five days of beatings and torture majorian was beheaded near river collapse thumb left upright 1 15 western and eastern roman empire by final collapse of empire in west was marked by increasingly ineffectual puppet emperors dominated by their germanic magister most pointed example of this is ricimer who effectively became a shadow emperor following depositions of avitus and majorian unable to take throne for himself due to his barbarian heritage ricimer appointed a series of puppet emperors who could do little to halt collapse of roman authority and loss of territories re conquered by majorian first of these puppet emperors libius severus had no recognition outside of italy with eastern emperor leo i and provincial governors in gaul and illyria all refusing to recognize him severus died in 465 and leo i with consent of ricimer appointed capable eastern general anthemius as western emperor following an eighteen month interregnum relationship between anthemius and east was good anthemius is last western emperor recorded in an eastern law and two courts conducted a joint operation to retake africa from vandals culminating in disastrous battle of cape bon in 468 in addition anthemius conducted failed campaigns against visigoths hoping to halt their expansion trial and subsequent execution of romanus an italian senator and friend of ricimer on grounds of treachery in 470 made ricimer hostile to anthemius following two years of ill feeling ricimer successfully deposed and killed anthemius in 472 elevating olybrius to western throne during brief reign of olybrius ricimer died and his nephew gundobad succeeded him as magister militum after only seven months of rule olybrius died of dropsy gundobad elevated glycerius to western emperor eastern empire had rejected olybrius and also rejected glycerius instead supporting a candidate of their own julius nepos magister militum in dalmatia with support of eastern emperors leo ii and zeno julius nepos crossed adriatic sea in spring of 474 to depose glycerius at arrival of nepos in italy glycerius abdicated without a fight and was allowed to live out his life as bishop of salona brief rule of nepos in italy ended in 475 when orestes a former secretary of attila and magister militum of julius nepos took control of ravenna and forced nepos to flee by ship to dalmatia later in same year orestes crowned his own young son as western emperor under name romulus augustus romulus augustus was not recognised as western emperor by eastern court who maintained that nepos was only legal western emperor reigning in exile from dalmatia on september 4 476 odoacer leader of germanic foederati in italy captured ravenna killed orestes and deposed romulus though romulus was deposed nepos did not return to italy and continued to reign as western emperor from dalmatia with support from constantinople odoacer proclaimed himself ruler of italy and began to negotiate with eastern emperor zeno zeno eventually granted odoacer patrician status as recognition of his authority and accepted him as his viceroy of italy zeno however insisted that odoacer had to pay homage to julius nepos as emperor of western empire odoacer accepted this condition and issued coins in name of julius nepos throughout italy this however was mainly an empty political gesture as odoacer never returned any real power or territories to nepos murder of nepos in 480 prompted odoacer to invade dalmatia annexing it to his kingdom of italy fall of empire thumb city of ravenna western roman capital on tabula peutingeriana a 13th century medieval map possibly copied from a 4th or 5th century roman original by convention western roman empire is deemed to have ended on 4 september 476 when odoacer deposed romulus augustus but historical record calls this determination into question indeed deposition of romulus augustus received very little attention in contemporary times romulus was a usurper in eyes of eastern roman empire and remaining territories of western roman control outside of italy with previous emperor julius nepos still being alive and claiming to rule western empire in dalmatia furthermore western court had lacked true power and had been subject to germanic aristocrats for decades with most of its legal territory being under control of various barbarian kingdoms with odoacer recognising julius nepos and later eastern emperor zeno as his sovereign nominal roman control continued in italy syagrius who had managed to preserve roman sovereignty in an exclave in northern gaul a realm today known as domain of soissons also recognized nepos as his sovereign and legitimate western emperor authority of julius nepos as emperor was accepted not only by odoacer in italy but by eastern empire and syagrius in gaul who had not recognized romulus augustulus nepos was murdered by his own soldiers in 480 a plot some attribute to odoacer or previous deposed emperor glycerius and eastern emperor zeno chose not to appoint a new western emperor zeno recognizing that no true roman control remained over territories legally governed by western court instead chose to abolish juridical division of position of emperor and declared himself sole emperor of roman empire zeno became first sole roman emperor since division after theodosius i 85 years prior and position would never again be divided as such eastern roman emperors after 480 are successors of western ones albeit only in a juridical sense these emperors would continue to rule roman empire until fall of constantinople in 1453 nearly a thousand years later as 480 marks end of juridical division of empire into two separate imperial courts some historians refer to death of nepos and abolition of western empire by zeno as end of western roman empire despite fall or abolition of western empire many of new barbarian kings of western europe continued to operate firmly within a roman administrative framework this is especially true in case of ostrogoths who came to rule italy after odoacer they continued to use administrative systems of odoacer s kingdom essentially those of western roman empire and administrative positions continued to be staffed exclusively by romans senate continued to function as it always had and laws of empire were recognized as ruling roman population though goths were ruled by their own traditional laws western roman administrative institutions in particular those of italy thus continued to be used during barbarian rule and after forces of eastern roman empire re conquered some of formerly imperial territories some historians thus refer to reorganizations of italy and abolition of old and separate western roman administrative units such as praetorian prefecture of italy during sixth century as true fall of western roman empire roman cultural traditions continued throughout territory of western empire for long after its disappearance and a recent school of interpretation argues that great political changes can more accurately be described as a complex cultural transformation rather than a fall political aftermath thumb map of barbarian kingdoms major kingdoms and roman empire labelled below of western mediterranean in 526 seven years before campaigns of reconquest under eastern emperor justinian i alt after fall of western roman empire germanic kingdoms often referred to as barbarian kingdoms founded during its collapse continued to grow and prosper their beginnings together with end of western roman empire mark transition from late antiquity to middle ages practices of barbarian kingdoms gradually replaced old roman institutions specifically in praetorian prefectures of gaul and italy during sixth and seventh centuries in many places roman institutions collapsed along with economic stability in some regions notably gaul and italy settlement of barbarians on former roman lands seems to have caused relatively little disruption with barbarian rulers using and modifying roman systems already in place germanic kingdoms in italy hispania and gaul continued to recognise emperor in constantinople as a somewhat nominal sovereign visigoths minted coins in their names until reign of justinian i in sixth century thumb 6th century visigothic coin struck in name of emperor justinian territories under direct roman control continued to exist in west even after 480 domain of soissons a rump state in northern gaul ruled by syagrius survived until 486 when it was conquered by franks under king clovis i after battle of soissons syagrius was known as king of romans by germanic peoples of region and repeatedly claimed that he was merely governing a roman province not an independent realm under clovis i from 480s to 511 franks would come to develop into a great regional power after their conquest of soissons franks defeated alemanni in 504 and conquered all visigothic territory north of pyrenees other than in 507 relations between franks and eastern empire appear to have been positive with emperor anastasius granting clovis title of consul following his victory against visigoths at time of its dissolution in 800s frankish kingdom had lasted far longer than other migration period barbarian kingdoms its divided successors would develop into medieval states of france initially known as west francia and germany initially known as east francia a mauro roman realm survived in province of mauretania caesariensis until early 8th century an inscription on a fortification at ruined city of altava from year 508 identifies a man named masuna as king of regnum maurorum et kingdom of moors and romans it is possible that masuna is same man as massonas who allied himself with forces of eastern roman empire against vandals in 535 this kingdom was defeated by eastern roman magister militum gennadius in 578 and its coastal territories were incorporated into empire once more germanic italy left thumb odoacer s italy in 480 ad following annexation of dalmatia deposition of romulus augustus and rise of odoacer as ruler of italy in 476 received very little attention at time overall very little changed for people there was still a roman emperor in constantinople to whom odoacer had subordinated himself had been experienced at many points in west before and deposition of romulus augustus was nothing out of ordinary odoacer saw his rule as entirely in tradition of roman empire not unlike ricimer and he effectively ruled as an imperial governor of italy and was even awarded title of patricius odoacer ruled using roman administrative systems already in place and continued to mint coins with name and portrait of julius nepos until 480 and later with name and portrait of eastern augustus rather than in his own name when nepos was murdered in dalmatia in 480 odoacer assumed duty of pursuing and executing assassins and established his own rule in dalmatia at same time odoacer established his power with loyal support of roman senate a legislative body that had continued even without an emperor residing in italy indeed senate seems to have increased in power under odoacer for first time since mid 3rd century copper coins were issued with legend s c senatus these coins were copied by vandals in africa and also formed basis of currency reform carried out by emperor anastasius in east under odoacer western consuls continued to be appointed as they had been under western roman empire and were accepted by eastern court first being caecina decius maximus basilus in 480 basilus was made praetorian prefect of italy in 483 another traditional position which continued to exist under odoacer eleven further consuls were appointed by senate under odoacer from 480 to 493 and one further praetorian prefect of italy was appointed caecina basilius decius 486 493 thumb solidus minted under odoacer with name and portrait of eastern emperor odoacer ruled as a roman governor would have and maintained himself as a subordinate to remaining empire eastern emperor zeno began to increasingly see him as a rival thus zeno promised theoderic great of ostrogoths foederati of eastern court control over italian peninsula if he was able to defeat odoacer theoderic led ostrogoths across julian alps and into italy and defeated odoacer in battle twice in 489 following four years of hostilities between them john bishop of ravenna was able to negotiate a treaty in 493 between odoacer and theoderic whereby they agreed to rule ravenna and italy jointly theoderic entered ravenna on 5march and odoacer was dead ten days later killed by theoderic after sharing a meal with him thumb map of realm of theodoric great at its height in 523 following annexation of southern parts of burgundian kingdom theoderic ruled both visigothic and ostrogothic kingdoms and exerted hegemony over burgundians and vandals inherited odoacer s role as acting viceroy for italy and ostensibly a patricius and subject of emperor in constantinople this position was recognized by emperor anastasius in 497 four years after theoderic had defeated odoacer though theodoric acted as an independent ruler he meticulously preserved outward appearance of his subordinate position theoderic continued to use administrative systems of odoacer s kingdom essentially those of western roman empire and administrative positions continued to be staffed exclusively by romans senate continued to function as it always had and laws of empire were recognized as ruling roman population though goths were ruled by their own traditional laws as a subordinate theoderic did not have right to issue his own laws only edicts or clarifications army and military offices were exclusively staffed by goths however who largely settled in northern italy though acting as a subordinate in domestic affairs theodoric acted increasingly independent in his foreign policies seeking to counterbalance influence of empire in east theoderic married his daughters to visigothic king alaric ii and burgundian prince sigismund his sister was married to vandal king thrasamund and he married audofleda sister of frankish king clovis i himself through these alliances and occasional conflicts territory controlled by theoderic in early sixth century nearly constituted a restored western roman empire ruler of italy since 493 theoderic became king of visigoths in 511 and exerted hegemony over vandals in north africa between 521 and 523 as such his rule extended throughout western mediterranean western imperial regalia housed in constantinople since deposition of romulus augustulus in 476 were returned to ravenna by emperor anastasius in 497 theoderic by now western emperor in all but name could not however assume an imperial title not only because notion of a separate western court had been abolished but also due to his barbarian heritage which like that of ricimer before him would have barred him from assuming throne with death of theodoric in 526 his network of alliances began to collapse visigoths regained autonomy under king and ostrogoths relations with vandals turned increasingly hostile under reign of their new king athalaric a child under regency of his mother amalasuntha after collapse of theoderic s control of western mediterranean frankish kingdom rose to become most powerful of barbarian kingdoms having taken control of most of gaul in absence of roman governance amalasuntha continued policies of conciliation between goths and romans supporting new eastern emperor justinian i and allowing him to use sicily as a staging point during reconquest of africa in vandalic war with death of athalaric in 534 amalasuntha crowned her cousin and only relative theodahad as king hoping for his support instead amalasuntha was imprisoned and even though theodahad assured emperor justinian of her safety she was executed shortly after this served as an ideal casus belli for justinian who prepared to invade and reclaim italian peninsula for roman empire imperial reconquest thumb upright 1 15 eastern roman empire by reoccupying some of former western roman empire s lands enlarged its territory considerably during justinian s reign from 527 red to 565 orange with emperor zeno having reunified empire into one imperial court remaining eastern roman empire continued to lay claim to areas previously controlled by western court throughout late antiquity and middle ages though military campaigns had been conducted by western court prior to 476 with aim of recapturing lost territory most notably under majorian reconquests if successful at all were only momentary it was as a result of campaigns of generals belisarius and narses on behalf of eastern roman emperor justinian i from 533 to 554 that long lasting reconquests of roman lands were witnessed despite also suffering from barbarian incursions eastern empire had survived fifth century mostly intact western roman empire less urbanized than eastern and more thinly populated may have experienced an economic decline throughout late empire in some provinces southern italy northern gaul except for large towns and cities and to some extent spain and danubian areas may have suffered east fared better economically especially as emperors such as constantine great and constantius ii had invested heavily in eastern economy as a result eastern empire could afford large numbers of professional soldiers and to augment them with mercenaries while western roman empire could not afford this to same extent even after major defeats east could although not without difficulties buy off its enemies with a ransom or protection money numbering more than 300 000 soldiers eastern roman army of justinian i was among most powerful in world unlike visigoths and ostrogoths vandals in africa minted their own coinage and were both de facto and de jure independent often being enemies of both western and eastern roman empires with pro roman vandal king hilderic having been deposed by gelimer in 530 justinian prepared an expedition led by belisarius it swiftly retook north africa between june 533 and march 534 returning wealthy province to roman rule following reconquest justinian swiftly reintroduced roman administrations of province establishing a new praetorian prefecture of africa and taking measures to decrease vandal influence eventually leading to complete disappearance of vandalic people following execution of pro roman ostrogoth queen amalasuntha and refusal of ostrogoth king theodahad to renounce his control of italy justinian ordered expedition to move on to reconquer italy ancient heartland of empire from 534 to 540 roman forces campaigned in italy and captured ravenna ostrogothic and formerly western roman capital in 540 gothic resistance revived under king totila in 541 they were finally defeated following campaigns by roman general narses who also repelled invasions into italy by franks and alemanni though some cities in northern italy continued to hold out until 560s justinian promulgated pragmatic sanction to reorganize governance of italy and province was returned to roman rule end of conflict saw italy devastated and considerably depopulated which combined with disastrous effects of plague of justinian made it difficult to retain over following centuries at time of collapse of western empire in 476 480 visigoths controlled large areas of southern gaul as well as a majority of hispania their increased domain had been partly conquered and partly awarded to them by western emperor avitus in 60s justinian undertook some limited campaigns against them recovering portions of southern coast of iberian peninsula here province of spania would last until 620s when visigoths under king reconquered south coast these regions remained under roman control throughout reign of justinian three years after his death lombards invaded italy lombards conquered large parts of devastated peninsula in late 500s establishing lombard kingdom they were in constant conflict with exarchate of ravenna a polity established to replace old praetorian prefecture of italy and enforce roman rule in italy wealthiest parts of province including cities of rome and ravenna remained securely in roman hands under exarchate throughout seventh century thumb map of eastern roman empire in 717 ad over course of seventh and eighth centuries islamic expansion had ended roman rule in africa and though some bastions of roman rule remained most of italy was controlled by lombards left although other eastern emperors occasionally attempted to campaign in west none were as successful as justinian after 600 events conspired to drive western provinces out of constantinople s control with imperial attention focused on pressing issues of war with sasanian persia and then rise of islam for a while west remained important with emperor constans ii ruling from syracuse in sicily a roman empire that still stretched from north africa to caucasus in thereafter imperial attention declined with constantinople itself being besieged in 670s renewed war with arabs in 680s and then a period of chaos between 695 and 717 during which time africa was finally lost once and for all being conquered by umayyad caliphate through reforms and military campaigns emperor leo iii attempted to restore order in empire but his doctrinal reforms known as iconoclastic controversy were extremely unpopular in west and were condemned by pope gregory iii roman empire was not only christian nation affected by islamic conquests visigothic kingdom finally fell to umayyad caliphate in 720s kingdom of asturias was founded by pelagius of asturias around same time and was first christian realm to be established in iberia following defeat of visigoths asturias would be transformed into kingdom of leon in 924 which would develop into predecessors of modern day spain religious disagreements between rome and constantinople eventually led to breakdown in imperial rule over rome itself and gradual transition of exarchate of ravenna into independent papal states led by pope in an attempt to gain support against lombards pope called for aid from frankish kingdom instead of eastern empire eventually crowning frankish king charlemagne as roman emperor in 800 ad though this coronation was strongly opposed by eastern empire there was little they could do as their influence in western europe decreased after a series of small wars in 810s emperor michael i recognized charlemagne as an emperor he refused to recognize him as a roman emperor a title which michael reserved for himself and his successors instead recognizing him as slightly less prestigious emperor of franks imperial rule continued in sicily throughout eighth century with island slowly being overrun by arabs during course of ninth century in italy a few strongholds in calabria provided a base for a later modest imperial expansion which reached its peak in early eleventh century with most of southern italy under roman rule of a sort this however was undone by further civil wars in empire and slow conquest of region by empire s former mercenaries normans who finally put an end to imperial rule in western europe in 1071 with conquest of bari last emperor to attempt reconquests in west was manuel i komnenos who invaded southern italy during a war with norman kingdom of sicily in 1150s city of bari willingly opened its gates to emperor and after successes in taking other cities in region manuel dreamed of a restored roman empire and a union between churches of rome and constantinople separated since schism of 1054 despite initial successes and papal support campaign was unsuccessful and manuel was forced to return east legacy as western roman empire crumbled new germanic rulers who conquered its constituent provinces maintained most roman laws and traditions many of invading germanic tribes were already christianized although most were followers of arianism they quickly changed their adherence to state church of roman empire this helped cement loyalty of local roman populations as well as support of powerful bishop of rome although they initially continued to recognize indigenous tribal laws they were more influenced by roman law and gradually incorporated it roman law particularly corpus juris civilis collected on orders of justinian i is basis of modern civil law in contrast common law is based on germanic anglo saxon law civil law is by far most widespread system of law in world in force in some form in about 150 countries thumb romance languages languages that developed from latin following collapse of western roman empire are spoken in western europe to this day and their extent almost reflects continental borders of old empire latin as a language did not disappear vulgar latin combined with neighboring germanic and celtic languages giving rise to modern romance languages such as italian french spanish portuguese romanian and a large number of minor languages and dialects today more than 900 million people are native speakers of romance languages worldwide in addition many romance languages are used as lingua francas by non native speakers latin also influenced germanic languages such as english and german it survives in a purer form as language of catholic church catholic mass was spoken exclusively in latin until 1969 as such it was also used as a lingua franca by it remained language of medicine law and diplomacy most treaties were written in latin as well as of intellectuals and scholarship well into 18th century since then use of latin has declined with growth of other lingua francas especially english and french latin alphabet was expanded due to split of i into i and j and of v into u v and in places especially germanic languages and polish w it is most widely used alphabetic writing system in world today roman numerals continue to be used in some fields and situations though they have largely been replaced by arabic numerals a very visible legacy of western roman empire is catholic church church institutions slowly began to replace roman ones in west even helping to negotiate safety of rome during late 5th century as rome was invaded by germanic tribes many assimilated and by middle of medieval period 9th and 10th centuries central western and northern parts of europe had been largely converted to roman catholicism and acknowledged pope as vicar of christ first of barbarian kings to convert to church of rome was clovis i of franks other kingdoms such as visigoths later followed suit to garner favor with papacy when pope leo iii crowned charlemagne as roman emperor in 800 he both severed ties with outraged eastern empire and established precedent that no man in western europe would be emperor without a papal coronation although power pope wielded changed significantly throughout subsequent periods office itself has remained as head of catholic church and head of state of vatican city pope has consistently held title of pontifex maximus since before fall of western roman empire and retains it to this day this title formerly used by high priest of roman polytheistic religion one of whom was julius caesar roman senate survived initial collapse of western roman empire its authority increased under rule of odoacer and later ostrogoths evident by senate in 498 managing to install symmachus as pope despite both theodoric of italy and emperor anastasius supporting another candidate laurentius exactly when senate disappeared is unclear but institution is known to have survived at least into 6th century inasmuch as gifts from senate were received by emperor tiberius ii in 578 and 580 traditional senate building curia julia was rebuilt into a church under pope honorius i in 630 probably with permission from eastern emperor heraclius nomenclature marcellinus comes a sixth century eastern roman historian and a courtier of justinian i mentions western roman empire in his chronicle which primarily covers eastern roman empire from 379 to 534 in chronicle it is clear that marcellinus made a clear divide between east and west with mentions of a geographical east oriens and west and of an imperial east orientale imperium and orientale respublica and an imperial west imperium regnum occidentalis respublica hesperium regnum hesperium imperium and furthermore marcellinus specifically designates some emperors and consuls as being eastern and orientalium respectively term hesperium imperium translating to western empire has sometimes been applied to western roman empire by modern historians as well though marcellinus does not refer to empire as a whole after 395 only to its separate parts he clearly identifies term roman as applying to empire as a whole when using terms such as us our generals and our emperor marcellinus distinguished both divisions of empire from outside foes such as sasanian persians and huns this view is consistent with view that contemporary romans of 4th and 5th centuries continued to consider empire as a single unit although more often than not with two rulers instead of one first time empire was divided geographically was during reign of diocletian but there was precedent for multiple emperors before diocletian and tetrarchy there had been a number of periods where there was more than one co emperor such as with caracalla and geta in 210 211 who inherited imperial throne from their father septimius severus but caracalla ruled alone after murder of his brother attempted restorations of a western court positions of eastern and western augustus established under emperor diocletian in 286 as tetrarchy had been abolished by emperor zeno in 480 following loss of direct control over western territories declaring himself sole augustus zeno only exercised true control over largely intact eastern empire and over italy as nominal overlord of odoacer reconquests under justinian i would bring back large formerly western roman territories into imperial control and with them empire would begin to face same problems it had faced under previous periods prior to tetrarchy when there had been only one ruler shortly after reconquest of north africa a usurper stotzas appeared in province though he was quickly defeated as such idea of dividing empire into two courts out of administrative necessity would see a limited revival during period that eastern empire controlled large parts of former west both by courtiers in east and enemies in west earliest attempt at crowning a new western emperor after abolition of title occurred already during gothic wars under justinian belisarius an accomplished general who had already successfully campaigned to restore roman control over north africa and large parts of italy including rome itself was offered position of western roman emperor by ostrogoths during his siege of ravenna ostrogothic and previously western roman capital in 540 ostrogoths desperate to avoid losing their control of italy offered title and their fealty to belisarius as western augustus justinian had expected to rule over a restored roman empire alone with codex justinianeus explicitly designating new praetorian prefect of africa as subject of justinian in constantinople belisarius loyal to justinian feigned acceptance of title to enter city whereupon he immediately relinquished it despite belisarius relinquishing title offer had made justinian suspicious and belisarius was ordered to return east at end of emperor tiberius ii s reign in 582 eastern roman empire retained control over relatively large parts of regions reconquered under justinian tiberius chose two caesares general maurice and governor germanus and married his two daughters to them germanus had clear connections to western provinces and maurice to eastern provinces it is possible that tiberius was planning to divide empire into western and eastern administrative units once more if so plan was never realized at death of tiberius maurice inherited entire empire as germanus had refused throne maurice established a new type of administrative unit exarchate and organized remaining western territories under his control into exarchate of ravenna and exarchate of africa later claims to imperial title in west thumb upright 0 8 denarius of frankish king charlemagne who was crowned as roman emperor imperator augustus in year 800 by pope leo iii due to and in opposition to roman empire in east being ruled by irene a woman his coronation was strongly opposed by eastern empire in addition to remaining as a concept for an administrative unit in remaining empire ideal of roman empire as a mighty christian empire with a single ruler further continued to appeal to many powerful rulers in western europe with papal coronation of charlemagne as emperor of romans in 800 ad his realm was explicitly proclaimed as a restoration of roman empire in western europe under concept of translatio imperii though carolingian empire collapsed in 888 and berengar last emperor claiming succession from charlemagne died in 924 concept of a papacy and germanic based roman empire in west would resurface in form of holy roman empire in 962 holy roman emperors would uphold notion that they had inherited supreme power and prestige of roman emperors of old until downfall of holy roman empire in 1806 charlemagne and subsequent holy roman emperors were not and did not claim to be rulers of a restored western roman empire pope leo iii and contemporary historians were fully aware of that notion of a separate western court had been abolished over three centuries prior and considered roman empire to be one and indivisible ruler of roman empire at time of charlemagne s coronation was irene mother of emperor constantine vi who she had deposed leo iii considered irene to be a usurper and illegitimate to rule due to her gender and as such considered imperial throne to be vacant thus charlemagne was not crowned as ruler of western roman empire and successor to romulus augustulus but rather as successor of constantine vi and as sole roman emperor irene was deposed and replaced by emperor nikephoros soon after and eastern empire refused to recognize imperial title of charlemagne following several wars in 810s emperor michael i rangabe eventually recognized charlemagne as an emperor but as slightly humiliating emperor of franks rather than roman emperor a title he reserved for himself for centuries to come revived western court and eastern court in direct succession to roman emperors of old would make competing claims to be rulers of whole roman empire with eastern empire terming holy roman empire as an empire of franks term empire of greeks was popularized in frankish court as a way to refer to empire centered in constantinople following end of eastern roman empire after fall of constantinople in 1453 and dissolution of holy roman empire in 1806 title of emperor became widespread among european monarchs austrian empire laid claim to be heir of holy roman empire as austria s habsburgs attempted to unite germany under their rule german empire established in 1871 also claimed to be a successor of rome through lineage of holy roman empire both of these empires used imperial title kaiser derived from latin word caesar german word for emperor german empire and austria hungary successor of austrian
