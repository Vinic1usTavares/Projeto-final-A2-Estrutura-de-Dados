tropical storm hanna was a moderately strong tropical storm that affected gulf coast and southeastern regions of united states tenth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm of 2002 atlantic hurricane season hanna formed through complex interaction of a surface trough a tropical wave and an upper level low pressure system a disturbance in upper atmosphere designated a tropical depression at 0000 utc on september 12 storm remained disorganized throughout its duration though it attained tropical storm status and a peak intensity of with winds of 60 miles per hour 100 km h hanna crossed extreme southeastern louisiana and made a second landfall along alabama mississippi border because most of associated convective activity was east of center of circulation louisiana and mississippi received minimal damage however on dauphin island alabama storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced evacuation of residents florida received high wind gusts heavy rainfall and strong surf that resulted in deaths of three swimmers 20 000 homes in state lost electricity heavy rainfall progressed into georgia where significant flooding occurred crop damage was extensive and about 335

ocean into gulf of mexico in early september 2002 at same time a westward moving tropical wave entered gulf on september 10 and spawned a weak low along trough with little associated thunderstorm activity on september 11 an upper level low over united states moved into gulf and became cut off from flow allowing atmospheric convection to develop to east of tropical wave surface low organized and convection formed closer to center of low at 0000 utc on september 12 a hurricane hunters aircraft was able to find a well defined center of circulation national hurricane center nhc thus designated it a tropical depression while it was about south of pensacola florida after being designated cyclone became disorganized and contained little deep and persistent convection with dry air infringing on western edge of storm substantial intensification was deemed unlikely despite being sheared cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day though it remained a depression due to a partially non tropical appearance initially depression meandered towards northeast due to weak steering currents and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600 utc as such it was named hanna by national hurricane center over next 24 hours low level center rotated around mid and upper level centers and entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late september 12 after a jog to northwest low level center became separated from convection meandering storm started to turn northward under steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid level trough hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60 miles per hour 100 km h at 0000 utc on september 14 convection shifted towards eastern semicircle of circulation while still exposed center became malformed and elongated on september 14 poorly organized cyclone crossed southeastern louisiana turned towards north northeast and made a second landfall close to alabama mississippi border at 1500 utc that day still at its peak strength storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland and remnant low pressure area moved into georgia and south carolina preparations thumb precursor to tropical storm hanna on september 11 alt satellite image of a large area of clouds over gulf of mexico elongated from upper right to bottom left shortly after formation of storm national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch for coastal area between pascagoula mississippi and suwannee river in florida a tropical storm warning for region between grand isle louisiana and apalachicola florida replaced watch though it was discontinued east of apalachicola all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued by 1800 utc on september 14 as there was no longer a need for
