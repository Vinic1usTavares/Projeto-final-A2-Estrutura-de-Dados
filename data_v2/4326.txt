device forts also known as henrician castles and blockhouses were a series of artillery fortifications built to defend coast of england and wales by henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences in hands of local lords and communities but threat of french and spanish invasion led king to issue an order called a device for a major programme of work between 1539 and 1547 fortifications ranged from large stone castles positioned to protect downs anchorage in kent to small blockhouses overlooking entrance to milford haven in pembrokeshire and earthwork bulwarks along essex coast some forts operated independently others were designed to be mutually reinforcing device programme was hugely expensive costing a total of ps376 000 estimated as between ps2 and ps82 million in today s money much of this was raised from proceeds of dissolution of monasteries a few years before these utilitarian fortifications were armed with artillery intended to be used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised by use of circular bastions and multi tiered defences combined with many traditional medieval features these designs contained serious military flaws however and second period of construction until 1547 saw introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland europe castles were commanded by captains appointed by crown overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers who would be supplemented by local militia in an emergency despite a french raid against isle of wight in 1545 device forts saw almost no action before peace was declared in 1546 some of defences were left to deteriorate and were decommissioned only a few years after their construction after war broke out with spain in 1569 elizabeth i improved many of remaining fortifications including during attack of spanish armada of 1588 by end of century defences were badly out of date and for first few decades of 17th century many of forts were left to decay most of fortifications saw service in first and second english civil wars during 1640s and were garrisoned during interregnum continuing to form backbone of england s coastal defences against dutch after charles ii was restored to throne in 1660 again left to fall in ruin during 18th century many of device forts were modernised and rearmed during napoleonic wars until peace was declared in 1815 fears over a possible french invasion resurfaced several times in 19th century combined with rapid changes in technology such as development of steamships and shell guns in 1840s rifled cannon and iron clad warships in 1850s and torpedo boats in 1880s this spurred fresh investment in those device forts still thought to be militarily valuable and encouraged decommissioning of others by 1900 however developments in guns and armour had made most of device forts that remained in service simply too small to be practical in modern coastal defence despite being brought back into use during first and second world wars by 1950s fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good coastal erosion over centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed many were restored however and opened to public as tourist attractions early history and design device programme background device forts emerged as a result of changes in english military architecture and foreign policy in early 16th century during late medieval period english use of castles as military fortifications had declined in importance introduction of gunpowder in warfare had initially favoured defender but soon traditional stone walls could easily be destroyed by early artillery few new castles that were built during this time still incorporated older features of gatehouses and crenellated walls but intended them more as martial symbols than as practical military defences more needed many older castles were simply abandoned or left to fall in disrepair although fortifications could still be valuable in times of war they had played only a limited role during wars of roses and when henry vii invaded and seized throne in 1485 he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during campaign henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons to fear an external invasion from continent he invested little in coastal defences over course of his reign modest fortifications existed along coasts based around simple blockhouses and towers primarily in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but they were very limited in scale his son henry viii inherited throne in 1509 and took a more interventionist approach in european affairs fighting one war with france between 1512 and 1514 and then another between 1522 and 1525 this time allying himself with spain and holy roman empire while france and empire were in conflict with one another raids along english coast might still be common but a full scale invasion seemed unlikely indeed traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications initially therefore henry took little interest in his coastal defences he declared reviews of fortifications in both 1513 and 1533 but not much investment took place as a result in 1533 henry broke with pope paul iii in order to annul long standing marriage to his wife catherine of aragon and remarry catherine was aunt of king charles v of spain who took annulment as a personal insult as a consequence france and empire declared an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraged two countries to attack england an invasion of england now appeared certain that summer henry made a personal inspection of some of his coastal defences which had recently been mapped and surveyed he appeared determined to make substantial urgent improvements initial phase 1539 43 henry viii gave instructions through parliament in 1539 that new defences were to be built along coasts of england beginning a major programme of work that would continue until 1547 order was known as a device which meant a documented plan instruction or schema leading to fortifications later becoming known as device forts initial instructions for defence of realm in time of invasion concerned building forts along southern coastline of england as well as making improvements to defences of towns of calais and guisnes in france then controlled by henry s forces commissioners were also to be sent out across south west and south east england to inspect current defences and to propose sites for new ones initial result was construction of 30 new fortifications of various sizes during 1539 stone castles of deal sandown and walmer were constructed to protect downs in east kent an anchorage which gave access to deal beach and on which an invasion force of enemy soldiers could easily be landed these defences known as castles of downs were supported by a line of four earthwork forts known as great turf bulwark little turf bulwark great white bulwark of clay and walmer bulwark and a long defensive ditch and bank route inland through a gap in kentish cliffs was guarded by sandgate castle in many cases temporary bulwarks for artillery batteries were built in during initial stages of work ahead of main stonework being completed thames estuary leading out of london through which 80 percent of england s exports passed was protected with a mutually reinforcing network of blockhouses at gravesend milton and higham on south side of river and west tilbury and east tilbury on opposite bank camber castle was built to protect anchorage outside ports of rye and winchelsea defences were built in port of harwich and three earth bulwarks were built around dover work was also begun on calshot castle in fawley and blockhouses of east and west cowes on isle of wight to protect solent which led into trading port of southampton portland roads anchorage in dorset was protected with new castles at portland and sandsfoot and work began on two blockhouses to protect milford haven waterway in pembrokeshire in 1540 additional work was ordered to defend cornwall carrick roads was an important anchorage at mouth of river fal and original plans involved constructing five new fortifications to protect it although only two castles pendennis and st mawes were actually built on opposite sides of estuary work began on further fortifications to protect solent in 1541 with construction of hurst castle overlooking needles passage and netley castle just outside southampton itself following a royal visit to north of england coastal fortifications around town of hull were upgraded in 1542 with a castle and two large blockhouses further work was carried out in essex in 1543 with a total of seven fortifications constructed three in harwich itself three protecting estuary leading to town and two protecting estuary linking into colchester st andrew s castle was begun to further protect solent work was undertaken rapidly and 24 sites were completed and garrisoned by end of 1540 with almost all of rest finished by end of 1543 by time they were completed however alliance between charles and francis had collapsed and threat of imminent invasion was over second phase 1544 47 henry moved back onto offensive in europe in 1543 allying himself with spain against france once again despite henry s initial successes around boulogne in northern france king charles and francis made peace in 1544 leaving england exposed to an invasion by france backed by her allies in scotland in response henry issued another device in 1544 to improve country s defences particularly along south coast work began on southsea castle in 1544 on portsea island to further protect solent and on sandown castle following year on neighbouring isle of wight brownsea castle in dorset was begun in 1545 and sharpenrode bulwark was built opposite hurst castle from 1545 onwards french invasion emerged in 1545 when admiral claude d annebault crossed channel and arrived off solent with 200 ships on 19 july henry s fleet made a brief sortie before retreating safely behind protective fortifications annebault landed a force near newhaven during which camber castle may have fired on french fleet and on 23 july they landed four detachments on isle of wight including a party that took site of sandown castle which was still under construction french expedition moved further on along coast on 25 july bringing an end to immediate invasion threat meanwhile on 22 july french had carried out a raid at seaford and camber castle may have seen action against french fleet a peace treaty was agreed in june 1546 bringing an end to war by time that henry died following year in total huge sum of ps376 000 had been spent on device projects architects and engineers some of device forts were designed and built by teams of english engineers master mason john rogers was brought back from his work in france and worked on hull defences while sir richard lee another of king s engineers from his french campaigns may have been involved in construction of sandown and southsea pair were paid substantial sums of ps30 and ps36 a year respectively sir richard morris master of ordnance and james needham surveyor of king s works led on defences along thames efforts of hampton court palace architectural team under leadership of augustinian canon richard contributed to high quality construction and detailing seen in many of henry s device projects henry himself took a close interest in design of fortifications sometimes overruling his technical advisers on particular details southsea castle for example was described by courtier sir edmund as being of his majesty s own device which typically indicated that king had taken a personal role in its design historian andrew saunders suspects that henry was probably leading and unifying influence behind fortifications england also had a tradition of drawing on expert foreign engineers for military engineering italians were particularly sought after as their home country was felt to be generally more technically advanced particularly in field of fortifications one of these foreign engineers stefan von haschenperg from moravia worked on camber pendennis sandgate and st mawes apparently attempting to reproduce italian designs although his lack of personal knowledge of such fortifications impacted poorly on end results technical treatises from mainland europe also influenced designers of device forts including albrecht durer s der und which described contemporary methods of fortification in germany published in 1527 and translated into latin in 1535 and niccolo machiavelli s libro dell art della guerra published in 1521 which also described new italian forms of military defences architecture thumb 300px 18th century engraving of a 1588 map showing mutually reinforcing defences along river thames including milton and gravesend blockhouses top and east tilbury and west tilbury blockhouses bottom device forts represented a major radical programme of work historian marcus merriman describes it as one of largest construction programmes in britain since romans brian st john o neil as only scheme of comprehensive coastal defence ever attempted in england before modern times while cathcart king likened it to edwardian castle building programme in north wales although some of fortifications are titled as castles historians typically distinguish between character of device forts and those of earlier medieval castles medieval castles were private dwellings as well as defensive sites and usually played a role in managing local estates henry s forts were organs of state placed in key military locations typically divorced from surrounding patterns of land ownership or settlements unlike earlier medieval castles they were spartan utilitarian constructions some historians such as king have disagreed with this interpretation highlighting similarities between two periods with historian christopher duffy terming device forts reinforced castle fortification forts were positioned to defend harbours and anchorages and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships and to protect gunnery teams from attack by those vessels some including major castles including castles of downs in kent were intended to be self contained and able to defend themselves against attack from land while smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on maritime threat although there were extensive variations between individual designs they had common features and were often built in a consistent style larger sites such as deal or camber were typically squat with low parapets and massively thick walls to protect against incoming fire they usually had a central keep echoing earlier medieval designs with curved concentric bastions spreading out from centre main guns were positioned over multiple tiers to enable them to engage targets at different ranges there were far more gunports than there were guns held by individual fortification bastion walls were pierced with splayed gun embrasures giving artillery space to traverse and enabling easy fire control with overlapping angles of fire interiors had sufficient space for gunnery operations with specially designed vents to remove black powder smoke generated by guns moats often surrounded sites to protect against any attack from land and they were further protected by what historian b morley describes as defensive paraphernalia developed in middle ages portcullises murder holes and reinforced doors smaller blockhouses took various forms including d shapes octagonal and square designs thames blockhouses were typically protected on either side by additional earthworks and guns these new fortifications were most advanced in england at time an improvement over earlier medieval designs and were effective in terms of concentrating firepower on enemy ships they contained numerous flaws however and were primitive in comparison to their counterparts in mainland europe multiple tiers of guns gave forts a relatively high profile exposing them to enemy attack and curved surfaces of hollow bastions were vulnerable to artillery concentric bastion design prevented overlapping fields of fire in event of an attack from land and tiers of guns meant that as an enemy approached number of guns fort could bring to bear diminished some of these issues were addressed during second device programme from 1544 onwards italian ideas began to be brought in although impact of henry s foreign engineers seems to have been limited and designs themselves lagged behind those used in his french territories emerging continental approach used angled arrow head bastions linked in a line called a trace italienne to provide supporting fire against any attacker sandown castle on isle of wight constructed in 1545 was a hybrid of traditional english and continental ideas with angular bastions combined with a circular bastion overlooking sea southsea castle and fort had similar angular bastions yarmouth castle finished by 1547 was first fortification in england to adopt new arrow headed bastion design which had further advantages over a simple angular bastion not all forts in second wave of work embraced italian approach however and some such as brownsea castle retained existing updated architectural style logistics costs of building fortifications varied with their size a small blockhouse cost around ps500 to build whereas a medium sized castle such as sandgate pendennis or portland would come to approximately ps5 000 defensive line of deal sandown and walmer castles cost a total ps27 092 while work at hull castle and its two blockhouses came to ps21 056 various officials were appointed to run each of projects including a paymaster a comptroller an overseer and commissioners from local gentry a few fortifications were built by local individuals and families st catherine s castle for example was reportedly paid for by town and local gentry and edgcumbe family built devil s point artillery tower to protect plymouth harbour much of expenditure was on construction teams called crews who built forts numbers of workers varied during course of project driven in part by seasonal variation but teams were substantial sandgate castle for example saw an average of 640 men on site daily during june 1540 and work at hull required a team of 420 a skilled worker was paid between 7 and 8 pence a day a labourer between 5 and 6 pence with trades including stonemasons carpenters carters lime burners sawyers plumbers and bricklayers finding enough workers proved difficult and in some cases men had to be pressed into service unwillingly labour disputes broke out with strikes over low pay at deal in 1539 and at guisnes in 1541 both were quickly suppressed by royal officials large amounts of raw materials were also needed for work including stone timber and lead and many other supplies camber for example probably required over 500 000 bricks sandgate needed 44 000 tiles while constructing a small blockhouse along thames was estimated by contemporaries to require of chalk just to enable manufacture of lime mortar some materials could be sourced locally but coal was shipped from north of england and prefabricated items were brought in from london most of money for first phase of device works came from henry s dissolution of monasteries a few years before and revenues that flowed in from court of augmentations and first fruits and tenths as a result in addition dissolution had released ample supplies of building materials as monastic buildings were pulled down and much of this was recycled netley castle for example was based on an old abbey and reused many of its stones east tilbury blockhouse reused parts of st margaret s chantry calshot castle took lead from nearby beaulieu abbey east and west cowes castles stone from beaulieu and quarr and sandwich had stone from local carmelite friary milton blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from milton chantry by second phase of programme however most of money from dissolution had been spent and henry instead had to borrow funds government officials noted that at least ps100 000 was needed for work garrisons thumb left reconstruction of life amongst 16th century garrison at st mawes castle garrisons of device forts comprised relatively small teams of men who typically lived and worked in fortifications garrisons would maintain and care for buildings and their artillery during long periods of peacetime and in a crisis would be supplemented by additional soldiers and local militia size of garrisons varied according to fortification camber castle had a garrison of 29 walmer castle 18 while west tilbury blockhouse only held 9 men ordinary soldiers would have lived in relatively basic conditions typically on ground floor with captains of fortifications occupying more elaborate quarters often in upper levels of keeps soldiers ate meat and fish some of which might have been hunted or caught by garrison garrisons were well organised and a strict code of discipline was issued in 1539 historian peter harrington suggests that life in forts would have usually been tedious and isolated soldiers were expected to provide handguns at their own expense and could be fined if they failed to produce them there were only around 200 gunners across england during 1540s they were important military specialists and historians audrey howes and martin foreman observe that an air of mystery and danger surrounded them rates of pay across defences were recorded in 1540 showing that typical pay of garrisons was 1 or 2 shillings a day for a captain his deputy 8 pence porters 8 pence with soldiers and gunners receiving 6 pence each in total 2 220 men were recorded as receiving pay that year at a cost to crown of ps2 208 although most garrisons were paid for by crown in some cases local community also had a role at brownsea local town was responsible for providing a garrison of 6 men and at sandsfoot village took up responsibility for supporting castle garrison in exchange for an exemption from paying taxes and carrying out militia service armament thumb upright reconstruction of a 16th century cannon and gun crew at pendennis castle artillery guns in device forts were property of crown and were centrally managed by authorities in tower of london tower moved them between various fortifications as they felt necessary often resulting in complaints from local captains various surviving records record armaments held by individual forts on particular dates and between 1547 and 1548 a complete inventory was made of crown s possessions detailing weapons held by all of forts number of guns varied considerably from site to site in late 1540s heavily armed forts such as hurst and calshot held 26 and 36 guns respectively portland however had only 11 pieces some forts had more guns than level of their regular peacetime garrison for example despite only having an establishment of 13 men milton blockhouse had 30 artillery pieces a variety of artillery guns were deployed including heavier weapons such as cannons culverins and demi cannons and smaller pieces such as sakers minions and falcons some older guns for example slings and bases were also deployed but were less effective than newer weapons such as culverin with sites equipped with several tiers of weapons heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in fortification with smaller weapons closer to ground it is uncertain how far guns of period would have reached analysis carried out in 16th and 17th century on ranges of artillery suggested that largest weapons such as a culverin could hit a target up to between 1 600 and 2 743 metres 5 200 ft and 8 999 ft away forts were typically equipped with a mixture of brass and iron artillery guns guns made of brass could fire more quickly up to eight times an hour and were safer to use than their iron equivalents but were expensive and required imported copper in 1530s henry had established a new english gun making industry in weald of kent and london staffed by specialists from mainland europe this could make cast iron weapons but probably initially lacked capacity to supply all of artillery required for device forts particularly since henry also required more guns for his new navy a technical breakthrough in 1543 however led to introduction of vertical casting and a massive increase in henry s ability to manufacture iron cannons few guns from this period have survived but during excavations in 1997 an iron portpiece was discovered on site of south blockhouse in kingston on hull weapon now known as henry s gun is one of only four such guns in world to have survived and is displayed at hull museums in addition to artillery device forts were equipped with infantry weapons handguns typically an early form of matchlock arquebus called a would have been used for close defence these were long and supported on tripods many forts also held supplies of bows arrows and polearms such as bills pikes and halberds longbows were still in military use among english armies in 1540s although they later declined quickly in popularity and these along with polearms would have been used by local militia when they were called out in a crisis later history 16th century after henry s death there was a pause in conflict with france during which many of new fortifications were allowed to deteriorate there was little money available for repairs and garrisons were reduced in size east cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin while bulwarks along downs were defaced and their guns removed they were formally removed from service in 1550 in 1552 essex fortifications were decommissioned and several were subsequently pulled down expense of maintaining fortifications in hull led crown to agree a deal with town authorities to take over management of them milton and higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558 mersea fort was temporarily decommissioned before being brought back into active service strategic importance of south east england declined after peace was declared with france in 1558 military attention instead shifted towards spanish threat to increasingly prosperous south west of country tensions grew and war finally broke out in 1569 new threat led to improvements being made to pendennis and st mawes castles in cornwall and repairs to calshot camber and portland along south coast in 1588 spanish armada sailed for england and device forts were mobilised in response as part of this work west tilbury was brought back into service and supported by a hastily raised army which was visited by queen elizabeth i and further enlargement followed under direction of italian engineer gravesend was improved and several of essex fortifications were temporarily brought back into use there were discussions about enhancing defences at hull and milford haven but no work was actually carried out despite destruction of armada spanish threat continued castles in kent were kept ready for action throughout rest of elizabeth s reign in 1596 a spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20 000 soldiers set out for pendennis which was then garrisoned with only 500 men fleet was forced to turn back due to bad weather but elizabeth reviewed defences and significantly expanded henry s original fortifications with more up to date bastions designed by engineer paul ive by end of century however most of device forts were typically out of date by european standards 17th century james i came to english throne in 1603 resulting peace with both france and spain his government took little interest in coastal defences and many of device forts were neglected and fell into disrepair with their garrisons wages left unpaid castles such as deal and blockhouses like gravesend were all assessed as needing extensive repairs with sandgate reported to be in such a poor condition that neither habitable or defensible against any assault nor any way fit to command roads lacking ammunition and powder and with only a handful of its guns in adequate repair hurst was unable to prevent flemish ships from passing along solent pendennis s garrison s pay was two years in arrears reportedly forcing them to gather limpets from shoreline for food some of forts fell out of use camber castle whose original function of protecting local anchorage had by now been made redundant by changing shoreline was decommissioned by king charles i in 1637 while sharpenrode bulwark lay in ruins by 1620s first english civil war thumb sketch of gravesend blockhouse by cornelis bol mid 17th century civil war broke out across england in 1642 between supporters of king charles i and parliament fortifications and artillery played an important role in conflict and most of device forts saw service south and east of england were soon largely controlled by parliament blockhouses at gravesend and tilbury were garrisoned by parliament and used to control access to london castles along sussex and kentish coastline were seized by parliament in opening phase of war camber castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by enemy remainder continuing to be garrisoned royal fleet which had been positioned in downs anchorage sided with parliament device forts along solent also fell into parliamentary hands early in conflict calshot was garrisoned throughout as was brownsea which was strengthened and equipped with additional guns west cowes was rapidly taken after firing on a nearby parliamentary ship and royalist commander at yarmouth quickly negotiated a surrender of his tiny garrison heavily outnumbered garrison at southsea castle was stormed by parliamentary forces in a night attack like camber st andrew s and netley were rapidly occupied and then decommissioned by parliament in north east hull also sided with parliament and its castle and blockhouses were used as part of town s defences during multiple sieges much of south west sided with king device forts such as st catherine s were held by royalists from beginning of conflict royalists invaded parliamentary controlled dorset in 1643 taking portland and sandsfoot flow of war turned against king and dorset forts were besieged in 1644 and 1645 with sandsfoot falling to parliament by march 1646 thomas fairfax had entered cornwall with a substantial army captain of castle was invited to retreat to stronger fortress of pendennis but he surrendered immediately without putting up resistance pendennis was bombarded from land and blockaded by a flotilla of ships captain sir john arundell agreed to an honourable surrender on 15 august and around 900 survivors left fort some terminally ill from malnutrition pendennis was penultimate royalist fortification to hold out in war followed by portland castle which finally surrendered in april 1646 second english civil war thumb little dennis blockhouse in 2008 after a few years of unsteady peace in 1648 second english civil war broke out this time with charles royalist supporters joined by scottish forces parliamentary navy was based in downs protected by nearby henrician castles but by may a royalist insurrection was underway across kent sandown castle declared for king and soldier and former naval captain major keme then convinced garrisons at deal and walmer to surrender sandgate castle probably joined royalists as well with both coastal fortresses and navy now under royalist control parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along coast or military aid sent to scots essex also rose in rebellion in june and town of colchester was taken by royalists sir thomas fairfax placed it under siege and mersea fort was taken by parliamentary forces and used to cut off any assistance reaching town by river meanwhile parliament defeated kentish insurgency at battle of maidstone at start of june and then sent a force under command of colonel rich to deal with castles of downs walmer castle was first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 july an earthwork fort was then built between sandown and deal who each may have been defended by around 150 men each deal which had been resupplied by royalists from sea was besieged in july a royalist fleet bombarded parliamentary positions and temporarily landed a force 1 500 flemish mercenaries in support of revolt but a shortage of money forced their return to continent fleet under command of prince charles attempted to landed a fresh force in august but despite three attempts operation failed and suffered heavy losses deal surrendered on 25 august followed by sandown on 5 september interregnum and restoration thumb upright 1 5 south blockhouse centre and castle right at hull viewed from sea by wenceslas hollar mid 17th century unlike many castles device forts avoided being slighted deliberately damaged or destroyed by parliament during years of interregnum many of forts remained garrisoned with substantial numbers of men due to fears of a royalist invasion overseen by newly appointed governors netley was brought back into service due to threat many were used to hold prisoners of war or political detainees including hull mersea portland southsea and west cowes during first anglo dutch war between 1652 and 1654 castles such as deal were reinforced with earthworks and soldiers portland saw action during a three day long naval battle between english and dutch forces in portland roads some sites fell out of use little dennis blockhouse part of complex of defences at pendennis and mersea were decommissioned between 1654 and 1655 and brownsea castle was sold off into private hands charles ii was restored to throne in 1660 and reduced both size and wages of garrisons across kingdom device forts initially remained at heart of defences along south coast but their design was by now badly antiquated deal continued to play an important role in defending downs during second and third dutch wars supported by local trained bands and castles such as hurst portland and sandgate remained garrisoned others however were decommissioned with sandsfoot closing in 1665 following a dispute over control of defences and netley being abandoned to fall into ruin concerns about dutch threat were intensified after an unexpected naval raid along thames in 1667 during which gravesend and tilbury prevented attack reaching capital itself in response charles made extensive improvements to his coastal defences as part of this investments were made to pendennis southsea and yarmouth while tilbury was hugely expanded with an updated system of ramparts bastions and moats at considerable cost in final phases of charles s work castle and southern blockhouse at hull were incorporated into a massive new fortification called citadel during 1680s some of device forts played a role in glorious revolution of 1688 against charles brother king james ii townsfolk of deal seized their local castle in support of william of orange and took steps to defend downs against a feared irish invasion which never materialised southsea castle was held by king s illegitimate son james fitzjames duke of berwick who was pressurised into surrendering as his father s cause collapsed yarmouth was controlled by robert holmes a supporter of james but was prevented from actively supporting loyalist cause by local inhabitants and his garrison who sided with william 18th 19th centuries 1700 91 thumb st mawes castle centre and pendennis left depicted by j m w turner in 1823 military significance of device forts declined during 18th century some of fortifications were redesigned to provide more comfortable housing for their occupants cowes castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation demolishing much of keep and adding residential wings and gardens over landward defences and brownsea castle began to be converted into a country house from 1720s onwards walmer became official residence of lord warden of cinque ports and lionel sackville duke of dorset carried out extensive work there after 1708 there was probably some rivalry between sackville and naval officer sir john norris who redeveloped nearby deal castle during same period creating comfortable wood panelled quarters for himself there overlooking sea criticisms were levelled at defences of device forts which often had minimal garrisons and had been left to fall into disrepair southsea castle for example was only garrisoned by an old sergeant and three or four men who sell cakes and ale according to one contemporary account and proposals were put forward to abandon site altogether portland suffered badly from coastal erosion and protected only by a caretaker garrison was reportedly not repaired for many years and a 1714 survey found long neglected pendennis castle to be in a very ruinous condition french military dismissed deal walmer and sandown as being highly vulnerable to any potential attack describing them in 1767 as very old and little more than gun platforms mersea fort and east tilbury fell into ruin and were abandoned latter being submerged by thames some limited investments were made in fortifications however with defences of pendennis castle being modernised in 1730s and those of calshot in 1770s 1792 1849 thumb left duke of wellington s room in walmer castle duke was captain there between 1829 and 1852 revolutionary and napoleonic wars at turn of 18th and 19th centuries led to some of castles being re garrisoned and improved as part of development of a range of gun batteries around key locations some of fortifications such as sandgate southsea hurst and pendennis protected strategic locations and these were extensively modernised hurst for example was redesigned with batteries of heavier 36 pounder 16 3 kg weapons and pendennis was equipped with up to 48 guns sandgate s keep was rebuilt to form a martello tower as part of a wider programme of work along south coast new gun batteries were constructed at deal sandown in kent and tilbury while fort mersea was brought back into service complete with a new battery as well calshot castle was renovated southsea s defences were extensively modernised as were those in hull with castle and south blockhouse being refitted some of device forts worked in conjunction with volunteer units raised during wars to counter threat of a french invasion walmer castle was used by its captain william pitt younger then both prime minister and lord warden of cinque ports as base for volunteer cavalry unit and a fleet of 35 armed fishing boats called luggers nearby deal also had units of infantry and cavalry called fencibles and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by pitt carried out military exercises at castle calshot was used to store munitions for nearby sea fencibles pendennis held a new volunteer artillery unit which was used to train other garrisons across cornwall government coastguard used some of fortifications as bases to combat smuggling calshot was a good location for interception vessels to lie in wait and by middle of century two officers and forty two men were stationed there sandown castle in kent was also used by coastguard for anti smuggling operations in coming decades some forts were declared obsolete and put to new uses portland was disarmed after war and converted into a private house gravesend was superseded by new tavern fort and demolished in 1844 meanwhile ruins of netley castle were transformed into a gothic styled house from 1826 onwards 1850 99 thumb upright 1 5 hurst castle seen from east showing 16th century defences centre flanked by extensive mid 19th century additions from mid 19th century onwards changes in military technology repeatedly challenged value and composition of britain s coastal defences introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that french might successfully attack along south coast and fears grew of a conflict in early 1850s southsea castle and st mawes were extended with new gun batteries pendennis was reequipped with heavier guns and hurst was extensively redeveloped there were discussions about rearming calshot but these were rejected in part due to concerns about suitability of 16th century walls in modern warfare crimean war sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 south coast of england was refortified new guns were installed at st catherine s and yarmouth in 1855 remains of west blockhouse were destroyed by a new fortification west blockhouse fort designed to deal with french threat fresh worries about france combined with development of rifled cannon and iron clad warships led to royal commission on defence of united kingdom being established in 1859 and expressing fears about security of south coast in response sandgate was re equipped with heavier guns in 1859 and extensive work was carried out on southsea hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech loading guns protected by iron armour plate intended for use against fast moving enemy warships tilbury blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at fort after 1868 portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion but it was not rearmed a fresh wave of concerns about france followed in 1880s accompanied by introduction of still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation an electronically operated minefield was laid across carrick roads in 1885 jointly controlled from st mawes and pendennis new quick firing guns were installed at hurst to enable castle to engage newer vessels calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort with a new battery of quick firing guns protecting a boom across estuary original 16th century parts of fortifications such as southsea and calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons however and were instead used for mounting searchlights range and direction finding in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline some other sites were no longer considered viable at all west cowes was decommissioned in 1854 and became club house of royal yacht squadron sandown castle in kent suffering badly from coastal erosion began to be demolished from 1863 onwards hull citadel and its 16th century fortifications were demolished in 1864 to make way for docks yarmouth was decommissioned in 1885 becoming a coastguard signalling station and sandgate also suffering from coastal erosion was sold off to south eastern railway company in 1888 20th 21st centuries 1900 1945 thumb pendennis 6 inch mark 24 gun 6 inch 152 mm mark 24 gun in half moon battery at pendennis castle dating from second world war by start of 20th century developments in guns and armour had made most of device forts that remained in service too small to be useful modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within 16th century designs a 1905 review of falmouth defences concluded that naval artillery at st mawes had become superfluous as necessary guns could be mounted at combination of pendennis and newer sites along coast and castle was disarmed a review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at calshot was also unnecessary and site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead meanwhile concerns had been growing about unsympathetic treatment of historic military buildings by war office for its part war office was concerned that it might find itself financially supporting these properties from its own budget yarmouth castle was passed to commissioners of woods and forests in 1901 with parts of it were leased to neighbouring hotel war office concluded that walmer and deal had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer castles to office of works in 1904 who opened both former fortifications to visitors portland castle was placed onto what was known as schedule c list which meant that army would continue to use and manage historic property but would receive advice on suitability of repairs from office of works with outbreak of first world war naval operations were mainly focused along south east and southern coasts defences of pendennis were reinforced while southsea with addition of anti zeppelin guns formed part of fortress portsmouth plan for defending solent calshot formed a base for anti submarine warfare and remaining castles of downs were used to support activities of dover patrol st mawes and portland were used as barracks and walmer became a weekend retreat for prime minister asquith exploiting its good communication links with front line in france during second world war britain s coastal defences depended on extensive barriers constructed along shores combined with large numbers of small defensive artillery positions supported by air cover several of device forts were brought back into service in this way pendennis st catherine s st mawes and walmer were equipped with naval gun batteries calshot and hurst were rearmed with naval guns and anti aircraft defences and sandsfoot was used as an anti aircraft battery southsea continued in service and was involved in operation grasp which seized french fleet in 1940 others were used as support facilities yarmouth was requisitioned for military use portland was used for accommodation offices and as an ordnance store and west cowes used as a naval headquarters for part of d day landings camber was used as an early warning and decoy site to distract raids from nearby rye early in war a german bomber destroyed much of captain s quarters at deal forcing william birdwood to move to hampton court palace prime minister winston churchill was appointed as captain of walmer castle during war but declined to use it as a residence noting that it was too expensive for him to maintain and that it lay within range of german artillery 1946 21st century thumb left sandgate castle damaged by coastal erosion and converted into a private house during 1970s after war coastal defences became increasingly irrelevant as nuclear weapons came to dominate battlefield remaining device forts still in military use were initially garrisoned with reservist units and then closed as military establishments st catherine s and portland were decommissioned in late 1940s hurst pendennis and yarmouth in 1950s southsea in 1960 and after closure of its air base calshot followed in 1961 widespread restoration work was then carried out at calshot deal hurst pendennis portland st catherine s and southsea more modern additions to fortifications were destroyed in an attempt to recreate appearance of castles at earlier periods of their history ranging from 16th to 19th centuries there was extensive research into forts during this period commencing in 1951 with a long running research project commissioned by ministry of works into device forts which in turn led to heightened academic interest in their histories during 1980s a range of fortifications were opened to public in post war years deal hurst pendennis and portland opened in 1950s and southsea in 1967 calshot followed in 1980s camber after a long period of restoration work in 1994 and sandsfoot reopened following repair work in 2012 visitor numbers vary across sites southsea castle for example received over 90 000 visitors in 2011 12 other forts were put to different uses netley was first used a nursing home and then converted into private flats brownsea became a corporate hotel for employees of john lewis partnership and sandgate was restored in 1970s to form a private home by 21st century many of device forts had been damaged by or in some cases lost entirely to coastal erosion problem had existed at some locations since 16th century and still persists for example at hurst east cowes castle and east tilbury fort have been entirely lost while east blockhouse mersea and sandsfoot have been badly damaged a third of sandgate and most of st andrews have been washed away other sites were demolished built upon or simply eroded over time almost no trace remains of bulwarks along downs for example remaining sites are protected
