that is how it actually happened musically song is an eighties inspired synthpop track it utilises a very simple and minimalist style of production and was described as an electro pop disco fusion with percolating crackle and pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs by sal cinquemani from slant magazine additionally it contains elements of electroclash and club music through lyrics of song minogue
