psilocybe aztecorum is a species of psilocybin mushroom in family known from arizona colorado central mexico india and costa rica fungus grows on decomposing woody debris and is found in mountainous areas at elevations of typically in meadows or open grassy conifer forests mushrooms have convex to bell shaped caps in diameter atop slender cylindrical stems that are up to long color of caps changes with variations in hydration ranging from dark chestnut brown to straw yellow or whitish when dry base of stem is densely covered with conspicuous white rhizomorphs a characteristic uncommon amongst psilocybe species species was first reported by french mycologist roger heim in 1956 as a variety of psilocybe mexicana before he officially described it under its current name a year later named for its association with nahua people also called aztecs p aztecorum may have been one of sacred mushroom species or teonanacatl a nahuatl word translated variously as sacred mushroom or flesh of gods reported in codices of 16th century spanish chronicler bernardino de sahagun mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by nahua indians in popocatepetl region although this traditional usage is waning variety p aztecorum var bonetii has smaller spores than main variety and is found at lower elevations with montezuma pine pinus montezumae and sacred fir abies religiosa p aztecorum may be distinguished from similar temperate species such as p baeocystis and p quebecensis by their ranges and by differences in morphology of microscopic structures like cystidia taxonomy and nomenclature species was first mentioned by french mycologist roger heim in 1956 based on material collected by american ethnomycologist r gordon wasson in paso de cortes on slopes of popocatepetl mountain in mexico heim originally named species as a variety of psilocybe mexicana limited to dried mushroom material for analysis he only described spores which he explained were relatively longer and narrower than that of psilocybe mexicana a year later heim renamed fungus psilocybe aztecorum and officially described it in addition to several other mexican psilocybe taxa some of these mushrooms including p aztecorum were illustrated in popular american weekly magazine life seeking magic mushroom in which wasson recounted psychedelic visions that he experienced during divinatory rituals of mazatec people thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to western popular culture in 1978 mexican mycologist and psilocybe specialist gaston guzman emended description of p aztecorum to include color variation of cap resulting from its strongly hygrophanous nature form rhizoids at base of stem lignicolous habitat and size of spores all features that he thought were either confused or not sufficiently detailed in heim s original description in same publication guzman also characterized variety p aztecorum var bonetii distinguished from main variety by its smaller spores he had originally described this variant as a separate species psilocybe bonetii in 1970 further guzman later published psilocybe originally described by him from tamil nadu in southern india as a synonym of p aztecorum var bonetii this putative synonymy however is confirmed by neither mycobank nor index fungorum guzman called main variety p aztecorum var aztecorum for this reason species authority is often cited as p aztecorum var aztecorum r heim emend guzman stamets 1996 pp 92 3 psilocybe aztecorum is type species of guzman s section aztecorum a group of bluing i e psilocybin containing psilocybe mushrooms characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view and pleurocystidia that when present are hyaline translucent other species classified in section aztecorum are p baeocystis and p quebecensis specific epithet aztecorum refers to aztec indians of central mexico who used this mushroom in traditional ceremonies long before spanish came to america variety p aztecorum var is named after dr federico bonet died 1980 emeritus professor of escuela nacional de ciencias who assisted guzman with his doctoral studies popular names of p aztecorum are ninos or children or little children or in nahuatl language which means ninos del agua children of water alluding to their habitat along ravines description thumb left gills have an adnate or adnexed attachment to stem sometimes with whitish edges cap is convex to bell shaped sometimes developing a broad umbo before expanding and flattening in age it reaches a diameter of in maturity cap eventually forms a central depression and in some old specimens opens into hollow stem cap surface is slimy to touch and has translucent striations along margin when moist cap is strongly hygrophanous meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration color ranges from yellowish brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish gray in age with greenish gray tints on margin color later changes to whitish from center to margin finally remaining completely white dried specimens are straw colored to pale brownish in contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms cap of p aztecorum does not have a strong bluing reaction upon injury only margin stains slightly green blue thumb right a young specimen with prominent rhizomorphs at stem base a silky fibrillose stem surface and a cobweb like partial veil covering gills gills are adnate broadly attached to stem slightly above bottom of gill or adnexed reaching stem but not attached to it and are light violet gray to dark violet brown they are either uniform in color or have whitish edges hollow stem is by thick equal in width throughout or thicker at top cylindric or sometimes flattened and either straight or with turns and windings its surface is smooth silky fibrillose whitish to greyish and stains blue green irregularly when touched or in age base of stem is densely covered with well developed white rhizomorphs young mushrooms have a white cobweb like partial veil that does not last long before it disappears although it sometimes remains as a non permanent ring on upper part of stem flesh is whitish to yellowish or reddish yellow in cap or reddish brown in stem and shows little or no bluing reaction to injury like most of bluing psilocybe mushrooms odor and taste of p aztecorum is slightly farinaceous similar to freshly ground flour in fresh specimens dried specimens have a more intense odor a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide koh stains cap stem and flesh reddish brown sometimes stem does not stain or stains slightly yellowish red spore print is blackish violet microscopic characteristics spores are elongated ellipsoid in face view roughly more or less cylindrical but usually tapering at both ends slightly inequilateral or asymmetrical in side view so called mango form they typically have dimensions of 12 14 by 6 6 7 7 by 6 7 5 mm although some spores have irregular shapes and are strongly elongated up to 23 mm spores are thick walled generally between 1 1 5 mm dark yellowish brown and have a broad germ pore variety bonetii has smaller spores measuring 10 13 by 6 7 5 by 6 7 mm basidia spore bearing cells measure 24 33 by 6 6 8 8 mm and may be attached to anywhere from one to four spores although four spored basidia are most common they are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish club shaped or roughly cylindrical and some have a slight constriction around middle cheilocystidia cystidia on edge of a gill are abundant forming a sterile band on gill edge they are hyaline fusoid ampullaceous with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle with dimensions of 20 45 by 5 8 2 mm and have a filamentous neck measuring 6 11 by 1 6 2 5 mm pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face are scattered similar to cheilocystidia in form and size hyaline and some have bifurcated or branched necks

cheilocystidia characteristic filamentous neck present in cystidia of p aztecorum is absent in p pseudoaztecorum p pseudoaztecorum had been previously described by k natarajan and n raman as p aztecorum but they published taxon with a new name after consultation with guzman fresh specimens of p aztecorum resemble p but this latter species is found only in pacific northwest region of united states and canada like p aztecorum caps of south african species p natalensis also bleach to nearly white when dried stamets 1996 p 134 closely related p baeocystis also in color to white when dry found in northwest north america from british columbia to washington and oregon p baeocystis has thinner cheilocystidia than p aztecorum typically measuring 20 32 by 4 4 6 mm and its pleurocystidia when present are found only near gill edge guzman 1983 p 327 p quebecensis known only from quebec canada has pleurocystidia measuring 12 25 by 5 10 mm although phylogeny of species comprising section aztecorum is not known with certainty guzman has suggested that p aztecorum was ancestor of p baeocystis in northwestern north america and of p quebecensis in northeastern north america guzman 1983 p 331 habitat and distribution thumb left p aztecorum fruits in high elevation meadows and open woodlands a lignicolous species psilocybe aztecorum lives in and decays dead wood leaves sticks or other similar organic debris mushrooms typically fruit in groups of 5 to 20 sometimes in bundles usual substrates include wood debris buried in soil twigs or very rotten logs and rarely pine cones mushroom is found in woodlands a low density forest or wooded area that allows sunlight to penetrate to forest floor containing hartweg s pine pinus in addition to grasses such as festuca and and herbaceous plant alchemilla at elevations of heim found type specimens at an altitude of in an alpine pine forest p aztecorum fruits from august to october psilocybe aztecorum is known only from high mountains of central mexico such as sierra nevada nevado de toluca and la in states of mexico puebla and tlaxcala according to guzman it is likely that species also grows in other areas with high mountains such as states of nuevo leon veracruz colima and chiapas which have ecological conditions similar to those of known localities variety bonetii grows in same as type variety mainly on humus but only in forests with montezuma pine pinus montezumae and sacred fir abies religiosa between elevation it has not been recorded from hartweg s pine forests also known only from mexico in states of mexico and morelos and in federal district p aztecorum var bonetii usually fruits from august to november according to guzman p aztecorum should be of conservation concern owing to loss of its natural habitat entheogenic use thumb 160px right some of flower like decorations on statue of xochipilli have been interpreted as p aztecorum psilocybe aztecorum contains psychoactive compound psilocybin in 1958 swiss chemist albert hofmann reported a relatively low concentration of 0 02 psilocybin but this analysis was performed on two year old specimens jonathan ott and guzman indicated presence of psilocybin in variety in terms of psychoactive potency paul stamets rates p aztecorum as moderately to highly active statue of aztec god of flowers xochipilli a 16th century stone effigy unearthed on side of volcano popocatepetl depicts a single figure seated cross legged upon a temple like base his body is covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms circular patterns on his kneecaps right forearm and headdress have been interpreted by r gordon wasson as stylized fruit bodies of psilocybe aztecorum wasson says that convex shape and incurved margins depicted in these images show mushroom caps just before maturity p aztecorum is in addition to p caerulescens one of two mushrooms thought to be species described by 16th century spanish chronicler bernardino de sahagun as teonanacatl word teonanacatl has been variously translated as sacred or divine mushroom or as flesh of gods these mushrooms considered holy sacraments by aztecs were consumed during spiritual and divinatory rituals to induce hallucinatory visions stamets 1996 pp 11 2 psilocybe aztecorum is still used ceremonially by indigenous people of oaxaca stamets 1996 p 110 and by nahua people in popocatepetl region although this usage is gradually diminishing traditional folk healers or maintain familiarity with psychoactive mushrooms and other mind altering plants used in ceremonial rituals and diagnose illnesses by having client ingest mushrooms one mixe initiation ritual involves ingestion of mushrooms following a period of abstinence from talking sexual intercourse and all foods except nuts for three days whereupon individual goes up to a mountain subsists on nothing but a little honey and prays to god for power to heal lipp 1998 pp 150 1 see also legal status of psilocybin
