single scene roberts believes it was enough to secure his call back for part of joseph he recalls that it got attention of producers and that actress amanda mealing who portrayed connie beauchamp put a good word in for him he felt lucky to join alongside chambers and rosie marcel as jac naylor due to feeling of solidarity which developed between them as preparation for role roberts observed open

series medical advisers having become a regular holby city viewer from time of his appearance as daniel actor had a contextual basis for storylines upon his return as joseph who he deemed a very complex character characterisation roberts described joseph as an awkward and very bookish character one who struggled to relate to his patients in contrast to happy go lucky sam which resulted in comedy as sam is antithesis of joe he also deemed his character incredibly honest and morally upright a total oddball with all sorts of hang ups and as being very stuck in his ways during his tenure
