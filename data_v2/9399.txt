thumb cover of august 15 1919 issue artwork by sidney h 1991 p 252 thrill book was a u s pulp magazine published by street smith in 1919 it was intended to carry different stories this meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable which in practice often meant that stories were fantasy or science fiction first eight issues edited by harold hersey were a mixture of adventure and weird stories contributors included greye la spina charles fulton oursler j h coryell and seabury quinn hersey was replaced by ronald oliphant with july 1 issue probably because street smith were unhappy with his performance oliphant printed more science fiction and fantasy than hersey had done though this included two stories by murray leinster which hersey had purchased before being replaced most famous story from thrill book is heads of cerberus a very early example of a novel about alternate time tracks by francis stevens oliphant was given a larger budget than hersey and was able to acquire material by popular writers such as h bedford jones but he was only able to produce eight more issues before end came last issue was dated october 15 1919 it was probably cancelled because of poor sales although a printers strike at that time may have been a factor although thrill book has been described as first american pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction this description is not supported by recent historians of field who regard it instead as a stepping stone on path that ultimately led to weird tales and amazing stories first true specialized magazines in fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively publication history left thumb cover of july 15 1919 issue artwork by charles 1991 p 250 in late 19th century popular magazines typically did not print fiction to exclusion of other content they would include non fiction articles and poetry as well in october 1896 frank a munsey company s argosy magazine was first to switch to printing only fiction and in december of that year it switched to using cheap wood pulp paper this is now regarded by magazine historians as having been start of pulp magazine era for twenty years pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre but in 1915 influential magazine publisher street smith began to issue titles that focused on a particular niche such as detective story magazine and western story magazine thus pioneering specialized and single genre pulps murray 2011 p 11 in midst of these changes some time in 1918 street smith s circulation manager henry ralston decided to launch a new magazine to publish different stories different meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable in some way which in most cases meant that they included either fantasy or science fiction elements bleiler 1991 pp 4 5 in fiction factory quentin reynolds history of street smith reynolds asserts that magazine was brainchild of ormond g smith one of publishers but pulp historian will murray regards this as unlikely to be full story given that reynolds book was written almost forty years later and was an approved history murray asserts that ralston was certainly involved in creation of thrill book walter adolphe roberts editor of street smith s s magazine told a friend of his harold hersey that ralston was looking for an editor for a new magazine hersey had sold some writing to pulps but his editorial experience was limited to no more than a year s work on several little magazines bleiler 1991 p 4 he met with ralston in early 1919 and was immediately hired on basis of interview it is possible that eugene a clancy editor of street smith s popular magazine was originally intended to be editor of thrill book but was unable to take on additional work though clancy did assist hersey on some issues of thrill book murray 2011 pp 11 16 bringing hersey on as editor was unfortunate historians of field describe hersey as lacking talent both as a writer and an editor hulse 2013 p 218 murray 2011 pp 13 15 bleiler 1991 p 2 first issue of thrill book was dated march 1 1919 and was published in a format similar to that of a dime novel choice of format was probably a mistake as it was associated in minds of buying public with low quality fiction aimed at readers with very low standards bleiler 1991 p 7 plan to publish twice a month indicated that street smith were confident that new magazine would be successful with ninth issue dated july 1 1919 hersey was replaced by ronald oliphant bleiler 1991 p 10 reason he was replaced is not clear though several explanations have been suggested murray leinster claimed that hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in magazine according to leinster some of poetry may have actually been written by hersey s mother rather than by hersey himself pulp historian richard bleiler regards this theory as unlikely since although up to eighteen of twenty five short poems in first eight issues of magazine may have been by hersey only two stories in those issues are definitely by him and there are only four other stories which may have been hersey s work published under a pseudonym bleiler suggests that at most street smith would have reprimanded hersey and that real reason for his dismissal is more likely to be that street smith were dissatisfied with thrill book under his editorship bleiler also suggests that hersey may have started rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure bleiler 1991 pp 10 13 hersey himself claimed that he was not fired but quit i wasn t fired but i should have been i saw handwriting on wall ahead of time i asked to be relieved of my duties and my request was promptly accepted at same time that oliphant was appointed editor layout of magazine was changed to that of a standard pulp at 160 pages this offered readers much better value for money than 48 page dime novel format of first eight issues even with a price increase from 10 to 15 cents a question and answer department cross trails was begun in imitation of a similar feature in adventure most successful pulp magazine of day and format change may also have been done to increase resemblance of two magazines along with a change to appearance of thrill book s contents page to resemble that of adventure bleiler 1991 pp 13 15 street smith cancelled magazine after sixteenth issue dated october 15 a printers strike has often been suggested as reason though hersey denied it in his reminiscences and it is clear that poor sales were at least part of reason for cancellation stories were still being acquired for magazine by street smith in november and since final issue would have appeared on newsstands some time in september this implies that magazine went on hiatus possibly because of printers strike with expectation of returning perhaps on a less frequent schedule a note in street smith s files records cancellation date as december 1 1919 which may indicate point at which delay caused by strike convinced street smith to finally kill magazine murray 2011 pp 19 20 contents and reception thumb cover of first issue dated march 1 1919 artwork by sidney h riesenberg is shabby and second rate according to richard bleiler hersey began by making himself familiar with work of writers already in market who were capable of producing kind of material ralston wanted he soon concluded that new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside original material budget did not permit hersey to pay rates that would attract top quality writers nor even to reprint best known stories of kind he was looking for and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as perley poore sheehan and robert w sneddon hersey distributed a notice to writers that described what he was looking for strange bizarre occult mysterious tales mystic happenings weird adventures feats of leger de main spiritualism et cetera if you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write too weird or strange let us see it this did not restrict submissions to fantasy or science fiction and as a result hersey received and printed all kinds of fiction including mysteries adventures and love stories murray 2011 p 15 though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill magazine ashley 2000 pp 37 40 hersey later recalled that notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts as a result of notices in writers magazines i received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten first issue included wolf of steppes a werewolf story by greye la spina this had been submitted to popular magazine but purchased by clancy for thrill book in 1918 when street smith began making plans for new magazine story was first by la spina whose real name was fanny greye bragg she would go on to publish several more stories in thrill book and later became a regular contributor to weird tales murray 2011 p 16 another first story was thing that wept by charles fulton oursler who later went on to edit liberty and to write novels under name anthony abbot 2011 p 293 bleiler 1991 p 34 two serials were begun in first issue jeweled ibis by j c and in shadows of race by j hampton bishop both contained enough fantastic or science fictional elements to fit original plans for magazine jeweled ibis was about worshippers of ancient egyptian gods and bishop s story was about a lost race in africa and included intelligent apes cover for first issue was by sidney h riesenberg bleiler describes it as shabby and second rate by comparison to cover art in successful magazines of day such as adventure and detective story magazine bleiler 1991 pp 6 7 may 1 issue included an early short story by seabury quinn stone image which features a character named dr who would later appear renamed dr trowbridge in quinn s popular occult detective stories about jules de grandin though quinn had not yet invented de grandin tod robbins a well regarded writer of fantasy supplied several short pieces all shallow mood sketches without much substance in opinion of science fiction historian mike ashley contributors included sophie louise wenzel who later published stories in weird tales under name sophie wenzel ellis but most of writers from hersey s editorship such as george c jenks and john r coryell both authors of dime novels are no longer well known names when oliphant took over editorship he placed notices in writers magazines looking for more submissions bleiler 1991 pp 6 16 much of material published under oliphant s editorship would have been bought by hersey making it hard to judge oliphant s impact murray 2011 p 17 however it is clear that oliphant bought more science fiction and fantasy stories than hersey had done in particular hersey had published almost no stories that were straightforward science fiction though two he did purchase murray leinster s a thousand degrees below zero and silver menace appeared in first few issues of oliphant s editorship stories such as lost days by trainor lansing which dealt with perceptions of time and ultimate ingredient by greye la spina about invisibility published in august and october respectively were more evidence of this change in emphasis most famous science fiction to appear in thrill book was francis stevens novel heads of cerberus which was one of earliest fictional depictions of alternate timelines murray 2011 p 19 in addition to increasing science fiction content oliphant also brought in authors who were better known than those published under hersey s editorship including h bedford jones and william wallace cook it seems likely that fiction budget increased when oliphant took control and he used this to pay higher word rates to better writers hersey had paid about a cent per word for fiction but bedford jones received 800 for opium ship which was a rate of between 2 5 and 3 cents per word however francis stevens was paid only 400 or less than a cent per word for much longer novel heads of cerberus bleiler 1991 p 15 poetry continued to appear including several more poems by hersey and also including dissonance by clark ashton smith whom hersey had contacted in march asking for submissions in what will murray describes as a rare instance of hersey s editorial foresight thumb upright cover of last issue artwork by james reynolds left when thrill book ceased publication street smith had numerous manuscripts in inventory that had been purchased for magazine these were offered to other street smith magazines such as sea stories over next few years greye la spina bought back her manuscript to dead wagon in 1927 and re sold it to weird tales francis stevens had sold three serials and three short stories to thrill book that remained unpublished one of serials serapion was published in argosy in 1920 but fate of other two is not known they may have been earlier titles for known works of hers three short stories are not known to have been published elsewhere in 1940 john l nanovic editor of doc savage and shadow reviewed remaining thrill book manuscripts and suggested to ralston that a few stories might be publishable in love story magazine and also suggested a few stories that john w campbell might be interested in for unknown following year oliphant reviewed ten of manuscripts and returned them to nanovic with his recommendations campbell reviewed three of them and declined to take any he also declined to take murray leinster s great catastrophe which had been submitted to thrill book and found independently of nanovic s review other magazines that considered and rejected stories oliphant recommended included clues mystery and detective story magazine murray 2011 pp 22 24 only story from thrill book s inventory that was used from this review was clyde broadwell s speed demon s vendetta which was rewritten and published in avenger in march 1942 under pseudonym denby brixton which broadwell had used for a story he had sold to thrill book bleiler 1991 pp 72 73 murray 2011 pp 24 25 in 1976 manuscripts were reviewed again by will murray by this time they had been donated to syracuse university by conde nast which had acquired street smith in 1961 ten stories reviewed by oliphant were found and plans were made for odyssey publications to publish a paperback edition of thrill book material including these stories along with some reprints following year another group of thrill book manuscripts was found in syracuse collection including leinster s great catastrophe and la spina s bracelet and planned contents of anthology were revised to include some of this material none of francis stevens stories were found in either group of manuscripts one story as it is written by de ferree cass was misidentified by murray as work of clark ashton smith and this led to delays in publication as odyssey made separate plans to publish story under smith s name misidentification was not discovered until after story appeared in print in 1982 four years later odyssey went out of business and anthology of thrill book material never appeared murray 2011 pp 25 26 because thrill book was only sold in selected parts of us copies of magazine are very scarce and are highly prized by pulp magazine collectors murray 2011 p 26 despite its rarity or perhaps because of it it has been often described as first science fiction and fantasy magazine ever published though more recent assessments by science fiction and pulp historians agree instead that magazine was a failed attempt at specialization in words of will murray view that thrill book is first such magazine is erroneously held by many and he adds that it was merely a prologue to golden era of periodical weird fiction in murray s opinion it might well have become a dominant force in genre had it continued publication richard bleiler comments that it was a magazine that somehow became a symbol to a generation of pulp readers it was first eidetic flash of a dream that would later come into being with weird tales bleiler 1991 p 20 and in mike ashley s opinion it was just a step towards a full blown fantasy magazine bibliographic details thrill book was published by street smith initially magazine was saddle stapled in by 8 in 48 pages long and priced at 10 cents this changed with ninth issue dated july 1 1919 to pulp format with 160 pages priced at 15 cents editor was harold hersey from march 1 1919 to june 15 1919 and ronald oliphant thereafter ashley 1985 pp 661 664 there were eight issues to first volume six in second and two in third and final volume bleiler 1991 pp 49 50 hersey later recalled that he had heard of a thrill book quarterly being issued but no evidence of such a magazine has been found murray 2011 p 20 two issues of thrill book have been reprinted in facsimile editions both by wildside press september 1 1919 issue published in 2005 and first issue march 1 1919 which appeared in 2011 notes references sources external links category magazines
