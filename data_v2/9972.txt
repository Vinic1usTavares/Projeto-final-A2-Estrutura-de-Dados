brooklyn bridge is a hybrid cable stayed suspension bridge in new york city it connects boroughs of manhattan and brooklyn spanning east river brooklyn bridge has a main span of and a deck height of above mean high water it is one of oldest roadway bridges in united states and was world s first steel wire suspension bridge as well as first fixed crossing across east river span was originally called new york and brooklyn bridge and east river bridge but was officially renamed brooklyn bridge in 1915 proposals for a bridge connecting manhattan and brooklyn were first made in early 19th century these plans eventually led to construction of current span designed by washington roebling while construction started in 1870 numerous controversies and novelty of construction process caused work to be prolonged over thirteen years and bridge opened on may 24 1883 over years brooklyn bridge has undergone several reconfigurations having carried horse drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950 to alleviate increasing traffic flows numerous bridges and tunnels were built to north and south following gradual deterioration brooklyn bridge was renovated several times with major renovations in 1950s 1980s and 2010s brooklyn bridge is southernmost of four toll free vehicular bridges connecting manhattan island and long island with manhattan williamsburg and queensboro bridges to north only vehicular pedestrian and bicycle traffic traffic are permitted with commercial vehicles being banned a major tourist attraction since its opening brooklyn bridge has become an icon of new york city over years bridge has been used as location of various stunts and performances as well as several crimes and attacks brooklyn bridge was designated a national historic landmark in 1964 and a national historic civil engineering landmark by american society of civil engineers in 1972 brooklyn bridge is also a new york city designated landmark description technically a suspension

bridge is a total of long when measured between curbs at park row in manhattan and sands street in brooklyn a separate measurement of is sometimes stated distance from curb at centre street in manhattan suspension span main span between two suspension towers is long and wide navigational clearance is above mean high water mhw during construction harbor pilot joseph henderson regarded as one of most experienced and trustworthy of new york s sandy hook pilots was called upon as an expert seaman to determine height above mhw for brooklyn bridge s main span side spans between each suspension tower and each side s suspension anchorages are each long at time of construction engineers had not yet discovered aerodynamics of bridge construction and bridge designs were not tested in wind tunnels it was coincidental that open truss structure supporting deck is by its nature less subject to aerodynamic problems this is because john a roebling designed brooklyn bridge s truss system to be six to eight times as strong as he thought it needed to be however due to use of inferior quality cable in initial construction bridge was only four times as strong as necessary main span and side spans are supported by a structure containing six trusses running parallel to roadway each of which is deep trusses allow brooklyn bridge to hold a total load of a design consideration from when it originally carried heavier elevated trains these trusses are held up by suspender ropes which hang downward from each of four main cables crossbeams run between trusses at top and diagonal and vertical stiffening beams run on outside and inside of each roadway an elevated pedestrian and cycling promenade runs in between two roadways and above them it typically runs below level of crossbeams except at areas surrounding each tower here promenade rises to just above level of crossbeams connecting to a balcony that slightly overhangs each of two roadways path is generally wide approaches each of side spans is reached by an approach ramp approach ramp from brooklyn side is shorter than approach ramp from manhattan side approaches are supported by renaissance style arches made of masonry arch openings themselves were filled with brick walls with small windows within approach ramp contains nine arch or iron girder bridges across side streets in manhattan and brooklyn cables thumb view of diagonal stays and vertical suspender cables main cables are at top alt brooklyn bridge is supported by four main cables which descend from tops of suspension towers and help support deck two are located to outside of bridge s roadways while two are located in median of roadways each main cable measures in diameter and contains 5 282 parallel galvanized steel wires wrapped closely together in a cylindrical shape these wires are bundled in 19 individual strands with 278 wires to a strand this was first use of bundling in a suspension bridge and took several months for workers to tie together from main cables hang a series of 24 watt led lighting fixtures referred to as necklace lights due to their shape in addition 1 520 galvanized steel wire suspender cables hang downward from main cables and another 400 cable stays extend diagonally from towers these wires directly hold up truss structure around bridge deck anchorages each side of bridge contains an anchorage for main cables anchorages are trapezoidal limestone structures located slightly inland of shore measuring at base and at top each anchorage weighs manhattan anchorage rests on a foundation of bedrock while brooklyn anchorage rests on clay anchorages both have four anchor plates one for each of main cables which are located near ground level and parallel to ground anchor plates measure with a thickness of and weigh each each anchor plate is connected to respective main cable by two sets of nine eyebars each of which is about long and up to thick chains of eyebars curve downward from cables toward anchor plates and eyebars vary in size depending on their position anchorages also contain numerous passageways and compartments starting in 1876 new york city rented out large vaults under bridge s manhattan anchorage in order to fund bridge and they were in constant use during early 20th century vaults were used to store wine as they were consistently kept at due to a lack of air circulation manhattan vault was called blue grotto because of a shrine to virgin mary next to an opening at entrance vaults were closed for public use in late 1910s and 1920s during world war i and prohibition but were reopened thereafter when new york magazine visited one of cellars in 1978 it discovered on wall a fading inscription reading who loveth not wine women and song he a fool his whole life long leakage in vaults necessitated repairs during late 1980s and early 1990s by late 1990s chambers were being used to store maintenance equipment towers thumb characteristic pointed arches of bridge s

quarry in essex county new york granite blocks were quarried and shaped on vinalhaven island maine under a contract with bodwell granite company and delivered from maine to new york by schooner manhattan tower contains of masonry while brooklyn tower has of masonry each tower contains a pair of gothic revival pointed arches through which roadways run arch openings are tall and wide tops of towers are located above floor of each arch opening while floors of openings are located an additional above mean water level giving towers a total height of above mean water towers rest on underwater caissons giant upside down boxes made of southern yellow pine both caissons contain interior spaces that were used by construction workers manhattan side s caisson is slightly larger measuring and located below high water while brooklyn side s caisson measures and is located below high water caissons were designed to hold even though towers would only exert pressure of when built brooklyn side s caisson which was built first originally had a height of and a ceiling composed of five layers of timber each layer tall ten more layers of timber were later added atop ceiling and entire caisson was wrapped in tin and wood for further protection against flooding thickness of caisson s sides was at both bottom and top caisson had six chambers two each for dredging supply shafts and airlocks manhattan side s caisson was slightly different because it had to be installed at a lower depth in addition to having seven additional layers of timber on top of 15 layers in its brooklyn counterpart manhattan caisson had fifty diameter pipes for sand removal a fireproof iron boilerplate interior and different airlocks and communication systems history planning thumb alt early plan of one tower for brooklyn bridge 1867 early brooklyn bridge tower plan 1867 proposals for a bridge between then separate cities of brooklyn and new york had been suggested as early as 1800 at time only travel between two cities was by various ferry lines engineers presented various designs such as chain or link bridges though these were never built due to difficulties of constructing a high enough fixed span bridge across extremely busy east river there were also proposals for tunnels under east river but these were considered prohibitively expensive current brooklyn bridge was conceived by german immigrant john augustus roebling in 1852 he had previously designed and constructed shorter suspension bridges such as roebling s delaware aqueduct in lackawaxen pennsylvania and john a roebling suspension bridge between cincinnati ohio and covington kentucky in february 1867 new york state senate passed a bill that allowed construction of a suspension bridge from brooklyn to manhattan two months later new york and brooklyn bridge company was incorporated with a board of directors later converted to a board of trustees there were twenty trustees in total eight each appointed by mayors of new york and brooklyn as well as mayors of each city and auditor and comptroller of brooklyn company was tasked with constructing what was then known as new york and brooklyn bridge span was also alternatively referred to as just brooklyn bridge a name originating from a january 25 1867 letter to editor sent to brooklyn daily eagle act of incorporation which became law on april 16 1867 authorized cities of new york now manhattan and brooklyn to subscribe to 5 million in capital stock which would fund bridge s construction roebling was subsequently named main engineer of work and by september 1867 had presented a master plan according to plan bridge would be longer and taller than any suspension bridge previously built it would incorporate roadways and elevated rail tracks whose tolls and fares would provide means to pay for bridge s construction and would also include a raised promenade that also served as a leisurely pathway proposal received much acclaim in both cities and residents predicted that new york and brooklyn bridge s opening would have as much of an impact as suez canal first transatlantic telegraph cable or first transcontinental railroad by early 1869 however some people started to negatively criticize project saying either that bridge was too expensive or that construction process was too difficult to allay concerns about design of new york and brooklyn bridge roebling set up a bridge party in march 1869 where he invited engineers and members of u s congress to see his other spans after bridge party concluded that april roebling and several engineers conducted final surveys during process it was found that main span would have to be raised from above mhw requiring several changes to overall design in june 1869 while conducting these surveys roebling sustained a crush injury to his foot when a ferry pinned it against a piling after amputation of his crushed toes he developed a tetanus infection that left him incapacitated and resulted in his death following month washington roebling john roebling s 32 year old son was then hired to fill his father s role when younger roebling was hired tammany hall leader william m tweed also became involved in bridge s construction because as a major landowner in new york city he had an interest in project s completion construction caissons alt left thumb diagram of caisson construction of brooklyn bridge began on january 2 1870 first work entailed construction of two caissons upon which suspension towers would be built brooklyn side s caisson was built at webb bell shipyard in greenpoint brooklyn and was launched into river on march 19 1870 compressed air was pumped into caisson and workers entered space to dig sediment until caisson sank to bedrock once caisson had reached desired depth it was to be filled in with vertical brick piers and concrete however due to unexpectedly high concentration of large boulders atop riverbed brooklyn caisson took several months to sink at desired rate furthermore in december 1870 timber roof of brooklyn caisson caught fire delaying construction further great blowout as fire was called delayed construction for several months since holes in caisson had to be repaired on march 6 1871 repairs were finished and caisson had reached its final depth of it was filled with concrete five days later overall about 264 individuals were estimated to have worked in caisson every day but because of high worker turnover about 2 500 men in total were estimated to have worked in caisson in spite of this only a few workers were paralyzed at its final depth caisson had an air pressure of manhattan side s caisson was next structure to be built and to ensure that it would not catch fire like its counterpart had manhattan caisson was lined with fireproof plate iron it was launched from webb bell s shipyard on may 11 1871 and maneuvered into place that september due to extreme underwater air pressure inside much deeper manhattan caisson many workers became sick with decompression sickness during this work despite incorporation of airlocks this condition was unknown at time and was first called caisson disease by project physician andrew smith between january 25 and may 31 1872 smith treated 110 cases of decompression sickness while three workers died from disease when iron probes underneath manhattan caisson found bedrock to be even deeper than expected washington roebling halted construction due to increased risk of decompression sickness after manhattan caisson reached a depth of with an air pressure of washington deemed sandy subsoil overlying bedrock beneath to be sufficiently firm and subsequently infilled caisson with concrete in july 1872 washington roebling himself suffered a paralyzing injury as a result of caisson disease shortly after ground was broken for brooklyn tower foundation washington s debilitating condition left him unable to physically supervise construction firsthand so he designed caissons and other equipment from his apartment his wife emily warren roebling provided written communications between her husband and engineers on site emily understood higher mathematics calculations of catenary curves strengths of materials bridge specifications and intricacies of cable construction and so she spent next 11 years helping supervise bridge s construction towers alt stereoscopic views of construction of manhattan tower thumb stereoscopic views of construction of manhattan tower after caissons were completed piers were constructed atop each caisson upon which masonry towers would be built construction of towers themselves was a complex process that took four years since masonry blocks were heavy builders transported blocks to base of towers using a pulley system with a continuous diameter steel wire rope operated by steam engines at ground level blocks were then carried upward via a timber track alongside each tower then maneuvered into proper position using a derrick atop towers blocks sometimes vibrated ropes due to their heaviness but only once did a block actually fall down suspension towers started construction in mid 1872 and by time work was halted for winter in late 1872 parts of each tower had already been constructed by mid 1873 there was substantial progress on towers construction brooklyn side s tower had reached a height of above mean high water while manhattan side s tower had reached above mhw arches of brooklyn tower were completed by august 1874 tower as a whole was substantially finished by december 1874 with erection of saddle plates for main cables at top of tower however ornamentation on brooklyn tower could not be completed until manhattan tower was finished last stone on brooklyn tower was raised in june 1875 and manhattan tower was completed in july 1876 saddle plates atop both towers were also raised in july 1876 work was dangerous by 1876 three workers had died by falling from towers while nine other workers had been killed in other accidents thumb left george bradford brainerd from bridge tower c 1872 brooklyn museum alt george bradford brainerd s painting from bridge tower circa 1872 while towers were being constructed in 1875 project had depleted its original 5 million budget two bridge commissioners one each from brooklyn and manhattan petitioned new york state lawmakers to allot another 8 million for construction ultimately legislators passed a law authorizing allotment under condition that cities would buy stock of brooklyn bridge s private stockholders work proceeded concurrently on anchorages on each side brooklyn anchorage broke ground in january 1873 and was subsequently substantially completed in august 1875 manhattan anchorage was built in less time having started in may 1875 it was mostly completed in july 1876 anchorages could not be fully completed until main cables were spun at which point another six feet would be added to height of each 80 foot anchorage cables first temporary wire was stretched between towers on august 15 1876 using chrome steel provided by chrome steel company of brooklyn wire was then stretched back across river and two ends were spliced to form a traveler a lengthy loop of wire connecting towers which was driven by a steam hoisting engine at ground level wire would be one of two that would be used to create a temporary footbridge for workers while cable spinning was ongoing next step was to send an engineer across already completed traveler wire in a boatswain s chair slung from wire to ensure that wire was safe enough bridge s master mechanic e f farrington was selected for this task and an estimated crowd of 10 000 people on both shores watched him cross a second traveler wire was then stretched across span a task that was completed by august 30 temporary footbridge located some above elevation of future deck was completed in february 1877 by december 1876 a steel contract for permanent cables still had not been awarded there was disagreement over whether bridge s cables should use as yet untested bessemer steel or well proven crucible steel until a permanent contract was awarded builders ordered of wire in interim 10 tons each from three companies including washington roebling s own steel mill in brooklyn in end it was decided to use 8 mm birmingham gauge crucible steel and a request for bids was distributed to which eight companies responded in january 1877 a contract for crucible steel was awarded to j lloyd haigh whom roebling distrusted but who was associated with bridge trustee abram hewitt spinning of wires required manufacture of large coils of wire which were galvanized but not oiled when they left factory coils were delivered to a yard near brooklyn anchorage where they were dipped in linseed oil hoisted to top of anchorage dried out and spliced into a single wire and finally coated with red zinc for further galvanizing there were thirty two drums at anchorage yard eight for each of four main cables of which each drum had a capacity of of wire first experimental wire for main cables was stretched between towers on may 29 1877 and spinning began two weeks later all four main cables were being strung by that july during that time temporary footbridge was unofficially opened to general public who could receive visitor s passes by august 1877 several thousand visitors from around world had used footbridge visitor passes ceased that september after a visitor had an epileptic seizure and nearly fell off as wires were being spun work also commenced on demolition of buildings on either side of river for brooklyn bridge s approaches this work was mostly complete by september 1877 following month initial contracts were awarded for suspender wires which would hang downward from main cables and support deck by may 1878 main cables were more than two thirds complete however following month one of wires slipped killing two people and injuring three others a subsequent investigation discovered that j lloyd haigh had substituted inferior quality wire in cables of eighty rings of wire that were tested only five met standards and it was estimated that haigh had earned 300 000 from deception at this point it was too late to replace cables that had already been constructed roebling determined that poorer wire would leave bridge only four times as strong as necessary rather than six to eight times as strong so inferior quality wire was allowed to remain and 150 extra cables were added contract for remaining wire was awarded to john a roebling s sons company and by october 5 1878 last of main cables wires went over river not everyone supported construction of brooklyn bridge and there was substantial opposition from shipbuilders and merchants located upstream who argued that bridge would not provide sufficient clearance underneath for ships in may 1876 these groups led by abraham miller filed a lawsuit in united states district court for southern district of new york against cities of new york and brooklyn supreme court decided in 1883 that brooklyn bridge was a lawful structure nearing completion thumb right chromolithograph of great east river suspension bridge brooklyn bridge by currier and ives 1883 after suspender wires had been placed workers began erecting steel crossbeams to support roadway as part of bridge s overall superstructure construction started on superstructure in march 1879 but as with cables trustees initially disagreed on whether steel superstructure should be made of bessemer or crucible steel that july trustees decided to award a contract for of bessemer steel to edgemoor or edge moor iron works based in philadelphia to be delivered by 1880 trustees later passed another resolution for another 500 short tons of bessemer steel however by february 1880 steel deliveries had not started that october bridge trustees questioned edgemoor s president about delay in steel deliveries despite edgemoor s assurances that contract would be fulfilled deliveries still had not been completed by november 1881 brooklyn mayor seth low who became part of board of trustees in 1882 became chairman of a committee tasked to investigate edgemoor s failure to fulfill contract when questioned edgemoor s president stated that delays were fault of another contractor cambria iron company who was manufacturing eyebars for bridge trusses at that point contract was supposed to be complete by october 1882 further complicating situation washington roebling had failed to appear at trustees meeting in june 1882 since he had gone to newport rhode island after news media discovered this most of newspapers called for roebling to be fired as chief engineer with exception of daily state gazette of trenton new jersey and brooklyn daily eagle some of more longstanding trustees including henry c murphy james s t and william c kingsley were willing to vouch for roebling since construction progress on brooklyn bridge was still ongoing however roebling s behavior was considered suspect among younger trustees who had joined board more recently construction on bridge itself was noted in formal reports that murphy presented each month to mayors of new york and brooklyn for example murphy s report in august 1882 noted that month s progress included 114 intermediate cords erected within a week as well as 72 diagonal stays 60 posts and numerous floor beams bridging trusses and stay bars by early 1883 brooklyn bridge was considered mostly completed and was projected to open that june contracts for bridge lighting were awarded by february 1883 and a toll scheme was approved that march opening thumb left newspaper headline announcing opening alt new york and brooklyn bridge was opened for use on may 24 1883 thousands of people attended opening ceremony and many ships were present in east river for occasion officially emily warren roebling was first to cross bridge bridge opening was also attended by u s president chester a arthur and new york mayor franklin edson who crossed bridge and shook hands with brooklyn mayor seth low at brooklyn end though washington roebling was unable to attend ceremony and rarely visited site again he held a celebratory banquet at his house on day of bridge opening further festivity included performance of a band gunfire from ships and a fireworks display on that first day a total of 1 800 vehicles and 150 300 people crossed span less than a week after brooklyn bridge opened ferry crews reported a sharp drop in patronage while bridge s toll operators were processing over a hundred people a minute however cross river ferries continued to operate until 1942 thumb right upright 1 1 bird s eye view of great new york and brooklyn bridge and grand display of fire works on opening night bridge had cost in 1883 dollars about us in to build of which brooklyn paid two thirds bonds to fund construction would not be paid off until 1956 an estimated 27 men died during its construction since new york and brooklyn bridge was only bridge across east river at that time it was also called east river bridge another popular nickname was brooklyn bridge because of economic benefits new crossing provided to city of brooklyn until construction of nearby williamsburg bridge in 1903 new york and brooklyn bridge was longest suspension bridge in world times longer than any previously built at time of opening brooklyn bridge was not yet complete proposed public transit across bridge was still being tested while brooklyn approach was being completed on may 30 1883 six days after opening a woman falling down a stairway at brooklyn approach caused a stampede which resulted in at least twelve people being crushed and killed in subsequent lawsuits brooklyn bridge company was acquitted of negligence however company did install emergency phone boxes and additional railings and trustees approved a fireproofing plan for bridge public transit service started with opening of new york and brooklyn bridge railway a cable car service on september 25 1883 on may 17 1884 one of circus master p t barnum s most famous attractions elephant jumbo led a parade of 21 elephants over brooklyn bridge this helped to lessen doubts about bridge s stability while also promoting barnum s circus late 19th through early 20th centuries thumb seen in 1899 patronage across brooklyn bridge increased in years after it opened a million people paid to cross in six months after it opened bridge carried 8 5 million people in 1884 its first full year of operation this number doubled to 17 million in 1885 and again to 34 million in 1889 many of these people were cable car passengers additionally about 4 5 million pedestrians a year were crossing bridge for free by 1892 trolley tracks were added in center lanes of both roadways in 1898 allowing trolleys to use bridge as well that year formerly separate city of brooklyn was unified with new york city and brooklyn bridge fell under city control concerns about brooklyn bridge s safety were raised during turn of century in 1898 traffic backups due to a dead horse caused one of truss cords to buckle there were more significant worries after twelve suspender cables snapped in 1901 though a thorough investigation found no other defects after 1901 incident five inspectors were hired to examine bridge each day a service that cost 250 000 a year brooklyn rapid transit company which operated routes across brooklyn bridge issued a notice in 1905 saying that bridge had reached its transit capacity by 1890 due to popularity of brooklyn bridge there were proposals to construct other bridges across east river between manhattan and long island although a second deck for brooklyn bridge was proposed it was thought to be infeasible because doing so would overload bridge s structural capacity first new bridge across east river williamsburg bridge opened upstream in 1903 and connected williamsburg brooklyn with lower east side of manhattan this was followed by queensboro bridge between queens and manhattan in march 1909 and manhattan bridge between brooklyn and manhattan in december 1909 several subway railroad and road tunnels were also constructed which helped to accelerate development of manhattan brooklyn and queens though tolls were instituted for carriages and cable car customers since bridge s opening pedestrians were originally spared from tolls however by first decade of 20th century pedestrians were paying tolls as well in july 1911 tolls on all four east river bridges were abolished as part of a populist policy initiative headed by new york city mayor william jay gaynor city government passed a bill to officially name structure brooklyn bridge in january 1915 ostensibly in an attempt to reduce traffic on nearby city streets grover whalen commissioner of plant and structures banned motor vehicles from brooklyn bridge in 1922 real reason for ban was an incident same year where two cables slipped due to high traffic loads both whalen and roebling called for renovation of brooklyn bridge and construction of a parallel bridge though parallel bridge was never built mid to late 20th century upgrades thumb ramp from brooklyn bridge to fdr drive completed 1969 alt ramp from brooklyn bridge to fdr drive completed circa 1969 first major upgrade to brooklyn bridge commenced in 1948 when a contract for redesigning bridge was awarded to david b steinman upgrade was expected to nearly double capacity of bridge s roadways to 6 000 cars per hour at a projected cost of 7 million renovation included demolition of both elevated and trolley tracks on roadways removal of trusses separating inner elevated tracks from existing vehicle lanes and widening of each roadway from two to three lanes as well as construction of a new steel and concrete floor in addition new ramps were added to adams street cadman plaza and brooklyn queens expressway bqe on brooklyn side and to park row on manhattan side trolley tracks closed in march 1950 to allow for widening work to occur during construction project one roadway at a time was closed allowing reduced traffic flows to cross bridge in one direction only widened south roadway was completed in may 1951 followed by north roadway in october 1953 restoration was finished in may 1954 with completion of reconstructed elevated promenade while rebuilding of span was ongoing a fallout shelter was constructed beneath manhattan approach in anticipation of cold war abandoned space in one of masonry arches was stocked with emergency survival supplies for a potential nuclear attack by soviet union these supplies remained in place half a century later in addition defensive barriers were added to bridge as a safeguard against sabotage simultaneous with rebuilding of brooklyn bridge a double decked viaduct for bqe was being built through an existing steel overpass of bridge s brooklyn approach ramp segment of bqe from brooklyn bridge south to atlantic avenue opened in june 1954 but direct ramp from northbound bqe to manhattan bound brooklyn bridge did not open until 1959 city also widened adams street approach in brooklyn between bridge and fulton street from between 1954 and 1955 subsequently boerum place from fulton street south to atlantic avenue was also widened this required demolition of old kings county courthouse towers were cleaned in 1958 and brooklyn anchorage was repaired next year on manhattan side city approved a controversial rebuilding of manhattan entrance plaza in 1953 project which would add a grade separated junction over park row was hotly contested because it would require demolition of 21 structures including old new york world building reconstruction also necessitated relocation of 410 families on park row in december 1956 city started a two year renovation of plaza requiring closure of one roadway at a time similar to during rebuilding of bridge itself work on redeveloping area around manhattan approach started in mid 1960s and at same time plans were announced for direct ramps to fdr drive elevated highway to alleviate congestion at approach ramp from fdr drive to brooklyn bridge was opened in 1968 followed by ramp from bridge to fdr drive next year a single ramp from manhattan bound brooklyn bridge to northbound park row was constructed in 1970 a repainting of bridge was announced two years later in advance of its 90th anniversary deterioration and late 20th century repair thumb brooklyn bridge formerly had steps up to promenade from brooklyn approach seen here in 1982 brooklyn bridge gradually deteriorated due to age and neglect while bridge had 200 full time dedicated maintenance workers before world war ii that number dropped to 5 by late 20th century and city as a whole only had 160 bridge maintenance workers in 1974 heavy vehicles such as vans and buses were banned from bridge to prevent further erosion of concrete roadway a new york times report four years later described that cables were visibly fraying and pedestrian promenade had holes in it city started planning to replace all of brooklyn bridge s cables at a cost of 115 million as part of a larger project to renovate all four toll free east river spans by 1980 brooklyn bridge was in such dire condition that it faced imminent closure in some places half of strands in cables were broken in june 1981 two of diagonal stay cables snapped seriously injuring a pedestrian who later died anchorages were subsequently found to have developed rust and an emergency cable repair was necessitated less than a month later after another cable developed slack following incident city accelerated timetable of its proposed cable replacement and it commenced a 153 million rehabilitation of brooklyn bridge in advance of 100th anniversary as part of project brooklyn bridge s original suspender cables installed by j lloyd haigh were replaced by bethlehem steel in 1986 marking cables first replacement since construction in addition staircase at washington street in brooklyn was renovated stairs from tillary and adams streets were replaced with a ramp and short flights of steps from promenade to each tower s balcony were removed in a smaller project bridge was floodlit at night starting in 1982 to highlight its architectural features additional problems persisted and in 1993 high levels of lead were discovered near bridge s towers further emergency repairs were undertaken in mid 1999 after small concrete shards began falling from brooklyn bridge into east river concrete deck had been installed during 1950s renovations and had a lifespan of about 60 years park row exit from bridge s westbound lanes was closed as a safety measure after september 11 2001 attacks on nearby world trade center that section of park row had been closed off since it ran right underneath 1 police plaza

york times reported that brooklyn bridge approach ramps had received a rating of poor during its inspection in 2007 however a nyc department of transportation spokesman said that poor rating did not indicate a dangerous state but rather implied it required renovation a project equivalent to us in to renovate approaches began in 2010 with full bridge renovation beginning in early 2011 project was originally scheduled to run until 2014 but did not actually finish until april 2015 work included widening two approach ramps from one to two lanes by re striping a new prefabricated ramp raising clearance over eastbound bqe at york street seismic retrofitting replacement of rusted railings and safety barriers and road deck resurfacing work necessitated detours for four years in august 2016 after renovation of bridge deck had been completed new york city department of transportation announced that it would conduct a seven month 370 000 study to verify if bridge could support a heavier upper deck that consisted of an expanded bicycle and pedestrian path about 10 000 pedestrians and 3 500 bikers use pathway on an average weekday work on pedestrian entrance on brooklyn side was underway by 2017 in july 2018 landmarks preservation commission approved a further renovation of brooklyn bridge s suspension towers and approach ramps with construction scheduled to begin in mid 2019

and between roadways not to scale vehicular traffic horse drawn carriages have been allowed to use brooklyn bridge s roadways since its opening originally each of two roadways carried two lanes of a different direction of traffic lanes were relatively narrow at only wide in 1922 motor vehicles were banned from brooklyn bridge while horse drawn carriages were restricted from manhattan bridge thereafter only vehicles allowed on brooklyn bridge were horse drawn since 1950 main roadway has carried six lanes of automobile traffic because of roadway s height posted and weight posted restrictions commercial vehicles and buses are prohibited from using brooklyn bridge due to weight restrictions passenger vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs are also legally not allowed to use bridge though this is not often enforced in practice on brooklyn side vehicles can enter bridge from tillary adams streets to south sands pearl streets to west and exit 28b of eastbound brooklyn queens expressway in manhattan cars can enter from both northbound and southbound fdr drive as well as park row to west chambers centre streets to north and pearl street to south however exit from bridge to northbound park row is closed to traffic exits and entrances vehicular access to bridge is provided by a complex series of ramps on both manhattan and brooklyn sides of bridge there are two

that steam trains would bear excessive loads upon structure of brooklyn bridge cable car line was designed as a steam cable hauled hybrid they were powered from a generating station under brooklyn approach cable cars could not only regulate their speed on upward and downward approaches but also maintain a constant interval between each other there were 24 cable cars in total initially service ran with single car trains but patronage soon grew so much that by october 1883 two car trains were in use line carried three million people in first six months nine million in 1884 and nearly 20 million in 1885 following opening of brooklyn union elevated railroad accordingly track layout was rearranged and more trains were ordered at same time there were highly controversial plans to extend elevated railroads onto brooklyn bridge under pretext of extending bridge itself after disputes trustees agreed to build two elevated routes to bridge on brooklyn side patronage continued to increase and in 1888 tracks were lengthened and even more cars were constructed to allow for four car trains of cable cars electric wires for trolleys were added by 1895 potentially allowing for future decommissioning of steam cable system terminals were rebuilt once more in july 1895 and following implementation of new electric cars in late 1896 steam engines were dismantled and sold following unification of cities of new york and brooklyn in 1898 new york and brooklyn bridge railway ceased to be a separate entity that june and brooklyn rapid transit company brt assumed control of line brt started running through services of elevated trains which ran from park row terminal in manhattan to points in brooklyn via sands street station on brooklyn side before reaching sands street at tillary street for fulton street line trains and at bridge street for fifth avenue line and myrtle avenue line trains elevated trains bound for manhattan were from their steam locomotives elevated trains were then coupled to cable cars which would pull passenger carriages across bridge brt did not run any through services of elevated trains from 1899 to 1901 due to increased patronage following opening of interborough rapid transit company irt s first subway line park row station was rebuilt in 1906 at one point there were plans for brooklyn bridge elevated trains to run underground to brt s proposed chambers street station in manhattan though work on connection was never completed overpass across william street was closed in 1913 to make way for proposed connection but reopened in 1929 after it became clear that connection would not be built after irt s joralemon street tunnel and williamsburg bridge tracks opened in 1908 brooklyn bridge no longer held a monopoly on rail service between manhattan and brooklyn and cable service ceased new subway lines from irt and from brt s successor brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt built in 1910s and 1920s posed significant competition to brooklyn bridge rail services with opening of independent subway system in 1932 and subsequent unification of all three companies into a single entity in 1940 elevated services started to decline and park row and sands street stations were greatly reduced in size fifth avenue and fulton street services across brooklyn bridge were discontinued in 1940 and 1941 respectively and elevated tracks were abandoned permanently with withdrawal of myrtle avenue services in 1944 trolleys a plan for trolley service across brooklyn bridge was presented in 1895 and brooklyn bridge trustees agreed two years later to a plan where trolleys could run across bridge under ten year contracts trolley service which began in 1898 ran on what are now two middle lanes of each roadway shared with other traffic when cable service was withdrawn in 1908 trolley tracks on brooklyn side were rebuilt to alleviate congestion trolley service on middle lanes continued until elevated lines stopped using bridge in 1944 when they moved to protected center tracks on march 5 1950 streetcars also stopped running and bridge was redesigned for automobile traffic exclusively walkway thumb one of pinch points on brooklyn bridge where cables descend below height of girders brooklyn bridge has an elevated promenade open to pedestrians and cyclists in center of bridge located above automobile lanes promenade is usually located below height of girders except at approach ramps leading to each tower s balcony path is generally wide though this is constrained by obstacles such as protruding cables benches and stairways which create pinch points at certain locations path narrows to 10 feet at locations where main cables descend to level of promenade further exacerbating situation these pinch points are some of most popular places to take pictures as a result in 2016 nycdot revealed plans to double promenade s width a center line was painted to separate cyclists from pedestrians in 1971 creating one of city s first dedicated bike lanes initially northern side of promenade was used by pedestrians and southern side by cyclists in 2000 these were swapped with cyclists taking northern side and pedestrians taking southern side more than 4 000 pedestrians and 3 100 cyclists cross brooklyn bridge each day pedestrian and bicycle access to bridge from brooklyn side is from either median of adams street at its intersection with tillary street or a staircase near prospect street between cadman plaza east and west in manhattan pedestrian walkway is accessible from crosswalks at intersection of bridge and centre street or through a staircase leading to park row emergency use while bridge has always permitted passage of pedestrians promenade facilitates movement when other means of crossing east river have become unavailable during transit strikes by transport workers union in 1980 and 2005 people commuting to work used bridge they were joined by mayors ed koch and michael bloomberg who crossed as a gesture to affected public pedestrians also walked across bridge as an alternative to suspended subway services following 1965 1977 and 2003 blackouts and after september 11 attacks on world trade center during 2003 blackouts many crossing bridge reported a swaying motion higher than usual pedestrian load caused this swaying which was amplified by tendency of pedestrians to synchronize their footfalls with a sway several engineers expressed concern about how this would affect bridge although others noted that bridge did withstand event and that redundancies in its design inclusion of three support systems suspension system diagonal stay system and stiffening truss make it probably best secured bridge against such movements going out of control in designing bridge john roebling had stated that bridge would sag but not fall even if one of these structural systems were to fail altogether notable events stunts thumb robert e odlum jumps from bridge there have been several notable jumpers from brooklyn bridge first person to jump from bridge was robert emmet odlum brother of women s rights activist charlotte odlum smith on may 19 1885

duffy jumped and was not seen again additionally cartoonist otto jumped and survived in 1910 and was then tried and acquitted for attempted suicide brooklyn bridge has since developed a reputation as a suicide bridge due to number of jumpers who do so with intention of killing themselves though exact statistics are difficult to find other notable feats have taken place on or near bridge in 1919

american art in 1976 media bridge is often featured in wide shots of new york city skyline in television and film and has been depicted in numerous works of art beyond that brooklyn bridge has served as an icon of america and so has been mentioned in numerous songs books and poems among most notable of these works is that of american modernist poet hart crane who used brooklyn bridge as a central metaphor and organizing structure for his second and most important book of poetry bridge brooklyn bridge has been lauded for its architecture as well one of first positive reviews was bridge as a monument a harper s weekly piece written by architecture critic montgomery schuyler and published a week after bridge s opening in piece schuyler wrote it so happens that work which is likely to be our most durable monument and to convey some knowledge of us to most remote posterity is a work of bare utility not a shrine not a fortress not a palace but a bridge architecture critic lewis mumford would later cite piece as impetus for serious architectural criticism in u s mumford himself wrote in 1920s that bridge was a source of joy and inspiration in his childhood and that it was a profound influence in his adolescence in later years other critics would regard brooklyn bridge as a work of art as opposed to an engineering feat or a means of transport not all critics appreciated bridge
