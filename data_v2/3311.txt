first battle of maryang san 3 8 october 1951 also known as defensive battle of was fought during korean war between united nations command un forces primarily australian and british and chinese people s volunteer army pva fighting occurred during a limited un offensive by us i corps codenamed operation commando this offensive ultimately pushed pva back from imjin river to jamestown line and destroyed elements of four pva armies following heavy fighting much smaller battle at maryang san took place over a five day period and saw 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar dislodge a numerically superior pva force from tactically important kowang san hill 355 and maryang san hill 317 features in conjunction with other units of 1st commonwealth division using tactics first developed against japanese in new guinea during second world war australians gained advantage of high ground and assaulted pva positions from unexpected directions they then repelled repeated pva counterattacks aimed at re capturing maryang san with both sides suffering heavy casualties before australians were finally relieved by a british battalion however with peace talks ongoing these operations proved to be last actions in war of manoeuvre which had lasted previous sixteen months it was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences reminiscent of western front in 1915 17 a month later pva re captured maryang san during fierce fighting and it was never re gained today battle is widely regarded as one of australian army s greatest accomplishments during war background military situation following general of army douglas macarthur s dismissal as commander in chief of un forces in korea he was replaced by general matthew b ridgway consequently on 14 april 1951 general james van fleet replaced ridgway as commander of us eighth army and un ground forces in korea chinese spring offensive during april and may 1951 ended in its defeat while un may june 1951 counteroffensive erased all pva gains in july kansas and wyoming lines were strengthened while a limited offensive in east central sector in mid august seized high ground around punchbowl and bloody ridge in september offensive in this sector continued targeting next hill complex north of bloody ridge known as heartbreak ridge meanwhile organisation of british commonwealth ground forces fighting in korea as part of un command had undergone considerable change in months following battles of imjin river and kapyong in late april 1951 3 rar had been transferred from 27th british infantry brigade to 28th british commonwealth brigade when that formation departed for hong kong meanwhile after protracted negotiations between governments of australia britain canada india new zealand and south africa agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with aim of increasing political significance of their contribution as well as facilitating solution of logistic and operational problems faced by various commonwealth contingents 1st commonwealth division was formed on 28 july 1951 with division including 25th canadian 28th british commonwealth and 29th british infantry brigades under command of major general james cassels and was part of us i corps since its formation division had occupied part of west central sector of un line approximately north of capital seoul 28th brigade included three infantry battalions 1st battalion king s own scottish borderers 1 kosb 1st battalion king s shropshire light infantry 1 ksli and 3rd battalion royal australian regiment under command of brigadier george taylor during this period 3 rar was commanded by lieutenant colonel francis hassett peace talks at kaesong during july and september led to a lull in fighting and 3 rar undertook mainly defensive duties helping to construct defences of kansas line south of imjin river as well as conducting extensive patrolling on northern side battalion also used reduced operational tempo as an opportunity to train reinforcements period culminated in a limited and largely unopposed divisional advance north of imjin to wyoming line codenamed operation minden in

foreground is a soldier kneeling in late september and early october even while continuing attack against heartbreak ridge van fleet developed a plan for a limited offensive in western section known as operation commando to advance north of 38th parallel with aim of pushing pva forces back and giving united nations forces more leverage at truce negotiations now occurring at panmunjom operation commando was scheduled for 3 5 october 1951 and us i corps commander lieutenant general john w o daniel envisioned a concept of operations in which three of corps four divisions would advance on a broad front in conjunction with us 25th infantry division on left flank of neighbouring us ix corps seizing a new defensive line known as jamestown line divisions to be used in advance included 1st commonwealth division us 1st cavalry division and republic of korea army rok 9th division rok 1st division would remain in its existing position on left flank in sector occupied by 1st commonwealth division pva forces were dug into a group of hills overlooking imjin river division faced 6 000 troops from pva 191st division 64th army under overall command of xie pva forces were divided into three regiments of about 2 000 men each with two regiments dug in in well prepared defensive positions with overhead protection and a third regiment in support 28th brigade faced one of two forward regiments 571st regiment which was deployed with one battalion on hill 355 a second battalion astride hill 217 and hill 317 and a third battalion in reserve to west task allocated to british commonwealth force was to take these positions with intention of advancing line from southern bank of imjin to a line of hills to north in total an objective that stretched more than primary objectives of advance would be capture of kowang san hill 355 and maryang san hill 317 and task of taking these positions was allocated to 28th british commonwealth brigade with this formation bearing brunt of fighting cassels planned on capturing jamestown line in three phases in first phase scheduled for 3 october 28th brigade would take hill 355 in east central sector during second phase on 4 october 25th brigade would assault two hill 187 features and south western ridge running to samichon sami river lastly during third phase scheduled for 5 october 28th brigade would capture hills 217 and 317 as such bulk of division s strength would be concentrated on right flank to be held by 28th brigade meanwhile 25th brigade would hold left flank and 29th brigade would be held in reserve while providing a battalion to each of other brigades as reinforcements kowang san would be assaulted during first phase by 1 kosb with 1 ksli and 3 rar in support while maryang san would be taken in third phase of operation by 3 rar and 1st battalion royal northumberland fusiliers 1 rnf which was detached from 29th brigade to 28th brigade for duration of operation commando careful reconnaissance and planning took place in week prior to commencement of operation and taylor emphasised use of indirect fires air support and infiltration tactics to limit casualties as well as exploitation of weak points in pva defences in direct support of brigade was 16th field regiment royal new zealand artillery with its 25 pounder field guns in addition to divisional and corps assets which included mortars howitzers and heavy artillery in total more than 120 guns and mortars also in support were two british centurion tank squadrons from 8th royal irish hussars preliminary operations thumb left 180px new zealand gunners firing a 25 pounder in korea alt soldiers firing a howitzer against a mountainous backdrop given primary task of capturing hill 317 hassett studied approaches from air and ground two previous attempts to take maryang san by american troops had been unsuccessful regardless utilising tactics first developed against japanese in new guinea during second world war of running along tops of ridges he intended to gain advantage of high ground while utilising cover afforded by vegetation and ease of movement along crest lines in order to assault pva positions from unexpected directions meanwhile pva defenders on maryang san were also testing a newly developed tactic called mobile positional defense in which only small units were stationed on hills in order to exhaust un attackers while bulk of pva defenders would later counterattack before un forces could consolidate into their newly gained positions however during first phase of operation australians would be tasked with capturing a pva outpost on hill 199 to allow tanks and medium machine guns to provide direct fires onto northern and eastern slopes of hill 355 in support of an attack by borderers from south east likewise shropshires would assault and capture hill 208 finally then two days before start of operation commando 28th brigade crossed imjin river to assemble behind 25th brigade on 1 october following day 3 rar less d company and borderers moved forward carefully into their assembly areas ready to advance following morning c company advanced to a position in front of canadian positions north east of hill 355 b company was to rear in afternoon c company was subjected to heavy shelling losing one soldier wounded d company under command of major basil hardiman was detached to 25th brigade to strengthen its extended front and it would not be available until afternoon of 3 october battle capture of hill 199 3 october 1951 thumb right alt map of movements of 3 rar during battle as described in text first battle of maryang san 2 8 october 1951 at 03 00 on 3 october b company 3 rar moved north toward hill 199 crossing open valley under cover of darkness and heavy mist a company then moved up behind c company artillery and mortar fire targeted known pva artillery positions with counter battery fire prior to dawn before switching to support borderers in their assault on hill 355 simultaneously shropshires were assaulting hill 208 and with support of a squadron 8th royal irish hussars they reached positions without opposition by 06 00 by 08 00 b company had gained high ground to north and then proceeded to patrol short distance to west to objective which was then taken with three wounded five pva were killed and one captured by mid morning both shropshires and australians had successfully captured their objectives expecting a counter attack australians on hill 199 began digging in however no such attack occurred d company subsequently returned and was allocated a position between c company and borderers c and b companies both received shelling during day wounding two men at 10 00 a company under captain jim shelton took over defence of hill 199 and b company went into reserve behind a company according to plan a troop of centurion tanks and a section of medium machine guns were then moved up onto hill 199 and began directing their fire onto northern slopes of hill 355 in support of borderers meanwhile at 07 15 following preparation by artillery and mortar fire lead british assault companies had begun to advance on hill 355 however with pva expecting an assault from that direction initial british moves met strong resistance and borderers were forced to withdraw and reorganise at 14 15 a second assault reached objectives on lower slopes and these gains were consolidated by nightfall attack was now behind schedule indeed borderers were still more than short of their final objective and with stubborn resistance being encountered during initial phase hill 355 would now not be secured until afternoon of 4 october assault was being slowed by two positions on northeast slopes of hill 355 known as hill 220 from which pva held british right flank in enfilade c company 3 rar would be detached to assist attack on kowang san next morning with australians tasked with outflanking pva defences and capturing this position heavy pva artillery fire had also slowed progress with more than 2 500 rounds falling in 28th brigade area in previous twenty four hours although this total was dwarfed many times over by weight of allied artillery fired across brigade front which included 22 324 rounds on division s left flank delay also meant that canadian attack scheduled for 06 00 next day in 25th brigade sector would have to be postponed until 11 00 due to continuing requirement to use divisional artillery in support of 28th brigade capture of hill 220 and fall of kowang san 4 october 1951 on 4 october c company 3 rar under command of major jack gerke attacked long spur running east from peak of hill 355 known as hill 220 launching their assault at 09 00 australians quickly killed or drove off defenders before pressing on up spur and routing remainder of a pva company reaching their objectives by 10 00 australians then took advantage of initiative gained so far pushing a platoon towards summit of hill 355 amid heavy fighting australians cleared eastern slopes of kowang san by 12 00 despite having received no orders to do so thirteen pva were killed and three captured in fighting while australian casualties included 11 wounded one of whom subsequently died gerke was later awarded distinguished service order dso for his leadership c company withdrew to rear of 3 rar position and were replaced by d company who occupied position held by a company north of hill 199 meanwhile led by a bagpiper borderers made a simultaneous assault up western face of kowang san and fearing they may be caught between two attacks pva defenders abandoned hill 355 withdrawing northwest under heavy indirect fire given strong resistance exhibited by pva canadians expected a tough fight as 25th brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of second phase of divisional plan yet with loss of hill 355 and 210 pva unexpectedly withdrew from their well prepared defensive positions with hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition only 2nd battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry encountered any opposition before they captured two hill 187 features losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 pva were also killed indeed ease with which canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on attaining their final objectives on jamestown line by nightfall no further resistance was encountered although heavy pva artillery fire caused a number of casualties including three killed canadians subsequently occupied positions they were destined to hold for next twenty two months of fighting meanwhile on 28th brigade s left flank shropshires met slight resistance securing hill 210 southwest of kowang san by 10 10 they were then relieved by canadians by nightfall in preparation for third phase of operation brigade plan was now a day behind schedule although with unexpected ease experienced by canadians overall divisional attack was still running according to plan however determined to hold on following loss of hill 355 pva moved in fresh troops heavily reinforcing a number of positions including maryang san fall of maryang san 5 october 1951 thumb left 200px no 2 squadron saaf mustang fighters during korean war alt two piston engined fighter aircraft lined up ready for take off on a runway final objective was maryang san a steep hill rising above valley about north of hill 355 however following delay in capturing hill 355 hassett would not be ready to implement his plan until early next day as such third phase would begin on 5 october with royal northumberland fusiliers scheduled to attack an intermediate objective hill 217 adjacent kowang san before assisting australians assault hill 317 australians moved into position northeast of hill 199 on afternoon of 4 october while over night of 4 5 october divisional artillery hit pva positions with two batteries of howitzers and another two batteries supplementing them air strikes by mustangs of no 2 squadron south african air force were also planned targeting pva concentrations north and west of objectives to cut off supplies and reinforcements both australians and fusiliers were scheduled to begin their attacks at first light at 05 45 following a heavy artillery preparation in dark fusiliers moved off but amid dense fog they found it difficult to maintain their bearings and were not in position in time to commence attack as planned by 10 00 they had struggled to within from their objective and following further delays assault was commenced at 11 00 after initially achieving surprise a number of forward pva outposts fell to fusiliers occupying strong defensive positions on hill 217 pva regained initiative however and poured heavy machine gun and rifle fire onto attackers as they crossed valley forcing them to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties and running low on ammunition having expected main axis of assault from south pva positions were stronger than previously considered and fusiliers were unable to gain summit despite one company gaining a toehold on summit by midday earlier that morning at 04 45 b and d companies 3 rar had moved north across valley while anti tank platoon crossed imjin taking up positions further north in order to protect right flank assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting hill 317 initially 3 rar was to attack from east while 1 rnf would attack from southwest through hill 217 however with fusiliers facing stiff resistance on hill 217 itself they were unable to get forward to assist previous attempts to capture maryang san had failed due to approach to steep eastern slopes of feature being across a wide open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting pva positions consequently australians planned to cross valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on pva flank in foothills before scaling position at first light a company would create a diversion on left flank while b company would clear lower slopes before d company passed through to assault pva main defensive position known as victor feature in a one up one in depth assault however following casualties of previous nights on hill 199 220 and 355 and effect of constant shelling 3 rar was now reduced to just 320 men in contrast australians faced two fresh pva battalions on maryang san in total about 1 200 men thumb right chinese soldiers from 64th army defending maryang san alt five asian soldiers firing weapons and throwing grenades from grass covered a hilltop in middle ground smoke is rising b company commanded by captain henry nicholls led off shrouded in heavy mist and with visibility limited in thick vegetation it drifted to right off intended axis of advance having lost direction suffering a similar fate as fusiliers disorientated assaulting companies became separated and battalion attack turned into a series of independent company attacks d company slowly continued forward however and when mist lifted suddenly at 11 20 they were left dangerously exposed still only halfway up slope to their objective australian approach had surprised pva however who were apparently expecting assault from north and d company succeeded in closing to within grenade range of pva on victor during a fierce twenty minute fire fight australians cleared their first objective with assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks and indirect fire support from artillery losing three killed and 12 wounded included among australian wounded was company commander and one of platoon commanders both of whom remained in command despite gunshot wounds pva losses included 30 killed and 10 captured during initial phase a company had attacked southwest along a spur leading to hill 317 and had met stiff opposition diversion was largely successful however causing pva to reinforce against attack which they believed to be main effort meanwhile d company continued to press their attack along high ground towards uniform feature assaulting deeply entrenched pva positions which included heavy automatic weapons by 16 00 it had successfully captured last of intermediate objectives assigned to it and a platoon from b company was pushed forward to assist in clearance of feature later lieutenant l g clark was awarded military cross while sergeant w j was awarded a bar to his distinguished conduct medal for their actions during fighting by this time total pva casualties included 98 killed and 40 captured while australians believed that a large number of pva had also been wounded following progress of b and d companies c company was moved up behind them and with capture of final objective they immediately commenced an assault on hill 317 capturing 10 prisoners for no loss although pva had been well dug in there were no barbed wire obstacles to hamper attackers and australians had rapidly gained position by 17 00 maryang san had fallen to australians with pva withdrawing under heavy artillery mortar and machine gun fire thumb left 160px abandoned chinese positions alt abandoned earthworks on a tree covered slope clothing and other debris can be seen in trenches and in trees strewn haphazardly on hill 217 fusiliers had maintained pressure on pva throughout day however they were still unable to capture feature regardless efforts of fusiliers in conjunction with a company s diversionary attack and rapid advance of d company with tank and artillery support had carried day a company continued to attack against heavy opposition and indirect fire slowly pushing pva defenders back later a platoon was detached to assist c company consolidate defence of maryang san following its capture while remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards again under heavy artillery fire indeed although it had played a supporting role in attack efforts of a company had been vital suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 pva and capturing two now with maryang san captured australians began digging in modifying south facing linear pva trench system into an all round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits fully expecting a pva counter attack that evening moved assault pioneer platoon to bolster hasty defences meanwhile pva still occupied three key ridgeline positions sierra feature hinge and summit of hill 317 itself which they continued to furiously defend these would be scene of considerable fighting in days to come as australians attempted to clear them hinge 6 8 october 1951 with both sides exhausted from fighting night of 5 6 october was less eventful than expected and australians used opportunity to develop their position to add further depth to their defences and to probe pva positions taylor ordered australians to capture central remaining pva position sierra feature a wooded knoll halfway between summit of maryang san and hinge next day meanwhile fusiliers would renew their attack on hill 217 southern approach to hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by pva and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome taylor would need to split fire of its defenders to do this high ground to north west of maryang san known as hinge would be vital indeed adjacent to hill 217 hinge dominated it from north as such for next assault planned for morning fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack hinge from east using australian positions on maryang san as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on hill 217 at 07 00 on 6 october 9 platoon c company under command of lieutenant arthur pembroke moved forward to sierra using heavy mist to conceal their movements under strength and not expecting feature to be occupied instead australians found a large number of pva in well prepared defensive positions without fire support and outnumbered australians immediately conducted a quick attack and using grenades and bayonets they inflicted heavy casualties on pva before forcing survivors to withdraw although subjected to constant shelling 9 platoon continued to hold knoll repelling several counterattacks over next 13 hours cutting down each assault through tree line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine gun fire forcing pva to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded behind one australian was killed in initial assault on sierra while a number were later wounded during defence pva casualties included 19 killed 30 wounded and seven captured pembroke was later awarded military cross thumb right 200px australian vickers machine gunners firing in support of assault by c company 3 rar on hill 317 alt soldiers firing a machine gun towards a hillside in distance a large number of discarded ammunition belts are visible during day fusiliers again assaulted hill 217 from south and attempted to work their way around eastern and western flanks of feature despite preparation by divisional artillery and 3 rar machine gun platoon firing their vickers machine guns in support from maryang san fusiliers were unable to make progress due to pva machine guns located in bunkers at top of their objective meanwhile their flanking movements were also blocked by pva small arms fire and grenades 1 rnf had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by afternoon they were a spent force sensing fusiliers weakness pva then launched their own assault forcing them to withdraw in contact previous plans for an assault on hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and dangerous approach march that would have been required again despite their efforts fusiliers had failed to capture their objective it seemed that only way to finally secure hill 217 was along ridge from hill 317 via hinge and as such australians would be tasked with capturing hinge following day b company was subsequently allocated attack in preparation they ascended hill 317 late in afternoon of 6 october finally securing crest and at last light joined 9 platoon on knoll northwest of summit where they would form up next day to conduct assault in early hours of 7 october allied artillery and mortar bombardment began targeting pva positions on hinge hassett moved 3 rar tactical headquarters on to hill 317 just before assaulting troops stepped off line of departure allowing him to direct battle from a forward position and to co ordinate fire support waiting for fog to lift so that artillery could fire until last safe moment attack finally began at 08 00 b company moved off down ridgeline with two up and one in depth using trees and long grass for concealment initially it seemed that pva had withdrawn during night when suddenly lead australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear a series of intense fire fights ensued as australians fought back and by 09 20 hinge finally fell with australians losing two killed and 20 wounded pva casualties included more than 20 killed as a result of fighting captain henry nicholls and lieutenant jim hughes were awarded military cross while corporal j park and corporal e f bosworth were awarded military medal yet even as surviving pva withdrew artillery and mortar fire began to fall on hinge b company moved quickly to consolidate position but were hampered by shelling while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties for remainder of day b company was subjected to intense indirect fire on hinge as was c company on hill 317 anti tank platoon and assault pioneer platoon reinforced c company with a platoon of c company moved forward to hinge to support b company at 20 00 both hinge and hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes heralding beginning of inevitable pva counterattack heavy mist concealed pva advance and this assisted many to penetrate australian perimeter throughout night of 7 8 october hinge was attacked on three occasions from both front and flanks by a force of battalion strength however australians beat back pva in desperate hand to hand combat pva swept forward but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire during one such assault sergeant p j o connell on seeing one of his platoon s bren gunners wounded manned light machine gun himself breaking up a pva assault while controlling fire of men around him meanwhile sergeant r w strong arranged resupply of ammunition to forward australian sections both were awarded military medal thumb left 200px korean porters supporting 3 rar alt unarmed men with boxes of supplies strapped to their backs at bottom of a hill in background other men have begun climb to top intensity of fighting had led to a severe shortage of ammunition among defenders and attempts to resupply australians were plagued by heavy shelling use of salvaged ammunition stabilised situation momentarily after one of b company s two vickers machine guns was destroyed by pva shelling and its ammunition belts were subsequently broken up and dispersed among riflemen however this soon resulted in a large number of mechanical failures and weapon stoppages causing additional problems for defenders evacuation of casualties was again an issue and assault pioneer platoon commanded by lieutenant jock mccormick was used as stretcher bearers and to run ammunition forward as were a number of other specialist platoons their ammunition nearly exhausted australians resorted to kicking and strangling many of attacking pva during brutal fighting fearing australians would be overwhelmed by persistent pva attacks taylor ordered borderers and shropshires to detach their korean porters to resupply australians while a full divisional concentration of artillery was fired in support of 3 rar ultimately b company succeeded in holding their hastily constructed defensive positions throughout night and until 05 00 on 8 october when pva finally gave up in order to preserve its remaining strength pva 191st division was forced to pull back by surrendering control of hill 217 without a fight at first light more than 120 pva dead and wounded lay around australian defences and in contrast to savage fighting during night pva stretcher parties were allowed to come forward and collect their wounded under a flag of truce australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting aftermath casualties thumb right 200px chinese prisoners captured by australian soldiers during un offensive in october 1951 alt three unarmed soldiers being led down a hill by two soldiers armed with rifles one in front other in rear four hours later at 09 00 3 rar was relieved on maryang san and hinge by borderers having lost 20 killed and 104 wounded pva casualties on hill 317 had been severe with 283 killed determined by body count and another 50 captured later it was estimated that australians had destroyed at least two pva battalions during five day battle 1 rnf once more advanced against hill 217 this time without opposition sending patrols to confirm that pva had withdrawn they were met by patrols from 1 kosb on hinge with borderers taking control of area at 11 00 hill 217 was latter occupied on 9 october by borderers 3 rar assault pioneer platoon anti tank platoon and a platoon from c company remained on maryang san however and during evening of 8 9 october pioneers killed four pva during a probe on their position they were finally relieved on 9 october for his leadership hassett was immediately awarded dso while a number of awards were also made to others that had distinguished themselves during fighting royal australian regiment was subsequently granted battle honours kowang san and maryang san today first battle of maryang san is widely regarded as one of australian army s greatest accomplishments of korean war assessment during battle british commonwealth logistic system proved robust enough to bear strain of fighting without serious disruption although problems were experienced despite difficulties an adequate flow of ammunition equipment food and water was maintained although there were occasions when australians endured thirst and hunger for several hours 3 rar used 900 000 rounds of small arms 5 000 grenades and 7 000 mortar rounds during five day battle all of which was moved in man loads by korean service corps porters and australian soldiers over long distances and extreme terrain often while under fire these resupply operations had required considerable effort and bravery to effect and a number of korean porters were killed and wounded at maryang san indeed evacuation of casualties and resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters on a number of occasions resulting in forward companies running short of ammunition meanwhile quality of support given to british and australian infantry by artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited while new zealand gunners had fired over 50 000 rounds in direct support of 3 rar blistering paint off barrels of their guns air support including that provided by south african mustangs had been important throughout battle was also noted for pioneering use of tunnel warfare by pva in korean war during fighting a pva company had defended their positions from a u shaped tunnel capable of housing 100 men which had served as both a bomb shelter and a base for counterattacks company leader later claimed that tunnel enabled defenders to inflict 700 un casualties while suffering only 21 casualties in return impressed by report pva commander peng dehuai later ordered construction of deep tunnels along entire front line and it formed a formidable obstacle for un forces to overcome during stalemate period subsequent operations thumb left 200px australian casualties being evacuated during operation commando october 1951 alt soldiers carrying a man on a stretcher operation commando finally ended on 15 october with us i corps having successfully seized jamestown line and destroying elements of pva 42nd 47th 64th and 65th armies pva losses were estimated at 21 000 casualties while un losses were 4 000 majority of them in us 1st cavalry division which had borne brunt of fighting although a few hills south of line remained in pva kpa hands requiring a follow up operation known as operation which succeeded in capturing these positions by 19 october un supply lines near seoul were now free from pva interdiction with peace talks ongoing these operations proved to be last actions in war of manoeuvre which had lasted previous sixteen months it was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences trench lines bunkers patrols wiring parties and minefields reminiscent of western front in 1915 17 construction of defensive localities began almost immediately although such operations were confined to reverse slopes during day due to artillery and mortar fire which made such operations hazardous patrolling forward of jamestown line also began in order to prevent pva from gaining control of no mans land yet even as war became a contest of positional warfare and attrition growing western political sensitivities ensured that un commanders were increasingly mindful of limiting casualties total casualties among 1st commonwealth division during operation commando amounted to 58 killed and 262 wounded bulk of which had occurred during fighting for hill 217 and hill 317 in addition to heavy casualties suffered by 3 rar 1 rnf had lost 16 killed and 94 wounded pva 64th army later received a commendation for keeping their casualties light despite some estimates placing its casualties at higher than 3 000 throughout operation 3 rar had played a crucial role and in a bold series of holding and flanking movements coordinated with accurate and sustained artillery and direct tank fire it had driven pva from both kowang san and maryang san they had then held key position against several unsuccessful counterattacks before forcing pva to retire a month later maryang san was subsequently retaken by pva from borderers amid fierce fighting at second battle of maryang san for which private bill speakman was later awarded victoria cross it was not re gained and remained in pva hands until end of war notes footnotes citations references further reading external links out in cold
