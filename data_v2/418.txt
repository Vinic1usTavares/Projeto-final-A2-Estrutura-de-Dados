max green line is a light rail service in portland oregon united states owned and operated by trimet as part of max light rail system it extends from downtown portland to eastside community of clackamas connecting portland state university psu portland city center northeast and southeast sections of portland and clackamas town center line is long and serves 30 stations between psu south stations and clackamas town center transit center it is only service that shares parts of its alignment with four other max services it shares portland transit mall with orange line and yellow line and banfield segment of eastside max with blue line and red line southbound from gateway northeast 99th avenue transit center green line serves an exclusive segment along interstate 205 i 205 referred to as i 205 max service runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a headway of 15 minutes during most of day line is third busiest in system carrying an average of 20 640 riders per day on weekdays in september 2018 planning for first light rail services to clackamas county began in mid 1980s with announcement of two separate lines one between downtown portland and oregon city via milwaukie and another between portland international airport and clackamas town center via i 205 feasibility studies conducted in early 1990s eventually shifted plans away from i 205 and culminated in south north line proposal this failed to secure voter backed funding over several ballot measures resulting in plan s cancellation in 1998 in 2001 regional planners reconvened and developed south corridor transportation project a two phased revision of initial proposal that sought addition of light rail to i 205 and portland transit mall in its first phase with support of local governments and residents project was approved in 2003 construction of two segments began in early 2007 and green line opened on september 12 2009 there are currently plans to expand max to southwest portland tigard and tualatin if approved by voters in 2020 green line would be extended from its psu south termini in downtown portland to bridgeport village via southwest barbur boulevard by 2027 extension would bring light rail service closer to oregon health science university ohsu campus on marquam hill portland community college pcc sylvania and tigard triangle among others i 205 history early proposals thumb left alt photograph of clackamas town center in background with part of its parking lot in foreground clackamas town center in 2011 in mid 1980s metro regional government announced plans to introduce light rail to clackamas county with proposal of two lines one between portland international airport and clackamas town center via i 205 and other between downtown portland and oregon city via milwaukie a panel of local and state officials known as joint policy advisory committee on transportation affirmed their endorsement of an i 205 line in 1987 with a request to start preliminary engineering for light rail in lieu of an originally planned busway preferred alignment had been i 205 transitway an unfinished grade separated transit right of way built during i 205 s construction in late 1970s and early 1980s as planning for what would become westside max blue line extension to washington county took priority for federal funding trimet called on local businesses and governments in clackamas county to subsidize proposed 88 million route a dispute between washington and clackamas county officials followed with clackamas county vying for additional federal assistance including 17 million in excess funds sourced from partially realized i 205 transitway in january 1989 in an effort to settle dispute metro approved a ten year regional transportation plan in which it reasserted westside line s priority and commissioned preliminary work on i 205 line as well as a study for a line to milwaukie u s senate committee on appropriations approved a financing package in september which provided 2 million to assess both segments at behest of oregon senator mark hatfield and washington senator brock adams who were members of committee a segment further north to clark county washington became part of proposals initial studies examined extending proposed i 205 line further north across columbia river to vancouver mall or clark county fairgrounds as studies analyzed various alternative routes however support eventually shifted to an alignment along busier interstate 5 i 5 and willamette river corridors a route from hazel dell washington through downtown portland to clackamas town center called south north line was finalized in 1994 estimated to cost around 2 8 billion portland area voters approved a 475 million bond measure on november 8 1994 to cover oregon s share a clark county vote to fund washington s portion which would have been sourced through sales and vehicle excise tax increases was subsequently defeated on february 7 1995 trimet later sought funding for various scaled back revisions of south north line generally following a route between north portland and clackamas town center which voters rejected in 1996 and 1998 in 1997 an unsolicited proposal from bechtel led to a public private partnership that built an extension of max to portland international airport using northern half of i 205 transitway now served by red line in 1999 north portland residents and businesses persuaded trimet to revive northern portion of south north project resulting in construction of interstate max for yellow line in 2004 revival and funding thumb left

to discuss renewed light rail plans to downtown milwaukie panel also revisited idea of running max on i 205 from gateway northeast 99th avenue transit center to clackamas town center following month committee announced 8 8 million south corridor transportation study which would evaluate both options in 2002 a supplemental draft environmental impact statement eis based on original south north line eis was published metro narrowed down five mode alternatives in january 2003 these included building both light rail lines a combination of one light rail service and one improved bus service bus rapid transit and dedicated bus lanes study s task force recommended both light rail options they proposed a two phased development plan starting with addition of light rail to i 205 by 2009 followed by completion of a portland to milwaukie line five years later existing i 205 transitway right of way and potential for no new taxes were two factors that led to selection of i 205 corridor for first phase with approval of local residents affected jurisdictions each endorsed this proposal by april 2003 an amendment to include adding tracks on portland transit mall as part of first phase was prepared following october trimet published final eis in december 2004 and began land acquisition for park and ride facilities in november 2005 combined i 205 max and transit mall revitalization project was approved by federal government on february 7 2006 project was budgeted at 575 7 million equivalent to in dollars of which approximately 220 million went to portland transit mall federal funding which covered 60 percent or about 345 million of total cost was approved in february 2006 under new starts program head of federal transit administration fta signed full funding agreement in portland on july 3 2007 in may 2009 project received 32 million in federal stimulus funding from american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 an amount already committed to project by federal government but made available so that trimet could retire debt earlier trimet negotiated a local match of 40 percent or 197 4 million unadjusted of total funding in july 2004 of this city of portland provided 15 million in bonds paid off by raising parking meter fees 17 million from a local improvement district and 6 3 million from systems and utilities charges around 36 million came from clackamas county urban renewal funds collected from property taxes within clackamas town center urban renewal district trimet contributed 20 5 million and portland development commission provided 20 million an additional 15 3 million was spent by downtown businesses to improve retail spaces along transit mall construction and opening thumb right alt photograph of max green line s tunnel under i

a joint venture composed of stacy and witbeck f e ward constructors both of which had worked on preceding interstate max project and granite construction company it was granted through a design build contract in february 2004 construction commenced in february 2007 this marked start of a 2 year closure of sections of i 205 bike path a new mixed use path linking clackamas county to south park blocks in downtown portland was paved as a permanent alternative preliminary work involved erecting light rail bridges over southeast johnson creek boulevard and southeast harold street and excavating light rail underpasses below southeast stark and washington streets crews were at work along two station segment within clackamas county by november 2007 line was over 70 percent complete by november 2008 with tracks laid from gateway transit center to trimet ordered 22 siemens cars to serve expansion referred to as type 4 first car was delivered in 2009 it made its first test run in march and entered service on august 6 2009 line s first end to end test run attended by local and state dignitaries occurred in july 2009 green line service commenced on september 12 2009 two extensions added a total of of newly constructed light rail tracks i 205 section accounted for portland transit mall section opening day festivities paid for by sponsors and donations were held at clackamas town center and psu as many as 40 000 people showed up to ride trains which were free that day to address its 31 million budget deficit trimet simultaneously eliminated four bus routes and implemented service cuts to 49 other lines transit mall revitalization thumb left alt photograph of construction on 5th avenue at yamhill street construction along 5th avenue from yamhill street shown in july 2007 a north south light rail alignment through downtown portland had been considered as early as 1980s in 1991 following recommendations made by a citizen advisory committee portland city council commissioned a feasibility study for a potential subway line beneath 1977 built portland transit mall on 5th and 6th avenues then served only by buses during planning stages of south north line in 1994 government planners introduced a surface light rail alternative which was later favored by project s steering committee when it concluded a 250 million tunnel would be too costly following cancellation of south north line city reserved revitalization efforts for transit mall amid proposals to rebuild it to allow curbside parking in 2002 in 2003 trimet planners began to reconsider addition of light rail to portland transit mall planning for second phase of south corridor transportation study which aimed to extend max south to milwaukie revealed that a fourth service on existing tracks along southwest morrison and yamhill streets served already by blue red and yellow lines would push downtown alignment to maximum capacity additionally portland business leaders pushed for construction of a new bridge that would lead to southern end of transit mall instead of using hawthorne bridge fearing latter would form a bottleneck a study conducted subsequently by trimet proposed stations on either left right or middle lanes of transit mall and planners selected a hybrid center lane travel with right side boarding option in april 2004 local governments approved revitalization plan by following month combining it with first phase construction of i 205 max consisting of seven stations per split on 5th and 6th avenues project extended existing transit mall from 44 to 117 block faces between portland union station and psu it also added a continuous travel lane for private vehicles which had not been present in corridor s original bus only design thumb right alt

awarded to a joint venture of stacy and witbeck and kiewit pacific preparation work began with rerouting of 17 bus lines to 3rd and 4th avenues six lines to southwest columbia and jefferson streets and one line 14 hawthorne to southwest 2nd avenue construction commenced on january 14 2007 with corridor s temporary closure owing to techniques learned from interstate max project businesses were kept open while blocks were closed off in three to four block sections from north to south minimizing disruptions original transit mall had been built with mortar set bricks which proved difficult to maintain in reconstruction trimet experimented with sand set brick paving as recommended by british civil engineer john who studied road building methods used by romans tracks were laid into surface street while water pipes and sewers were buried to underground last section of rail on transit mall was installed in may 2008 from june to august 2008 upper deck of steel bridge was closed to connect existing max tracks with new tracks 5th and 6th avenues reopened to vehicular traffic in july 2008 two months ahead of schedule trimet began line testing in january 2009 initially with cars hauled by a truck then with system s new type 4 trains bus service returned to transit mall on may 24 2009 three months later on august 30 2009 light rail portion opened with inaugural service from yellow line which was rerouted from its original downtown alignment with blue and red lines on first avenue and southwest morrison and yamhill streets green line trains began serving portland transit mall during opening of i 205 max on september 12 2009 proposed southwest corridor extension a proposed expansion of max referred to as southwest corridor light rail project would add 13 stations over a new extension and connect downtown portland to southwest portland and cities of tigard and tualatin line would start from southern end of portland transit mall at psu south stations and head south over interstate 405 i 405 it would run between marquam hill to west and i 5 to east and proceed southwest beyond capitol highway to connect with barbur transit center two bridges would take line over i 5 into tigard triangle it would traverse a fourth bridge over oregon route 217 and proceed towards tigard transit center which would connect it with wes commuter rail adjacent to sw hall blvd station would be a newly constructed rail yard built to house rolling stock and maintenance operations line would continue down beside old oregon electric railway right of way current owned by portland western railroad before terminating at bridgeport village much of extension would run along center of southwest barbur boulevard a part of oregon route 99w or 99w it is being designed to connect riders to upper campus of ohsu via pedestrian link and pcc sylvania via shuttle bus end to end travel time would take approximately 30 minutes at an estimated cost of 2 6 billion to 2 9 billion project will be included in a regional transportation funding measure that will be voted on in 2020 if approved extension is expected to open in 2027 and serve approximately 43 000 riders by 2035 project history a segment of or 99w between portland and sherwood was identified as one of region s next high capacity transit corridors in metro s 2035 regional transportation plan adopted on june 10 2010 fta granted metro 2 million in january 2011 to begin studies for this area which was formally called southwest corridor funds focused on assessment of various alternatives including light rail commuter rail streetcar and bus rapid transit southwest corridor plan officially launched on september 28 2011 integrating individual land use plans begun by each of involved communities and initiating development of a unified transportation network in june 2013 metro released corridor s high capacity transit analysis in which it selected light rail and bus rapid transit as main alternatives citing a lack of present and future demand analysis eliminated further planning using alternatives to sherwood a streetcar line and a high occupancy vehicle lane on i 5 among other previously considered options were also abandoned in response to local opposition to removal of automobile lanes from or 99w in tigard steering committee recommended rerouting proposed alignment through tigard triangle a refinement recommendation was announced in june 2014 selecting a preliminary route from southern end of portland transit mall in downtown portland to just east of tualatin station in downtown tualatin this was later shortened to terminate at bridgeport village proposals to serve ohsu on marquam hill hillsdale and pcc sylvania with tunnels were dropped from plan because they would be costly have severe construction impacts and attract few new transit riders connecting ohsu to a surface transit line through elevators or escalators is being studied in may 2016 light rail was chosen as preferred mode alternative over bus rapid transit tigard voters after passing a measure requiring voters to approve construction of any high capacity transit built within city limits approved light rail extension following september amid a budget gap of planners proposed reducing lanes on barbur boulevard and shortening line s route to terminate in downtown tigard both proposals were rejected in november 2019 private negotiations as well as metro s approval to increase project s requested budget by 125million in 2020 ballot measure has reduced budget gap to around 100million route thumb right alt photograph of buildings on left with a green line train crossing a bridge in background a green line train seen crossing over foster road in 2010 green line is long it

minutes in early morning and late evening hours ridership prior to start of construction a psu study estimated 46 500 new boardings along green line by 2025 during its first year in operation trimet planners projected 25 250 average weekday riders fewer people than expected actually utilized line on its first day of weekday service by following month however trimet recorded approximately 17 000 trips per day average daily ridership in june 2010 was 19 500 increasing to 24 300 by april 2012 as of september 2018 green line records an average weekday ridership of 20 640 making it third busiest max service drop in ridership experienced system wide is attributed to crime and lower income riders being forced out of inner city by rising housing prices note references external links category
