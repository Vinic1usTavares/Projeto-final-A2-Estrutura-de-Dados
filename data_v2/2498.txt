advanced gemini is a number of proposals that would have extended gemini program by addition of various missions including manned low earth orbit circumlunar and lunar landing missions gemini was second manned spaceflight program operated by nasa and consisted of a two seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit docking with unmanned spacecraft such as agena target vehicles and allowing crew to perform tethered extra vehicular activities a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights lunar proposals ranged from reusing docking systems developed for agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as centaur which could propel spacecraft to moon to complete modifications of gemini to enable it to land on lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing apollo program some of advanced gemini proposals used off shelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from original program while others featured modifications to allow spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included addition of wings or a parasail to spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing background right thumb 200px gemini 7 in orbit alt a black and white spacecraft with earth below it gemini was second american manned orbital spaceflight program after mercury it was intended to demonstrate technologies and techniques required for apollo program such as extra vehicular activities rendezvous and docking maneuvering in orbit and long duration flight gemini spacecraft which was built by mcdonnell aircraft was derived from earlier mercury spacecraft but modified to accommodate two astronauts it was also equipped with a larger equipment module allowing it to support longer missions and maneuver in orbit it was launched by titan ii rocket flying from launch complex 19 at cape canaveral air force station in total twelve missions were launched ten of which were manned following two unmanned test flights first manned flight gemini 3 was launched on 23 march 1965 program concluded on 15 november 1966 with successful recovery of gemini 12 many other applications were envisaged for gemini spacecraft at various stages before during and after two years in which it was used by nasa for manned spaceflight although none of these proposals ever made it into operation many were considered seriously and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation in case of manned orbital laboratory a gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of program in some cases technology developed in advanced gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs such as components from titan iiim which was to have launched mol being used to upgrade other titan rockets military applications right 225px thumb gemini b spacecraft alt a spacecraft in a museum displaying a united states air force color scheme united states air force intended to use gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations manned orbital development system and later manned orbital laboratory mol these stations would have been launched by titan iiim rockets with a gemini spacecraft atop eliminating need for rendezvous and docking maneuvers for this purpose several modifications were made to gemini capsule including installation of a hatch in heat shield to allow access to space station left thumb 100px launch of gemini b and ops 0855 alt a rocket launching in order to give its astronauts experience before these programs started blue gemini program was proposed which would have seen usaf astronauts fly on nasa missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions this would have first seen cooperative missions between nasa and us air force with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from nasa and one from usaf followed by two missions with all usaf crews but performing missions for nasa after these flights us air force would have flown a number of missions of its own firstly it would have flown a two man agena rendezvous and docking mission followed by two one man scientific or technology research missions other proposed missions included tests of astronaut mobility unit which was designed to assist with evas inertial navigation systems and flying a radar imaging system right thumb 225px gemini separating from mol in orbit alt artist s impression of two spacecraft separating from each other backdropped against earth mol launches would have been conducted from launch complex 40 at cape canaveral air force station and space launch complex 6 at vandenberg air force base in 1966 a test flight was launched from lc 40 using a titan iiic it consisted of gemini b spacecraft built from spacecraft used for gemini 2 test flight atop ops 0855 a boilerplate mol space station gemini b was released on a suborbital trajectory and descended to earth to test modifications made to heat shield and ensure that access hatch would not affect its performance ops 0855 continued on to orbit early mol stations would have only been manned by a single crew launched with station later stations would have been designed to be resupplied and support multiple crews delivered by additional gemini spacecraft or derivatives mol program was cancelled on 10 june 1969 in favor of unmanned reconnaissance satellites some systems developed for program were later used on unmanned missions while space suits which were under development were transferred to nasa titan iiim rocket which was to launch mol never flew however some of upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other titan rockets stretched first and second stages became titan 34 which was used as core of some later titan iiib flights and on titan seven segment solid rocket boosters were later introduced on titan iv a gemini ferry several gemini ferry spacecraft were proposed to provide transportation of crews and cargo to nasa and usaf space stations in low earth orbit nasa contracted mcdonnell to conduct a study into what modifications would be needed to allow gemini spacecraft to support this three spacecraft were envisioned a manned spacecraft to transport crew to stations a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply station every three or four months studies looked at minimizing required modifications to gemini spacecraft three docking methods were considered first was use of existing docking system used on gemini agena missions this would have allowed mission to be accomplished with little modification to gemini spacecraft needed however crew transfer could only have been accomplished by means of an extra vehicular activity eva changes that would have been required included strengthening nose installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn adding necessary equipment to perform transfer eva and providing provisions for flight to and from station number of retro rockets would have been increased from four to six a second method would have seen spacecraft dock in same way but after docking spacecraft would be swung round and attached to side of space station a tunnel would then have been placed over gemini s hatches allowing crew to transfer to station without performing an eva some modifications to hatches would have been required final proposed docking method was to use a port mounted on rear of equipment module which would have allowed crew to transfer directly between spacecraft and space station through docking port a modified version of spacecraft was proposed which would have included a cargo module attached to back of a modified equipment module spacecraft would have approached station and docked backwards using a port on rear of cargo module if one of forward docking configurations had been used for gemini itself docking would have been controlled remotely from station with gemini then separating from cargo module and flying around station to dock normally on a different port rear docking gemini would have simply remained attached to cargo module with crew boarding station through it its docking would have been controlled by its own crew from a station at back of cargo module two gemini derived spacecraft were considered for unmanned resupply flights first of these would have involved a gemini spacecraft with all systems for manned flight re entry and landing removed spacecraft would have docked using a port at front of spacecraft cargo would have been transferred through nose of spacecraft where re entry attitude control system was located on manned spacecraft spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous and to space station other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions but re using as many gemini systems as possible it would have had a higher cargo capacity than stripped down version of gemini spacecraft crew only or cargo only supply missions would have been launched aboard a titan ii and saturn i or saturn ib would have been used for combined crew and cargo spacecraft because of increased power of saturn i gemini spacecraft s ejection seats would not have been able to propel crew far enough in event of an explosion so a launch escape tower was proposed based on one used on mercury spacecraft titan iiim was also considered to launch heavier spacecraft big gemini right 200px thumb big gemini titan iiig version alt drawing of a spacecraft which consists of a descent module and a large cylindrical module behind it big gemini or big g grew out of a 1963 proposal called gemini transport to develop an enlarged gemini spacecraft with docking capability which would take advantage of increased capacity offered by saturn ib and titan iiim rockets it was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space and to be able to dock with space stations in support of apollo applications and mol missions it would have been launched by a heavy lift launch vehicle either a titan iiig or saturn int 20 former being intended for use on us air force missions and latter being intended for nasa missions titan iiim was also considered which would have launched a smaller version of spacecraft due to its lower capacity to resupply mol space stations later in program nasa also proposed several saturn ib derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to int 20 offering similar payload capacity shape and mass of spacecraft would have varied depending on rocket that was to launch it saturn launched version had a short conical cargo module and a total mass of whereas titan iiig launched version featured a longer cylindrical module with a total mass of titan iiim version would have been much shorter and lighter with a mass of as that rocket had less payload capacity than titan iiig or saturn iiig variant would have carried twelve crew while others had a maximum capacity of nine use of nasa variant with apollo service module was also considered once in orbit big g would have docked with space stations using an apollo docking probe mounted on rear of cargo module which was in turn mounted on rear of re entry module re entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate larger crew and modifications made to spacecraft for mol program would have been incorporated including hatch in heat shield which would have been used to provide access to cargo module in event of a launch failure launch escape system developed for apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel re entry module clear of rocket big g would have made landings on land using a parasail or paraglider to guide it onto a runway or dry lake such as one at edwards air force base it would have landed using skids derived from north american x 15 lunar exploration circumlunar missions right thumb 330px gemini centaur proposal for circumlunar missions alt drawing of a spacecraft and a rocket stage docked together a number of studies investigated sending a gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory many of proposals made for this involved a double launch architecture with gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit upper stages that were considered included transtage second stage of a titan ii four different types of centaur including s v variant developed for saturn i agena d an enlarged agena and two burning in parallel either a titan or saturn ib would have been used to launch upper stage while gemini would launch on titan ii as it had in gemini program other proposals involved launching gemini spacecraft on a titan iiic and refueling in low earth orbit before proceeding to moon and a single launch architecture using a three stage variant of saturn ib gemini centaur proposal was predicted to have been able to achieve a 72 hour circumlunar flight centaur would have performed trans lunar injection before separating from gemini spacecraft some concerns were raised that gemini spacecraft s heat shield would not have been able to protect it during higher speed ballistic reentry associated with trajectory that would have been required nasa proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect spacecraft this and several other modifications made spacecraft too heavy to be launched by titan ii rocket which was used for original twelve gemini missions so several solid rocket motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown lunar orbit missions gemini spacecraft would have rendezvoused with stacked centaur and agena upper stages in low earth orbit centaur would have placed gemini and agena onto a circumlunar trajectory along which they would coast until they reached moon agena would then have been used to perform lunar orbit insertion following completion of activities in lunar orbit agena would have been fired again for trans earth injection this architecture would have used a titan ii to launch gemini spacecraft with a saturn ib launching upper stages lunar landing thumb one of early proposals for a lightweight one man lander alt drawing of a small spacecraft using gemini spacecraft for a manned lunar landing was considered as early as original mercury mark ii proposal which led to gemini program initial proposal was for a lunar orbit rendezvous mission using a gemini spacecraft and a lightweight open cockpit lander launched by a saturn c 3 rocket it was first time that lunar orbit rendezvous was proposed as part of a lunar landing concept spacecraft would have been tested in low earth orbit before lunar missions using two titan ii launches lander which was designed by nasa s langley research center would have had a mass of no more than some of proposals had a mass as low as with cryogenic propellants being used in place of heavier hypergolic propellant proposal was intended to provide a faster and lower cost alternative to apollo program which was at that time proposing a direct ascent landing another proposal would have used a saturn v to achieve a direct ascent mission profile spacecraft consisted of four modules retrograde module would have been powered by an engine and used to propel spacecraft during trans lunar coast during landing it would be used for initial phases of powered descent at an altitude of above lunar surface rm would have been jettisoned and a second module terminal landing module would have performed final descent after landing spacecraft would have stayed on moon for a day before it was propelled back to earth launch from lunar surface and trans earth injection would have been performed by service module which would also have contained components of life support system and other systems which were located in equipment module of earth orbit gemini spacecraft reentry module was based on gemini capsule but would have been modified to allow it to reenter atmosphere at higher velocity that would have been required by a lunar flight it was seen as last effort by nasa managers and engineers who still advocated direct ascent mission profile and was intended to be cheaper faster and safer than apollo lunar orbit rendezvous technique apollo rescue due to risks associated with lunar landing a number of rescue spacecraft were proposed to be used to allow crew of an apollo mission to return to earth safely in event of a problem many of these designs were based around gemini spacecraft one of these proposals was gemini lunar orbit rescue vehicle which was designed to retrieve crew of an apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around moon it was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate three astronauts who would have been aboard apollo this would have been attached to a modified equipment module equipment module contained engines which would be used for lunar orbit insertion and trans earth injection as well as life support equipment to keep crew alive until they returned to earth launch and trans lunar injection would have been performed by a saturn v once spacecraft was in lunar orbit apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an eva another proposed spacecraft gemini lunar surface survival shelter was designed to be sent to moon ahead of an apollo mission it would have landed close to planned apollo landing site and if apollo lunar module s ascent stage failed to ignite crew would have performed an eva to transfer to lsss shelter was not designed to take off again after landing so an lsrs or another apollo mission would then be sent to collect crew while command module pilot of original apollo mission would have returned to earth alone aboard his spacecraft it consisted of a gemini reentry module which would have housed astronauts while they awaited rescue and a descent stage containing life support systems consumables and engine and propellant used to land spacecraft gemini lunar surface rescue spacecraft was intended to fly a direct ascent mission launched by a saturn v descent stages built from either descent stage of apollo lunar module or from apollo service module would have reduced spacecraft s velocity as it approached moon one configuration used two service modules and one lem descent stage with lem descent stage performing final landing and then being reused for ascent from lunar surface and trans earth injection other configuration used three lem descent stages with second being used for landing and third for ascent and tei lsrs would have landed close to apollo lunar module on moon and apollo crew would have transferred to it by eva following apollo 1 fire in january 1967 nasa conducted a safety review of apollo program in response to this review mcdonnell proposed universal lunar rescue vehicle a repackaged version of lunar surface rescue spacecraft with an enlarged capsule to make room for three astronauts who were being rescued it was intended to rescue an apollo crew at almost any point while they were at moon should an anomaly occur some designs included five seats with two astronauts piloting it to moon proposal was considered but rejected due to lack of funds other proposals a number of other applications were considered for gemini spacecraft manned orbital telescope manned orbital telescope was a proposal for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation it would have used larger reentry module which was also proposed for big gemini spacecraft and would have been launched on a saturn ib enlarged reentry module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at same time which would have been used to rescue crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low earth orbit it would have launched atop a titan iiic once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a transtage integrated into equipment module larger capsule would have been used to accommodate crew of spacecraft which required rescuing rendezvous with a pegasus satellite another proposed mission would have seen a gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a pegasus satellite in low earth orbit spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with pegasus or into a lower orbit subsequently docking with an agena and using that to raise its orbit gemini would have flown around pegasus and then one of crew would have performed an eva to recover a piece of one of spacecraft s micrometeoroid detection panels this mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft to collect data on satellite s exposure to supporting data that satellite had returned itself and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites gemini paraglider right thumb alt a spacecraft on wheels suspended from a large triangular wing in flight close to ground gemini paraglider several missions were proposed to demonstrate methods of landing gemini spacecraft on land spacecraft had originally been designed to land using a flexible rogallo wing and a set of skis or wheels however this was abandoned in favor of under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing as proposed big gemini spacecraft would have landed this way mcdonnell aircraft asked nasa to consider flying standard gemini spacecraft with paraglider in order to test system before it would be required operationally winged gemini another alternative landing concept was us air force s proposal to attach wings to spacecraft this proposal arose soon after cancellation of x 20 dyna soar and would have seen a gemini spacecraft attached to a set of wings developed during asset program this would have been launched by a titan ii rocket and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit another proposal saw spacecraft being launched by a titan iiia or iiic using transtage for maneuvering once mission was complete spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors long duration missions there were also proposals to use gemini spacecraft to conduct long duration missions to small purpose built space stations in low earth orbit one proposal saw a space station based on agena which would have been used to provide propulsion and attitude control for station a pressurized module between agena and docking adapter would have been used by crew for accommodation and to conduct experiments crew would have boarded agena by means of an inflatable tunnel between hatches and its airlock pecan spacecraft was a similar proposal see also apollo applications program apollo program direct project gemini manned orbital laboratory skylab soyuz program
