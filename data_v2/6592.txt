his contract with team for an additional year in week prior to race mercedes introduced a new low downforce rear wing for spa featuring a spoon shaped design similar to that of mclaren mp4 21 in aim was to find a balance between low downforce for long straights on spa circuit while at same time retaining enough downforce for more twisting second sector of track red bull on other hand tested two different rear wings during friday s free practice sessions while daniel ricciardo ran with a very low downforce wing daniil kvyat tested a more spa specific set up which was ultimately used by both drivers in qualifying and race to prevent tyre degradation mclaren came to spa with a new specification power unit aiming to reach level of ferrari s unit with introduced changes however team s racing director eric boullier warned that it might take until singapore until gains could be visible and expected a difficult belgian grand prix in suit with new power unit team introduced a new engine cover

attempt to limit influence of pit walls on their drivers during race starts new regulations were introduced for start procedure from belgian grand prix onwards drivers were now only allowed to adjust one clutch level after leaving pit garage for starting grid response from drivers was mixed with nico rosberg commenting that new start procedures would be challenging while fernando alonso opined that changes were not significant and daniel ricciardo hoped new procedure might help his team lotus legal troubles lotus team experienced legal difficulties over spa weekend as a legal battle with former test driver charles pic concerning time team had granted pic at wheel of their car with case in arbitration court lotus faced threat of their cars being impounded and unable to move following conclusion of grand prix weekend bailiffs returned cars to lotus and team was eventually able to travel to italy after bernie ecclestone chief executive of formula one group stepped in to ensure staff were paid while their financial problems continued to question team s future free practice per regulations for season three practice sessions were held two 90 minute sessions on friday and another one hour session before qualifying on saturday in first practice session on friday morning nico rosberg was fastest after initial trouble with his power unit a quarter of a second ahead of his mercedes teammate lewis hamilton daniel ricciardo red bull was third just five hundredths of a second slower than hamilton with kimi raikkonen another tenth down in fourth fifty minutes into session a red flag came out when pastor maldonado lost traction at rear end of his lotus hybrid at exit of les combes corner and crashed into tyre barriers damaging front right of his car session was stopped for ten minutes for track marshals to repair barriers speaking about his accident maldonado said it was very unlucky because i nearly saved car but anyway it happened this track is always very difficult when you have a moment or whatever especially at that point where second sector is quite narrow but this can happen now we can t change that we need to look forward in second lotus romain grosjean was again replaced by jolyon palmer who finished practice 17th another accident marred second practice session on friday afternoon when a rear tyre on nico rosberg s mercedes blew causing him to spin in run up to blanchimont corner rosberg was able to avoid hitting tyre barriers but session was nevertheless red flagged in order to clear track of car prior to this incident rosberg had set fastest time of session with 1 49 687 three tenths of a second faster than teammate hamilton in second ricciardo was again third a further 0 4 seconds adrift ahead of fellow red bull driver daniil kvyat one second behind rosberg williams cars of valtteri bottas and felipe massa were 14th and 16th respectively ahead of two mclaren drivers who were faster only than two manor marussia cars rosberg s tyre failure was later deemed result of an external cut excluding possibility of any structural integrity issues rosberg however remained worried about reliability of tyres for sunday s race saying problem is that we don t really understand it there are theories but there is no real evidence so that s a bit worrying for sure world champion lewis hamilton bounced back in third session on saturday morning being quickest almost half a second faster than rosberg in an uneventful session two ferrari drivers were third and fourth with vettel leading raikkonen meanwhile force india drivers sergio perez and nico hulkenberg ended session in fifth and eighth respectively separated by red bull drivers only nuisance in third practice occurred when romain grosjean almost spun having to go around kimi raikkonen in turn 16 complaining to his team about a very very dangerous manoeuvre qualifying qualifying consisted of three parts 18 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of first two sessions valtteri bottas was first and last out on track during first part of qualifying q1 starting lap that saved him from elimination in very last moments of session excluded from further participation were both manor marussia cars both mclaren drivers and sauber s felipe nasr max verstappen succeeded in progressing into q2 despite complaining about a loss of power on his car second part of qualifying saw kimi raikkonen come to a halt on track due to a loss of oil pressure session was briefly red flagged to clear track and when it resumed both mercedes drivers decided not to head out again since their first times where sufficient to advance to q3 max verstappen did not compete in q2 at all due to problems on his car leaving him in provisional 14th bar his penalty and raikkonen in 15th on grid other three drivers to be eliminated were marcus ericsson for sauber daniil kvyat and nico hulkenberg hulkenberg s time was just three tenths of a second slower than that of sebastian vettel in tenth and he became only driver of a mercedes powered car not to compete for pole position thumb lewis hamilton celebrates taking pole position lewis hamilton was first mercedes driver to set a timed lap in q3 being almost half a second faster than rosberg in q2 while rosberg succeeded in bettering his times as well he nevertheless ended up 0 458 seconds behind his teammate and second on grid this handed lewis hamilton his tenth pole position in eleven races meaning that he secured fia pole position trophy at this early stage of season next fastest car valtteri bottas for williams was 1 3 seconds off hamilton s time of 1 47 197 fourth fastest was grosjean who delivered what bbc called a stunningly impressive lap sergio perez put in a surprising effort as well finishing fifth for force india meanwhile sebastian vettel who had won previous race in hungary managed only ninth fastest after a mistake at final chicane after qualifying hamilton stated his performance was mainly due to improvements he made in middle sector of lap saying sector two has been probably in past a bit of a weak point i knew lines but could never really put corners together definitely on those last two laps that was a very very strong area for me indeed he gained most of his time on rosberg in this sector containing majority of circuit s corners he became first driver since michael schumacher who achieved feat in to secure six consecutive pole positions while last driver to score six consecutive poles in one season was mika hakkinen in following their poor qualifying performance and grid penalties jenson button expected a lonely race for mclaren saying i actually enjoyed driving car and when you cross finishing line and you see time you think that s not bad but then when you see where you are a second off guy in front of you it s a massive margin it hurts penalties thumb jenson button expected a lonely race after a poor qualifying and a grid penalty mclaren who were expected to benefit from start changes were set to start race from back of grid after they had already been allowed to use one additional power unit in 2015 season team had used their sixth power unit for hungarian grand prix and now equipped both cars with a seventh heavily revised version of their power unit for belgium on friday mclaren made another power unit change on saturday since a mid season change in regulations meant that penalties could no longer result in in race time penalties cumulative 105 place grid penalty set a new record in formula one max verstappen received a ten place grid penalty after he equipped his sixth power unit on friday after lotus changed gearbox on romain grosjean s car on saturday grosjean was handed a five place grid penalty moving him from fourth to ninth on grid for same reason kimi raikkonen received a five place grid penalty which only set him back two places due to penalties of other drivers race thumb nico hulkenberg was unable to start race prior to race start nico hulkenberg returned to pit garage after reporting a loss of power on his force india but he eventually made it to grid his problem returned during formation lap and when his car stalled on starting grid starting procedure was aborted and another formation lap commenced carlos sainz jr experienced a similar problem during second formation lap and was called into pit lane he was eventually sent out after race started race distance was therefore shortened to 43 laps at start nico rosberg did not get away well falling back to fifth behind perez ricciardo and bottas but overtook latter for fourth by end of lap fernando alonso did also start well for mclaren moving up to twelfth while lewis hamilton retained his lead pulling clear of perez s force india early on on lap two pastor maldonado became second retirement of race when he stopped his car due to a power failure on lap six daniil kvyat took eighth place from felipe massa while romain grosjean had quick first laps as well overtaking second williams of bottas for sixth on lap eight thumb left at his first pit stop valtteri bottas mechanics fitted his car with three soft compound tyres and one medium compound tyre erroneous tyre right rear resulted in bottas serving a drive through penalty an early pit stop by ricciardo on lap eight forced hand of force india who brought in perez one lap later but perez still came out behind red bull several more drivers came in over next couple of laps including bottas and grosjean with williams taking back his position during stops only to be overtaken again on lap ten bottas was also set for a penalty as his team had simultaneously equipped him with two different types of tyre compounds he would later serve a drive through penalty lap eleven saw a risky overtaking manoeuvre by max verstappen who went around outside of nasr at blanchimont to take eleventh place following these first stops order at front was hamilton rosberg vettel raikkonen and ricciardo with first four yet to stop rosberg was first to do so on lap 13 coming out slightly ahead of perez who had overtaken ricciardo a lap earlier perez carried his momentum into eau rouge and up to turn seven but ultimately failed to get better of mercedes hamilton and vettel made pit stops for new tyres on laps 14 and 15 respectively over next laps rosberg steadily closed on hamilton in front without being able to catch his teammate lap 18 saw romain grosjean gain another position at ricciardo s expense moving into fourth just two laps later a drs aided move on perez handed him third place on lap 21 daniel ricciardo s red bull came to a sudden stop at exit of bus stop chicane leading to a virtual safety car period during which many drivers made pit stops for new tyres among them grosjean massa and verstappen by lap 29 kvyat had made a pit stop for new soft tyres being able to go fast until end of race while vettel decided to try and finish race without pitting for new tyres a second time kvyat s newer tyres allowed him to overtake bottas raikkonen massa and perez to eventually finish fourth sainz jr eventually retired from race on lap 34 vettel s strategy however did not work out by lap 42 less than two laps from finish his right rear tyre exploded while on kemmel straight handing grosjean final podium position vettel ended his race in pit lane but was classified down in twelfth place unchallenged by his teammate in second lewis hamilton finished race to take his 39th grand prix victory post race thumb post race podium ceremony at podium interviews conducted by former formula one driver david coulthard lewis hamilton said that he felt fairly relaxed at front naming looking after tyre wear as his only concern during race nico rosberg conceded that he just completely messed up start and added that hamilton did a great job so deserved to win romain grosjean was delighted with his tenth career podium speaking of an incredible weekend and claimed that podium has feel of a race win asked about his title aspirations hamilton insisted that it was definitely way too early to speak about winning world title during post race press conference grosjean described moment of vettel s tyre failure as a bit of a scary moment saying that it was very unfortunate he had that puncture thumb left roberto merhi finished ahead of teammate will stevens for fourth race in succession following race sebastian vettel voiced harsh criticism of tyre supplier pirelli concerning not only his own but also nico rosberg s tyre failure on friday he was quoted saying i think it is a sort of thing that keeps going around and no one mentions it is unacceptable if nico tells us he did not go off track he didn t go off track why should he lie to us it is same with me i didn t go off track it is out of blue tyre exploded he saw safety of drivers at risks asserting that i f it happens 200 metres earlier i am not standing here now pirelli s motorsport director paul reacted to vettel s accusations by saying i am not going to criticise sebastian it is a hot moment and i don t want to enter into a war of words over that it is pointless for everybody we were concerned when we saw number of laps that were going to be done nobody really suggested they were going to do a one stop race and it was a bit of a surprise if anything people were talking about doing three stops rather than two nico rosberg however backed up his compatriot vettel telling press exploding tyres is poor it shouldn t happen that it keeps on happening in other categories as well and with me on friday both of us were so lucky if it had happened a couple of metres later or earlier we would have one of biggest shunts ever they need to figure out something to make it safer he also called for immediate action considering race following spa francorchamps due to its nature as fastest race of year pirelli reacted by demanding a maximum stint length for their tyres a suggestion company had already put in at end of day after race pirelli announced that they had found cuts on other tyres from other teams mainly on rear tyres and that they were still searching for cause of damages however company reasserted their stance that while rosberg s failure was caused by external damage vettel s was due to pure wear vettel received additional support from coulthard who wrote that vettel was right to tackle pirelli over issue of tyres as well as coulthard s former teammate mika hakkinen vettel once again defended team s decision to try a one stop race on tuesday after race saying our strategy was never risky at any point team is not to blame when tyre supplier released findings of their own investigation into matter company needed to overturn their claim that failure was caused by wear since report proved that damage to vettel s tyre was caused by debris thumb left max verstappen was praised for his overtake on felipe nasr max verstappen received particular praise for his overtake on felipe nasr through blanchimont former driver allan mcnish wrote this is first time in my life i have seen someone go around outside of someone at blanchimont that was big at fia prize giving ceremony on 4 december 2015 verstappen received an award for action of year acknowledging his manoeuvre jenson button on other hand called mclaren s race an embarrassment after he had suffered from a lack of battery power throughout race finishing only ahead of two manor marussia drivers lotus disclosed that maldonado s retirement was in part caused by heavy contact with kerbs with intensity of impact being as high as technical director nick chester felt it was a big shame that maldonado who had been running ahead of eventual third placed grosjean when he retired was unable to contribute to a strong result for team lotus later revealed that retirement was caused by damage to clutch control system sustained when he went off track at eau rouge at same time team applauded grosjean for a faultless drive additional praise for grosjean came from motorsport journalist mark hughes who felt that grosjean was still seriously under rated in formula one williams launched an internal investigation into tyre mix up at valtteri bottas s first pit stop feeling that it might have cost him a podium position as a result of race lewis hamilton extended his championship lead over rosberg to 28 points biggest margin it had been all season up to that point vettel s tyre failure cost him points as he was now 67 points off lead in standings in constructors championship mercedes extended their lead over ferrari to 184 points while lotus moved into fifth place at expense of force india classification qualifying driverconstructorq1q2q3 144 lewis hamilton
