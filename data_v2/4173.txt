thumb upright 1 5 a reconstruction of york castle in 14th century showing castle s stone keep top overlooking castle bailey below a keep from middle english kype is a type of fortified tower built within castles during middle ages by european nobility scholars have debated scope of word keep but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences used as a refuge of last resort should rest of castle fall to an adversary first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of motte and bailey castles that emerged in normandy and anjou during 10th century design spread to england as a result of norman invasion of 1066 and in turn spread into wales during second half of 11th century and into ireland in 1170s anglo normans and french rulers began to build stone keeps during 10th and 11th centuries these included norman keeps with a square or rectangular design and circular shell keeps stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build during 12th century new designs began to be introduced in france quatrefoil shaped keeps were introduced while in england polygonal towers were built by end of century french and english keep designs began to diverge philip ii of france built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories while in england castles were built without keeps in spain keeps were increasingly incorporated into both christian and islamic castles although in germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in western fashion in second half of 14th century there was a resurgence in building of keeps in france keep at vincennes began a fashion for tall heavily machicolated designs a trend adopted in spain most prominently through valladolid school of spanish castle design meanwhile tower keeps in england became popular amongst most wealthy nobles these large keeps each uniquely designed formed part of grandest castles built during period in 15th century protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery for example in 1464 during wars of roses keep in bamburgh castle previously considered to be impregnable was defeated with bombards by 16th century keeps were slowly falling out of fashion as fortifications and residences many were destroyed in civil wars between 17th and 18th centuries or incorporated into gardens as an alternative to follies during 19th century keeps became fashionable once again and in england and france a number were restored or redesigned by gothic architects despite further damage to many french and spanish keeps during wars of 20th century keeps now form an important part of tourist and heritage industry in europe etymology and historiography thumb upright a 19th century reconstruction of keep at chateau d etampes since 16th century english word keep has commonly referred to large towers in castles dixon p 9 word originates from around 1375 to 1376 coming from middle english term kype meaning basket or cask and was a term applied to shell keep at guines said to resemble a barrel kenyon and thompson pp 175 6 term came to be used for other shell keeps by 15th century by 17th century word keep lost its original reference to baskets or casks and was popularly assumed to have come from middle english word keep meaning to hold or to protect early on use of word keep became associated with idea of a tower in a castle that would serve both as a fortified high status private residence and a refuge of last resort dixon pp 9 12 gondoin p 103 4 issue was complicated by building of fortified renaissance towers in italy called tenazza that were used as defences of last resort and were also named after italian for to hold or to keep by 19th century victorian historians incorrectly concluded that etymology of words keep and tenazza were linked and that all keeps had fulfilled this military function as a result of this evolution in meaning use of term keep in historical analysis today can be problematic king pp 190 6 contemporary medieval writers used various terms for buildings we would today call keeps in latin they are variously described as turris turris castri or magna turris a tower a castle tower or a great tower 12th century french came to term them a donjon from latin lordship linking keep and feudal authority similarly medieval spanish writers called buildings torre del homenaje or tower of homage in england donjon turned into dungeon which initially referred to a keep rather than to a place of imprisonment king p 190 while term remains in common academic use some academics prefer to use term donjon and most modern historians warn against using term keep simplistically fortifications that we would today call keeps certainly did not necessarily form part of a unified medieval style nor were they all used in a similar fashion during period king pp 190 6 dixon p 12 history timber keeps 9th 12th centuries earliest keeps were built as part of motte and bailey castles from 10th century onwards a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence places first such castle built at vincy in 979 king p 38 these castles were initially built by more powerful lords of anjou in late 10th and 11th centuries in particular fulk iii and his son geoffrey ii who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060 devries pp 203 4 william conqueror then introduced this form of castle into england when he invaded in 1066 and design spread through south wales as normans expanded up valleys during subsequent decades king pp 20 1 thumb upright reconstructed wooden keep at saint sylvain d anjou in a motte and bailey design a castle would include a mound called a motte usually artificially constructed by piling up turf and soil and a bailey a lower walled enclosure a keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of motte some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall walk around them and outer walls of motte and wall walk could be strengthened by filling in gap between wooden walls with earth and stones allowing it to carry more weight this was called a garillum king p 55 smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep devries p 209 many wooden keeps were designed with a a square structure that overhung from upper floors of building enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design king pp 53 4 these wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege one contemporary account of these keeps comes from jean de colmieu around 1130 who described how nobles of calais region would build a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible space on top of mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide inside enclosure is a citadel or keep which commands whole circuit of defences entrance to fortress is by means of a bridge which rising from outer side of moat and supported on posts as it ascends to top of mound toy p 53 at durham castle contemporaries described how keep arose from tumulus of rising earth with a keep reaching into thin air strong within and without a stalwart house glittering with beauty in every part kenyon p 13 citing armitage 1912 pp 147 8 as well as having defensive value keeps and mottes sent a powerful political message to local population durand p 17 wooden keeps could be quite extensive in size and as robert higham and philip barker have noted it was possible to build very tall and massive structures higham and barker p 244 as an example of what these keeps may have comprised early 12th century chronicler lambert of ardres described wooden keep on top of motte at castle of ardres where first storey was on surface of ground where were cellars and granaries and great boxes tuns casks and other domestic utensils in storey above were dwelling and common living rooms of residents in which were larders rooms of bakers and butlers and great chamber in which lord and his wife slept in upper storey of house were garret rooms in this storey also watchmen and servants appointed to keep house took their sleep brown p 30 in holy roman empire tall free standing wooden later stone fighting towers called bergfriede were commonly built by 11th century either as part of motte and bailey designs or as part of hohenburgen castles with characteristic inner and outer courts kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 purton p 195 bergfriede which take their name from german for a belfry had similarities to keeps but are usually distinguished from them on account of bergfriede having a smaller area or footprint usually being non residential and being typically integrated into outer defences of a castle rather than being a safe refuge of last resort kaufmann and kaufmann pp 123 306 thompson 2008 pp 22 3 early stone keeps 10th 12th centuries during 10th century a small number of stone keeps began to be built in france such at chateau de langeais in 11th century their numbers increased as style spread through normandy across rest of france and into england nicholson p 78 kaufmann and kaufmann p 109 some existing motte and bailey castles were converted to stone with keep amongst usually first parts to be upgraded while in other cases new keeps were built from scratch in stone brown p 38 these stone keeps were introduced into ireland during 1170s following norman occupation of east of country where they were particularly popular amongst new anglo norman lords mcneill pp 20 53 two broad types of design emerged across france and england during period four sided stone keeps known as norman keeps or great keeps in english a donjon carre or donjon roman in french and circular shell keeps viollet le duc p 77 reasons for transition from timber to stone keeps are unclear and process was slow and uneven taking many years to take effect across various regions brown p 36 traditionally it was believed that stone keeps had been adopted because of cruder nature of wooden buildings limited lifespan of wooden fortifications and their vulnerability to fire but recent archaeological studies have shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as sophisticated as their stone equivalents brown p 36 toy 1985 p 54 creighton and higham pp 41 2 some wooden keeps were not converted into stone for many years and were instead expanded in wood such as at hen domen creighton and higham p 41 nonetheless stone became increasingly popular as a building material for keeps for both military and symbolic reasons liddiard 2005 p 53 king p 62 stone keep construction required skilled craftsmen unlike timber and earthworks which could be built using unfree labour or serfs these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive pounds p 20 they were also relatively slow to erect due to limitations of lime mortar used during period a keep s walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet 3 6 metres a year keep at scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build number of such keeps remained relatively low in england for example although several early stone keeps had been built after conquest there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100 and only around a hundred had been built by 1216 hulme p 213 norman keeps had four sides with corners reinforced by pilaster buttresses some keeps particularly in normandy and france had a design being rectangular in plan with their length twice their width while others particularly in england formed a square toy 1985 p 66 baldwin p 298 these keeps could be up to four storeys high with entrance placed on first storey to prevent door from being easily broken down early french keeps had external stairs in wood whilst later castles in both france and england built them in stone toy 198 p 66 king p 67 in some cases entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door producing a forebuilding king p 67 strength of norman design typically came from thickness of keep s walls usually made of rag stone these could be up to 24 feet 7 3 metres thick immensely strong and producing a steady temperature inside building throughout summer and winter brown p 45 king p 68 larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while smaller versions had a single slightly cramped chamber on each floor brown p 46 thompson 2008 p 65 usually only first floor would be vaulted in stone with higher storeys supported with timbers there has been extensive academic discussion of extent to which norman keeps were designed with a military or political function in mind particularly in england earlier analyses of norman keeps focused on their military design and historians such as r brown cathcart king proposed that square keeps were adopted because of their military superiority over timber keeps most of these norman keeps were certainly extremely physically robust even though characteristic pilaster buttresses added little real architectural strength to design king p 67 hulme p 216 many of weaknesses inherent to their design were irrelevant during early part of their history corners of square keeps were theoretically vulnerable to siege engines and galleried mining but before introduction of trebuchet at end of 12th century early artillery stood little practical chance of damaging keeps and galleried mining was rarely practised hulme pp 216 222 similarly corners of a square keep created dead space that defenders could not fire at but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until introduction of crossbow in middle of 12th century when arrowslits began to be introduced hume p 217 nonetheless many stone norman keeps made considerable compromises to military utility liddiard 2005 pp 51 2 norwich castle for example included elaborate blind arcading on outside of building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony rather than for defence liddiard 2005 p 51 interior of keep at hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective liddiard 2005 p 53 important early english and welsh keeps such as white tower colchester and chepstow were all built in a distinctive romanesque style often reusing roman materials and sites and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people liddiard 2005 p 34 pettifer 2000a p xiii turner p 27 political value of these keep designs and social prestige they lent to their builders may help explain why they continued to be built in england into late 12th century beyond point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted liddiard 2005 p 48 king p 73 second early stone design emerging from 12th century onwards was shell keep a donjon in french which involved replacing wooden keep on a motte or palisade on a ringwork with a circular stone wall brown p 42 durand p 29 shell keeps were sometimes further protected by an additional low protective wall called a chemise around their base buildings could then be built around inside of shell producing a small inner courtyard at centre brown p 42 style was particularly popular in south east england and across normandy although less so elsewhere durand p 29 toy 1933 cited creighton p 49 restormel castle is a classic example of this development as is later launceston castle prominent normandy and low country equivalents include gisors and van leiden these castles were amongst most powerful fortifications of period brown p 41 toy 1985 pp 58 9 viollet le duc p 83 although circular design held military advantages over one with square corners as noted above these really mattered from only end of 12th century onwards major reason for adopting a shell keep design in 12th century at least was circular design of original earthworks exploited to support keep indeed some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes such as that found at windsor castle hulme p 222 mid medieval keeps late 12th 14th centuries during second half of 12th century a range of new keep designs began to appear across france and england breaking previous unity of regional designs use of keeps in castles spread through iberia but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs one traditional explanation for these developments emphasises military utility of new approaches arguing for example that curved surfaces of new keeps helped to deflect attacks or that they drew on lessons learnt during crusades from islamic practices in levant brown pp 53 4 king p 81 more recent historical analysis however has emphasised political and social drivers that underlay these mid medieval changes in keep design liddiard 2005 pp 6 7 through most of 12th century france was divided between capetian kings ruling from ile de france and kings of england who controlled normandy and much of west of france within capetian territories early experimentation in new keep designs began at in 1120 where a circular keep was built with four round turrets internally however structure remained conventionally square king p 98 gondoin p 156 a few years later chateau d etampes adopted a quatrefoil design king p 99 these designs however remained isolated experiments in 1190s however struggle for power in france began to swing in favour of philip ii culminating in capetian capture of normandy in 1204 philip ii started to construct completely circular keeps such as tour jeanne d arc with most built in his newly acquired territories king p 100 baldwin p 298 chatelain p 303 first of philip s new keeps was begun at louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed all built to a consistent standard and cost baldwin p 299 architectural idea of circular keeps may have come from catalonia where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition and probably carried some military advantages but philip s intention in building these new keeps in a fresh style was clearly political an attempt to demonstrate his new power and authority over his extended territories durand pp 29 57 gondoin p 156 as historian philippe durand suggests these keeps provided military security and were a physical representation of or capetian renewal durand p 59 keep design in england began to change only towards end of 12th century later than in france king p 77 wooden keeps on mottes ceased to be built across most of england by 1150s although they continued to be erected in wales and along welsh marches pounds p 21 by end of 12th century england and ireland saw a handful of innovative angular or polygonal keeps built including keep at orford castle with three rectangular clasping towers built out from high circular central tower cross shaped keep of trim castle and famous polygonal design at brown pp 52 3 heslop pp 279 289 anderson p 113 hull p 142 despite these new designs square keeps remained popular across much of england and as late as 1170s square norman great keeps were being built at newcastle anderson pp 114 6 circular keep designs similar to those in france really became popular in britain in welsh marches and scotland for only a short period during early 13th century king pp 81 2 as with new keeps constructed in france these anglo norman designs were informed both by military thinking and by political drivers keep at orford has been particularly extensively analysed in this regard and although traditional explanations suggested that its unusual plan was result of an experimental military design more recent analysis concludes that design was instead probably driven by political symbolism and need for henry to dominate contested lands of east anglia liddiard 2005 p 47 architecture would for mid 12th century nobility have summoned up images of king arthur or constantinople then idealised versions of royal and imperial power heslop p 288 9 even formidable military designs such as that at chateau gaillard were built with political effect in mind liddiard 2005 p 54 gaillard was designed to reaffirm angevin authority in a fiercely disputed conflict zone and keep although militarily impressive contained only an anteroom and a royal audience chamber and was built on soft chalk and without an internal well both serious defects from a defensive perspective during most of medieval period iberia was divided between christian and islamic kingdoms neither of which traditionally built keeps instead building watchtowers or mural towers tuulse p 74 burton p 230 by 12th century however influence of france and various military orders was encouraging development of square keeps in christian castles across region and by second half of century this practice was spread across into islamic kingdoms tuulse p 74 burton p 236 anderson p 151 by contrast remainder of europe saw stone towers being used in castles but not in a way that fulfilled range of functions seen in western european keeps in low countries it became popular for local nobility to build stand alone square towers but rarely as part of a wider castle purton p 94 similarly square stone towers became popular in venice but these did not fulfil same role as western keeps schulz p 7 in germany rectangular stone castles began to replace motte and bailey castles from 12th century onwards taylor p 7 these designs included stone versions of traditional bergfriede which still remained distinct from domestic keeps used in more western parts of europe with occasional notable exception such as large residential bergfried at castle several designs for new castles emerged that made keeps unnecessary one such design was concentric approach involving exterior walls guarded with towers and perhaps supported by further concentric layered defenses thus castles such as framlingham never had a central keep military factors may well have driven this development r brown for example suggests that designs with a separate keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co ordinated and combined defensive system and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough a keep became militarily unnecessary brown pp 62 72 in england gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged need for a keep in same castle classic edwardian gatehouse with two large flanking towers and multiple portcullises designed to be defended from attacks both within and outside main castle has been often compared to earlier norman keeps some of largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason pettifer 2000b p 320 brown p 69 quadrangular castle design that emerged in france during 13th century was another development that removed need for a keep castles had needed additional living space since their first emergence in 9th century initially this had been provided by halls in bailey then later by ranges of chambers alongside inside of a bailey wall such as at goodrich but french designs in late 12th century took layout of a contemporary unfortified manor house whose rooms faced around a central rectangular courtyard and built a wall around them to form a castle gondoin p 167 result illustrated initially at and later at chateau de was a characteristic quadrangular layout with four large circular corner towers it lacked a keep which was not needed to support this design chatelain p 35 late medieval keeps 14th 16th centuries end of medieval period saw a fresh resurgence in building of keeps in western castles some castles continued to be built without keeps bastille in 1370s for example combined a now traditional quadrangular design with machicolated corner towers gatehouses and moat walls innovatively were of equal height to towers pounds pp 265 6 this fashion became copied across french and in england particularly amongst nouveau riche for example at nunney royalty and very wealthiest in france england and spain however began to construct a small number of keeps on a much larger scale than before in england sometimes termed tower keeps as part of new palace fortresses this shift reflected political and social pressures such as desire of wealthiest lords to have privacy from their growing households of retainers as well as various architectural ideas being exchanged across region despite ongoing hundred years war between france and england emery p 206 anderson p 223 resurgence in french keep design began after defeat of royal armies at battles of crecy in 1346 and poitiers in 1356 which caused high levels of social unrest across remaining french territories durand p 81 purton p 140 charles v of france attempted to restore french royal authority and prestige through construction of a new range of castles chateau de vincennes where a new keep was completed under charles by 1380 was first example of these palace fortresses keep at vincennes was highly innovative six stories high with a chemin de ronde running around machicolated battlements luxuriously appointed building was protected by an enceinte wall that formed a fortified envelope around keep durand p 81 purton p 140 anderson p 208 vincennes keep was copied elsewhere across france particularly as french kings reconquered territories from english encouraging a style that emphasised very tall keeps with prominent machicolations purton p 141 no allowance for emerging new gunpowder weapons was made in these keeps although later in century gunports were slowly being added as for example by charles vi to his keep at saint malo purton p 141 270 french model spread into iberia in second half of century where most powerful nobles in castile built a number of similar tall keeps such as that at taking advantage of weakness of castilian crown during period anderson p 237 henry iv of castile responded in 15th century by creating a sequence of royal castles with prominent keeps at castle of la mota portillo and alcazar of segovia built to particular proportions these keeps became known as a key element of valladolid school of spanish castle design kaufmann and kaufmann p 284 smaller versions of these keeps were subsequently built by many aspiring new aristocracy in spain including many converted jews keen to improve their social prestige and position in society french model of tall keeps was also echoed in some german castles such as that at although layout and positioning of these towers still followed existing bergfried model rather than that in western castles anderson p 174 15th and 16th centuries saw a small number of english and occasional welsh castles develop still grander keeps pounds p 271 johnson 2002 p 111 first of these large tower keeps were built in north of england during 14th century at locations such as warkworth they were probably partially inspired by designs in france but they also reflected improvements in security along scottish border during period and regional rise of major noble families such as percies and nevilles whose wealth encouraged a surge in castle building at end of 14th century emery pp 14 5 new castles at raby bolton and warkworth castle took quadrangular castle styles of south and combined them with exceptionally large tower keeps to form a distinctive northern style king pp 152 3 built by major noble houses these castles were typically even more opulent than smaller castles like nunney built by nouveau riche king p 152 they marked what historian anthony emery has described as a second peak of castle building in england and wales following on from edwardian designs at end of 14th century emery p 25 in 15th century fashion for creation of very expensive french influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps spread with new keeps being built at wardour tattershall and raglan castle pounds p 271 in central and eastern england some keeps began to be built in brick with caister and tattershall forming examples of this trend creighton and higham p 54 in scotland construction of holyrood great tower between 1528 and 1532 drew on this english tradition but incorporated additional french influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable keep guarded by a gun park dunbar pp 69 70 these tower keeps were expensive buildings to construct each built to a unique design for a specific lord and as historian norman pounds has suggested they were designed to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour pounds p 270 at same time as these keeps were being built by extremely wealthy much smaller keep like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across ireland scotland and northern england often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners emery p 26 toy 1985 p 225 it was originally argued that irish tower houses were based on scottish design but pattern of development of such castles in ireland does not support this hypothesis barry p 223 a tower house would typically be a tall square stone built crenelated building scottish and ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall toy 1985 p 224 reid p 33 most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house pettifer 2000b p 320 as 16th century progressed keeps fell out of fashion once again in england gatehouse also began to supplant keep as key focus for a new castle development thompson 1994 pp 73 125 by 15th century it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at same castle and by early 16th century gatehouse had easily overtaken keep as more fashionable feature indeed almost no new keeps were built in england after this period classical palladian style began to dominate european architecture during 17th century causing a further move away from use of keeps buildings in this style usually required considerable space for enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces by middle of century and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep brindle and kerr p 50 keep at bolsover castle in england was one of few to be built as part of a palladian design gomme and maguire pp 69 72 later use and destruction of keeps 17th 21st centuries from 17th century onwards some keeps were deliberately destroyed in england many were destroyed after end of second english civil war in 1649 when parliament took steps to prevent another royalist uprising by slighting or damaging castles so as to prevent them from having any further military utility slighting was quite expensive and took considerable effort to carry out so damage was usually done in most cost efficient fashion with only selected walls being destroyed bull p 134 keeps were singled out for particular attention in this process because of their continuing political and cultural importance and prestige they lent their former royalist owners at kenilworth for example only keep was slighted and at raglan keep was main focus of parliamentary activity johnson p 174 there was some equivalent destruction of keeps in france in 17th and 18th centuries such as slighting of by cardinal richelieu in 1624 but catalogue of damage was far less than that of 1640s and early 1650s in england chatelain p 38 9 in england ruined medieval castles became fashionable again in middle of 18th century they were considered an interesting counterpoint to palladian classical architecture and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners gerrard p 16 creighton p 85 some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect hawarden for example was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed better to produce a good silhouette pettifer 2000a p 75 interest continued and in late 18th and 19th century it became fashionable to build intact replica castles in england resulting in what a rowan has called norman style of new castle building characterised by inclusion of large keeps final replica keep to be built in this way was at penrhyn between 1820 and 1840 thompson 1994 p 162 citing rowan 1952 where there was an existing castle on a site another response across 19th century europe was to attempt to improve buildings bringing their often chaotic historic features into line with a more integrated architectural aesthetic in a style often termed gothic revivalism jones p 4 there were numerous attempts to restore or rebuild keeps so as to produce this consistently gothic style in england architect anthony salvin was particularly prominent as illustrated by reworking and heightening of keep at windsor castle while in france eugene viollet le duc reworked keeps at castles in locations like pierrefonds during 1860s and 1870s admittedly in a largely speculative fashion since original keep had been mostly destroyed in 1617 hanser pp 181 2 184 jones p 4 spanish civil war and first and second world wars in 20th century caused damage to many castle keeps across europe in particular famous keep at coucy was destroyed by german army in 1917 thompson rise p 44 by late 20th century conservation of castle keeps formed part of government policy across france england ireland and spain stubbs and makas p 98 in 21st century in england most keeps are in ruins and form part of tourism and heritage industries rather than being used as functioning buildings keep of windsor castle being a rare exception in germany large numbers of bergfried towers were restored as functional buildings in late 19th and early 20th centuries often as government offices or youth hostels or modern conversion of tower houses which in many cases have become
