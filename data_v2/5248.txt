early in 1939 it gained additional role of providing conversion training on anson for new pilots and air gunners eather 2007 p 16 squadron s maritime patrol activities were hindered by limitations of its ansons these aircraft were obsolete and had an inadequate range and bomb load on 28 april 1939 an anson of no 6 squadron crashed near killing all four crew members following outbreak of world war ii no 6 squadron escorted convoys off australian east coast and undertook training exercises with australian army and ran squadron s ansons were replaced by twelve mark i lockheed hudson light bombers during april and may 1940 these aircraft were much more capable than ansons having a longer range higher speed and greater bomb load eather 2007 p 19 no 6 squadron continued to be based at richmond though detachments were made to other airstrips along east coast when squadron escorted troop convoys eather 2007 p 20 in august 1940 squadron conducted long range patrols searching for german raiders which were present in tasman sea but without success raaf historical section 1995 p 15 no 6 squadron continued its maritime patrol tasks in months after outbreak of pacific war in december 1941 at

squadron participated in battle of bismarck sea by searching for barges and attacking lifeboats carrying survivors from japanese ships which had been sunk due to unit s high rate of flying activities no 6 squadron s hudsons increasingly suffered from mechanical problems and this may have contributed to a drop in number of hours flown by squadron from march 1943 on 20 july no 9 operational group which commanded no 6 squadron and other raaf units in new guinea banned squadron s hudsons from taking part in any further combat operations due to their poor condition it was decided at about this time to re equip squadron with australian built bristol beauforts to effect this change no 6 squadron s hudson crews flew their aircraft back to australia and were replaced by new aircrews equipped with beauforts from september during this period squadron s ground crew were frequently used as labourers as they did not have any aircraft to maintain eather 2007 pp 65 66 after receiving its new

allocation of recently built aircraft odgers 1968 p 330 no 6 squadron next saw action in late 1944 from late october it and other units of no 71 wing conducted attacks on rabaul and other locations in

it continued to support australian army operations in new britain and aitape wewak area of new guinea there were few targets within range of dobodura however and squadron saw little combat during 1945 despite limited nature of raids conducted from dobodura squadron s offensive operations were hampered by a shortage of bombs eather 2007 p 109 a detachment of six aircraft was deployed to tadji between late april and 13 may to participate in attacks on japanese positions near wewak alongside beauforts from no 7 no 8 no 15 and no 100 squadrons odgers 1968 pp 343 345 squadron conducted little operational flying from late may and in june its commander recommended in his monthly report that no 6 squadron be either disbanded or re equipped and sent to a more active area raaf headquarters did

aircrews to serve with wing s two front line units no 1 and no 2 squadrons its training effort was increased from 1950 when no 1 squadron was deployed to malaya as part of australia s contribution to malayan emergency eather 1995 p 34 during october that year three of no 6 squadron s lincolns were deliberately flown through cloud which resulted from first british atomic bomb test operation hurricane which took place in montebello islands off western australian these aircraft had role of determining level of radioactivity caused by atomic blast and no 6 squadron performed similar duties for subsequent british atomic bomb tests at maralinga south australia several lincolns were so heavily contaminated with radioactivity during these flights that they could not be flown again squadron lost three lincolns in one day on 8 april 1953 when one was written off after its undercarriage collapsed while landing at amberley and a further two were destroyed when they collided on ground at queensland no aircrew were injured in these accidents no 6 squadron s lincolns were replaced with canberra jet bombers in early 1955 and unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 july as part of transition to canberra squadron s remaining aircrew were posted to lincoln conversion flight which continued to support no 1 squadron in malaya and replacement aircrew were posted from no 2 squadron eather 2007 p 127 squadron suffered a number of accidents during next two years in which several canberras were damaged as a result of defects with aircraft no 6 squadron continued its training duties with new aircraft these included regular deployments to darwin in northern territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to malaya and new zealand in early 1967 most of squadron s personnel were transferred to no 2 squadron to bring that unit up to its full strength before it deployed to south vietnam as part of australia s commitment to vietnam war from this point onwards no 6 squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in south vietnam during late 1960s no 1 and no 6 squadrons were scheduled to be re equipped with general dynamics f 111c strike aircraft from 1968 mechanical problems with united states air force usaf f 111s caused raaf to postpone its acceptance of these aircraft however leading for a requirement for an interim aircraft to equip both squadrons wilson and pittaway 2010 p 41 mcdonnell douglas f 4 phantom iis were leased from usaf and no 6 squadron was re equipped with these aircraft between september and october 1970 phantoms proved highly successful though one was severely damaged on its first flight at amberley when it attempted an emergency landing and arrester cable failed it was repaired by no 3 aircraft depot no 6 squadron s remaining phantoms were handed back to usaf on 4 october 1972 prior to delivery of f 111cs raaf historical section 1995 p and pittaway 2010 p 44 thumb right two no

operational conversion unit though it had a secondary strike role from august 1979 no 6 squadron gained a photo reconnaissance role when it was issued with four aircraft which had been modified into rf 111cs these four aircraft were concentrated squadron s reconnaissance flight which included photo analysts as well as specialised aircrew eather 2007 p 148 training was conducted in australia and nearby countries and rf 111cs occasionally deployed to united states to take part in exercises held there in june 1982 no 6 squadron was expanded to include a survey flight which undertook photo survey flights in co operation with army s royal australian survey corps using a leased learjet flight conducted surveys of south eastern australia northern australia fiji and parts of indonesia and malaysia until it was disbanded on 15 may 1987 in 1993 no 6 squadron s f 111cs were replaced by f 111gs which had been purchased from usaf in 1992 to be used for training purposes this purchase allowed australia s f 111cs to be used mainly for strike and reconnaissance purposes and extended type s expected life in raaf service all f 111gs were assigned to no 6 squadron and unit s f 111c and rf 111c aircraft were transferred to no 1 squadron eather 2007 pp 152 153 squadron typically had seven f 111gs operational at any point in time wilson and pittaway 2010 p 69 in 2002 australian government decided to retire f 111s in 2010 and replace them with lockheed martin f 35 lightning ii aircraft which at time were expected to be delivered from 2012 as a result of delays to f 35 program government decided in early 2007 to re equip both no 1 and no 6 squadrons with boeing f a 18f super hornet aircraft on an interim basis wilson and pittaway 2010 p 80 no 6 squadron s f 111gs were progressively retired over next few months as they became due for major servicing and last aircraft of this type flew on 3 september final f 111 operational conversion course was completed in mid 2008
