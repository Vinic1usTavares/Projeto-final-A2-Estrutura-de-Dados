thumb upright 1 2 four metric measuring devices a tape measure in centimetres a thermometer in degrees celsius a kilogram weight and a that measures volts amperes and ohms metric system is an internationally recognised decimalised system of measurement it is in widespread use and where it is adopted it is only or most common system of weights and measures it is now known as international system of units si it is used to measure everyday things such as mass of a sack of flour height of a person speed of a car and volume of fuel in its tank it is also used in science industry and trade first nation to adopt metric system a process called was france in 1790s in subsequent decades and centuries most other nations adopted it in part or in full with notable holdouts being liberia myanmar and united states which primarily uses u s customary units in its modern form it consists of a set of base units metre for length kilogram for mass second for time ampere for electrical current kelvin for temperature candela for luminous intensity and mole for quantity these together with their derived units can measure any physical quantity metric system may also refer to other systems of related base and derived units defined before middle of 20th century some of which are still in limited use today metric system was designed to have properties that make it easy to use and widely applicable including units based on natural world decimal ratios prefixes for multiples and sub multiples and a structure of base and derived units it is also a coherent system which means that its units do not introduce conversion factors not already present in equations relating quantities it has a property called rationalisation that eliminates certain constants of proportionality in equations of physics units of metric system originally taken from observable features of nature are now defined by phenomena such as microwave frequency of a caesium atomic clock which accurately measures seconds one unit kilogram was defined in terms of a man made artefact until recently but its precise definition now depends on a fixed numerical value for planck s constant new definition was formally propagated on 20 may 2019 while there are numerous named derived units of metric system such as watt and lumen other common quantities such as velocity and acceleration do not have their own unit but are defined in terms of existing base and derived units such as metres per second for velocity units of british imperial system and related us customary system are officially defined in terms of metric system notably as per international yard and pound agreement base units of imperial and customary system are defined in terms of metre and kilogram metric system is also extensible and new derived units are defined as needed in fields such as radiology and chemistry most recent derived unit katal for catalytic activity was added in 1999 recent changes are directed toward defining base units in terms of invariant constants of physics to provide more precise realisations of units for advances in science and industry units base units modern metric system consists of four electromechanical base units representing seven fundamental dimensions of measure length mass time electromagnetism thermodynamic temperature luminous intensity and quantity of substance units are metre for length kilogram for mass second for time ampere for electromagnetism kelvin for temperature candela for luminous intensity mole for quantity together they are sufficient for measuring any known quantity without reference to further quantities or phenomena metre ampere candela and mole are all defined in terms of other base units for example speed of light is defined as 299 792 458 metres per second and metre is derived from that constant and definition of a second as a result in dimensional analysis they remain wholly separate concepts derived units with special names there are currently 22 derived units with special names in metric system these are defined in terms of base units or other named derived units eight of these units are electromagnetic quantities volt a unit of electrical potential ohm a unit of electrical resistance tesla a unit of magnetic flux density weber a unit of magnetic flux farad a unit of electrical capacitance henry a unit of electrical inductance siemens a unit of electrical conductance inverse of ohm coulomb a unit of electrical charge four of these units are mechanical quantities watt a unit of mechanical or electrical power newton a unit of mechanical force joule a unit of mechanical electrical or thermodynamic energy pascal a unit of pressure five units represent measures of electromagnetic radiation and radioactivity becquerel a unit of radioactive decay sievert a unit of absorbed ionizing radiation gray a unit of ionizing radiation lux a unit of luminous flux lumen a unit of luminous intensity two units are measures of circular arcs and spherical surfaces a unit of circular arc a unit of spherical surface area three units are miscellaneous degree celsius a unit of thermodynamic temperature katal a unit of catalytic activity enzymatic hertz a unit of cycles per second inverse of second auxiliary and accessory units although si as published by cgpm should in theory meet all requirements of commerce science and technology certain customary units of measure have acquired established positions within world community in order that such units are used consistently around world cgpm catalogued such units in tables 6 to 9 of si brochure these categories are non si units accepted for use with international system of units table 6 this list includes hour and minute angular measures degree minute and second of arc and historic non coherent metric units litre tonne and hectare non si units whose values in si units must be obtained experimentally table 7 this list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy such as dalton electron mass electron volt astronomical unit solar mass and a number of other units of measure that are well established but dependent on experimentally determined physical quantities other non si units table 8 this list catalogues a number of units of measure that have been used internationally in certain well defined spheres including bar for pressure angstrom for atomic physics nautical mile and knot in navigation non si units associated with cgs and cgs gaussian system of units table 9 this table catalogues a number of units of measure based on cgs system and dating from nineteenth century they appear frequently in literature but their continued use is discouraged by cgpm si symbols for metric units are intended to be identical regardless of language used but unit names are ordinary nouns and use character set and follow grammatical rules of language concerned for example si unit symbol for kilometre is km everywhere in world even though local language word for unit name may vary language variants for kilometre unit name include italian german in german all nouns start with an upper case letter dutch french greek portuguese spanish and russian variations are also found with spelling of unit names in countries using same language including differences in american english and british spelling for example meter and liter are used in united states whereas metre and litre are used in other english speaking countries in addition official us spelling for rarely used si prefix for ten is deka in american english term metric ton is normal usage whereas in other varieties of english tonne is common gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in english speaking countries other than united states though this older usage is declining in si unit of power is watt which is defined as joule per second in us customary system of measurement unit of power is horsepower which is defined as 550 foot pounds per second pound in this context being pound force similarly neither us gallon nor imperial gallon is cubic foot or cubic yard us gallon is 231 cubic inches and imperial gallon is 277 42 cubic inches concept of coherence was only introduced into metric system in third quarter of 19th century in its original form metric system was non coherent in particular litre was 0 001 m3 and are from which hectare derives was 100 m2 however units of mass and length were related to each other through physical properties of water gram having been designed as being mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point realization of units pic right thumb metre was originally defined to be one ten millionth of distance between north pole and equator through paris base units used in metric system must be realisable each of definitions of base units in si is accompanied by a defined mise en pratique practical realisation that describes in detail at least one way in which base unit can be measured where possible definitions of base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to realise a standard without reliance on an artefact held by another country in practice such realisation is done under auspices of a mutual acceptance arrangement maa standard metre is defined as exactly 1 299 792 458 of distance that light travels in a second realisation of metre depends in turn on precise realisation of second there are both astronomical observation methods and laboratory measurement methods that are used to realise units of standard metre because speed of light is now exactly defined in terms of metre more precise measurement of speed of light does not result in a more accurate figure for its velocity in standard units but rather a more accurate definition of metre accuracy of measured speed of light is considered to be within 1 m s and realisation of metre is within about 3 parts in 1 000 000 000 or an order of 10 9 parts kilogram was defined by mass of a man made artefact of platinum iridium held in a laboratory in france until new definition was introduced in may 2019 replicas made in 1879 at time of artefact s fabrication and distributed to signatories of metre convention serve as de facto standards of mass in those countries additional replicas have been fabricated since as additional countries have joined convention replicas were subject to periodic validation by comparison to original called ipk it became apparent that either ipk or replicas or both were deteriorating and are no longer comparable they had diverged by 50 mg since fabrication so figuratively accuracy of kilogram was no better than 5 parts in a hundred million or within an order of 10 8 parts accepted redefinition of si base units replaced ipk with an exact definition of planck s constant which defines kilogram in terms of second and metre properties as a system although metric system has changed and developed since its inception its basic concepts have hardly changed designed for transnational use it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement now known as base units derived units were built up from base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal based and identified by a standard set of prefixes units based on natural world like most units of measure units of metric system were based on perceptual quantities of natural world but they also had definitions in terms of stable relationships in that world a metre was defined not by span of a man s arms like a but on a quantitative measure of earth a kilogram was defined by a volume of water whose linear dimensions were fractions of unit of length earth was not easy to measure nor was it uniformly shaped but principle that units of measure were to be based on quantitative relationships among invariant facets of physical world was established units of metric system today still adhere to that principle but relationships used are based on physics of nature rather than its sensory dimensions base and derived unit structure metric system base units were originally adopted because they represented fundamental orthogonal dimensions of measurement corresponding to how we perceive nature a spatial dimension a time dimension one for effect of gravitation and later a more subtle one for dimension of an invisible substance known as electricity or more generally electromagnetism one and only one unit in each of these dimensions was defined unlike older systems where multiple perceptual quantities with same dimension were prevalent like inches feet and yards or ounces pounds and tons units for other quantities like area and volume which are also spatial dimensional quantities were derived from fundamental ones by logical relationships so that a unit of square area for example was unit of length squared many derived units were already in use before and during time metric system evolved because they represented convenient abstractions of whatever base units were defined for system especially in sciences so analogous units were scaled in terms of metric units and their names adopted into system many of these were associated with electromagnetism other perceptual units like volume which were not defined in terms of base units were incorporated into system with definitions in metric base units so that system remained simple it grew in number of units but system retained a uniform structure decimal ratios some customary systems of weights and measures had duodecimal ratios which meant quantities were conveniently divisible by 2 3 4 and 6 but it was difficult to do arithmetic with things like pound or foot there was no system of notation for successive fractions for example of of a foot was not an inch or any other unit but system of counting in decimal ratios did have notation and system had algebraic property of multiplicative closure a fraction of a fraction or a multiple of a fraction was a quantity in system like of which is so a decimal radix became ratio between unit sizes of metric system prefixes for multiples and submultiples in metric system multiples and submultiples of units follow a decimal pattern non si units for time and plane angle measurement inherited from existing systems are an exception to decimal multiplier rule a common set of decimal based prefixes that have effect of multiplication or division by an integer power of ten can be applied to units that are themselves too large or too small for practical use concept of using consistent classical latin or greek names for prefixes was first proposed in a report by french revolutionary commission on weights and measures in may 1793 prefix kilo for example is used to multiply unit by 1000 and prefix milli is to indicate a one thousandth part of unit thus kilogram and kilometre are a thousand grams and metres respectively and a milligram and millimetre are one thousandth of a gram and metre respectively these relations can be written symbolically as in early days multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given greek derived prefixes such as kilo and mega and those that were negative powers of ten were given latin derived prefixes such as and milli however 1935 extensions to prefix system did not follow this convention prefixes nano and micro for example have greek roots during 19th century prefix derived from greek word was used as a multiplier for when applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed square and cube operators are applied to unit of length including prefix as illustrated below 1 mm2 square millimetre 1 mm 2 0 001 m 2 1 km2 square kilometre 1 km 2 1000 m 2 1 mm3 cubic millimetre 1 mm 3 0 001 m 3 1 km3 cubic kilometre 1 km 3 1000 m 3 prefixes are not usually used to indicate multiples of a second greater than 1 non si units of minute hour and day are used instead on other hand prefixes are used for multiples of non si unit of volume litre l l such as millilitres ml coherence thumb upright james clerk maxwell played a major role in developing concept of a coherent cgs system and in extending metric system to include electrical units each variant of metric system has a degree of coherence derived units are directly related to base units without need for intermediate conversion factors for example in a coherent system units of force energy and power are chosen so that equations force mass x acceleration energy force x distance energy power x time hold without introduction of unit conversion factors once a set of coherent units have been defined other relationships in physics that use those units will automatically be true therefore einstein s mass energy equation does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent units cgs system had two units of energy erg that was related to mechanics and calorie that was related to thermal energy so only one of them erg could bear a coherent relationship to base units coherence was a design aim of si which resulted in only one unit of energy being defined joule rationalisation maxwell s equations of electromagnetism contained a factor relating to representative of fact that electric charges and magnetic fields may be considered to emanate from a point and propagate equally in all directions i e spherically this factor appeared awkwardly in many equations of physics dealing with dimensionality of electromagnetism and sometimes other things international system of units international system of units is modern metric system it is based on metre kilogram second ampere mksa system of units from early in 20th century it also includes numerous coherent derived units for common quantities like power watt and lumen electrical units were taken from international system then in use other units like those for energy joule were modelled on those from older cgs system but scaled to be coherent with mksa units two additional base units degree kelvin equivalent to degree celsius for thermodynamic temperature and candela roughly equivalent to international candle unit of illumination were introduced later another base unit mole a unit of mass equivalent to avogadro s number of specified molecules was added along with several other derived units system was promulgated by general conference on weights and measures french conference generale des poids et mesures cgpm in 1960 at that time metre was redefined in terms of wavelength of a spectral line of krypton stable isotope of an inert gas that occurs in undetectable or trace amounts naturally atom and standard metre artefact from 1889 was retired today international system of units consists of 7 base units and innumerable coherent derived units including 22 with special names last new derived unit katal for catalytic activity was added in 1999 some of base units are now realised in terms of invariant constants of physics as a consequence speed of light has now become an exactly defined constant and defines metre as of distance light travels in a second until 2019 kilogram was defined by a man made artefact of deteriorating platinum iridium range of decimal prefixes has been extended to those for 1024 and 10 24 which are unfamiliar because nothing in our everyday lives is that big or that small international system of units has been adopted as official system of weights and measures by all nations in world except for myanmar liberia and united states while united states is only industrialised country where metric system is not predominant system of units there are 192 countries that predominantly use metric system and 3 that do not historical variants a number of variants of metric system evolved all using metre des archives and des archives or their descendants as their base

gram second systems centimetre gram second system of units cgs was first coherent metric system having been developed in 1860s and promoted by maxwell and thomson in 1874 this system was formally promoted by british association for advancement of science system s characteristics are that density is expressed in force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs thermal energy was defined in calories one calorie being energy required to raise temperature of one gram of water from 15 5 degc to 16 5 degc meeting also recognised two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties electrostatic set of units and electromagnetic set of units international system of electrical units cgs units of electricity were cumbersome to work with this was remedied at 1893 international electrical congress held in chicago by defining international ampere and ohm using definitions based on metre kilogram and second mks and mksa systems in 1901 giovanni giorgi showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved metre kilogram second coulomb and metre kilogram second ampere mksa systems are examples of such systems international system of units systeme international d unites or si is current international standard metric system and is also system most widely used around world it is an extension of giorgi s mksa system its base units are metre kilogram second ampere kelvin candela and mole mks metre kilogram second system came into existence in 1889 when artefacts for metre and kilogram were fabricated according to convention of metre early in 20th century an unspecified electrical unit was added and system was called when it became apparent that unit would be ampere system was referred to as mksa system and was direct predecessor of si metre tonne second systems metre tonne second system of units mts was based on metre tonne and second unit of force was sthene and unit of pressure was pieze it was invented in france for industrial use and from 1933 to 1955 was used both in france and in soviet union gravitational systems gravitational metric systems use kilogram force kilopond as a base unit of force with mass measured in a unit known as hyl technische mug or metric slug although cgpm passed a resolution in 1901 defining standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980 665 cm s2 gravitational units are not part of international system of units si conversion calculation and symbol confusion incidents dual usage of or confusion between metric and non metric units and confusion of metric symbols have resulted in a number of serious incidents these include due to serious medication errors having resulted from confusion between mg and mg doses of less than one
