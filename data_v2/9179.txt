party strength and personal popularity to give him an advantage over bradley a decidedly superior orator in only debate between two held at grayson bradley attacked democrats for creating useless offices such as railroad commissioners he defended republican proposal of a high protective tariff and advocated federal aid for education when buckner took platform he began by asking if bradley had charged in an earlier speech that one of buckner s speeches had been written by former governor j proctor knott bradley acknowledged that he had heard that knott had written speech and that he bradley had repeated this claim in one of his speeches buckner rebuked bradley for circulating this infamously false charge and withdrew his agreement to participate in any further joint debates he then delivered a discourse attacking protective tariff and federal aid for education tapp and klotter pp 232 234 true to his word buckner never again met bradley in a joint debate tapp and klotter p 234 rumors began to circulate that buckner was afraid to meet bradley in debate again and bradley did little to dispel these rumors democrats were not completely united throughout campaign with prominent members of party including milton j durham and state senator albert seaton berry criticizing democratic record in state democratic henderson gleaner was also critical opining we should be ashamed of ourselves throughout state bradley hammered issue of blind trust afforded perennial democratic officeholders specifically calling for an examination of treasury though bradley lost election by more than 16 000 votes he made best showing of any republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from state s black voters his concerns about state treasury proved valid when

gubernatorial election of 1895 bradley declared his candidacy early for republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895 and no real challenger emerged prior to republicans nominating convention consequently bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention major issue of campaign was whether country should maintain a monetary system based on gold standard or allow coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 commonly called free silver position wiltz p 118 at their convention republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of gold standard wiltz p 125 thumb left upright alt a man in his forties with black hair and a long mustache wearing a white shirt and black coat facing right parker watkins hardin bradley s opponent in 1895 democrats were divided on monetary issue their eventual nominee parker watkins hardin was known to be a free silver supporter but he pledged to abide by whatever platform convention adopted that platform was ambiguous with regard to gold and silver question it praised president grover cleveland and his treasury secretary native kentuckian john g carlisle both gold supporters and endorsed national democratic platform of 1892 most believed this meant platform favored gold although silverites like ollie m james contended that 1892 platform favored silver consequently most democrats left convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on money question wiltz pp 118 123 124 126 campaign opened in louisville on august 19 1895 in his first address hardin came out squarely for free silver ensuring division of his party for rest of campaign bradley reprised much of his argument from 1887 campaign against buckner he charged mismanagement of state government by democrats citing tate s as evidence he also stressed hardin s association with tate hardin had been state s attorney general when tate absconded and two were known to be friends he denounced free silver and again called for a high protective tariff he blamed democratic president cleveland for national depression wiltz pp 120 127 in third debate held in hopkinsville hardin countered bradley s offensive against him on money issue by charging that election of a republican would lead to negro domination of state this put bradley in a dilemma if he refused to acknowledge blacks influence on party he would lose their votes if he acknowledged it he would lose many white voters bradley attempted to ignore racial question in hopkinsville and during next two debates instead intensifying his criticism of hardin on money question and his association with tate in sixth joint debate held august 30 at eminence some members of audience began to heckle bradley who was hoarse from previous debates after attempting to restart his opening statement four times bradley left platform and next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates as a result of incident many believed bradley was looking for a reason to end debates in order to dodge racial question and incident at eminence gave him opportunity some black republicans resented bradley s attempt to dodge racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support bradley but vote for populist thomas s pettit instead wiltz pp 128 131 in general election bradley carried vote of many gold democrats he also drew a number of votes from those who sympathized with views of american protective association an anti immigrant anti catholic organization some estimates placed organization s membership at 14 000 in louisville alone it also had strength in urban centers of paducah lexington ashland covington and frankfort wiltz p 129 democrats were also hurt by economic factors including national economic problems and a severe drought in state klotter in kentucky s governors p 129 bradley was elected first republican governor of kentucky defeating hardin by a vote of 172 436 to 163 524 pettit populist candidate drew 16 911 votes most of them from democrats in western kentucky turnout in election was 85 wiltz p 132 more votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties nine of which went for bradley and nine for hardin governor of kentucky bradley was inaugurated december 10 1895 wiltz p 134 during his term republicans controlled kentucky house of representatives while democrats controlled kentucky senate this led to infighting between two houses of general assembly and between general assembly and governor on joint votes such as election of u s senators parties were even with sixty eight members each two populists were also members of assembly one who supported democrats and another who supported republicans legislative session of 1896 in first legislative session of bradley s term 75 bills were filed including a ban on manufacture and sale of cigarettes a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced one would have lifted most of restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether bradley added an anti lynching law to legislative agenda however none of these bills were acted on vast majority of assembly s attention during session was focused on election of a u s senator reis p 4k thumb left upright alt a man in his forties with black hair and a bushy black mustache he is standing facing right and holding a can in his right hand a hat in his left and wearing a long black coat election of a successor to senator j c s blackburn dominated first legislative session of bradley s term many democrats were anxious to return senator j c s blackburn to his seat in congress but some were instead supporting ex governor john y brown democratic state senator albert berry was also making overtures about being considered for seat republican legislators nominated w godfrey hunter for seat and ultimately blackburn and hunter emerged as leading candidates gold democrats refused to back blackburn a free silver supporter instead opting for ex governor james b mccreary tapp and klotter p 356 on ballot after ballot no candidate received a majority though blackburn received 65 votes once leaving him just two votes shy of election treasury secretary john g carlisle was put forward as a compromise candidate but never received more than 61 votes other proposed compromise candidates included louisville courier journal editor henry watterson congressman walter evans ex governor buckner judge william h holt and augustus e willson tapp and klotter p 357 free silver democrats challenged hunter s naturalization it was finally concluded that hunter an englishman was naturalized under provisions of a federal law that allowed him to omit standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in u s army over course of contest hunter was also indicted for bribery but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence voting proceeded over several days and demonstrators in chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates a kentucky post account from march 7 1896 recorded that good humored legislators began pelting each other with paper during day s deliberations this attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of governor s message to legislature were flying through air by march 11 tensions had reached point that armed democratic supporters were standing outside state house in an attempt to intimidate republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering attempts were made to unseat several legislators in general assembly leading to threats of violence observers were banned from gallery and everyone entering state house was searched for weapons bradley called militia to frankfort to maintain order and considered adjourning session to an opera house in louisville where more security could be provided some leading democrats in louisville lauded bradley for preserving order but democratic lawmakers in senate sought passage of resolutions to convict bradley of interference with election fine him 500 and sentence him to six months in jail tapp and klotter p 359 these same legislators also threatened to imprison lieutenant governor william jackson worthington allowing democratic president pro tem of senate william goebel to become acting governor a committee was appointed to investigate bradley but resolutions to convict and imprison him were not passed on march 16 governor bradley declared martial law in capital session adjourned later that day without having elected a senator among session s few accomplishments were bills creating two reform houses in state and providing for free turnpikes and gravel roads tapp and klotter p 360 a bill forbidding employment of children of school age who had not attended at least twelve weeks of school during year passed over bradley s veto in an effort to embarrass governor senate refused to pass a revenue bill leaving governor with no money to run state following session a northern kentucky newspaper opined it is hard to conceive how a legislature would go about accomplishing less than this present one has bradley called a special session in march 1897 to resume balloting for senator he appointed andrew t wood to fill vacancy in case legislators did not elect a senator in time for congressional session to begin tapp and klotter p 364 republicans continued supporting hunter free silver democrats still backed blackburn and gold democrats nominated businessman henry l martin of woodford county when continued deadlock between hunter and blackburn ensued hunter withdrew his name from consideration tapp and klotter p 365 republicans nominated st john boyle but gridlock continued unabated after several ballots boyle also withdrew and republicans put forth lawyer and state senator william joseph deboe in his place deboe was elected on 112th ballot becoming first republican senator from commonwealth advocacy for blacks bradley did much to advance cause of blacks in kentucky he denounced racially motivated lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence he called a special legislative session in march 1897 to consider an anti lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to 500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence lucas and wright p 81 it further empowered peace officers to recruit able bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so if necessary despite politically divided legislature bill quickly passed both houses of general assembly and bradley signed it on may 11 1897 lucas and wright p 82 in january 1898 bradley accepted an invitation to speak before anti mob and lynch law association in springfield ohio during bradley s four year term twenty five lynchings were committed in state down from fifty six during term of his predecessor wright p 179 one high profile case that illustrated bradley s opposition to racial violence was that of ex slave george dinning after being emancipated dining saved enough money to purchase a farm in simpson county on january 27 1897 a mob of 25 armed white men came to dinning s farm accused him of stealing hogs and chickens and demanded he leave county within 10 days dining denied being a thief and insisted several people in county would vouch for his good character mob enraged by dinning s resistance began firing on his house and wounded him twice dining retrieved a gun from his house and fired into mob killing one man mob fled and next day dining turned himself in to local officials while he was in their custody mob returned to his farm drove his family from their house looted it and razed it to ground wright pp 14 15 simpson county sheriff moved dining to bowling green and eventually to louisville to prevent him from being lynched governor bradley dispatched a squad of state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded despite fact that case involved a black man killing a white man most observers believed dining would be acquitted on grounds of self defense jury however convicted dining of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor immediately bradley s office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on dinning s behalf requests came from blacks and whites some of them ex confederates dinning s attorney augustus e willson formally requested a pardon and bradley issued it 10 days after conviction bradley opined that dining had acted reasonably under circumstances and that it was a shame that no members of mob were charged after being freed dining relocated to indiana and hired ex confederate bennett h young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of mob that had identified themselves during his trial trial was held in louisville and dining was awarded 50 000 in damages wright pp 15 17 in his address to state legislature in january 1898 bradley advocated repeal of state s separate coach law which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks lucas and wright p 91 he appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond janitorial jobs they usually received lucas and wright p 90 he named edward e underwood as first black person on board of trustees for kentucky state college later university of kentucky lucas and wright p 67 because of his devotion to black advancement bradley was only white person included in william decker johnson s 1897 compilation biographical sketches of prominent negro men and women of kentucky klotter in kentucky portrait in paradox p 214 other matters of bradley s term election of republican president william mckinley in 1896 deepened democrats resolve to oppose republican governor and his allies moreover when legislature convened in 1898 democratic majority in both houses was overwhelming tapp and klotter p 366 bradley s message to general assembly in 1898 called for numerous reforms including spending cuts to reduce government waste putting state s charitable institutions under control of a non partisan board and reforms to public education and legal system tapp and klotter pp 368 370 legislature largely ignored governor s message in favor of partisan concerns tapp and klotter p 370 a pure food and drug law was enacted without his signature his veto of controversial legislation regulating railroad rates however was sustained kentucky governor william o bradley national governors association both houses passed a resolution calling for resignation of senator william lindsay a gold democrat who did not support william jennings bryan s presidential bid on grounds that he no longer represented interests of his party lindsay responded that he represented people of kentucky and refused to resign his seat thumb left governor s mansion was damaged by a fire during bradley s term another of bradley s concerns in his message to legislature was condition of governor s mansion in his address he declared as to executive mansion for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in winter present site is disagreeable view from one side overlooks walls of penitentiary and from other smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby clark and lane p 65 instead of addressing bradley s concerns general assembly passed a ripper bill taking control of mansion from governor and putting it under supervision of court of appeals on february 10 1899 mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in governor s bedroom day was so cold that fireman had difficulty keeping water in their hoses unfrozen and mansion suffered extensive damage though mansion was insured and a reporter for courier journal opined that sensible thing to do would be to demolish old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in frankfort to serve as governor s mansion legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a republican governor consequently mansion was once again repaired bradleys stayed with a neighbor in frankfort immediately after fire thereafter governor bradley stayed in frankfort s capitol hotel while mrs bradley and daughter christine returned to family s home in lancaster family re occupied residence prior to end of bradley s term clark and lane pp 65 66 bradley struggled to end violent feuds that continued in eastern part of state during his term so called tollgate wars were ongoing in many rural areas that could not afford to build good roads private companies had built roads and attempted to recover costs and turn a profit by charging tolls poor residents of areas however maintained that tolls were excessive especially in light of national depression they began to call for free roads but their calls went unheeded by state and national governments many then resorted to violence burning toll houses and threatening and attacking toll collectors bradley called for harsh action against this lawlessness but democratic general assembly sympathetic to plight of poor residents of state refused to act by end of bradley s term most of violence had ended as companies sold their stock to local groups or simply abandoned their roads due to violence harrison in a new history of kentucky pp 268 269 kentucky s four infantry regiments and two cavalry units that served in spanish american war were beset by poor sanitation and disease in army camps where they were stationed units saw little action in war but 84 men died as a result of poor conditions when time came for troops to return home bradley found that state had no money to pay for hospital trains needed for their trip bradley personally borrowed money from a bank to secure their passage and trusted that general assembly would reimburse him harrison in a new history of kentucky p 269 goebel election law gubernatorial election of 1899 on february 1 1898 senate president pro tem william goebel sponsored a measure later referred to as goebel election law kleber goebel election law p 378 bill created a board of election commissioners appointed by general assembly who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of kentucky s counties board was empowered to examine election returns and rule on results power to decide outcome of disputed elections remained with general assembly pursuant to section 153 of state constitution kentucky constitution section 153 because general assembly was heavily democratic and goebel was considered a likely democratic aspirant for governorship in 1899 election bill was attacked as blatantly partisan and self serving even by some democrats harrison in a new history of kentucky p 270 nevertheless goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override bradley s veto making bill law a proposal was made to call a special session to repeal law and bradley was in favor of action but a poll of legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify call republicans organized a test case against law but kentucky court of appeals found it constitutional as leader of party goebel essentially hand picked members

vote plurality for william jennings bryan in 1896 presidential election as a sure sign that state would vote democratic in 1899 others were not interested in being on defensive against inevitable democratic attacks on bradley s administration still others were intimidated by prospect of being defeated by machinery of goebel election law hughes schaefer and williams p 50 sitting attorney general william s taylor was first to announce his candidacy and soon secured support of senator deboe tapp and klotter p 425 later candidates included hopkins county judge clifton j pratt and sitting

win nomination republican nominating convention convened on july 12 in lexington hughes schaefer and williams p 52 angry that his party had not more seriously considered his candidate bradley did not attend black leaders in party threatened to follow bradley and organize their own nominating convention as they believed taylor represented lily white branch of party taylor attempted to hold party together by making one of black leaders permanent secretary of convention and promising to appoint other black leaders to his cabinet if elected he also tried to bring bradley back to convention by promising to nominate bradley s nephew edwin p morrow for secretary of state bradley refused offer in face of taylor s superior organization all other candidates withdrew in a show of party unity allowing taylor to be nominated unanimously hughes schaefer and williams p 53 bradley had initially been cool toward taylor but he agreed to tour state with republican leader augustus e willson after goebel eventual democratic nominee made a similar tour with william jennings bryan who was wildly popular in state although he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from democratic attacks henry watterson suggested that bradley was seeking to enlist taylor s support for his anticipated senatorial bid bradley began his tour of state in louisville charging that democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of state s best men had deserted him he also encouraged blacks not to desert republican party he contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with democrats support of separate coach bill throughout his speech bradley defended his administration and never once mentioned taylor finally he closed with line and go to polls and elect taylor tapp and klotter p 439 as bradley exited stage willson whispered to him bradley that s slickest thing you ever did in your life as they continued to tour state bradley and willson often drew crowds

after bradley left office goebel and his running mate j c w beckham challenged results of 1899 election in general assembly per state constitution hughes schaefer and williams p 167 all candidates for state s minor offices contested as well bradley and his colleague augustus willson formed part of legal team that represented republicans before general assembly and in court where they challenged legality of goebel election law and later actions of general assembly s contest committee hughes schaefer and williams p 277 republicans around state expected general assembly s contest committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make goebel governor armed men from eastern kentucky filled capital awaiting contest committee s findings on morning of january 30 as goebel and two friends walked toward capitol building a shot rang out and goebel fell wounded he was taken to a nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds as expected contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make goebel governor and general assembly voted to certify recommendation goebel was sworn in as governor but he died on february 3 beckham then took oath of office and continued legal challenge against taylor and his lieutenant governor john marshall harrison in a new history of kentucky pp 271 272 in federal court bradley argued on behalf of republican minor officers that goebel election law deprived citizens of their right to vote right to vote he claimed was inherent in fourteenth amendment s guarantee of liberty and could not be taken from any citizen without due process hughes schaefer and williams pp 277 278 federal judge william howard taft ruled that republicans would have to seek remedy in state courts hughes schaefer and williams p 282 after a protracted legal battle all of minor officers were unseated except attorney general clifton j pratt tapp p 505 cases of taylor and marshall were appealed to kentucky court of appeals then to supreme court of united states in case of taylor v beckham bradley countered democrats claims that federal courts should not have jurisdiction by citing thayer v boyd a similar case in which court had assumed jurisdiction he further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property using this to contend that taylor s rights under fourteenth amendment had been violated thus giving court jurisdiction also bradley asserted election of some members of general assembly s contest committee would hinge on decision of that very committee at least one member of committee was known to have wagered on election s outcome these facts should have nullified decision of committee and assembly on grounds that it had left some members as judges of their own cases bradley argued finally bradley cited irregularities in proceedings of contest committee including giving insufficient time for review of testimony provided in written form by taylor and marshall s legal representation court refused to intervene in case however because it found that there were no federal questions involved lone justice dissenting from that opinion was kentuckian john marshall harlan hughes schaefer and williams pp 327 328 later life

withdrew from contest bradley was angered as belknap was nominated on first ballot and subsequently lost to j c w beckham who was allowed to seek a second term because a court ruled he had not been
