aries is one of constellations of zodiac it is located in northern celestial hemisphere between pisces to west and taurus to east name aries is latin for ram and its symbol is 20px unicode representing a ram s horns it is one of 48 constellations described by 2nd century astronomer ptolemy and remains one of 88 modern constellations it is a mid sized constellation ranking 39th overall size with an area of 441 square degrees 1 1 of celestial sphere although aries came to represent specifically ram whose fleece became golden fleece of ancient greek mythology it has represented a ram since late babylonian times before that stars of aries formed a farmhand different cultures have incorporated stars of aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in china and a porpoise in marshall islands aries is a relatively dim constellation possessing only four bright stars hamal alpha arietis second magnitude sheratan beta arietis third magnitude mesarthim gamma arietis fourth magnitude and 41 arietis also fourth magnitude few deep sky objects within constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies several meteor showers appear to radiate from aries including daytime arietids and epsilon arietids history and mythology aries is recognized as an official constellation now albeit as a specific region of sky by international astronomical union it was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars and has remained a constellation since ancient times it now includes ancient pattern as well as surrounding stars in description of babylonian zodiac given in clay tablets known as mul apin constellation now known as aries was final station along ecliptic mul apin was a comprehensive table of risings and settings of stars which likely served as an agricultural calendar modern day aries was known as agrarian worker or hired man although likely compiled in 12th or 11th century bc mul apin reflects a tradition which marks pleiades as vernal equinox which was case with some precision at beginning of middle bronze age earliest identifiable reference to aries as a distinct constellation comes from boundary stones that date from 1350 to 1000 bc on several boundary stones a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from other characters present shift in identification from constellation as agrarian worker to ram likely occurred in later babylonian tradition because of its growing association with dumuzi shepherd by time mul apin was created by 1000 bc modern aries was identified with both dumuzi s ram and a hired laborer exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to lack of images of aries or other ram figures in ancient egyptian astronomy aries was associated with god amon ra who was depicted as a man with a ram s head and represented fertility and creativity this is one of reasons why sign is associated with bull because it was location of vernal equinox it was called indicator of reborn sun during times of year when aries was prominent priests would process statues of amon ra to temples a practice that was modified by persian astronomers centuries later aries acquired title of lord of head in egypt referring to its symbolic and mythological importance thumb left 300px aries and musca borealis as depicted in urania s mirror a set of constellation cards published in london c 1825 thumb aries depicted in an early medieval manuscript c 1000 aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times in hellenistic astrology constellation of aries is associated with golden ram of greek mythology that rescued phrixus and helle on orders from hermes taking phrixus to land of colchis phrixos and helle were son and daughter of king athamas and his first wife nephele king s second wife ino was jealous and wished to kill his children to accomplish this she induced a famine in boeotia then falsified a message from oracle of delphi that said phrixos must be sacrificed to end famine athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop mount when aries sent by nephele arrived helle fell off of aries s back in flight and drowned in dardanelles also called hellespont in her honor after arriving phrixus sacrificed ram to zeus and gave fleece to aeetes of colchis who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter aeetes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as golden fleece and was guarded by a dragon in a later myth this golden fleece was stolen by jason and argonauts historically aries has been depicted as a crouched wingless ram with its head turned towards taurus ptolemy asserted in his almagest that hipparchus depicted alpha arietis as ram s muzzle though ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure instead it was listed as an unformed star and denoted as star over head john flamsteed in his atlas coelestis followed ptolemy s description by mapping it above figure s head flamsteed followed general convention of maps by depicting aries lying down astrologically aries has been associated with head and its humors it was strongly associated with mars both planet and god it was considered to govern western europe and syria and to indicate a strong temper in a person first point of aries location of vernal equinox is named for constellation this is because sun crossed celestial equator from south to north in aries more than two millennia ago hipparchus defined it in 130 bc as a point south of gamma arietis because of precession of equinoxes first point of aries has since moved into pisces and will move into aquarius by around 2600 ad sun now appears in aries from late april through mid may though constellation is still associated with beginning of spring medieval muslim astronomers depicted aries in various ways astronomers like al sufi saw constellation as a ram modeled on precedent of ptolemy however some islamic celestial globes depicted aries as a nondescript four legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns some early bedouin observers saw a ram elsewhere in sky this constellation featured pleiades as ram s tail generally accepted arabic formation of aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five unformed stars four of which were over animal s hindquarters and one of which was disputed star over aries s head al sufi s depiction differed from both other arab astronomers and flamsteed s in that his aries was running and looking behind itself obsolete constellations introduced in aries musca borealis lilium vespa and apes have all been composed of northern stars musca borealis was created from stars 33 arietis 35 arietis 39 arietis and 41 arietis in 1612 petrus plancius introduced apes a constellation representing a bee in 1624 same stars were used by jakob bartsch to create a constellation called vespa representing a wasp in 1679 augustin royer used these stars for his constellation lilium representing fleur de lis none of these constellation became widely accepted johann hevelius renamed constellation musca in 1690 in his to differentiate it from musca southern fly it was later renamed musca borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into aries in 1922 international astronomical union defined its recommended three letter abbreviation ari official boundaries of aries were defined in 1930 by eugene delporte as a polygon of 12 segments its right ascension is between 1h 46 4m and 3h 29 4m and its declination is between 10 36deg and 31 in equatorial coordinate system in non western astronomy in traditional chinese astronomy stars from aries were used in several constellations brightest stars alpha beta and gamma arietis formed a constellation called lou lou variously translated as bond lasso and sickle which was associated with ritual sacrifice of cattle this name was shared by 16th lunar mansion location of full moon closest to autumnal equinox lunar mansion represented area where animals were gathered before sacrifice around that time this constellation has also been associated with harvest time as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head 35 39 and 41 arietis were part of a constellation called wei wei which represented a fat abdomen and was namesake of 17th lunar mansion which represented granaries delta and zeta arietis were a part of constellation tian yin thought to represent emperor s hunting partner zuo geng a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector was composed of mu nu omicron pi and sigma arietis he was accompanied by kang a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution in a similar system to chinese first lunar mansion in hindu astronomy was called after traditional names for beta and gamma arietis because hindu new year began with vernal equinox rig veda contains over 50 new year s related hymns to twins making them some of most prominent characters in work aries itself was known as aja and mesha in hebrew astronomy aries was named teli it signified either simeon or gad and generally symbolizes lamb of world neighboring syrians named constellation and bordering turks named it half a world away in marshall islands several stars from aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a porpoise along with stars from cassiopeia andromeda and triangulum alpha beta and gamma arietis formed head of porpoise while stars from andromeda formed body and bright stars of cassiopeia formed tail other polynesian peoples recognized aries as a constellation marquesas islanders called it na pai ka maori constellation may correspond to modern aries as well in indigenous peruvian astronomy a constellation with most of same stars as aries existed it was called market moon and kneeling terrace as a reminder for when to hold annual harvest festival huay features thumb left 256px constellation aries as it can be seen with naked eye stars aries has three prominent stars forming an asterism designated alpha beta and gamma arietis by johann bayer alpha hamal and beta sheratan are commonly used for navigation there is also one other star above fourth magnitude 41 arietis bharani a arietis called hamal is brightest star in aries its traditional name is derived from arabic word for lamb or head of ram ras al hamal which references aries s mythological background with a spectral class of k2 and a luminosity class of iii it is an orange giant with an apparent visual magnitude of 2 00 which lies 66 light years from earth hamal has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is 0 1 b arietis also known as sheratan is a blue white star with an apparent visual magnitude of 2 64 its traditional name is derived from arabic word for two signs referring to both beta and gamma arietis in their position as heralds of vernal equinox two stars were known to bedouin as qarna al hamal horns of ram it is 59 light years from earth it has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is 2 1 it is a spectroscopic binary star one in which companion star is only known through analysis of spectra spectral class of primary is a5 hermann carl vogel determined that sheratan was a spectroscopic binary in 1903 its orbit was determined by hans ludendorff in 1907 it has since been studied for its eccentric orbit g arietis with a common name of mesarthim is a binary star with two white hued components located in a rich field of magnitude 8 12 stars its traditional name has conflicting derivations it may be derived from a corruption of al arabic word meaning pair or a word for fat ram however it may also come from sanskrit for first star of aries or hebrew for ministerial servants both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names along with beta arietis it was known to bedouin as qarna al hamal primary is of magnitude 4 59 and secondary is of magnitude 4 68 system is 164 light years from earth two components are separated by 7 8 arcseconds and system as a whole has an apparent magnitude of 3 9 primary has a luminosity of and secondary has a luminosity of primary is an a type star with an absolute magnitude of 0 2 and secondary is a b9 type star with an absolute magnitude of 0 4 angle between two components is 1deg mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by robert hooke in 1664 one of earliest such telescopic discoveries primary g1 arietis is an alpha2 canum venaticorum variable star that has a range of 0 02 magnitudes and a period of 2 607 days it is unusual because of its strong silicon emission lines constellation is home to several double stars including epsilon lambda and pi arietis e arietis is a binary star with two white components primary is of magnitude 5 2 and secondary is

magnitude is 0 2 53 arietis is a runaway star of magnitude 6 09 815 light years away its spectral class is b2 it was likely ejected from orion nebula approximately five million years ago possibly due to supernovae finally teegarden s star is closest star to earth in aries it is a brown dwarf of magnitude 15 14 and spectral class m6 5v with a proper motion of 5 1 arcseconds per year it is 24th closest star to earth overall aries has its share of variable stars including r and u arietis mira type variable stars and t arietis a semi regular variable star r arietis is a mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13 7 to a maximum of 7 4 with a period of 186 8 days it is 4 080 light years away u arietis is another mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 15 2 to a maximum of 7 2 with a period of 371 1 days t arietis is a semiregular variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 11 3 to a maximum of 7 5 with a period of 317 days it is 1 630 light years away one particularly interesting variable in aries is sx arietis a rotating variable star considered to be prototype of its class helium variable stars sx arietis stars have very prominent emission lines of helium i and silicon iii they are normally main sequence stars and their variations are not usually visible to naked eye therefore they are observed usually having periods that fit in course of one night similar to alpha2 canum venaticorum variables sx arietis stars have periodic changes in their light and magnetic field which correspond to periodic rotation they differ from alpha2 canum venaticorum variables in their higher temperature there are between 39 and 49 sx arietis variable stars currently known ten are noted as being uncertain in general catalog of variable stars deep sky objects thumb right ngc 772 with a notated supernova ngc 772 is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 10 3 located southeast of b arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 arietis it is a relatively bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope it is 7 2 by 4 2 arcminutes meaning that its surface brightness magnitude 13 6 is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude ngc 772 is a class sa s b galaxy which means that it is an unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly main arm on northwest side of galaxy is home to many star forming regions this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies ngc 772 has a small companion galaxy ngc 770 that is about 113 000 light years away from larger galaxy two galaxies together are also classified as arp 78 in arp peculiar galaxy catalog ngc 772 has a diameter of 240 000 light years and system is 114 million light years from earth another spiral galaxy in aries is ngc 673 a face on class sab s c galaxy it is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms it has no ring and a faint bulge and is 2 5 by 1 9 arcminutes it has two primary arms with fragments located farther from core 171 000 light years in diameter ngc 673 is 235 million light years from earth ngc 678 and ngc 680 are a pair of galaxies in aries that are only about 200 000 light years apart part of ngc 691 group of galaxies both are at a distance of approximately 130 million light years ngc 678 is an edge on spiral galaxy that is 4 5 by 0 8 arcminutes ngc 680 an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary is brighter of two at magnitude 12 9 ngc 678 has a magnitude of 13 35 both galaxies have bright cores but ngc 678 is larger galaxy at a diameter of 171 000 light years ngc 680 has a diameter of 72 000 light years ngc 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane ngc 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight it has multiple spiral arms and a bright core because it is so diffuse it has a low surface brightness it has a diameter of 126 000 light years and is 124 million light years away ngc 877 is brightest member of an 8 galaxy group that also includes ngc 870 ngc 871 and ngc 876 with a magnitude of 12 53 it is 2 4 by 1 8 arcminutes and is 178 million light years away with a diameter of 124 000 light years its companion is ngc 876 which is about 103 000 light years from core of ngc 877 they are interacting gravitationally as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in aries consisting of ngc 935 and ic 1801 ngc 821 is an e6 elliptical galaxy it is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies ngc 821 is 2 6 by 2 0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11 3 its diameter is 61 000 light years and it is 80 million light years away another unusual galaxy in aries is segue 2 segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of milky way recently discovered to be a potential relic of epoch of meteor showers aries is home to several meteor showers daytime meteor shower is one of strongest meteor showers that occurs during day lasting from 22 may to 2 july it is an annual shower associated with marsden group of comets that peaks on 7 june with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 54 meteors its parent body may be asteroid icarus meteors are sometimes visible before dawn because radiant is 32 degrees away from sun they usually appear at a rate of 1 2 per hour as meteors that last several seconds and often begin at horizon because most of daytime arietids are not visible to naked eye they are observed in radio spectrum this is possible because of ionized gas they leave in their wake other meteor showers radiate from aries during day these include daytime epsilon arietids and northern and southern daytime may arietids jodrell bank observatory discovered daytime arietids in 1947 when james hey and g s stewart adapted world war ii era radar systems for meteor observations delta arietids are another meteor shower radiating from aries peaking on 9 december with a low peak rate shower lasts from 8 december to 14 january with highest rates visible from 8 to 14 december average delta meteor is very slow with an average velocity of per second however this shower sometimes produces bright fireballs this meteor shower has northern and southern components both of which are likely associated with 1990 ha a near earth asteroid autumn arietids also radiate from aries shower lasts from 7 september to 27 october and peaks on 9 october its peak rate is low epsilon arietids appear from 12 to 23 october other meteor showers radiating from aries include october delta arietids daytime epsilon arietids daytime may arietids sigma arietids nu arietids and beta arietids sigma arietids a class iv meteor shower are visible from 12 to 19 october with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on 19 october planetary systems aries contains several stars with extrasolar planets hip 14810 a g5 type star is orbited by three giant planets those more than ten times mass of earth hd like hip 14810 is a g type main sequence star slightly larger than sun with two orbiting planets one planet is 2 3 times mass of jupiter and other is 1 57 times mass of jupiter hd is a g0 type star approximately size of sun with one orbiting planet planet discovered in 2002 has a mass 1 07 times that of jupiter and orbits every 500 days in 2019 scientists conducting survey at alto observatory announced evidence of
