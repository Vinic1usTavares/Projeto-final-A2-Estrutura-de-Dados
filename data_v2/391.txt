that sorensen had quit role of declan and decision to recast was taken with mullally making his first on screen appearance on 3 may 2010 in october 2010 it was announced character was to leave neighbours and he made his final appearance on 15 march 2011 character was originally portrayed as a teenage tearaway but later settled down he has been involved with some of series most controversial storylines including teenage pregnancy which caused an upset among conservative family groups coping with his wife s death and a relationship with fellow character kate ramsay which was initially received as distasteful and unbelievable with australian viewers declan has also been popularised whilst sorensen played him for his good looks and physical appearance subsequently being branded as one of show s most popular characters character creation and casting in 2007 neighbours suffered a significant decline in ratings and plans were made to take series into a back to basics approach where storylines would become less controversial and return to focus on relationships and family dynamics it was at this point that character of declan was created and actress jane hall would play his on screen mother rebecca napier characters were to create a family unit for then already existing character oliver barnes david james sorensen was cast as declan in 2007 and his character appeared same year after he had played character for nearly three years sorensen decided to quit series to pursue a career outside of acting instead of character departing series five confirmed that a decision had been made to recast role erin mullally was cast in role and began filming immediately after sorensen s departure from production in a statement from press office at five they stated as character of declan is extremely popular and with some sensational storylines planned it was decided that character would be recast sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue as a part of series saying i m really happy character s going to continue because producers and writers have given declan some fantastic storylines i m really proud he s become as popular as he has at time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout history of programme creator of neighbours reg watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in show saying i always believed it was a pity when actors chose to leave a serial that character should go as well a lot of time and money is invested in character so we decided to recast if character was important to future of storyline and show itself it was this explanation that backed up declan s recast sorensen also explained that hand over process would be simple adding it ll be nothing over top i m declan one day and next day it s erin pretty simple that s how it works i can t continue so erin comes in and picks up baton i think it s easier for viewers to accept when it s a simple change over recast had also upset fans of character under portrayal of sorensen in response to this he said erin will come in and play his version of declan he can t play it exactly as i do and i and producers would never expect him to do it any other way all i can say to declan supporters is that erin will be terrific give him a go you ll be surprised sorensen also felt that it would be strange to see declan played by mullally saying of course it will be strange to see someone playing part that i started and basically created it s been my life it s not just being declan at studio i get declan on street at restaurants everywhere declan is me so to hand it over is difficult he also felt humble that viewers thought character would not be same played by another actor adding i m very humbled that a lot of people think that i can understand why fans would feel that way because i starred as declan for past three years and that s all anyone knows mullally later stated he did not know he was auditioning for a recast he also stated that he wasn t sure if he could be successful in role to start with he also watched hours of footage of previous episodes to get an idea of how to portray declan then making a statement to declan fans reading i m sure that initially people will be quite confronted by a new face with same character name i m not fooling myself about that but hopefully people will come to accept it mullally has compared two versions of declan saying one of writers said to me in a meeting other day that changeover between james and me can be best described as james playing declan as very strong macho he liked to get into things and was very proactive new declan is more grown up quite mature and savvy he thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn t have to use brute force to get it during rebecca s vision thomas smith portrayed a six year old declan in october 2010 it was announced that mullally was to leave neighbours along with three other members of cast matthew werkmeister zeke kinski jane hall rebecca robinson and alia and gabriella de vercelli india napier on his decision to leave mullally said i ve had an absolute ball playing declan guy has been through so much he needs a rest i ve made so many new friends but it will be my daughters alia and gabriella de vercelli i ll really miss it has been wonderful to watch them grow and develop and be a part of their lives character development characterisation declan s personality has evolved through his given storylines he was once a teenage tearaway but over time had to face harsh realities

and he accepted his responsibilities teenage pregnancy a high profile storyline for character was when he got his girlfriend bridget pregnant storyline progressed and saw couple decide to have child this caused controversy and an outcry from conservative family groups in australia who accused programme of using characters to normalise teenage pregnancy speaking on behalf of groups pro family perspectives director angela conway said teenage pregnancy is not something that should be considered norm programmes like neighbours can make behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable a lot of kids just aren t ready to get their head around details of explicit sexuality neighbours executive producer susan bower was quick to defend her character s storyline stating i am quite sure a lot of people are not happy with this storyline we decided we would show ramifications on teenagers lives mignon added that storyline between declan and bridget was not shallow trite vulgar further adding she wouldn t have liked to film storyline if it was and branded it as showing emotional spectrum of pregnancy justice critics slammed show noting that neighbours is a g rated

to move on without showing proper respect to love of his life he s left confused and upset as scenes from storyline began to air brewer made comment on storyline reassuring viewers adding i think they ll be okay with it i think they ll be accepting it s done very tastefully and very slowly two characters don t rush anything declan was then portrayed as having even more trouble battling his feelings for kate but tried hard not to forget bridget of this sorensen explained i m glad that some months down track all wasn t forgotten it s such a sad situation declan really does like kate and she feels same way about him but his heart won t let him move on after couple began dating it attracted a bigger mixed response from viewers many felt it was still too soon after bridget sorensen then spoke out
