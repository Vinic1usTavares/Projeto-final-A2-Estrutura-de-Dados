zhuangzi mandarin historically romanized chuang tzu is an ancient chinese text from late warring states period which contains stories and anecdotes that exemplify carefree nature of ideal daoist sage named for its traditional author master zhuang zhuangzi zhuangzi with tao te of two foundational texts of taoism and is generally considered most important of all daoist writings zhuangzi consists of a large collection of anecdotes allegories parables and fables which are often humorous or irreverent in nature its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from human world and its conventions fables and anecdotes in text attempt to illustrate falseness of human distinctions between good and bad large and small life and death and human and nature while other ancient chinese philosophers focused on moral and personal duty zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with way dao by following nature though primarily known as a philosophical work zhuangzi is regarded as one of greatest literary works in all of chinese history and has been called most important pre qin text for study of chinese literature a masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from han dynasty 206ad220 to present many major chinese writers and poets in history such as sima xiangru and sima qian during han dynasty ruan ji and tao yuanming during six dynasties li bai during tang dynasty 618907 and su shi and lu you in song dynasty 9601279 were heavily influenced by zhuangzi history authorship and textual history zhuangzi is named for and attributed to zhuang known as zhuangzi from mandarin chinese zhuangzi meaning master zhuang a man generally said to have been born around 369 at a place called meng in state of song around present day shangqiu henan province and to have died around 301 295 or 286 almost nothing is concretely known of zhuangzi s life he is thought to have spent time in southern state of chu as well as in capital of state of qi sima qian s records of grand historian shiji first of china s 24 dynastic histories has a biography of zhuangzi but most of it seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in zhuangzi itself in introduction to his zhuangzi translation american scholar burton watson concluded his comments about paucity of historical information on zhuangzi by saying whoever zhuang zhou was writings attributed to him bear stamp of a brilliant and original mind scholars have recognized since at least song dynasty 9601279 that some parts of book could not have been written by zhuangzi himself since ancient times however its first seven chaptersthe nei pian inner chapters have been considered to be actual work of zhuangzi and most modern scholars agree with this view how many if any of remaining 26 chaptersthe wai pian wai pian outer chapters and za pian miscellaneous chapters were written by zhuangzi has long been debated it is generally accepted that middle and later zhuangzi chapters are result of a subsequent process of accretion and redaction by later authors responding to scintillating brilliance of inner chapters regardless of its authorship all of zhuangzi 33 surviving chapters are accepted as compositions from 4th to 2nd centuries bc details of zhuangzis textual history prior to han dynasty 206ad220 are largely unknown traces of its influence in late warring states period philosophical texts such as guanzi han feizi huainanzi and lushi chunqiu suggest that zhuangzi s intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in states of qi and chu in 3rd century records of grand historian refers to a 100 000 word zhuangzi work and references several chapters that are still in text book of han han shu finished in ad 111 lists a zhuangzi in 52 chapters which many scholars believe to be original form of work a number of different forms of zhuangzi survived into tang dynasty 618907 but a shorter and more popular 33 chapter form of book prepared by philosopher and writer guo xiang around ad 300 is source of all surviving editions in 742 zhuangzi was canonized as one of chinese classics by an imperial proclamation from emperor xuanzong of tang which awarded it honorific title true scripture of southern florescence though most orthodox chinese scholars did not consider zhuangzi to be a true classic jing due to its non confucian nature manuscripts upright 1 5 thumb tang dynasty zhuangzi manuscript preserved in japan 1930s replica portions of zhuangzi have been discovered among bamboo slip texts from warring states period and han dynasty tombs particularly at shuanggudui and zhangjiashan han bamboo texts sites one of slips from bamboo texts which date to around 300 bc contains what appears to be a short fragment from ransacking coffers qu qie chapter a large number of zhuangzi fragments dating from early tang dynasty were discovered among dunhuang manuscripts in early 20th century by expeditions of hungarian british explorer aurel stein and french sinologist paul they collectively form about twelve chapters of guo xiang s version of zhuangzi and are preserved mostly at british library and bibliotheque nationale de france among japanese national treasures preserved in kozan ji temple in kyoto is a zhuangzi manuscript from muromachi period manuscript has seven complete chapters from outer and miscellaneous chapters and is believed to be a close copy of an annotated edition written in 7th century by chinese daoist master cheng fl 630 660 content zhuangzi consists of a large collection of anecdotes allegories parables and fables which are often humorous or irreverent in nature most zhuangzi stories are fairly short and simple such as lickety and split drilling seven holes in wonton chapter 7 or zhuangzi being discovered sitting and drumming on a basin after his wife dies chapter 18 although a few are longer and more complex like story of master lie and magus chapter 14 and account of yellow emperor s music chapter 14 unlike other stories and allegories in other pre qin texts zhuangzi is unique in that allegories form bulk of text rather than occasional features and are always witty emotional and are not limited to reality unlike other ancient chinese works whose allegories were usually based on historical legends and proverbs most zhuangzi stories seem to have been invented by zhuangzi himself some are completely whimsical such as strange description of evolution from misty spray through a series of substances and insects to horses and humans chapter 18 while a few other passages seem to be sheer playful nonsense which read like lewis carroll s jabberwocky zhuangzi is full of quirky and fantastic characters such as mad scholar sir plow and a man who believes his left arm will turn into a rooster his right arm will turn into a crossbow and his buttocks will become cartwheels a master of language zhuangzi sometimes engages in logic and reasoning but then turns it upside down or carries arguments to absurdity to demonstrate limitations of human knowledge and rational world some of zhuangzi s reasoning such as his renowned argument with his philosopher friend huizi master hui about joy of fish chapter 17 have been compared to socratic and platonic dialogue traditions and huizi s paradoxes near end of book have been termed strikingly like those of zeno of notable passages thumb upright 1 zhuangzi dreaming of a butterfly by 18th century japanese painter ike no taiga right thumb upright 0 6 zhuangzi dreaming of a butterfly by japanese painter shibata 1888 butterfly dream most famous of all zhuangzi stories zhuang zhou dreams of being a butterfly appears at end of second chapter on equality of things well known image of zhuangzi wondering if he was a man who dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man is so striking that whole dramas have been written on its theme in it zhuangzi plays with theme of transformation illustrating that distinction between waking and dreaming is another false dichotomy if one distinguishes them how can one tell if one is now dreaming or awake death of wonton another well known zhuangzi story death of wonton illustrates dangers zhuangzi saw in going against innate nature of things zhuangzi believed that greatest of all human happiness could be achieved through a higher understanding of nature of things and that in order to develop oneself fully one needed to express one s innate ability in this anecdote mair suggests that zhuangzi humorously and absurdly uses wonton a name for both chinese conception of primordial chaos and by later physical analogy wonton demonstrate what he believed were disastrous consequences of going against things innate natures debate on joy of fish story of debate on joy of fish is a well known anecdote that has been compared to socratic dialogue tradition of ancient greece exact point made by zhuangzi in this debate is not entirely clear story seems to make point that knowing a thing is simply a state of mind and that it is not possible to determine if that knowing has any objective validity this story has been cited as an example of zhuangzi s linguistic mastery as he subtly uses reason to make an anti rationalist point drumming on a tub and singing another well known zhuangzi story drumming on a tub and singing describes how zhuangzi did not view death as something to be feared zhuangzi seems to have viewed death as a natural process or transformation where one gives up one form of existence and assumes another in second chapter he makes point that for all humans know death may in fact be better than life how do i know that loving life is not a delusion how do i know that in hating death i am not like a man who having left home in his youth has forgotten way back watson 1968 cited in his writings teach that wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness zhuangzi s death story of zhuangzi s death contained in chapter 32 of text exemplifies colorful lore that grew up around zhuangzi in decades after his death as well

principles and attitudes including living one s life with natural spontaneity uniting one s inner self with cosmic way dao keeping oneself distant from politics and social obligations accepting death as a natural transformation showing appreciation and praise for things others view as useless or aimless and stridently rejecting social values and conventional reasoning these principles form core ideas of philosophical daoism other major philosophical schools of ancient as confucianism legalism and all concerned with concrete social political or ethical reforms designed to reform people and society and thereby alleviate problems and suffering of world however zhuangzi believed that key to true happiness was to free oneself from world and its standards through daoist principle of inaction wu wei wuwei action that is not based on any purposeful striving or motives for was fundamentally opposed to systems that impose order on individuals zhuangzi interprets universe as a thing that changes spontaneously without a conscious god or will driving it and argues that humans can achieve ultimate happiness by living equally spontaneously it argues that because of humans advanced cognitive abilities they have a tendency to create artificial as good versus bad large versus small usefulness versus uselessness and social systems like remove themselves from natural spontaneity of universe in order to illustrate mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action zhuangzi most frequently uses analogy of craftsmen or artisans as burton watson described skilled woodcarver skilled butcher skilled swimmer does not ponder or on course of action he should take his skill has become so much a part of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and without knowing why achieves success term wandering you is used throughout stories of zhuangzi to describe how an enlightened person wanders through all of creation enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it zhuangzi vigorously opposes formal government which zhuangzi seems to have felt was problematic at its foundation because of opposition between man and nature text tries to show that as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness it is unclear if zhuangzi s positions were tantamount to anarchy and he was by no means in favor of violence political references in zhuangzi are more concerned with what government should not do rather than what kind of government should exist western scholars have long noticed that zhuangzi is often strongly anti rationalist deriving from zhuangzi s possible contemporary was most logically sophisticated school in ancient china whereas reason and logic became hallmark of greek philosophy and then entire western philosophical tradition in china philosophers preferred to rely on moral persuasion and intuition zhuangzi played a significant role in traditional chinese skepticism toward rationalism as zhuangzi frequently turns logical arguments upside down to satirize and discredit them however zhuangzi did not entirely abandon language and reason but only wished to point out that overdependence on them could limit flexibility of thought influence zhuangzi is by far most influential purely literary work dating from before china s imperial unification in 221 its literary quality imagination and creativity and linguistic prowess were entirely unprecedented in period of its creation virtually every major chinese writer or poet in history from sima xiangru and sima qian during han dynasty ruan ji and tao yuanming during six dynasties li bai during tang dynasty to su shi and lu you in song dynasty were deeply imbued with ideas and artistry of zhuangzi early times traces of zhuangzis influence in late warring states period philosophical texts such as guanzi han feizi huainanzi and lushi chunqiu suggest that zhuangzi s intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in states of qi and chu in 3rd century however during qin and han their state sponsored legalist and confucian ideologies zhuangzi does not seem to have been highly regarded one exception is han dynasty scholar jia yi s 170 work fu on owl fu earliest definitively known fu rhapsody which does not reference zhuangzi by name but cites it for one sixth of poem after collapse of han dynasty in ad 207 and subsequent chaos of three kingdoms period both zhuangzi and zhuang zhou began to rise in popularity and acclaim 3rd century ad poets ruan ji and xi kang both members of famous seven worthies of bamboo grove were ardent zhuangzi admirers and one of ruan s essays entitled discourse on summing up zhuangzi da zhuang lun is still extant this period saw confucianism temporarily surpassed by a revival of daoism and old divination texts such as classic of changes i ching and many early medieval chinese poets artists and calligraphers were deeply influenced by zhuangzi daoism and buddhism zhuangzi has been called most important of all daoist writings and its inner chapters embody core ideas of philosophical daoism in 4th century ad zhuangzi became a major source of imagery and terminology for a new form of daoism known as highest clarity shangqing school that was popular among aristocracy of jin dynasty ad highest clarity daoism borrowed notable zhuangzi terms such as perfected man zhen ren great clarity tai qing and fasting mind xin zhai and though they are used somewhat differently than in zhuangzi itself they still show important role zhuangzi played at time zhuangzi was very influential in adaptation of buddhism to chinese culture after buddhism was first brought to china from india in 1st century ad zhi dun china s first aristocratic buddhist monk wrote a prominent commentary to zhuangzi in mid 4th century zhuangzi also played a significant role in formation of chan zen buddhism which grew out of a fusion of buddhist ideology and ancient daoist thought among traits chan zen buddhism borrowed from zhuangzi are a distrust of language and logic an insistence that dao can be found in everything even dung and urine and a fondness for dialogues based on riddles or paradigm challenging statements known as gong an japanese koan medieval and early modern zhuangzi retained prominence throughout chinese history as preeminent example of core daoist philosophical ideals 17th century scholar gu lamented his government s flippant use of zhuangzi on imperial examination essays as representative of a decline in traditional morals at end of ming dynasty 1368 1644 in great chinese novel dream of red chamber hong lou meng main protagonist jia often turns to zhuangzi for comfort amidst his despair over conflicting love interests and relationships story of zhuangzi drumming on a tub and singing after death of his wife inspired an entire tradition of folk music called funeral drumming sang gu in central china s hubei and hunan provinces that survived into 18th and 19th centuries modern outside of china and traditional zhuangzi lags far behind tao te ching in general popularity and is rarely known by non scholars a number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring zhuangzi to wider attention among western readers in 1939 british translator and sinologist arthur waley described zhuangzi as one of most entertaining as well as one of books in world cited in in introduction to his 1994 translation of zhuangzi american sinologist victor h mair wrote i feel a sense of injustice that dao de jing is so well known to my fellow citizens while zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored because i firmly believe that latter is in every respect a superior work notable translations herbert giles 1889
