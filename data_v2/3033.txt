hitler s generals on trial last war crimes tribunal at nuremberg is a 2010 book by canadian historian valerie hebert dealing with high command trial of book covers criminal case against defendants all high ranking officers of armed forces of nazi germany as well as wider societal and historical implications of trial book received generally positive reviews for its mastery of subject and thorough assessment of legacy of trial contents premise hitler s generals on trial details high command trial officially known as war criminals before nuremberg military tribunals which was part of subsequent nuremberg trials hitler s generals on trial focuses on two goals set out for trials first a didactic goal which attempted to use trials as a learning experience for german nation regarding depth of complicity of their armed forces wehrmacht in criminality of nazi regime second goal involved obtaining justice for victims by punishing those involved handling subject from an interdisciplinary perspective hebert addresses issues of international military justice post war developments in west germany and how political considerations superseded quest for justice in this atmosphere myth of clean wehrmacht thrived and in words of author trial had virtually no impact on german public consciousness prosecution and defence cases using primary and secondary materials hebert discusses proceedings themselves evolution of american judicial policy towards war crimes preceding trials and post conviction developments hebert focuses in particular on cases against senior field commanders hermann hoth georg von kuchler and hans reinhardt who led armies and army groups on eastern front and were responsible for mass war crimes and crimes against humanity she also details cases against two key members of okw german military s supreme command walter warlimont who composed barbarossa jurisdiction order and hermann reinecke in charge of prisoner of war regulations which led to deaths of millions of soviet pows in covering one tactic shared by defence counsels from different trials hebert reviewed a memorandum put forth at nuremberg trial in 1945 1946 co authored by former chief of staff of okh german army high command franz halder and former field marshals walter von brauchitsch and erich von manstein along with other senior military figures document aimed to portray german armed forces as apolitical and largely innocent of crimes committed by nazi regime hebert shows how that strategy was also adopted by lead counsel for defence in high command trial hans laternser conclusion hebert implicates court s greater pedagogical failure as cause of its failure to enact justice while evidence of specific war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by accused was damning book found that it was defence that won case in court of germany s public opinion german public proved to be too recalcitrant towards idea of imposing consequences upon their military leaders in a country where society has long revered military german public found concept of punishment for its military leaders as anathema to their own personal sense of a moral legal culture those motivations brought about various campaigns conducted by german clergy and government of new federal republic on behalf of convicted which ultimately impacted trial s conclusion faced with their concerted lobbying efforts american sentence review and clemency program reduced or commuted many of sentences which according to hebert brought failure to both of trial s goals former military officers were first to be released including those convicted in high command case with various areas of german society doing what it could to influence sentences of those on trial none of defendants remained in prison after 1957 nevertheless none of those found guilty were ever publicly exonerated of their crimes reception a review by historian daniel in journal of genocide research finds book a welcome addition to this literature as it focuses on a trial that has so far been neglected according to if hebert had provided more information on german military organization and function she could have presented a clearer picture wehrmacht s inexorable ties to nazi regime s goals of conquest and annihilation review agrees with hebert in that americans did not fully achieve objectives they had set out before start of case but it must be remembered that trials of german military figures between 1945 and 1949 brought to light many documents of inestimable value to historians as in wehrmacht exhibition of 1990s thus although most of crimes of wehrmacht were forgotten in immediate wake of proceedings didactic value of high command trial was not completely lost reviewing hitler s generals on trial in military review mark montesclaros of army command and general staff college describes book s treatment of political context of trial and subsequent developments as one of its greatest insights he points out that american authorities in germany were not only seeking justice but at same time trying to rebuild german society conduct a de nazification program and recruit west germany into a military coalition in face of looming cold war with soviet union faced with these conflicting priorities americans opted for reconciliation with former enemy which included clemency programs for those convicted in war crimes trials mark montesclaros highly recommends book to those interested in international military justice and post war developments in germany historian alaric searle notes book s success with only 208 pages of text in providing a readable accessible and tightly structured overview of an extremely complex case he contrasts it with other literature on war crimes trials which he describes as affairs written by lawyers and recommends hitler s generals on trial for teaching purposes american scholar jonathan lurie reviewing book in h net finds that it breaks new ground and is strongly recommended comparing it to 2008 collection of essays atrocities on trial historical perspectives on politics of prosecuting war crimes edited by patricia heberer and jurgen matthaus which covered a number of war crimes trials lurie notes strength of hebert s book in thoroughly analysing a single case and its outcomes and lessons he goes on to describe work as an outstanding contribution that asks difficult questions about justice retribution and atonement author valerie hebert is an associate professor of history and interdisciplinary studies at lakehead
