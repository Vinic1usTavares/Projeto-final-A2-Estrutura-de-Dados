cyrus cylinder or cyrus charter is an ancient clay cylinder now broken into several pieces on which is written a declaration in akkadian cuneiform script in name of persia s achaemenid king cyrus great kuhrt 2007 p 70 72 it dates from 6th century bc and was discovered in ruins of babylon in mesopotamia modern iraq in 1879 2010 01 26 it is currently in possession of british museum which sponsored expedition that discovered cylinder it was created and used as a foundation deposit following persian conquest of babylon in 539 bc when neo babylonian empire was invaded by cyrus and incorporated into his persian empire writing depicts first known large empire with first true states and provinces encompassing different cultures first persian empire was first true empire to develop to such an unprecedented scale so idea of unified states under higher bureaucracy as human rights directly comes from legacy of cyrus text on cylinder praises cyrus sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings babylonian king nabonidus who was defeated and deposed by cyrus is denounced as an impious oppressor of people of babylonia and his low born origins are implicitly contrasted to cyrus kingly heritage victorious cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by chief babylonian god marduk to restore peace and order to babylonians text states that cyrus was welcomed by people of babylon as their new ruler and entered city in peace it appeals to marduk to protect and help cyrus and his son cambyses it extols cyrus as a benefactor of citizens of babylonia who improved their lives repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across mesopotamia and elsewhere in region it concludes with a description of how cyrus repaired city wall of babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king cylinder s text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of cyrus policy of repatriation of jewish people following their babylonian captivity an act that book of ezra attributes to vos 1992 p 204 as text refers to restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples this interpretation has been disputed as text identifies only mesopotamian sanctuaries and makes no mention of jews jerusalem or judea cylinder has also been referred to by mohammad reza pahlavi last shah of iran as first declaration of universal human rights a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of cylinder s generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at beginning of his reign neil macgregor former director of british museum has stated that cylinder was first attempt we know about running a society a state with different nationalities and faiths a new kind of statecraft it was adopted as a national symbol of iran by imperial state which put it on display in tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2 500 year celebration of persian empire on

a firman decree from ottoman sultan abdul hamid ii to continue earlier excavations firman was only valid for a year but a second firman with much more liberal terms was issued in 1878 it was granted for two years through to 15 october 1880 with promise of an extension to 1882 if required 1903 pp 204 05 sultan s decree authorised rassam to pack and dispatch to england any antiquities he found

stages around a cone shaped core of clay within which there are large grey stone inclusions it was built up with extra layers of clay to give it a cylindrical shape before a fine surface slip of clay

reunited in 1972 main body of cylinder discovered by rassam in 1879 is fragment a it underwent restoration in 1961 when it was re fired and plaster filling was added smaller fragment b is a section

indefinitely in exchange for a suitable cuneiform tablet from british museum collection although cylinder clearly post dates cyrus great s conquest of babylon in 539 bc date of its creation is unclear

been identified as part of a cuneiform tablet that was inscribed with same text as cyrus cylinder fragments had come from small site of near babylon and identification was made by professor wilfred lambert formerly of university of birmingham and irving finkel curator in charge of museum s department of middle east cyrus cylinder press release british museum 20 january 2010 relation to a chinese bone inscription in 1983 two fossilized horse bones inscribed with cuneiform signs surfaced in china which professor oliver gurney at oxford later identified as coming from cyrus cylinder discovery of these objects aroused much discussion about possible connections between ancient mesopotamia and china although their authenticity was doubted by many scholars from beginning and they are now generally regarded as forgeries history of putative artifact goes back almost a century earliest record goes back to a chinese doctor named xue shenwei who sometime prior to 1928 was shown a photo of a rubbing of one of bones by an antiquities dealer named zhang yi an although not able to view bones at that time xue shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named wang dongting in 1935 and then second via a personal connection named ke around 1940 while xue did not recognize script on bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried bones for safekeeping during cultural revolution then in 1983 xue presented bones to palace museum in beijing where liu and wang of state administration of cultural heritage undertook their study these officials identified script as cuneiform and asked assyriologists chi yang and wu yuhong to work on inscriptions identification of source text proceeded slowly until 1985 when wu yuhong along with oxford assyriologist stephanie dalley and oliver gurney recognized text in one bone as coming from cyrus cylinder one year later wu yuhong presented his findings at 33rd rencontre and published them in a journal article after that second bone inscription remained until 2010 when irving finkel worked on it in that same year british museum held a conference dedicated to artifacts based on serious textual errors in inscription including omission of a large number of signs from cyrus cylinder wu yuhong argued inscriptions were most likely copied from cylinder while housed in british museum or from an early modern publication based upon it however he acknowledged remote possibility it was copied in late antiquity irving finkel disputed this conclusion based on relative obscurity of cyrus cylinder until recent decades and mismatch in paleography between bone inscriptions and hand copies found in early editions from 1880 s finally after workshop concluded an 1884 edition of cyrus cylinder by e a wallis budge came to irving finkel s attention this publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a for only a section of whole cylinder however typeface in that edition matched paleography on bone inscriptions and extract of cylinder published in book matched that of bone as well this convinced finkel that bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained majority opinion since then interpretations mesopotamian and persian tradition and propaganda according to british museum cyrus cylinder reflects a long tradition in mesopotamia where from as early as third millennium bc kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms british museum cyrus cylinder cyrus s declaration stresses his legitimacy as king and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for religious and political traditions of babylon british museum and scholars of period describe it as an instrument of ancient mesopotamian propaganda inscription in british museum room 1982 p 124 text is a royal building inscription a genre which had no equivalent in old persian literature it illustrates how cyrus co opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of babylon winn leith p 285 many elements of text were drawn from long standing mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in babylonia preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by gods for his wickedness new king has gained power through divine will of gods new king rights wrongs of his predecessor addressing welfare of people sanctuaries of gods are rebuilt or restored offerings to gods are made or increased and blessings of gods are sought and repairs are made to whole city in manner of earlier rightful kings both continuity and discontinuity are emphasized in text of cylinder it asserts virtue of cyrus as a gods fearing king of a traditional mesopotamian type on other hand it constantly discredits nabonidus reviling deposed king s deeds and even his ancestry and portraying him as an impious destroyer of his own people as fowler and hekster note this creates a problem for a monarch who chooses to buttress his claim to legitimacy by appropriating symbolic capital of his predecessors fowler hekster p 33 cylinder s reprimand of nabonidus also discredits babylonian royal authority by association it is perhaps for this reason that achaemenid rulers made greater use of assyrian rather than babylonian royal iconography and tradition in their declarations cylinder refers to assyrian king ashurbanipal as my predecessor rather than any native babylonian ruler cylinder itself is part of a continuous mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items including animal sacrifices stone tablets terracotta cones cylinders and figures newly crowned kings of babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns often in form of declarations that were deposited in foundations of public buildings british museum cyrus cylinder kuhrt 1983 pp 83 97 dandamaev pp 52 53 beaulieu p 243 van der spek pp 273 285 wiesehofer 2001 p 82 briant p 43 some contained messages while others did not and they had a number

exhibit in los angeles on avenue of stars as a gift from persian people to city of los angeles similarities with other royal inscriptions thumb 250px right nabonidus cylinder cyrus cylinder bears striking similarities to older mesopotamian royal inscriptions two notable examples are cylinder of marduk apla iddina ii who seized babylonian throne in 722 1 bc and annals of sargon ii of assyria who conquered babylon twelve years later as a conqueror marduk apla iddina faced many of same problems of legitimacy that cyrus did when he conquered babylon he declares himself to have been chosen personally by marduk who ensured his victory when he took power he performed sacred rites and restored sacred shrines he states that he found a royal inscription placed in temple foundations by an earlier babylonian king which he left undisturbed and honored all of these claims also appear in cyrus s cylinder twelve years later assyrian king sargon ii defeated and exiled marduk apla iddina taking up kingship of babylonia sargon s annals describe how he took on duties of a babylonian sovereign honouring gods maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding privileges of urban elite again cyrus s cylinder makes exactly same points nabonidus cyrus s deposed predecessor as king of babylon commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders such as cylinder of nabonidus also in british museum that follows same basic formula kuhrt 2007 pp 174 175 text of cylinder thus indicates a strong continuity with centuries of babylonian tradition as part of an established rhetoric advanced by conquerors as kuhrt puts it familiarity with long established babylonian tropes suggests that cylinder was authored by babylonian priests of marduk working at behest of cyrus dyck pp 91 94 it can be compared with another work of around same time verse account of nabonidus in which former babylonian ruler is excoriated as enemy of priests of marduk and cyrus is presented as liberator of babylon grabbe 2004 p 267 both works make a point of stressing cyrus s qualifications as a king from a line of kings in contrast to non royal ancestry of nabonidus who is described by cylinder as merely insignificant dick p 10 verse account is so similar to cyrus cylinder inscription that two texts have been dubbed an example of literary dependence not direct dependence of one upon other but mutual dependence upon a common source this is characterised by historian morton smith as propaganda put out in babylonia by cyrus s agents shortly before cyrus s conquest to prepare way of their lord smith p 78 this viewpoint has been disputed as simon j sherwin of university of cambridge puts it cyrus cylinder and verse account are after event compositions which reuse existing mesopotamian literary themes and do not need to be explained as product of pre conquest persian propaganda sherwin p 122 german historian schaudig has identified a line on cylinder he i e marduk saved his city babylon from its oppression with a line from tablet vi of babylonian epic of creation enuma elis in which marduk builds babylon haubold p 51 johannes haubold suggests that reference represents cyrus s takeover as a moment of ultimate restoration not just of political and religious institutions but of cosmic order underpinning universe haubold p 52 analysis of cylinder s claims thumb upright alt stone stele with a carving depicting a man with a beard carrying a tall staff and wearing a robe and conical hat gesturing to three symbols representing moon sun and venus stele depicting nabonidus praying to moon sun and planet venus babylonian king s religious practices were harshly condemned by cyrus cylinder s inscription vilification of nabonidus cyrus cylinder s vilification of nabonidus is consistent with other persian propaganda regarding deposed king s rule in contrast to cylinder s depiction of nabonidus as an illegitimate ruler who ruined his country reign of nabonidus was largely peaceful he was recognised as a legitimate king and he undertook a variety of building projects and military campaigns commensurate with his claim to be king of babylon universe and four corners of earth bidmead p 137 nabonidus as actually seen in babylon assyriologist paul alain beaulieu has interpreted nabonidus s exaltation of moon god sin as an outright usurpation of marduk s prerogatives by moon god bidmead p 134 although babylonian king continued to make rich offerings to marduk his greater devotion to sin was unacceptable to babylonian priestly elite bidmead p 135 nabonidus came from unfashionable north of babylonia introduced foreign gods and went into a lengthy self imposed exile which was said to have prevented celebration of vital new year festival mallowan pp 409 411 conquest and local support cyrus s conquest of babylonia was resisted by nabonidus and his supporters as battle of opis demonstrated iranologist pierre briant comments that it is doubtful that even before fall of babylon cyrus was impatiently awaited by a population desperate for a liberator briant p 43 however cyrus s takeover as king does appear to have been welcomed by some of babylonian population buchanan pp 12 13 judaic historian lisbeth s fried says that there is little evidence that high ranking priests of babylonia during achaemenid period were persians and characterises them as babylonian collaborators fried p 30 text presents cyrus as entering babylon peacefully and being welcomed by population as a liberator this presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors notably assyrian rulers tukulti ninurta i who invaded and plundered babylon in 12th century bc and sennacherib who did same thing 150 years before cyrus conquered region massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements cyrus cylinder presents a very different message johannes haubold notes that it portrays cyrus s takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between babylonian and persian history not a natural disaster but salvation of babylonia however cylinder s account of cyrus s conquest clearly does not tell whole story as it suppresses any mention of earlier conflict between persians and babylonians max mallowan describes it as a skilled work of tendentious history text omits battle of opis in which cyrus s forces defeated and apparently massacred nabonidus s army oppenheim a leo in pritchard james b ancient near eastern texts relating to old testament princeton university press p 41 nor does it explain a two week gap reported by nabonidus chronicle between persian entry into babylon and surrender of esagila temple lisbeth s fried suggests that there may have been a siege or stand off between persians and temple s defenders and priests about whose fate cylinder and chronicle makes no mention she speculates that they were killed or expelled by persians and replaced by more pro persian members of babylonian priestly elite fried p 29 as walton and hill put it claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by people is standard conqueror s rhetoric and may obscure other facts walton hill p 172 describing claim of one s own armies being welcomed as liberators as one of great imperial fantasies bruce lincoln professor of divinity at university of chicago notes that babylonian population repeatedly revolted against persian rule in 522 bc 521 bc 484 bc and 482 bc though not against cyrus or his son rebels sought to restore national independence and line of native babylonian kings perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards persians as cylinder suggests lincoln p 40 restoration of temples inscription goes on to describe cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries statues of gods that nabonidus had brought to city before persian invasion this restored normal cultic order to satisfaction of priesthood it alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but does not imply an empire wide programme of restoration instead it refers to specific areas in border region between babylonia and persia including sites that had been devastated by earlier babylonian military campaigns cylinder indicates that cyrus sought to acquire loyalty of ravaged regions by funding reconstruction return of temple properties and repatriation of displaced populations however it is unclear how much actually changed on ground there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of mesopotamian temples during cyrus s reign internal policy persians policy towards their subject people as described by cylinder was traditionally viewed as an expression of tolerance moderation and generosity on a scale previously unknown p 13 15 policies of cyrus toward subjugated nations have been contrasted to those of assyrians and babylonians who had treated subject peoples harshly he permitted resettling of those who had been previously deported and sponsored reconstruction of religious buildings dandamaev pp 52 53 cyrus was often depicted positively in western tradition by sources such as old testament of bible and greek writers herodotus and xenophon brown pp 7 p 8 of xenophon was particularly influential during renaissance when cyrus was romanticised as an exemplary model of a virtuous and successful ruler stillman p 225 modern historians argue that while cyrus s behavior was indeed conciliatory it was driven by needs of persian empire and was not an expression of personal tolerance per se min p 94 empire was too large to be centrally directed cyrus followed a policy of using existing territorial units to implement a decentralized system of government magnanimity shown by cyrus won him praise and gratitude from those he spared evans pp 12 13 policy of toleration described by cylinder was thus as biblical historian rainer albertz puts it an expression of conservative support for local regions to serve political interests of whole empire albertz pp 115 116 another biblical historian alberto soggin comments that it was more a matter of practicality and economy as it was simpler and indeed cost less to obtain spontaneous collaboration of their subjects at a local level than to have to impose their sovereignty by force soggin p 295 biblical interpretations right thumb 350px alt map showing various places in mesopotamia mentioned by cyrus cylinder places in mesopotamia mentioned by cyrus cylinder most of localities it mentions in connection with restoration of temples were in eastern and northern mesopotamia in territories that had been ruled by deposed babylonian king nabonidus excepting susa bible records that some jews who were exiled by babylonians returned to their homeland from babylon where they had been settled by nebuchadnezzar to rebuild temple following an edict from cyrus book of ezra 1 4 5 provides a narrative account of rebuilding project hurowitz pp 581 591 scholars have linked one particular passage from cylinder to old testament account this passage has often been interpreted as a reference to benign policy instituted by cyrus of allowing exiled peoples such as jews to return to their original homelands becking p 8 cylinder s inscription has been linked with reproduction in book of ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by cyrus concerning repatriation of jews and reconstruction of temple in jerusalem dandamaev 2010 01 26 two edicts one in hebrew and one in aramaic are substantially different in content and tone leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a post hoc fabrication bedford p 113 question of their authenticity remains unresolved though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of persian royal policy albeit perhaps not one that was couched in terms given in text of biblical edicts dispute over authenticity of biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from cyrus cylinder specifically concerning question of whether it indicates that cyrus had a general policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries bedford p 134 text of cylinder is very specific listing places in mesopotamia and neighboring regions it does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on return of babylonian deities to their own home cities it emphasises re establishment of local religious norms reversing alleged neglect of nabonidus a theme that amelie kuhrt describes as a literary device used to underline piety of cyrus as opposed to blasphemy of nabonidus she suggests that cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions and that there was no general policy as such kuhrt 1983 pp 83 97 lester l grabbe a historian of early judaism has written that religious policy of persians was not that different from basic practice of assyrians and babylonians before them in tolerating but not promoting local cults other than their own gods grabbe 2006 p 542 cyrus may have seen jerusalem situated in a strategic location between mesopotamia and egypt as worth patronising for political reasons his achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories as an expression of their legitimacy as rulers thereby favour with cults devotees bedford pp 138 139 conversely persian kings could and did destroy shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them as happened at miletos in 494 bc following ionian revolt greaves alan m miletos a history p 84 routledge 2002 historian ernst badian has noted regarding ionian revolt that devastated all of lower asia 1 177 is obviously an exaggeration for ionians soon returned to their trading activities persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction which would have been required given circumstances of its destruction however cylinder s text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside babylonia janzen p 157 biblical historian bob becking concludes that it has nothing to do with judeans jews or jerusalem peter ross bedford argues that cylinder is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout empire bedford p 137 kuhrt comments that purely babylonian context of cylinder provides no proof of historicity of cyrus s return of jewish exiles and rebuilding of temple in jerusalem though becking links this with lack of any references to jews in surviving achaemenid texts an indication that persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance german scholar josef wiesehofer summarizes widely held traditional view by noting that many scholars have read into sentences from text of cylinder a confirmation of old testament passages about steps taken by cyrus towards erection of jerusalem temple and repatriation of judaeans and this interpretation was according to wiesehofer for some scholars a strict belief that instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of cyrus cylinder human rights cylinder gained new prominence in late 1960s when last shah of iran called it world s first charter of human rights macgregor cylinder was a key symbol of shah s political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights despite disagreement of some historians and scholars pahlavi iranian government s view thumb cyrus cylinder at center of official emblem of 2 500 year celebration of persian empire at pahlavi iranian imperial era cyrus cylinder was dubbed first declaration of human rights by pre revolution iranian government united nations note to correspondents no 13 october 1971 a reading prominently advanced by shah mohammed reza pahlavi in a 1967 book white revolution of iran shah identified cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with achaemenids wiesehofer 1999 pp 55 68 he wrote that history of our empire began with famous declaration of cyrus which for its advocacy of humane principles justice and liberty must be considered one of most remarkable documents in history of mankind shah described cyrus as first ruler in history to give his subjects freedom of opinion and other basic rights pahlavi p 9 in 1968 shah opened first united nations conference on human rights in tehran by saying that cyrus cylinder was precursor to modern universal declaration of human rights robertson p 7 in his 1971 nowruz new year speech shah declared that 1971 would be cyrus great year during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2 500 years of persian monarchy it would serve as a showcase for a modern iran in which contributions that iran had made to world civilization would be recognized main theme of commemoration was centrality of monarchy within iran s political system associating shah of iran with famous monarchs of persia s past and with cyrus in particular ansari pp 218 19 shah looked to achaemenid period as a moment from national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for imperial society he hoped to create lincoln p 32 cyrus cylinder was adopted as symbol for commemoration and iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about
