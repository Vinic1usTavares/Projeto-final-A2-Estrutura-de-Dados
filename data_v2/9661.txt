was too zoomed out to fully highlight this critics generally were divided on plot some derided it as nonsensical less complex than in previous installments and disconnected from gameplay while others appreciated concept of protagonist psychologically working through their troubles gameplay was better received with its ability to be played in short intervals and its rpg elements highlighted as a strength reviewers generally disliked relative dearth of checkpoints perceived underdevelopment of game mechanics beyond basics and increased difficulty in later sections consensus among critics as to whether book of memories succeeded as a dungeon crawler in its own right was not reached some wrote that game was fun entertainment worked well as a game independent of silent hill series was promising despite flaws or was enjoyable despite a perceived lack of faithfulness to trappings of series while others wrote that it failed to live up to horror roots of series or suffered from an identity crisis as neither a faithful silent hill title nor an innovative dungeon crawler notes references external links konami digital entertainment official website category 2012 video games
