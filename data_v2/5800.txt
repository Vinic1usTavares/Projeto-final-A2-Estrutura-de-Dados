in october 2014 oliver sava of a v club awarded episode a c sava compared installment to previous fourth season episode bmo noire but noted that while latter builds a story around one of supporting character that is primarily defined by being cute and lonely reign of gunters does not add anything to character of gunter making it feel like a one off joke stretched to fill 10 minutes he also felt that it would have been more enjoyable to watch action unfold between ice king and secret wizard society because he felt that action taking place at candy kingdom while fun was not very exciting despite this sava noted that best part of episode was when finn explains to jake that he is keeping his lady friends in a state of confusion in order to pursue potential romantic relationships with them in future explanatory notes references external links category 2012 american television episodes category adventure time season 4 episodes
