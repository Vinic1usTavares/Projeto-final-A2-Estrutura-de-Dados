herbal healing family background sherwood was born in 1660 to john and susan white john white was a carpenter and farmer of scottish descent it is uncertain whether he was born in america susan was english by birth their daughter grace was born in virginia probably in pungo in april 1680 grace white married a respected small farm landowner james sherwood in lynnhaven parish church couple had three sons john james and richard john white gave sherwoods of land when they married and on his death in 1681 left them remainder of his farm sherwood family was poor and lived in an area inhabited by small landowners or those with no land at all in addition to farming grace sherwood grew her own herbs which she used to heal both people and animals she also acted as a midwife when james died in 1701 grace inherited his property she did not remarry no drawings or paintings of sherwood exist but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing a sense of humor sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm this was unusual for time as was her herb growing combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives sherwood biographer and advocate belinda nash suggests that sherwood s neighbors may have been jealous of sherwood and that witchcraft tales may have been conjured up in an effort to remove her from and subsequently get her property sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft or in which she sued her accusers for slander witchcraft and virginia thumb right asheville bridge creek known as muddy creek when grace sherwood lived on its banks existence of witches and demonic forces was taken for granted by american colonists witchcraft was considered work of devil colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior as early as 1626 nineteen years after founding of jamestown colony a grand jury in virginia sat to consider whether joan wright was a witch she had supposedly predicted deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife no record of outcome is extant nevertheless virginia did not experience events of mass hysteria such as salem massachusetts witch trials in 1692 1693 in which 19 people were executed on allegations of sorcery some years before first accusations against sherwood ecclesiastical influence in courtroom was much less a factor in virginia where clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials than in new england where ministers took an active part people s fears of witchcraft in virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore although two often intermingled new england s puritans had settled in towns and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions there were few such towns in virginia where population mostly lived on farms and plantations connected by water transport and scattered over a large area virginia s lay and religious leaders were more interested in prosecuting offenses such as gossip slander and fornication seeing them as threats to social stability they wished to avoid witchcraft prosecutions which were divisive virginia courts were reluctant to hear accusations of witchcraft and were even more reluctant to convict unlike salem witch trial courts where accused had to prove her innocence in virginia courts accuser carried burden of proof further virginia courts generally ignored evidence said to have been obtained by supernatural means whereas new england courts were known to convict people based solely on it virginia required proof of guilt through either searches for witch s marks or ducking judges and magistrates would dismiss unsubstantiated cases of witchcraft and allow accusers who found themselves under an ill tongue to be sued for slander frances pollard of virginia historical society states it was pretty clear that virginia early on tried to discourage these charges being brought of witchcraft because they were so troublesome southeastern corner of virginia around present day norfolk and virginia beach where pungo is located saw more accusations of witchcraft than other areas according to leslie m newman this may have been due to local poverty as there was no cultural elite to restrain such prosecutions although few virginia records survive from that era 19 known witchcraft cases were brought in colony during 17th century all but one of which ended in acquittal one conviction was a 1656 case of a man convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 10 stripes and banishment from county there were no executions for witchcraft in virginia nonetheless as late as in 1736 virginia s justices of peace were reminded that witchcraft was still a crime and that first offenders could expect to be pilloried and jailed for up to a year in 1745 john craig a presbyterian minister in augusta county made assertions of witchcraft after his child and several of his animals died and was in response accused of using evil arts to divine who was responsible neither he nor those who accused him brought their claims to court to face unsympathetic magistrates though prosecution for witchcraft was still possible in virginia last virginia witchcraft trial took place in 1802 in brooke county which is now in west virginia in that case a couple claimed that a woman was a witch an accusation ruled slanderous trial by ducking immersing accused bound in water to see if she would float appears to have been used only once in virginia to try sherwood it was believed that as water was considered pure it would reject witches causing them to float whereas innocent would sink accusations against sherwood initial claims of witchcraft first accusation against sherwood came to court in early 1697 richard capps alleged that she had used a spell to cause death of his bull court made no decision and sherwoods filed a defamation suit against capps that was resolved by a settlement in 1698 sherwood was accused by her neighbor john of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop no court action followed this accusation and another suit for defamation by sherwoods failed in same year elizabeth barnes alleged that sherwood had assumed form of a black cat entered barnes home jumped over her bed drove and whipped her and left via keyhole again allegation was unresolved and again subsequent defamation action was lost for each of failed actions sherwood and her husband had to pay court related costs according to richard beale davis in his journal article on witchcraft in virginia by this time princess anne county had obviously grown tired of mrs sherwood as a general nuisance in 1705 sherwood was involved in a fight with her neighbor elizabeth hill sherwood sued hill and her husband for assault and battery and on december 7 1705 was awarded damages of twenty shillings one pound sterling trial by water thumb upright alt engraving of a naked woman with hands tied to tied on her back floating on water as a trial by ordeal for being a witch 17th century engraving of

having bewitched elizabeth hill causing a miscarriage in march 1706 princess anne county justices sought to two juries both made up of women first was ordered to search sherwood s home for or baked figures that might indicate she was a witch second was ordered to look for demon suckling teats by examining her in both instances reluctance on part of local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out searches on march 7 1706 sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 ancient and knowing women appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of devil they discovered two marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman forewoman of this jury was same elizabeth barnes who had previously accused sherwood of witchcraft neither colonial authorities in williamsburg nor local court in princess anne were willing to declare sherwood a witch those in williamsburg considered charge overly vague and on april 16 instructed local court to examine case more fully for each court appearance sherwood had to travel from her farm in pungo to where court was sitting on may 2 1706 county justices noted that while no particular act of had been alleged against sherwood there was great cause of suspicion consequently sheriff of princess anne county took sherwood into custody though sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior maximilian boush a warden of lynnhaven parish church was prosecutor in sherwood s case on july 5 1706 justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place with sherwood s consent but heavy rains caused a postponement until july 10 as they feared wet weather might harm her health sherwood was taken inside lynnhaven parish church placed on a stool and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery she

court records have been lost she served an unknown time in jail next to lynnhaven parish church perhaps as long as seven years and nine months she was ordered to be detained to be brought to a future trial but no record of another trial exists so it is possible charge was dismissed at some point on september 1 1708 she was ordered to pay christopher cocke of tobacco for a reason not indicated in surviving records but there is no mention of payment she appears to have been released some time in or before 1714 since in that year she paid back taxes on her property which virginia lieutenant
