performances and episode nicely summarizes will and grace s friendship over course of entire show some critics criticized finale for putting action in several different time periods jennifer armstrong of entertainment weekly said we endure a swirl of confusing unnecessary sequences from grace s dream to current reality to two years later to their kids first day of college to their kids impending wedding by end instead of being sad to bid adieu we re just relieved not to have yet another disbelief suspending flash forward thrust upon us jim schembri of sydney morning herald wrote time jumping device is overused and a tad awkward but by and large it s a noble finale to one of better standard three wall sitcoms from america amy amatangelo of zap2it commented that will grace is a show that spent eight seasons predicated on lasting friendship of will and grace and we re supposed to believe that they spent over 20 years not talking to each other just because their lives went in different directions that there is no way their friendship could have been sustained once they both found love of their life amatangelo enjoyed jack and karen s performance of unforgettable but rest of finale
