alt demonstration against redskins name thumb right 250px in november 2014 a demonstration against use of name redskins was held outside tcf bank stadium in minneapolis minnesota before a game against vikings washington redskins name controversy involves name and logo of washington redskins a national football league nfl franchise native americans have been questioning use of name and image since 1960s while topic has received widespread public attention since 1990s native americans demanding change include tribal nations national tribal organizations civil rights organizations and individuals largest of these organizations national congress of american indians counted enrollment of its member tribes as totaling 1 2 million individuals in 2013 according to american psychological association as of 2010 over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights educational athletic and scientific experts have published resolutions or policies that state that use of native american names and or symbols by non native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice contributing to other problems faced by native americans public awareness of issues has been growing based upon social science research on harmful effects of stereotyping number of high school and college teams using redskins name has been declining steadily along with other native american mascots there is also a growing number of public officials sports commentators and other journalists advocating a change washington d c team is only one example of larger native american mascot controversy but it receives more public attention because modern dictionaries define name as derogatory or insulting and because team represents nation s capital team headquarters is in ashburn virginia and its home stadium fedexfield is in landover maryland both within washington metropolitan area name controversy was a factor in team s departure from washington dc in 1997 and remains so in discussions of location of a new stadium as well as picketing and other forms of direct protest opponents took legal action to cancel trademarks held by team on june 18 2014 trademark trial and appeal board ttab of united states patent and trademark office uspto voted to cancel redskins federal trademark registrations considering them disparaging to native americans cancellation was affirmed in 2015 by judge in a first appeal by redskins however in june 2017 supreme court of united states came to a unanimous decision in a different case ruling that not allowing disparaging names to be protected by trademark registration is an unconstitutional infringement of freedom of speech thus voiding legal basis for cancellation of redskins trademarks support for continued use of name has come from team s owners management nfl commissioner and a majority of fans which include some native american individuals supporters say that name honors achievements and virtues of native americans and that it is not intended in a negative manner some such as team president bruce allen also point to use of redskins by three high school teams two on reservations that have a majority of native american students supporters have asserted that a majority of native americans are not offended by name based upon a national poll by annenberg public policy center in 2004 in a commentary published soon after that poll 15 native american scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in annenberg study that rather than being a measure of native american opinion it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism specific criticism of methodology includes use of self reporting to identify native americans which violated basic principles supporting validity of public opinion polling in may 2016 washington post published a poll that duplicated central question posed in 2004 yielding an identical result history in 1933 football team that shared both name and playing field with boston braves baseball team moved to fenway park already home to boston red sox co owner george preston marshall changed name to redskins more likely to avoid confusion while retaining indian imagery of team than to honor coach william henry lone star dietz whose identity as a native american was debated logo for nfl braves was similar to current logo a native american head in profile with braids and trailing feathers current logo proposed by walter wetzel a former blackfeet tribal chairman and past president of national congress of american indians was introduced in 1972 and is modeled after likeness on buffalo nickel members of blackfeet tribe express a range of opinions from support to indifference to strong opposition to redskins name based upon their personal experiences advocates of changing team s name say that stereotypes of native americans must be understood in context of a history that includes conquest forced relocation and organized efforts by federal and state governments to eradicate native cultures such as boarding schools of late 19th and early 20th centuries since first europeans made landfall in north america native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes misconceptions and caricatures whether portrayed as noble savages ignoble savages teary eyed environmentalists or most recently simply as casino rich native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal historical and personal experience into one dimensional representations that tells us more about depicters than about depicted carter meland anishinaabe and david e wilkins lumbee are professors of native american studies at university of minnesota origin and meaning of redskin alt redskins script logo thumb right 300px script logo used by redskins 1972 present historical context for emergence in americas of racial identities based upon skin color was establishment of colonies which developed a plantation economy dependent upon slave labor prior to colonial era british identified themselves as christians rather than white at start of eighteenth century indians and europeans rarely mentioned color of each other s skins by remarks about skin color and categorization of peoples by simple color coded labels red white black had become commonplace documents from colonial period indicate that use of red as an identifier by native americans for themselves emerged in context of indian european diplomacy in southeastern region of north america before later being adopted by europeans and becoming a generic label for all native americans linguistic evidence indicates that while some tribes may have used red to refer to themselves during pre columbian era based upon their origin stories general use of term was in response to meeting people who called themselves white and their slaves black choice of red rather than other colors may have been due to cultural associations rather than skin color in debate over meaning of word redskin team supporters frequently cite a paper by ives goddard a smithsonian institution senior linguist and curator emeritus who asserts that term was a direct translation of words used by native americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning in an interview goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if native words were accurately translated darren r reid a history lecturer at coventry university contends that native american usage was generally attributed to them by european writers reid states that team logo works together with name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype it is not up to non indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a native american positive stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring native americans but this is forcing your idea of what it is to honour those people onto them and that fundamentally is disrespectful advocates of changing name emphasize current meanings in dictionaries of american english which include usually offensive disparaging insulting and taboo such meanings are consistent with usage found in books in period between 1875 and 1930 which is after that studied by goddard john mcwhorter an associate professor of linguistics at columbia university compares redskin becoming a slur to other racial terms such as oriental which acquired implied meanings associated with contempt a controversial etymological claim is that term emerged from practice of paying a bounty for indians and that redskin refers to bloody scalp of native americans although official documents do not use word in this way an historical association between use of redskin and paying of bounties can be made in 1863 a winona minnesota newspaper daily republican printed an announcement state reward for dead indians has been increased to 200 for every red skin sent to purgatory this sum is more than dead bodies of all indians east of red river are worth a news story published by atchison daily champion in atchison kansas on october 9 1885 tells of settlers hunt for redskins with a view of obtaining their scalps valued at 250 for c richard king lack of direct evidence does not mean that contemporary native people are wrong to draw an association between a term that empathizes an identity based upon skin color and a history that commodified native american body parts trademark cases meaning of term redskin was addressed in two cases challenging trademark registrations held by pro football inc team s corporate entity challenge was based upon a provision of lanham act which prohibited registration of any mark that may disparage persons institutions beliefs or national symbols or bring them into contempt or disrepute first case filed in 1992 by suzan shown harjo and six other native american leaders resulted in cancellation federal registrations for redskins marks by trial and appeal board ttab however in 2005 united states district court for district of columbia reversed ttab s decision on grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement subsequent appeals were also rejected on basis of laches that native american petitioners had pursued their rights in an untimely manner a second case was filed with younger plaintiffs not effected by laches led by amanda blackhorse linguistic expert for petitioners geoffrey nunberg successfully argued that whatever its origins redskins was a slur at time of trademark registrations based upon passages from books and newspapers and movie clips in which word is inevitably associated with contempt derision condescension or sentimental paeans to noble savage nigger also began as a benign reference to skin color only to become a racial slur through disparaging use on june 18 2014 ttab again voted to cancel trademarks in a two to one decision that held that term redskins is disparaging to a substantial composite of native americans evidence of disparagement include frequent references to scalping made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting redskins loss of a game and passages from movies made from 1940s to 1960s using redskin to refer to native americans as a savage enemy ttab majority held that ncai represented about 30 percent of native americans during time in question which board found satisfied substantial composite test of trademark law in december 2015 federal circuit court of appeals struck down disparagement prohibition in trademark law in a case matal v tam involving a denial of trademark registration to asian american band slants majority opinion stated in part that w hatever our personal feelings about mark at issue here or other disparaging marks first amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find speech likely to offend others on june 19 2017 supreme court unanimously ruled in favor of tam stating disparagement clause violates first amendment s free speech clause contrary to government s contention trademarks are private not government speech on june 29 2017 both native american petitioners and justice department withdrew from any further litigation now that supreme court has rendered legal issue moot while team owner daniel snyder expresses opinion that court decision is a victory for team executive director of ncai asserts that name remains a slur and decision that grants it first amendment protection does not alter any of arguments against its continued use use by native americans supporters of redskins name note that three predominantly native american high schools use name for their sports teams suggesting that it can be acceptable however in 2013 principal of one of these red mesa high school in teec nos pos arizona said that use of word outside american indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate legacy of negativity that term has created teec nos pos on navajo nation is 96 5 native american wellpinit washington a town within a reservation of spokane people is 79 3 native american in 2014 wellpinit high school voted to keep redskins name third school kingston high school in kingston oklahoma is 57 69 native american native american writer and attorney gyasi ross compares native american use of variations of word redskin with african american use of variations of word nigger specifically natives calling each other skins as analogous to nigga use of terms by some members of minority communities does not mean that same may be used by outsiders this is generally recognized by white people with regard to black expressions yet whites feel free to say how natives should feel about redskin ross also notes that there is no consensus among natives regarding either opposition to washington team s use of name or importance of issue compared to more immediate concerns however in response to argument that native americans ought to focus on social issues larger than a team name ross stated that native people shouldn t be forced to choose between living or racial discrimination those are false binaries controversy redskins controversy began receiving more attention in 2013 starting with a symposium in february on topic at smithsonian s national museum of american indian in washington d c subsequently oneida indian nation of new york sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of 2013 season each featuring a targeted message a broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion including local government leaders members of congress and president barack obama statements in support of a name change by academic civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that native american groups have been making for decades in 2017 when professional sports has dealt with a number of racial issues from individual acts by players to widespread protests during national anthem some commentators speculated why there has been no action to address stereotyping of native americans including decision to have washington redskins host a game on thanksgiving academic research issue is often discussed in media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness which reduces it to feelings and opinions and prevents full understanding of historical psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on negative effects of use of native american names and images by sports teams effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations confidence and academic performance has been well established this effect is enhanced due to invisibility of native americans in mainstream society and media leaving stereotypes as primary basis for thinking about abilities and traits associated with natives including roles and opportunities natives americans envision for themselves furthermore even when stereotypes are positive e g native americans are spiritual they may have a limiting detrimental effect on individuals stereotyping may directly affect academic performance and self esteem of native american youth whose people face high rates of suicide unemployment and poverty euro americans exposed to mascots may be more likely to believe not only that such stereotypes are true but that native americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to target of stereotype a spreading effect alt chief zee thumb right 180px chief zee with other fans native americans opposed to mascots point to oversimplification of their culture by fans playing indian with no understanding of deeper meaning of feathers face paint chants and dancing richard lapchick director emeritus of northeastern university s center for study of sport in society wrote could you imagine people mocking african americans in black face at a game yet go to a game where there is a team with an indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces is this not equivalent to black face unofficial mascot of redskins team was williams aka chief zee an african american man who attended games for 38 years beginning in 1978 dressed in a red faux indian costume complete with feathered war bonnet and rubber tomahawk other fans dress in similar costumes for games in a report published by center for american progress summarizing research on real impact of native mascots and team names on american indian and alaska native youth a case is made that public debate misses point since individual opinions on either side do not matter given measurable effects on mental health of native american young people exposed to such misrepresentations of their ethnic identity and often hostile or insulting behavior of non natives that occur when teams with such names and mascots play clinical psychologist michael friedman writes that use of native imagery in particular use of a dictionary defined slur is a form of bullying negative impact of which is magnified by its being officially sanctioned majority of scholars argue that use of any stereotype whether positive or negative is a hindrance to advancement of targeted group national organizations representing several academic disciplines after reviewing research done on issue have passed resolutions calling for end of all native american mascots and images in sports these include society of indian psychologists 1999 american counseling association 2001 american psychological association 2005 american sociological association 2007 and american anthropological association 2015 executive board of nation s

organizers of protest since 2013 picketing at stadiums has occurred occasionally when redskins have played particularly in cities with a significant population of native americans such as dallas denver and minneapolis latter protest was supported by several minnesota politicians picketing resumed for 2014 season in glendale arizona when team played arizona cardinals and again largest rally was in minneapolis where estimates of number of protestors was between 3 500 and 5 000 at a protest in philadelphia in 2017 native americans pointed out irony of nfl players making a statement

ll never change name it s that simple never you can use caps snyder addressed an open letter to fans that was published in washington post on october 9 2013 in which he stated that most important meaning of name is association that fans have to memories of their personal history with team snyder also states that name was chosen in 1933 to honor native americans in general and coach and four players at that time who were native american and that in 1971 coach george allen consulted with red cloud indian fund on pine ridge indian reservation when designing logo in 2013 red cloud athletic fund sent a letter to washington post stating that as an organization red cloud indian school has never and will never endorse use of name redskins like many native american organizations across country members of our staff and extended community find name offensive snyder s response and that of other supporters and fans reflects psychology of identification with sports teams self esteem

wahoo logo from stadium and uniforms goodell stated that redskins name and logo would remain primarily citing 2016 washington post opinion poll on their website team states that 2014 annual nfl poll showing 71 percent support for name along with poll taken among native americans by annenberg institute demonstrates continued widespread and deep opposition to redskins changing our name we respect point of view of small number of people who seek a name change but it is important to recognize very few people agree with case they are making team s president bruce allen addressed a letter dated may 23 2014 to senator reid repeating position that name was originated by native americans to refer to themselves that logo was also designed and approved by native american leaders and that vast majority of both native americans and public do not find name offensive conservative columnists george will and pat buchanan state that opponents of team name are being oversensitive although charles

positive one of individuals in video is mark one wolf who was reported as being born mark e yancey in washington d c of african american and japanese descent political opinion although majority of those advocating a name change are democrats there is no indication that issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that native americans are such a small percentage of electorate and are not likely to influence outcome of any election there are only eight states where natives make up greater than 2 percent of population alaska arizona montana new mexico north dakota oklahoma south dakota and wyoming however polls show a definite political difference in opinion of general public with only 58 of democrats opposing a name change versus 89 of republicans statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action there have also been non binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in new jersey and passed in minneapolis new york state and california topic came up in a 2013 interview of president barack obama who stated that if he were owner of redskins he would consider changing name because it offends many native americans but that he did not have a stake in issue as he is not an owner of a professional sports team in november 2015 obama speaking at white house tribal nations conference stated names and mascots of sports teams like washington redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of native americans and praised adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of cost of new uniforms on may 22 2014 fifty u s senators forty eight democrats and two independents sent a letter to nfl commissioner goodell asking league referencing donald sterling case to send same clear message as nba did that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports five democratic senators declined to sign letter and republicans were not invited to do so no senators have publicly supported name but rather have either declined to give an opinion or stated their opposition to senate involvement in issue during his campaign president donald trump defended name dc metro area jurisdictions much of local political discussion has been about building a stadium beginning in 1990s when a maryland location was chosen for what is now fedexfield with possibility of building a new stadium in near future both previous and current mayors of district of columbia have stated that a name change must be part of discussion however team rejects that possibility while virginia governor terry mcauliffe met with owner to discuss building of a new stadium in virginia for many years beginning with departure of baltimore colts redskins were only nfl team in a large area from maryland into southern states this is slowly changing as maryland nfl fans move to baltimore ravens several maryland politicians have stated that name should change but governor larry hogan opposes any change also citing desire to keep stadium in maryland virginia fans are now more numerous and dedicated supporters of redskins and state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage team s relocation of its facilities there and maintain that name is entirely a business decision for team to make an agency of commonwealth virginia lottery is a sponsor of team and says it has never had any complaints name change as a business decision two professors at goizueta business school at emory university summarized their research in a new york times editorial they found that studies of college teams that have changed their names and mascots indicate that doing so has a long term financial benefit while vocal opponents of change often threatened withdrawal of support this never materialized there have been no name changes by professional teams though a comparison of nfl teams shows highest negative trend in brand equity affects washington redskins and kansas city chiefs calling into question business logic of retaining native american names or logos that are offensive to even a minority in a commentary for forbes tom van riper states that research specifically considering fan loyalty and traditions of team indicates that value of name as a brand is significant and unlikely to change for business reasons an alternative opinion is that team would benefit from a re branding but any new name would need to be carefully selected in 2014 sales of redskins merchandise declined 35 from previous year people are having a second thoughts about wearing a t shirt with logo or name that it has now been called racist said matt powell senior analyst for a team spokesman attributed decline to dismal performance in 2013 season but other teams with bad records have not seen such a steep decline in sales corporate sponsors have either made no public response to media inquiries regarding name or stated that they play no role in decision and defer to team and nfl despite name controversy value of team has risen 700 million to 2 4 billion 40 making them third most valuable franchise in

bothered by team s name ncai executive director jacqueline pata stated survey doesn t recognize psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on american indian and alaska natives it is not respectful to who we are as native people this poll still doesn t make it right native american journalists association issued a statement calling publication of poll and reporting of its significance as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical reporters and editors behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for continued use of these harmful racist mascots they were either willfully malicious or dangerously naive in process and reporting used in this story and neither is acceptable from any journalistic institution washington post editorial board continues to support changing name citing opposition to such mascots by native american tribes which has resulted in continued retirement of redskins by high schools such as in driggs idaho in 2019 an alternative method to standard opinion polls was used by center for indigenous peoples studies at california state university san bernardino a survey was conducted of 400 individuals
