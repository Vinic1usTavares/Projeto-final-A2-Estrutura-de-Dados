sixgill stingray hexatrygon bickelli is a species of stingray and only extant member of family hexatrygonidae although several species of sixgill stingrays have been described historically they may represent variations in a single widespread species this flabby heavy bodied fish described only in 1980 is unique among rays in having six pairs of gill slits rather than five growing up to long it has a rounded pectoral fin disc and a long triangular and flexible snout filled with a gelatinous substance it is brownish above and white below and lacks dermal denticles benthic in nature sixgill stingray is usually found over upper continental slopes and seamounts at depths of it has been recorded from scattered locations in indo pacific from south africa to hawaii this species probably uses its snout to probe for food in bottom sediment its jaws are greatly protrusible allowing it to capture buried prey sixgill stingray gives live birth with litters of two to five pups iucn has assessed this ray as least concern because it faces minimal fishing pressure across most of its range taxonomy and phylogeny first known sixgill stingray an intact female across was found on a beach near port elizabeth south africa it was described as a new species and placed in its own family by phillip and margaret smith in a 1980 article for bulletin of j l b smith institute of ichthyology generic name hexatrygon is derived from greek hexa six and trygon stingray referring to number of gill slits specific name bickelli honors dave bickell a journalist who discovered original specimen following description of h bickelli four additional species of sixgill stingray were described on basis of morphological differences however their validity was brought into question after comparative studies revealed that traits such as snout shape body proportions and tooth number vary greatly with age and among individuals taxonomists therefore concluded tentatively that there is only a single species of sixgill stingray though genetic analysis is needed to determine whether this is truly case phylogenetic studies using morphological and genetic data have generally concurred that sixgill stingray is most basal member of stingray lineage an extinct relative h lived during middle eocene 49 37 million years ago description sixgill stingray has a bulky flabby body with a rounded pectoral fin disc that is longer than wide triangular snout is much longer in adults than in juveniles making up almost two fifths of disc length and is filled with a clear gelatinous material because of this snout of a dead specimen can shrink significantly when exposed to air or preservatives tiny eyes are placed far apart and well ahead of larger spiracles between widely spaced nostrils are a pair of short and fleshy flaps that are joined in middle to form a curtain of skin mouth is wide and nearly straight in either jaw are 44 102 rows of small blunt teeth arranged in a quincunx pattern teeth are more numerous in adults six pairs of small gill slits occur on underside of disc all other rays have five pairs a few sharks also have six or more pairs of gill slits for example in genus hexanchus one recorded specimen had six gill slits on left side and seven on right their pelvic fins are rather large and rounded tail is moderately thick and measures about 0 5 0 7 times as long as disc one or two serrated stinging spines are present on its dorsal surface well back from base end of tail bears a long low leaf shaped caudal fin that is nearly symmetrical above and below skin is delicate and entirely lacking dermal denticles disc is purplish to pinkish brown above darkening slightly at fin margins skin is easily abraded leaving white patches underside of disc is white with dark margins on pectoral and pelvic fins snout is translucent and tail and caudal fin are almost black largest known specimen is a female long distribution and habitat sixgill stingray has been recorded at widely scattered locations in indo pacific in indian ocean it has been reported from south africa off port elizabeth and port alfred southwestern india several islands of indonesia and western australia from exmouth plateau to shark bay in pacific ocean it has been found from japan to taiwan and philippines as well as off flinders reef in queensland new caledonia and hawaii this bottom dwelling species typically inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts at depths of however it occasionally ventures into shallower water with one ray observed feeding at a depth of off japan it can be found over sandy muddy or rocky bottom substrates biology and ecology thumb cookiecutter shark is known to bite sixgill stingray long snout of sixgill stingray is very flexible both vertically and horizontally suggesting that ray uses it to probe for food in bottom sediment underside of snout is covered by well developed ampullae of lorenzini arranged in longitudinal rows which are capable of detecting minute electric fields produced by other organisms mouth can be protruded downward farther than length of head likely allowing ray to extract buried prey jaws are poorly mineralized suggesting that it does not feed on hard shelled animals there is a record of a specimen with a wound from a cookiecutter shark isistius brasiliensis reproduction in sixgill stingray is viviparous with documented litter sizes of between two and five pups newly born rays measure around long both males and females mature sexually at approximately long human interactions for most part little fishing activity occurs at depths occupied by sixgill stingray thus iucn has listed it as least concern in waters around taiwan it is caught in small numbers as bycatch in bottom trawls catch rate seems to have decreased in recent years leading to concerns that it may be locally overfished though quantitative data are lacking references category hexatrygonidae category monotypic fish genera category fish of pacific ocean
