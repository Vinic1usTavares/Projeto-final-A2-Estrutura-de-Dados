strontium is chemical element with symbol sr and atomic number 38 an alkaline earth metal strontium is a soft silver white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in periodic table calcium and barium it occurs naturally mainly in minerals celestine and strontianite and is mostly mined from these both strontium and strontianite are named after strontian a village in scotland near which mineral was discovered in 1790 by adair crawford and william cruickshank it was identified as a new element next year from its crimson red flame test color strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by humphry davy using then newly discovered process of electrolysis during 19th century strontium was mostly used in production of sugar from sugar beet see strontian process at peak of production of television cathode ray tubes as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in united states was used for faceplate glass with replacement of cathode ray tubes with other display methods consumption of strontium has dramatically declined while natural strontium which is mostly isotope strontium 88 is stable synthetic strontium 90 is radioactive and is one of most dangerous components of nuclear fallout as strontium is absorbed by body in a similar manner to calcium natural stable strontium on other hand is not hazardous to health characteristics thumb left upright oxidized dendritic strontium strontium is a divalent silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and similar to those of its group neighbors calcium and barium greenwood and earnshaw pp 112 13 it is softer than calcium and harder than barium its melting 777 degc and boiling 1655 degc points are lower than those of calcium 842 degc and 1757 degc respectively barium continues this downward trend in melting point 727 degc but not in boiling point 2170 degc density of strontium 2 64 g cm3 is similarly intermediate between those of calcium 1 54 g cm3 and barium 3 594 g cm3 c r hammond elements pp 4 35 in three allotropes of metallic strontium exist with transition points at 235 and 540 degc standard electrode potential for sr2 sr couple is 2 89 v approximately midway between those of ca2 ca 2 84 v and ba2 ba 2 92 v couples and close to those of neighboring alkali metals strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380 degc at room temperature it forms only oxide spontaneously besides simple oxide sro peroxide can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide sr o2 2 greenwood and earnshaw p 119 strontium hydroxide sr oh 2 is a strong base though it is not as strong as hydroxides of barium or alkali metals greenwood and earnshaw p 121 all four dihalides of strontium are known greenwood and earnshaw p 117 due to large size of heavy s block elements including strontium a vast range of coordination numbers is known from 2 3 or 4 all way to 22 or 24 in and sr2 ion is quite large so that high coordination numbers are rule greenwood and earnshaw p 115 large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate ligands such as crown ethers for example while 18 crown 6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and alkali metals its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger greenwood and earnshaw p 124 organostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium carbon bonds they have been reported as intermediates in barbier type reactions although strontium is in same group as magnesium and compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to or compounds due to similar ionic radii of these elements sr2 118 pm eu2 117 pm sm2 122 pm most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures bulky ligands tend to favor stability for example strontium sr c5h5 2 must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with or cyclopentadiene itself replacing c5h5 ligand with bulkier c5 ch3 5 ligand on other hand increases compound s solubility volatility and kinetic stability greenwood and earnshaw pp 136 37 because of its extreme reactivity with oxygen and water strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements such as in minerals strontianite and celestine it is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with formation of oxide finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in production of flares like calcium and barium as well as alkali metals and divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution isotopes natural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes 86sr 87sr and 88sr their abundance increases with increasing mass number and heaviest 88sr makes up about 82 6 of all natural strontium though abundance varies due to production of radiogenic 87sr as daughter of long lived beta decaying 87rb greenwood and earnshaw p 19 of unstable isotopes primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium and that of isotopes heavier than 88sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium of special note are 89sr and 90sr former has a half life of 50 6 days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium s chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium while 90sr half life 28 90 years has been used similarly it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product its presence in bones can cause bone cancer cancer of nearby tissues and leukemia 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30 000 km2 with greater than 10 kbq m2 with 90sr which accounts for 5 of core inventory of 90sr history thumb left upright 0 6 flame test for strontium strontium is named after scottish village of strontian gaelic an t where it was discovered in ores of lead mines thomas charles hope originally named element strontianite but name was soon after shortened to strontium in 1790 adair crawford a physician engaged in preparation of barium and his colleague william cruickshank recognised that strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other heavy spars sources this allowed adair to conclude on page 355 it is probable indeed that scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined physician and mineral collector friedrich gabriel sulzer analysed together with johann friedrich mineral from strontian and named it strontianite he also came to conclusion that it was distinct from and contained a new earth neue in 1793 thomas charles hope a professor of chemistry at university of glasgow proposed name strontites although thomas c hope had investigated strontium ores since 1791 his research was published in he confirmed earlier work of crawford and recounted considering it a peculiar earth i thought it necessary to give it an name i have called it strontites from place it was found a mode of derivation in my opinion fully as proper as any quality it may possess which is present fashion element was eventually isolated by sir humphry davy in 1808 by electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide and announced by him in a lecture to royal society on 30 june 1808 in keeping with naming of other alkaline earths he changed name to strontium many other early investigators examined strontium ore among them 1 martin heinrich klaproth

by augustin pierre in 1849 large scale introduction came with improvement of process in early 1870s german sugar industry used process well into 20th century before world war i beet sugar industry used 100 000 to 150 000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year strontium hydroxide was recycled in process but demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in munsterland mining of strontianite in germany ended when mining of celestine deposits in gloucestershire started these mines supplied most of world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941 although celestine deposits in granada basin were known for some time large scale mining did not start before 1950s during atmospheric nuclear weapons testing it was observed that strontium 90 is one of nuclear fission products with a relative high yield similarity to calcium and chance that strontium 90 might become enriched in bones made research on metabolism of strontium an important topic occurrence thumb mineral celestine srso4 strontium commonly occurs in nature being 15th most abundant element on earth its heavier congener barium being 14th estimated to average approximately 360 parts per million in earth s crust and is found chiefly as sulfate mineral celestine srso4 and carbonate strontianite of two celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining because strontium is used most often in carbonate form strontianite would be more useful of two common minerals but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development in groundwater strontium behaves chemically much like calcium at intermediate to acidic ph sr2 is dominant strontium species in presence of calcium ions strontium commonly forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased ph at intermediate to acidic ph dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange mean strontium content of ocean water is 8 mg l at a concentration between 82 and 90 umol l of strontium concentration is considerably lower than calcium concentration which is normally between 9 6 and 11 6 mmol l it is nevertheless much higher than that of barium 13 mg l production upright 1 6 thumb strontium producers in 2014 alt grey and white world map with china colored green representing 50 spain colored blue green representing 30 mexico colored light blue representing 20 argentina colored dark blue representing below 5 of strontium world production three major producers of strontium as celestine as of 2015 are china 150 000 t spain 90 000 t and mexico 70 000 t argentina 10 000 t and morocco 2 500 t are smaller producers although strontium deposits occur widely in united states they have not been mined since 1959 a large proportion of mined celestine srso4 is converted to carbonate by two processes either celestine is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or celestine is roasted with coal to form sulfide second stage produces a dark coloured material containing mostly strontium sulfide this so called black ash is dissolved in water and filtered strontium carbonate is precipitated from strontium sulfide solution by introduction of carbon dioxide sulfate is reduced to sulfide by carbothermic reduction srso4 2 c srs 2 co2 about 300 000 tons are processed in this way annually metal is produced commercially by reducing strontium oxide with aluminium strontium is distilled from mixture strontium metal can also be prepared on a small scale by electrolysis of a solution of strontium chloride in molten potassium chloride sr2 2 sr 2 cl cl2 2 applications thumb cathodic monitor front panel made from strontium and barium oxide containing glass this application used to consume most of world s production of strontium consuming 75 of production primary use for strontium is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes where it prevents x ray emission this application for strontium is declining because crts are being replaced by other display methods this decline has a significant influence on mining and refining of strontium all parts of crt must absorb x rays in neck and funnel of tube lead glass is used for this purpose but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to interaction of x rays with glass therefore front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb x rays average values for glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8 5 strontium oxide and 10 barium oxide because strontium is so similar to calcium it is incorporated in bone all four stable isotopes are incorporated in roughly same proportions they are found in nature however actual distribution of isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another thus analyzing bone of an individual can help determine region it came from this approach helps to identify ancient migration patterns and origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites 87sr 86sr ratios are commonly used to determine likely provenance areas of sediment in natural systems especially in marine and fluvial environments 1969 showed that surface sediments of atlantic displayed 87sr 86sr ratios that could be regarded as bulk averages of 87sr 86sr ratios of geological terranes from adjacent landmasses a good example of a fluvial marine system to which sr isotope provenance studies have been successfully employed is river nile mediterranean system due to differing ages of rocks that constitute majority of blue and white nile catchment areas of changing provenance of sediment reaching river nile delta and east mediterranean sea can be discerned through strontium isotopic studies such changes are climatically controlled in late quaternary more recently 87sr 86sr ratios have also been used to determine source of ancient archaeological materials such as timbers and corn in chaco canyon new mexico 87sr 86sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations strontium aluminate is frequently used in glow in dark toys as it is chemically and biologically inert alt red fireworks thumb upright strontium salts are added to fireworks in order to create red colors strontium carbonate and other strontium salts are added to fireworks to give a deep red colour this same effect identifies strontium cations in flame test fireworks consume about 5 of world s production macmillan j paul park jai won rolf wagner heinz kohler karl and peter 2002 strontium and strontium compounds in ullmann s encyclopedia of industrial chemistry wiley vch weinheim strontium carbonate is used in manufacturing of hard magnets strontium chloride is sometimes used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth one popular brand includes 10 total strontium chloride hexahydrate by weight small amounts are used in refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities metal itself has a limited use as a getter to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them although barium may also be used for this purpose greenwood and earnshaw p 111 ultra narrow optical transition between kr 1s0 electronic ground state and metastable kr excited state of 87sr is one of leading candidates for future re definition of second in terms of an optical transition as opposed to current definition derived from a microwave transition between different hyperfine ground states of 133cs current optical atomic clocks operating on this transition already surpass precision and accuracy of current definition of second radioactive strontium 89sr is active ingredient in a radiopharmaceutical used for bone pain secondary to metastatic bone cancer strontium is processed like calcium by body preferentially incorporating it into bone at sites of increased osteogenesis this localization focuses radiation exposure on cancerous lesion thumb rtgs from soviet era lighthouses 90sr has been used as a power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs 90sr produces approximately 0 93 watts of heat per gram it is lower for form of 90sr used in rtgs which is strontium fluoride however 90sr has one third lifetime and a lower density than 238pu another rtg fuel main advantage of 90sr is that it is cheaper than 238pu and is found in nuclear waste soviet union deployed nearly 1000 of these rtgs on its northern coast as a power source for lighthouses and meteorology stations biological role a relatively large group of marine radiolarian protozoa produce intricate mineral skeletons composed of strontium sulfate in biological systems calcium is substituted in a small extent by strontium in human body most of absorbed strontium is deposited in bones ratio of strontium to calcium in human bones is between 1 1000 and 1 2000 roughly in same range as in blood serum effect on human body human body absorbs strontium as if it were its lighter congener calcium because elements are chemically very similar stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day in adults strontium consumed tends to attach only to surface of bones but in children strontium can replace calcium in mineral of growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems biological half life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days 1000 days 18 years 30 years and at an upper limit 49 years wide ranging published biological half life figures are explained by strontium s complex metabolism within body however by averaging all excretion paths overall biological half life is estimated to be about 18 years elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected by age and sex due to differences in bone metabolism drug strontium ranelate aids bone growth increases bone density and lessens incidence of vertebral peripheral and hip fractures however strontium ranelate also increases risk of venous thromboembolism pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction its use is therefore now restricted its beneficial effects are also questionable since increased bone density is partially caused by increased density of strontium over calcium which it replaces strontium also bioaccumulates in body despite restrictions on strontium ranelate strontium is still contained in some supplements there is not much scientific evidence on risks of strontium chloride when taken by mouth those with a personal or family history of blood clotting disorders are advised to avoid strontium strontium has been shown to inhibit sensory irritation when applied topically to skin topically applied strontium has been shown to accelerate recovery rate of epidermal permeability barrier skin barrier see also references bibliography external links webelements com strontium strontium at periodic table of videos
