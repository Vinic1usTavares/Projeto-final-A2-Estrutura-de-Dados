sidney george barnes 5 june 1916 16 december 1973 was an australian cricketer and cricket writer who played 13 test matches between 1938 and 1948 able to open innings or bat down order barnes was regarded as one of australia s finest batsmen in period immediately following second world war he helped create an enduring record when scoring 234 in second test against england at sydney in december 1946 exactly same score as his captain don bradman in process setting a world record 405 run fifth wicket partnership barnes averaged 63 05 over 19 innings in a career that like those of most of his contemporaries was interrupted by second world war he made his first class debut at end of 1936 37 season when selected for new south wales and was later included in team for 1938 australian tour of england making his test debut in final international of series on resumption of test cricket after war he was picked as opening partner to arthur morris barnes was a member of invincibles 1948 australian team that toured england without losing a single match retiring from cricket at end of that tour barnes attempted a comeback to test cricket in 1951 52 season that was ultimately and controversially unsuccessful as a convention cricket seasons are denoted as a single year to represent northern hemisphere summer or dashed for southern hemisphere see cricket season for more information barnes had a reputation as an eccentric and was frequently subject of controversy this included a celebrated libel case following his exclusion from national team in 1951 52 for reasons other than cricket ability he was later involved in an incident where acting as twelfth man he performed his duties on ground in a suit and tie rather than whites carrying a bizarre range of superfluous items despite this reputation barnes was a shrewd businessman who used opportunities afforded by cricket to supplement his income through trading journalism and property development increasing paranoia brought about by bipolar disorder saw barnes lose many of friends he had made through game as he sought treatment for his depression on 16 december 1973 he was found dead at his home in sydney suburb of collaroy he had ingested barbiturates and bromide in a probable suicide early years barnes was born in 1916 in annandale an inner suburb of sydney smith p 3 was born in annandale on 5 june 1916 she christened him sidney george after city of his birth and his maternal grandfather sid s place of birth would remain a problem for many years to come he always thought it was charters towers in queensland and said so in his autobiography he also confessed confusion over year citing 1918 or 1919 rather than 1916 however in his autobiography he claims to have been born in 1918 or 1919 in queensland barnes p 13 and his military service record has his date of birth as 5 june 1917 military service record national archives he was third child of alfred percival barnes and hilda may barnes nee jeffery both from farming families near tamworth in northern new south wales after marrying couple left tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near in north queensland before sid was born alfred died from typhoid fever caused by drinking contaminated water on family property after his death hilda widowed and pregnant with her latest child moved to sydney with her children and stayed with her sister where sid was born from her husband s estate hilda barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in stanmore and leichhardt new south wales to let or sell later in life barnes would recount how as a child he used to collect rents for his mother smith pp 2 3 childhood and club cricket thumb left barnes aged 16 as a petersham player barnes attended stanmore public school and although not a scholar was a keen participant in sporting activities smith p 5 his introduction to cricket came via his older brother horrie horrie was a useful batsman who played in local western suburbs churches league and paid sid sixpence to bowl to him after he finished work taking an interest in game sid had trials for school team and was eventually selected in first xi an early controversy saw barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an umpire s decision smith p 10 successes for both his school team and his local club team st augustine saw him acquire nickname governor general nickname of australian test player charlie macartney and he was selected for new south wales schoolboys to play teams from victoria and queensland in 1932 33 barnes joined petersham club and began playing in third xi former test batsman tommy andrews became his mentor at club and in 1933 34 barnes made his first grade cricket debut as a batsman wicket keeper against paddington facing bowling of hunter hendry and alan mcgilvray smith pp 11 13 he was soon successful scoring a century against manly in february even as a young and inexperienced cricketer he showed a brash confidence in his own ability when praised for his batting by great test bowler bill o reilly barnes responded thanks very much you didn t bowl too badly yourself leaving o reilly speechless smith p 13 this success led barnes to consider cricket as a potential career however his mother and stepfather were concerned about likelihood of cricket providing him with a living in response barnes took a job with a garage in mosman but after finding that necessary travel interfered too much with playing cricket he found alternative employment demonstrating motorbikes in city smith pp 13 14 first class cricket barnes had come to attention of new south wales selectors by 1936 37 season and was included as twelfth man in side to play visiting english side taking a catch on boundary to dismiss stan worthington smith p 15 he made his first class debut in final sheffield shield match of season against south australia at sydney cricket ground smith pp 7 8 batting at number five barnes scored 31 and 44 twice being dismissed lbw by leg spinner frank ward whilst fielding barnes managed to find himself in controversy again running out vic richardson opposition captain after end of over was called square leg umpire had not heard call of over and upheld appeal much to disgust of richardson new south wales captain stan mccabe whom barnes idolised withdrew appeal barnes was selected for new south wales for opening match of 1937 38 season against queensland making 68 in a rain affected match against touring new zealanders barnes fell just short of his maiden first class century scoring 97 smith pp 17 18 he appeared to have reached landmark when scoring 127 not out against western australia but new south wales cricket association retrospectively deemed match to be not of first class status angering barnes he finally scored his maiden first class century 110 against victoria in final game of season completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on jaw by a ball delivered by ernie mccormick smith p 20 as a result of his performances over season scoring over 800 runs averaging 50 56 barnes was selected as youngest member of australian cricket team to tour england in 1938 smith p 21 test cricket thumb cigarette card showing barnes as a new south wales representative pre war debut unfortunately for barnes he broke his wrist while exercising on sea voyage to england for 1938 tour keeping injury secret until tourists had departed gibraltar for fear of being sent home smith p 26 quoting barnes i had jog trotted six times around ship morning we were due to land in gibraltar and i started stretching exercises i leapt to catch steel rope running across deck to hold up sun awnings but early morning mist had made slippery and i couldn t hold it i slipped back and in falling threw out my left hand to break fall i fell with all my weight on left hand smith continues a few hours later pain increased and hand started to swell he said nothing just in case there was a ship in gibraltar on its way back to australia on arrival in england he therefore did not play an innings until last day of june missing exactly half of 30 first class matches scheduled for tour including first two tests both of which were drawn his first innings was 42 against derbyshire and he shared in a fourth wicket stand of 176 with bill brown who made an unbeaten 265 third test was a wash out and he was not picked for fourth which australians won although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper having deputised for ben barnett in that role in tour matches against warwickshire and nottinghamshire barnes p 78 in event his test debut came in final test played at oval barnes had to field for 16 hours as england amassed a total of 903 for seven declared then highest test score barnes bowled 38 overs in innings and took seventh wicket that of arthur wood for 84 runs with both don bradman and jack fingleton injured and unable to bat australia struggled england won by an innings and 579 runs still largest winning margin in test cricket history but barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and according to wisden well justified his choice in all first class matches on tour barnes scored 720 runs and reached 90 three times though without going on to a first class century he scored 140 in a two day match against durham which was not considered first class his international career was then put on hold as all foreign tours were suspended during second world war he continued to play first class cricket in australia before enlisting in second australian imperial force in may 1942 barnes s time in military was short a man who was proud of his appearance he had a uniform made to measure when one issued did not fit he met champion golfer norman von nida early into his enlistment and two were assigned to 1st armoured division in greta a shortage of tanks and military regimen led to boredom and barnes used his hitherto ignored trade background to his advantage seeking a release to join a tank making company which was granted von nida and barnes remained friends and business partners for many years afterwards smith p 47 post war series after scoring 1 050 runs including six centuries at an average of 75 00 in 1940 41 season barnes played little cricket until 1945 46 when he scored centuries in five successive matches for new south wales he was picked for 1945 46 australian tour of new zealand and played in representative match that was later designated as first test match between two countries he made 54 as australia won easily post war period also saw a new approach to batting on part of barnes he discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot making and re invented himself as a watchful more defensive player which made his scoring more prolific although less crowd pleasing barnes was made captain of new south wales for 1946 47 australian season though he only managed to play three matches for state team one of those was match against touring mcc team and barnes was approached during match about becoming an opening batsman for forthcoming test series he wrote in his autobiography i had never opened before and was a little dubious i had however struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that barnes p 115 barnes does not identify who it was that approached him he also liked idea of batting ahead of bradman in batting order much better i thought to get in before him than to come later like flat beer after champagne barnes was first choice as an opener with arthur morris throughout test series although it was not until third test that they had a first wicket partnership of any substance morris had broken into team as an opener after an injury sidelined bill brown for entire season first test at brisbane was dominated by australia a pattern that was to be a feature of series although barnes contributed only 31 to total of 645 which brought an innings victory barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm he got a huge block of ice out of tub in which our drinks were kept staggered to side of dressing room and tossed it on to roof over english dressing room it caused a noise for a start that brought all englishmen running and then it came over side of gutter crashed on to lawn and down grass those english eyes certainly did stand out barnes p 117 bradman had words with barnes after this match about his new role as an opener barnes later wrote he asked me how i liked it i said it suited me you batted very well in this game he said but not quite as an opener you were looking for runs all time i think what you want to watch as an opener is not getting out what is needed from my openers and is most important is patience and plenty of it i was completely willing to be guided by anything that bradman wanted me to do barnes p 118 years later barnes wrote about effect this had on his batting style there was one angle about this change of batting position that didn t appeal to me i am by nature a forcing batsman i like to take shine out of a bowler sic and i love to hear ball rattling pickets or soaring over fence my footwork was quick and i often caused delight by stepping back feet outside leg stump and square cutting if i were to become an australian test opening batsman i would have to conform to standard i would have to put up shutters and so i came to second test in sydney ready to drape myself in gloomy colors of a test opening batsman barnes pp 121 122 thumb bradman and barnes leave field for an adjournment as both head towards 234 it was during second test at sydney in december 1946 that barnes made a lasting impression on world game having opened innings he made his top test score of 234 and helped to set a world record 405 run fifth wicket partnership with don bradman a record that still stands today on a rain affected pitch arthur morris was out at 1 24 and ian johnson came out as a nightwatchman he and barnes angered crowd by launching into a series of bad light appeals up to 12 were counted before umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare 33 clif cary cricket controversy test matches in australia 1946 47 t werner laurie ltd 1948 this ensured that australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket and allowed bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on monday after series barnes said on radio we could have played on but it was a test match and we just had to win i realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost so i appealed after every second ball i complained of people moving about light and in fact anything in an effort to get appeal upheld hammond and yardley were inspecting wet pitch i knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so i just kept on appealing until umpires answered me p32 clif cary cricket controversy test matches in australia 1946 47 t werner laurie ltd 1948 barnes played carefully on still suspect pitch following day and late in afternoon bradman lower in order than usual due to a leg injury joined barnes with score at 4 159 score given in australian convention i e four wickets down with score at 159 over six and a half hours later bradman was out for 234 barnes was dismissed just four balls later also for 234 having batted for over ten hours in his autobiography barnes stated that coincidence of scores was intended lots of people have asked me whether i deliberately threw my wicket away at 234 answer is yes barnes p 125 he confirmed to an interviewer many years later that it wouldn t be right for someone to make more runs than sir donald bradman e w swanton wrote that this could well have been so for he was a man of quixotic mood and temperament p63 e w swanton swanton in australia with mcc 1946 1975 fontana collins 1975 however england bowler alec bedser wrote it was when i was bowling to sid at sydney that i first discovered that i could move ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers i held ball in same manner as a leg break bowler with fingers across seam and on pitching i was surprised to see ball go away like a leg break it also surprised sid barnes pp7 8 alec bedser may s men in australia m c c tour 1958 59 stanley paul 1959 this would make barnes first batsman to be dismissed by bedser s special ball which would claim bradman for a duck in fourth test at adelaide barnes injured his hand during fielding practice before third test and although he went on to play in that game scoring 45 and 32 he opted out of batting in a state game according to his autobiography this cost him new south wales captaincy barnes p 127 and he missed fourth test he returned for final test and top scored with 71 in australia s first innings adding 30 in second barnes went to england in 1947 in his autobiography he claimed that he went as a representative for a wine and spirits company although after initial mention of that there is no further word and he appears also to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply because of rationing in england barnes pp 139 147 once in england he was approached by burnley to play as a professional in lancashire league cricket which he did for a while before finding it too much of a drag and resigning barnes pp 146 barnes returned to australia for 1947 48 season keen to win a place on 1948 tour to england he was worried that having played as a professional in lancashire league would damage his chance of further test cricket but at same time suggested that he had offers from other lancashire league teams to fall back on should he not be picked there was also concern that with his wife now living in scotland he would breach australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with test cricketers barnes pp 151 158 in fact lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to barnes s continued test career arriving back with several state games having already been played he failed to make runs for new south wales and was not picked for first two tests against indian tourists bill brown taking over as opener with morris match between victoria and new south wales was barnes s chance to redeem himself wisden reported it thus barnes needed a score to rehabilitate himself in eyes of test selectors and he spent all saturday over 131 runs while 20 000 impatient spectators barracked loudly his dismissal on third day evoked cheers all round ground he followed that century 158 in total with a similarly plodding 80 not out in second innings and was picked for third test with brown dropped after a series of low scores in first two tests barnes made only 12 and 15 jeopardising his place but what wisden termed another of his dour determined but faultless innings for top score in new south wales game against south australia ensured a second chance in fourth test at adelaide he made 112 and put on 236 with bradman for second wicket with 33 in final match of series his place on 1948 tour was secure though he had to give assurances about amount of contact he would have with his wife still living in scotland before he was confirmed barnes p 158 invincibles tour 1948 australia team that toured england has become known as invincibles because they did not lose a single game following their performances during australian season barnes and morris were favoured as australia s first choice opening pair while brown batted out of position in middle order in first two tests before second test at lord s barnes wagered ps8 at 15 1 on himself to score a century he made a duck in first innings but ensured success in second making 141 barnes and morris shared century opening partnerships at lord s and oval where their 117 run stand dwarfed 52 all out made by entire england team in addition to his century at lord s barnes made three other scores over 60 in series when fielding barnes stationed himself as close to bat as possible at either forward short leg or point report of tour in 1949 edition of wisden cricketers almanack stated that barnes s fielding was as important a factor as his batting in invincibles success probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on bowler running up but equally important was fact that knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction barnes demeanour in field illustrated general of australians preston 1949 pp 240 241 however he received criticism for this approach and it resulted in him missing fourth test at headingley through injury in england s first innings of third test he was hit in ribs by a full blooded pull shot from dick pollard from bowling of ian johnson and had to be carried from pitch by four policemen following day he collapsed while practising in nets and when he went in to bat at number six he collapsed again and had to retire hurt after this he was taken to hospital where he spent 10 days before rejoining tour for derbyshire match that followed fourth test barnes thus played in four of five tests missing fourth test through injury he scored 329 runs averaging 82 25 during first class tour matches barnes s performance was less spectacular in all first class matches on tour he amassed 1354 runs averaging 56 41 barnes made 176 in 255 minutes against surrey early in tour but apart from his test hundred his only other century came in final tour match when final 50 runs of his 151 against h d g leveson gower xi at scarborough cricket festival came in just 25 minutes preston 1949 p 258 later playing career thumb barnes plays a practical joke by using a miniature bat in bradman s testimonial match an important concern for barnes when returning from united kingdom to australia was to avoid paying customs duties on enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during tour this included good quality english cloth in very short supply in australia at this time hearing a rumour that customs officials were waiting in sydney for him barnes disembarked at melbourne and travelled to sydney by train move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee smith p 130 barnes played in bradman s testimonial match at mcg in december 1948 but otherwise made himself unavailable for first class cricket preferring to pursue business interests he wrote a regular column for sydney s daily telegraph prosaically titled like it or lump it in which he often criticised administration of game and amounts paid to australia s leading cricketers haigh and frith pp 107 111 barnes was one of a number of cricket writers of immediate post war era who adopted a confrontational tabloid style of journalism in contrast to more sedate reporting of 1930s harte pp 401 402 libel case thumb barnes and his legal representative outside venue of their libel case at beginning of 1951 52 season barnes had a change of heart and returned to new south wales team in a bid to play test cricket again he approached aubrey oxlade chairman of australian cricket s board of control to ask if there was any impediment to his return to australian team oxlade told barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances during his absence from test team australian selectors had been unsuccessful in their attempts to find a reliable partner for arthur morris to open batting barnes started season solidly and in last match before team for third test against west indies was chosen he hit 107 against victoria selectors duly picked him for match then passed team list to board of control for ratification board vetoed inclusion of barnes and requested nomination of a replacement player unwilling to accept blame for barnes s omission selectors deliberately deferred their decision on replacement when team was not announced at scheduled time journalists uncovered story and barnes became a cause celebre for many weeks missing all of remaining tests speculation abounded as to nature of his supposed misdeeds these included jumping turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player s pass insulting royal family theft from team mates drunkenness and stealing a car harte pp 422 423 board of control had granted themselves power to exclude a player from national team on grounds other than cricket ability following poor behaviour of some members of 1912 team that toured england harte p 256 they had a secret dossier compiled during season documenting barnes s behaviour and they doctored minutes of meeting at which they discussed his selection publicly board remained silent on their policy and how it related to barnes on field barnes responded with an innings of 128 in three hours against queensland off field he sought answers from administrators but was frustrated by their evasiveness his form tapered off during closing stages of season and he finished with 433 first class runs at an average of 39 36 just as furore appeared to have died down in april 1952 sydney s daily mirror published a letter from a reader jacob raith smith p 155 jacob raith a master baker cricket lover from sid s own suburb of stanmore and a former president of petersham cricket club it continues down same page rather than support player whom he did not know despite their associations with same area he decided to back board responding to a letter in support of barnes raith sided with board and suggested that his character was to blame for omission acting on legal advice barnes sued raith for libel and engaged sydney s leading barrister jack shand kc as counsel case began in sydney s district court on 21 august 1952 shand s examination of various board members appearing for defendant revealed board s maladministration pettiness and its acceptance of rumour as fact no firm reason was put forward for omission of barnes and a division within board was evident when several of its members spoke highly of him as barnes began his testimony on second day of proceedings raith s counsel announced settlement of case and commented to court seldom in history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly barnes was vindicated with a full public apology although court case portrayed an awful image of chaos and bigotry under which australian cricket was administered it did little to alter board s culture next major court case involving australian cricket world series cricket challenges of 1977 78 demonstrated that board was still run as a closed shop over 25 years later in an analysis of barnes libel case gideon haigh wrote far from becoming a watershed in player administrator relations it may even have discouraged players contemplating defiance of board but lacking wherewithal to retain a criminal barrister twelfth man incident thumb right barnes as twelfth man dressed in suit and tie and carrying cigars iced towels a mirror and comb a radio and a clothes brush resuming for new south wales in 1952 53 barnes scored 152 against victoria in last match before beginning of test series against south africa nevertheless selectors overlooked him for first test and in following state match against south australia at adelaide oval barnes offered to act as twelfth man to provide an opportunity for a younger player ray during a drinks break on second day of match he appeared on ground in a suit and tie rather than whites carrying superfluous items such as cigars iced towels a mirror and comb a radio and a clothes brush crowd initially responded well to joke but their mood soured when interval extended beyond its scheduled time and barnes received criticism for delaying game south australian team captained by australian selector phil ridings officially complained to new south wales cricket association nswca which asked barnes to express regret over incident despite association s support for barnes during his problems of previous season he prevaricated eventually nswca forwarded a written apology on his behalf barnes appeared just once more for new south wales against south africa at new year 1953 then made himself unavailable for selection conceding that his card had been marked australian team toured england in 1953 and lost ashes after holding them for 19 years barnes wrote eyes on ashes a book about tour that included trenchant criticism of behaviour of australian team which did not go down well with some of his former team mates style and personality barnes gripped bat very low on handle and bent over so far in his stance that knuckles of his right hand were level with his knees he stood with his heels almost together and toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover which left him open chested when facing bowler a noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow swinging delivery and play it late if necessary robinson p 78 his first movement was back and across crease to cover stumps from view of bowler putting him in position to play hook leg glance sweep and his favourite square cut shot all of these terms are included in list of cricket terms journalist ray robinson called barnes artful dodger of cricket alluding to both his batting style and his off field business dealings and wrote that he would rather steal a run like a pickpocket than hit an honest four with a straightforward stroke robinson p 76 robinson summarised his safety first approach in going so far back as bowler delivered though this routine made his play air tight in one way it simplified opposing captains field placing to curb his scoring it left him with a back foot addict s liability to go leg before wicket or be caught behind on either side and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length he could have made more runs since war as a stroke player and won popular backing as a candidate for title of world s best batsman instead of austere distinction of looking hardest australian to get out robinson p 79 david frith wrote of bill brown s memories of barnes as a person and his controversial fielding barnes was also bill s room mate and his affection for his late lamented pal a lovable rogue was obvious he recalled furore over barnes s provocative field positioning extremely close at silly mid on and how criticism of his foot being too close to mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a couple of feet into forbidden territory and a couple of feet more when english crowd roared at him he was a part time leg break bowler taking 57 wickets in first class cricket at a useful average of 32 21 cashman pp 14 15 barnes s leg break spun very little but he had a topspinner which hurried onto batsman and yielded him many wickets barnes was also a substitute wicket keeper and a versatile fieldsman during his career he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires on 1948 tour of england after an australian appeal was turned down by umpire alec skelding he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to skelding stating now all you want is a white stick a complex character barnes rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn stocky with blue eyes and powerful wrists he had a passion for physical fitness and was an enthusiastic big game fisherman and golfer life outside cricket thumb barnes in later life barnes married a schoolteacher alison margaret edward on 11 june 1942 alison was daughter of kenneth edward a scottish professor of theology at university of sydney couple met at a country dance when barnes on his way back from an exhibition match in katoomba was bet price of meal that he could not get young girl to dance with him within twelve months pair were married smith p 44 outside of cricket barnes followed his mother into property development see above and at various times entered into partnerships with keith miller and norman von nida his suspicious nature which grew as time passed saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations while barnes was not a millionaire he was a successful and organised businessman smith pp 195 196 as a writer barnes had no claims to literary talent his copy was ghost written in all likelihood by his friend jack tier and later by former professional rugby league footballer peter peters smith pp 185 186 his writing was of a provocative tone his column in daily express during 1953 tour was called aussie they couldn t gag his forthright opinions certainly cost him friends and hardened opinions of others about him smith pp 183 184 at end of 1953 tour he published eyes on ashes and his autobiography it isn t cricket he also wrote ashes ablaze in 1955 and turned to full time writing mostly for sydney s daily telegraph his columns were perceived as being deliberately controversial and as time went by increasingly regarded as in later life barnes suffered from depressive illness he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with a combination of medication mainly diazepam and electroconvulsive therapy he spent much of his last years in and out of clinics seeking treatment for his condition smith pp 204 205 in 1973 barnes died at his home in collaroy one of sydney s northern beach suburbs from barbiturate and bromide poisoning although medications were certainly self administered coroner could not determine intent statistical analysis only six players with ten or more completed innings have achieved an end of career average in excess of 60 barnes s 63 05 in 19 innings ranks him as number three in history of test cricket behind sir donald bradman 99 94 80 innings and stewie dempster 65 72 15 innings there is no consensus within cricket on what is appropriate minimum number of innings required when comparing career averages to avoid statistical quirks caused by players of very short careers andy ganteaume for example played just one test and scored a century in cricinfo s statistical analysis of leading career averages barnes is omitted for having played just 19 rather than minimum of 20 innings likewise there is no consensus on omitting current players something which is done because when comparing career performances most players experience a fall off in average toward end of their career cricinfo includes current players including one mike hussey whose career average in december 2007 exceeded that of barnes barnes s short career was dominated by his monumental double hundred but he was a consistent performer as chart left reveals age did not seem to diminish his abilities in his last eight test innings aged 31 32 he passed 50 five times and scored two of his three test hundreds thumb left 300px sid barnes s test batting performances red bars indicate runs that he scored in an innings with blue line indicating batting average in his last ten innings blue dots indicate an innings where he remained not out comparing players from test cricket is an exercise usually flawed by different conditions rules of day and oppositions faced however a useful comparison can be made between barnes and bradman because they were contemporaries in same team bradman is generally acknowledged as greatest batsman of all time fully a third better statistically than next best man in history see completed career averages chart right barnes and bradman played together in three series there was also a fourth 1938 ashes but barnes played only one test in those series barnes s averages bear comparison to bradman s particularly in more ashes series barnes bradman english cricket team in australia in 1946 47 73 83 97 14 indian cricket team in australia in 1947 48 43 00 178 75 australian cricket team in england in 1948 82 25 72 57 another way of viewing a player s performance without distortion is by using world rankings which have been applied retrospectively to assess careers of past players however ratings employ a measure to damp down oscillation of points of new players because barnes played only 19 test innings his performances are weighted to just under 85 of their full value consequently even in his own day he is rated as no better than seventh in world at his peak test match performance batting bowling opposition matches runs average high score 100 50 runs wickets
