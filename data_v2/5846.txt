to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode five stars out of five calling it extremely well performed by all concerned shearman and pearson felt that episode was similar to earlier per manum and was somewhat formulaic however they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining series after changes made in its last two seasons explaining point of all this is only to emphasise how different x files universe now feels familiarity of ingredients only making us more aware that mix is never going to be same again shearman and pearson pp 243 244 writing for television without pity jessica morgan rated episode a b although she felt that by this stage series mythology was moving in concentric circles of pain and confusion zack handlen of a v club awarded episode a b and wrote that episode finds duchovny back on his feet and ready for action and he brings a new energy to part he enjoyed way show presented story as one wherein we spend as much time watching mulder from outside as we do seeing events from his perspective because it makes things interesting handlen also wrote that while episode did not hit emotional notes that its predecessor deadalive did it was nonetheless stronger plotwise and built to an inevitable conclusion in classic x files style not all reviews were positive tom kessenich in his book examinations gave episode a mixed review writing this was an episode that had tremendous promise and carter and spotnitz almost got it right sadly they failed to invest themselves fully and intelligently into mulder s return kessenich p 169 paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a largely negative review and awarded it one and a half stars out of four vitaris wrote that despite opening with tremendously affecting acting from david duchovny episode lapses into a lost opportunity to explore psyche of a person who has suffered torture notes footnotes bibliography external links three words at tv com category 2001 american
