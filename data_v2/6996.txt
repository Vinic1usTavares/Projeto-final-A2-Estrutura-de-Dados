from album gaga explained artpop is really an inferno and it s only song on record that i didn t really wanna go anywhere or explode or orgasm because then it would just be like composing something that would be just like every other sort of orgasm that i ve ever had and because its really center of record i really wanted there to be a more infinite tone to this concept of art pop that we can put art in front and not have corporate world to control in art anymore how can we artist back our ideas and for our visions to be most important thing thing that s driving culture driving these corporations i didn t wanted artpop to grow too much i wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra recording and composition initial recording sessions for artpop coincided with born this way ball gaga spent majority of her recording time on artpop with white shadow but she did not want final version to be edited further unlike her other songs song was recorded at record plant studios hollywood california by dave russell and benjamin lader with lader and daniel zaidenstadt also working as assistants during final mix russell also did mixing of track for track at record

spanning tonal nodes of f3 to a4 song follows a basic sequence of dm gm f c as its chord progression thumb left song was recorded at record plant studios in hollywood california in a review for billboard jason lipshutz described artpop as gaga s manifesto about her creativity calling it a lurching electro jazz beast who s beats became louder and complex as it reached climax consisting of strings techno song has a beat similar to selena gomez s 2011 single love you like a love song with its electronic composition and a groove comparable to singer kylie minogue s 2001 hit single can t get you out of my head interspersed between are computerized musical sounds and chorus which has a coo ing accompanied with main vocals like michael jackson and was described by kevin harley from independent as sleek eurodisco artpop s lyrics have been deduced to be a statement about subjectivity of art it begins with singer uttering lines come to me with all your subtext of fantasy line being an indicative of enigma around her according to huffington post gaga explained lyrics were a metaphor about love with chorus line we could belong together artpop she believed that if her fans and herself could be together that would probably mean a bonding for art and pop too on contrary jim farber from new york daily news believed that love relationship was sidelined for that between art and pop with lyrics there are other dimensions to lyrics with gaga playing off her image of self promotion and criticisms directed at her with line i try to sell myself but i am really laughing because i just want music not bling in a review for artpop simon chandler from tiny mix tapes gave a detailed analysis of lyrical composition according to him gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with artpop but it appeared to be arrogant since most of conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage chandler believed that lyrics wanted to drive home a point about gaga being center for any discussion with previous lyrics implication is that gaga s impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to general crowd and primarily fuels public interest in her release and reception a teaser for artpop was previewed as part of snippets from parent album until its final release on november 11 2013 a not safe for work

images for her interview with v magazine and artwork for promotional single dope gaga shows a range of emotion in film including caressing a mannequin and applying dirt on her body but most of time she simply stares towards camera rivera from new york daily news expressed her difficulty in understanding film but added that hypnotic musical backdrop of her single artpop perfectly matches artsy bewildering and even disturbing images that run through fast and slow editing gaga admitted that she had performed for 12 hours while making film track received mixed reviews from music critics mike wass from idolator called it an obtuse synth track believing composition to be ingenious or pretentious and felt that gaga s endeavors kept pop music scene interesting evan sawdey from popmatters believed that vibe of previous track on album do what u want carried off to artpop which he described as strange and hypnotic and best thing on parent album harley listed artpop as one of more aurally pleasurable tracks from album calling it a standout track andrew barker from variety compared gaga s vocals to those of debbie harry with their cold disposition emily from nme called song slow and sexy believing that line my artpop could mean anything referred to trivial concept of album itself critic greg kot from chicago tribune believed that artpop was only song on album where there was a hint of what actual composition of over all record should have been justin miller from harper s bazaar called song more intimate that previous tracks in album but felt it was a techno ballad and most diffused composition for gaga negative reviews came from holly williams of contactmusic com who was extremely disappointed with track williams felt a rapid decline in quality of music with title track which she believed should have been climactic inventive and a little bit trippy with such a title but found its tempo to be slow and mundane maura johnson from spin felt that lyrics like i just love music not bling appeared insincere on gaga s behalf since her career graph showed that singer was more infatuated with fame in 21st century not deepest statement but also not that unique to new millennium johnson concluded los angeles timess mikael wood believed that line was not something that worked in a pop record and believed that along with first single applause gaga s ideas seemed unattainable and not exciting john walker from mtv news rated it two out of five stars calling it boring chris bossman from consequence of sound compared composition of track to a dying old school war melinda newman from hitfix called song too quirky and felt that it could only be successful if remixed properly robert copsey from digital spy believed that chorus line my artpop could mean anything made concept of album all more confusing instead of simplifying gaga s brash statements about her musical outputs ericka welch from huffington post called song as pretentious and least interesting endeavor on album she believed that artpop failed to embody concept of album and was plagued with same inconsequential lyrics that was visible during her born this way era she concluded by giving example like a mad scientist trying to create life gaga s experiment to fuse art and pop sometimes results in overly ambitious deformities with six legs live performances thumb upright gaga performing
