manga reminiscent of romantic comedy film simply irresistible 1999 and that manga contained conventional shojo aspects in a later review of second volume she described series as entertaining enough but it s fluffy and forgettable like so many of mousse items and drinks najika makes volumes already feel familiar even as i m reading them for first time mania entertainment s sakura eries expressed her lukewarm feelings towards first volume writing that reader s suspension of disbelief was vital to enjoying manga she disliked two dimensional characterization and ando s illustrations of characters although she felt that food was well drawn comparing series to others in cooking genre she wrote that it differed in that cooking is najika s expression of self and her means of creating relationships and drawing others to common ground like estranged kitazawa brothers in follow up reviews of second and third volumes she remained lukewarm to series she praised kobayashi s portrayal of akane s eating disorder though she disliked how najika s quest to find her flan prince seemed to become more of a side plot carlo santos of anime news network praised najika as a likeable protagonist and characterizations as believable he enjoyed plot and recipes although he wrote that character designs lacked creativity and criticized plot cliches and antagonists weak characterization he had mixed feelings about fourth volume s emphasis on conventional shojo romance and plot twists at cost of its cooking aspect he found artwork conventional though able to convey emotion he wrote that fifth volume finally balanced romance and cooking elements although he disliked inclusion of a side story preferring another chapter instead in his review of seventh volume he concluded this series takes elements of romance drama cooking genres and still manages to come up with something greater than sum of its parts reviews of light novel varied draper carlsen wrote that characters and premise lacked strength to make novel compelling though she felt that response of others may differ grading novel a b eries wrote that novel would appeal to fans of manga although she found story arcs varying
