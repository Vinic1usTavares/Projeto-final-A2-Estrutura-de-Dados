300 powerbook 100 was low end model of first three simultaneously released powerbooks its cpu and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor macintosh portable it had a motorola 68000 16 megahertz mhz processor 2 8 megabytes mb of memory a monochrome backlit liquid crystal display lcd with 640 x 400 pixel resolution and system 7 0 1 operating system it did not have a built in floppy

powerbook project in 1990 allocating 1 million for marketing despite small marketing budget new powerbook line was a success generating over 1 billion in revenue for apple in its first year sony designed and manufactured powerbook 100 in collaboration with apple industrial design group apple s internal design team it was discontinued on september 3 1992 and superseded by powerbook 145 and powerbook duo series since then it has been praised several times for its design pc world named powerbook 100 tenth greatest pc of all time in 2006 and us magazine mobile pc chose powerbook 100 as greatest gadget of all time in 2005 history from 1990 john sculley then ceo of apple oversaw product development personally to ensure that apple released new computers to market more quickly his new strategy was to increase market share by lowering prices and releasing more hit products this strategy contributed to commercial success of low end macintosh classic and macintosh lc desktop computers released by apple in 1990 sculley wanted to replicate success of these products with apple s new powerbook line sculley began project in 1990 and wanted powerbook to be released within one year project had three managers john medica who managed engineering for new laptop randy battat who was vice president for product marketing and neil selvin who headed marketing effort in 1991 two leaders in laptop computer industry were toshiba and compaq both of which had introduced models weighing less than medica battat and selvin deliberately designed powerbook to weigh less than its competitors sculley allocated a 1 million marketing budget to powerbook product line in contrast to 25 million used to market macintosh classic medica battat and selvin used most of money to produce and air a television commercial that viewers would remember advertising agency chiat day filmed retired los angeles lakers basketball star kareem abdul jabbar sitting uncomfortably in a small airline coach seat yet typing comfortably on his powerbook ad caption read at least his hands are comfortable apple unveiled powerbook 100 on october 21 1991 at comdex computer expo in las vegas alongside two other models powerbook 140 and powerbook 170 both advertisement and product were successful apple projected us sales of more than 200 000 powerbooks in first year with peak demand in first three months of release by january 1992 apple had sold more than 100 000 powerbooks by which time they were in short supply apple soon solved supply problems and proceeds from powerbook sales reached 1 billion in first year after launch apple surpassed toshiba and compaq as market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments carlton p 191 powerbook 100 140 and 170 contributed greatly to apple s financial success in 1992 at end of financial year apple announced its highest figures yet 7 1 billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8 to 8 5 highest it had been in four years however initial popularity of powerbook 100 did not last sales decreased and by december 1991 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers were willing to pay more for a built in floppy disk drive and second serial port which powerbook 100 lacked by august 10 1992 apple quietly dropped powerbook 100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer oriented stores such as price club in these stores a ram 40mb hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than 1 000 more than 1 500 less than similar 2mb 20mb configuration s original list price on september 17 1992 apple recalled 60 000 powerbook 100s because of a potential safety problem an electrical short it was discovered could melt a small hole in casing which occurred in three of 60 000 notebooks manufactured between october 1991 and march 1992 on day of recall apple shares closed at 47 down 1 25 but some analysts discounted recall s importance in addition original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on motherboard and computer was prone to cracks in power adapter socket on motherboard which required a 400 replacement motherboard if warranty had expired features most of powerbook 100 s internal components were based on its predecessor macintosh portable it included a motorola 16 mhz processor had 2 mb memory no floppy disk drive and cost approximately 2 300 an external floppy disk drive was available for 279 dimensions of powerbook 100 were an improvement over portable it was deep wide and high compared to portable which was deep wide and high another significant difference was less expensive passive matrix display used instead of sharper active matrix used on portable and 170 powerbook 100 included system 7 0 1 operating system as standard with support for all versions up to system 7 5 5 apple however released system 6 0 8l which allowed powerbook 100 to run system 6 it could also be used with some earlier system 6 versions although apple did not officially support this powerbook 100 had one external serial port designed for use with a printer or any compatible rs 422 device it was first macintosh to omit an external modem port instead offering an optional built in 2400 baud modem for communications as a result for first time a user could not print directly and access appletalk or a faster external modem simultaneously and devices such as advanced midi interfaces could not be used because they required dedicated use of both ports a third party serial modem port could however be installed in internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions when computer was not in use contents of memory were preserved as long as main lead acid battery remained charged powerbook 100 power manager was an integrated circuit usually placed on logic board of a powerbook and was responsible for power management of computer identical to that of macintosh portable it controlled display s backlight hard drive spin down sleep and wake battery charging trackball control and input output i o 100 did add a new feature 3 5 v batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory ram when powerbook 100 s battery was being replaced or when 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources this made it a perfect candidate for use with apple s ram disk to help increase battery life by accessing hard disk less frequently since 100 was only powerbook that maintained contents of ram on shutdown in order to reduce startup time powerbook 100 was first powerbook to incorporate scsi disk mode which allowed it to be used as an external hard disk on a desktop macintosh this provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto powerbook or transferred to desktop without need for 100 s optional floppy disk drive a specialized scsi cable with a unique connector was required however to use any scsi device on powerbook series a second dedicated cable was required for scsi disk mode this feature was unique to 100 until apple introduced new powerbooks more than a year later there are two versions of powerbook 100 s qwerty layout keyboard a domestic us version with 63 keys and an international iso version with 64 keys caps lock key on powerbook 100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status and to compensate system 7 operating system software includes an extension file that causes an icon of international caps lock symbol to appear in upper right hand corner of menu bar when caps lock is active internals of powerbook 100 were basis of apple active lifestyle telephone prototype design both powerbook 140 and 170 were designed before 100 by apple industrial design group from march 1990 february 1991 100 s styling was based on those computers and represents first improvements to powerbook line as apple benefited from lessons learned in developing more powerful models enclosure 100 was designed between september and december 1990 and retained same design elements which were a variation on snow white design language apple had been using since 1984 specifically raised ridges spaced apart intended to tie it into existing product line apple approached sony in late 1989 because it did not have enough engineers to handle number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991 using a basic blueprint from apple including a list of chips and other components and portable s architecture 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by sony in san diego california and japan sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed apple s smallest and lightest machine in under 13 months cancelling other projects and giving powerbook 100 top priority sony president norio gave project manager yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any sony division robert brunner apple s head of industrial design at time led design team that developed laptop including its trackball and granite color brunner said he designed powerbook so it would be as easy to use and carry as a regular book dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of time and also from apple s other products which traditionally were beige or platinum grey trackball another new design element was placed in middle of computer allowing powerbook to be easily operated by both left and right handed users designers were trying to create a fashion statement with overall design of laptop which they felt made it a more personal accessory like a wallet or briefcase brunner said it says something about identity of person who is carrying it reception crystal waters of home office computing praised powerbook 100 s unique effective design but was disappointed because internal modem did not receive faxes and 100 had no monitor port low capacity 20 mb hard drive was also criticized once a user s core applications had been installed little room was left for optional programs and documents waters concluded having used 100 constantly in past few weeks i know i wouldn t feel cheated by buying it if only it had a 40mb hard disk drive option pc week powerbook 100 measuring it against its predecessor macintosh portable powerbook 100 took 5 3 seconds to open a microsoft word document and 2 5 seconds to save it while portable took 5 4 and 2 6 seconds respectively pc week tested battery life which delivered 3 hours 47 minutes of use byte magazines review concluded powerbook 100 is recommended for word processing and communications tasks higher end products offer enough power for complex reports large spreadsheets and professional graphics described it as ideal for writers and others on a tight budget powerbook 100 continues to receive recognition from press pc world named powerbook 100 10th greatest pc of all time in 2006 and in 2005 us magazine mobile pc chose powerbook 100 as greatest gadget of all time ahead of sony walkman and atari 2600 powerbook 100 received multiple awards for its design including 1999 silver design of decade award form magazine s 1993 designer s design awards
