clement died 1258 was a 13th century dominican friar who was first member of dominican order in britain and ireland to become a bishop in 1233 he was selected to lead ailing diocese of dunblane in scotland and faced a struggle to bring bishopric of dunblane or bishopric of strathearn to financial viability this involved many negotiations with powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of revenue that would normally have been entitlement of clement s bishopric negotiations proved difficult forcing clement to visit papal court in rome while not achieving all of his aims clement succeeded in saving bishopric from relocation to inchaffray abbey he also regained enough revenue to begin work on new dunblane cathedral he faced a similar challenge with impoverished bishopric of argyll in 1240s he was given job of restoring viability of diocese and installing a new bishop this involved forming a close relationship with king alexander ii of scotland clement was with king during his campaign in argyll in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign in 1250 clement had been able to install a new bishop in argyll and had become one of guardians appointed to govern scotland during minority of king alexander iii by 1250 he had established a reputation as one of most active dominican reformers in britain clement helped to elevate edmund of abingdon and queen margaret to sainthood after his death he received veneration as a saint himself although he was never formally canonised early years and background thumb 250px

confined to earldoms of strathearn and menteith size was a problem for providing bishopric with adequate income a problem compounded by fact that gille brigte mormaer of strathearn had established inchaffray priory in 1200 promoted to abbey in 1221 in 1440s bower wrote that gille brigte divided his earldom into three equal portions one he gave to church and bishop of dunblane second to st john

locations see quote above see also cowan easson medieval religious houses p 204 clement visited papal court to present his difficult situation in spring 1237 pope wrote to bishop of dunkeld that bishop clement found church so desolated that there was no place in cathedral church where he could lay his head it had no college of clergy divine offices were celebrated in a roofless church and by a rural chaplain only and episcopal revenues were so slender and had been alienated to such a degree that they scarcely sufficed to support him for half a year passages from augustin theiner vetera monumenta no 91 and translated in cockburn medieval bishops of dunblane p 49 in response to clement s visit moreover pope had empowered bishops of dunkeld brechin and st andrews to take action to rescue bishopric he told these bishops that since continual care of all churches is our daily burden we grant to said church dunblane so far as we personally can and authorise you if you find situation to be as described to assign to said bishop if it can be done without scandal a quarter of teinds of all parish churches of diocese of dunblane so that under your guidance and that of upright men he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there failing this pope wrote quarter teinds of all churches of diocese assigned to bishop which are held by laymen you shall transfer with episcopal seat to canons regular of st john in diocese i e to inchaffray abbey who shall have power to elect a bishop in any vacancy so pope s help was two sided it made clement s task vis a vis these institutions easier but on other hand possibility had emerged that dunblane could

in fixed payments liable to real decline by way of inflation moreover he had to concede permanent canonries to several of abbots concessions which would give them a role in election of his successors

in relation to bishopric of argyll in 1241 argyll s last bishop william had been drowned while at sea argyll was poorest bishopric in scotland and area lacked strong royal authority and hence good

exercise control in province at same time establishing a strong bishopric in area was vital to integrating area fully into kingdom an aim cherished by contemporary king alexander ii thus alexander s goal and clement s goal were essentially one and same it is impossible to be more specific but in 1249 king alexander ii launched an expedition against eoghan king was attempting to force eoghan whose
