of ring line providing a frequent service in city centre with lower average speeds but with more stops there are major transfer points to tramway at majorstuen jernbanetorget jar storo and forskningsparken commuter train serves suburbs further away from oslo though some of commuter rail services remind of a rapid transit service in particular line l1 and line l2 to lillestrom asker and ski with higher service frequency through continual populated area of oslo transfer to railway services is available at jernbanetorget to oslo s and nationaltheatret latter with a considerably shorter walk bus services are provided to numerous stations most bus services provide feeding to metro system where possible and then do not continue into town however since metro operates solely into town instead of across it many buses operate between stations on different lines or provide alternative routes across town future expansion as part of political compromise oslo package 3 a number of changes have been decided for oslo metro expansion of furuset line to lorenskog with stations at lorenskog centre and a new terminus at akershus university hospital with travel time to jernbanetorget of 27 minutes to be opened in 2027 a second common tunnel from majorstuen to toyen creating two new stations at bislett and southern grunerlokka nybrua all lines will stop at stortinget which will get four platforms station at majorstuen will be moved underground to be opened around 2030 although not part of oslo package 3 fornebu line which has been variously proposed as a light rail metro and an automated train line since 1997 is planned to run from majorstuen to old airport area at fornebu through skoyen and lysaker a total of 6 new stations will be on this line to be opened in 2026 or 2027
