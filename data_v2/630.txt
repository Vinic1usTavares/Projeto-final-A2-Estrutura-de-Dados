east range is of late 15th century as is great hall on south side of court double height bay windows date from bodley and garner s remodelling for morgan williams alan hall describes inner court as having a peaceful and domestic appearance having been constructed in more settled tudor period under later stradlings exterior walls of inner ward are decorated with a set of terracotta medallions or busts writer simon jenkins suggests it is unclear whether they are original to castle or imported from elsewhere although architectural historian john newman records that they were in situ by 1804 they appear to be modelled on busts of emperors by giovanni da maiano at hampton court there are differing views as to provenance of medallions cadw is certain that two those said to depict marcus aurelius and cleopatra are by da maiano and were originally part of hampton court set it also suggests they could have been installed as early as 16th century alan hall agrees noting close connection between cardinal wolsey to whom pope leo x had presented them and sir thomas arundell father in law of fourth sir edward stradling newman is less definitive although he notes their varying quality and suggests that further investigation should be undertaken beside hall between inner and outer curtain walls is bradenstoke hall consisting of inner curtain wall on north side and realigned outer curtain wall on south with a modern wall on east end built at that point to fit in an early 14th century roof brought from bradenstoke priory in wiltshire western range has largely been replaced by a

spectacular views john newman considered that other developments undertaken by college although to designs of uncompromising modernity neither detract from historic castle nor impinge on its setting gardens and grounds thumb right alt garden with central path and rose beds rose garden at st donat s castle original gardens of stradlings were famous begun in tudor period by sir thomas stradling they were extended by his son sir edward stradling after a long sojourn in rome tudor stradlings also maintained two deer parks on wider estate one for red and one for fallow deer welsh poet thomas a friend of sir edward composed a tribute in latin suggesting that beauty of gardens was sufficient to encourage visits from sea god neptune and water nymph thetis gardens descend in a series of terraces to sea and give distant views across bristol channel towards devon and somerset later development in early 20th century by morgan williams saw establishment of a tudor style garden with carved heraldic beasts on pedestals this was followed by additions by hearst including a number of garden structures such as an italianate summerhouse overlooking rose garden in which he installed a telephone exchange with connections to new york and california hearst built a long outdoor swimming pool on lowest terrace on site of castle s medieval tilt yard pool was designed by allom assisted by julia morgan hearst s main architect for san simeon beyond pool site are cavalry barracks newman dates these as 17th century but both alan hall and cadw suggest a slightly earlier dating in 16th century as a response to threat of spanish invasion they were certainly converted to stabling from whence name derives in 17th century and stradlings kept their horses at barracks during civil war by 20th century barracks were in a ruinous state and hearst converted them into guest accommodation and a pool house in 1930s between 1978 and 1981 atlantic college rebuilt them in original 17th century style to serve as student accommodation college installed an indoor swimming pool and replaced allom morgan outdoor pool beyond barracks castellated sea walls and towers have their origins in 16th century but were completely reconstructed by hearst in 1920s watchtower on opposite slope to castle is also probably 16th century or possibly late 15th century and is shown in a state of completion in a view of castle dated 1740 it decayed thereafter was restored in late 19th century but is again derelict in early 21st century it was almost certainly intended as a seaward look out gardens were
