and sweated out mercury aluminium and magnesium fire department s chief medical officer dr kerry kelly criticized lack of objective evidence saying i have trouble believing in these purple stained towels an investigation by new york press asked a number of independent doctors about evidence for purification rundown none of them endorsed program s effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous several said that no peer reviewed research on rundown had been published in any medical journal some apparently supportive studies have been published but these lack control groups and have other scientific failings according to deputy fire commissioner frank gribbon doctors investigating program on behalf of fire department concluded that it was not detoxifying university of georgia bioterrorism expert cham dallas also denied that procedure could detoxify saying it sounds great and they mean well but it just doesn t work in 2007 james dahlgren and colleagues published a

polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polychlorinated in rescue workers and improvement during regime two scientists from cambridge environmental inc published a thorough critique of study they questioned premise that wtc rescue workers needed detoxification citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal paper argues that project never properly tested its outcomes and concludes that application of potentially dangerous purification rundown to health problems of 9 11 workers is unconscionable many of participants spoke favorably of

help with distress they felt in aftermath of attacks to point that they would try anything fire department officials raised concerns about project saying that firefighters were being required to give
