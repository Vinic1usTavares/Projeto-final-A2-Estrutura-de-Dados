of cadets in 1912 his class was due to be commissioned on 1 january 1916 but outbreak of first world war in august 1914 caused it to be graduated early he was commissioned as a lieutenant in both permanent military forces pmf and australian imperial force aif on 3 november 1914 on 7 november 1914 robertson married jessie bonnar in a private service at a registry office in collingwood ceremony was kept secret because at time junior officers required army s permission to marry and at age 20 robertson would not have received it later they would claim that they had been married in 1916 their marriage produced no children first world war major general william bridges decided that duntroon cadets none of whom had yet finished their training should be split up and posted to various units of aif as regimental rather than staff officers robertson was posted to 10th light horse as its machine gun officer he was one of seven members of his class in 3rd light horse brigade by end of august

for duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in aif this was result of an aif policy aimed at giving them a broad a range of experience which would benefit post war army while not allowing an accumulation of young officers of high rank for whom reduced post war army would not have sufficient posts his substantive rank remained that of lieutenant he would not be promoted to substantive rank of captain in pmf until 30 september 1920 and promotion to major would not come until 1 july 1932 at battle of magdhaba his colonel was wounded and robertson took over command of 10th light horse he was awarded distinguished service order dso for his actions during this battle distinguished service order his citation read robertson s men took many turkish prisoners including a senior officer

breveted as a lieutenant colonel in june 1936 rank became substantive in july 1937 like other regular officers robertson was opposed to singapore strategy and therefore to defence policy of government of day and said so publicly in british army quarterly robertson argued for a local defence of australia by land and air units naval theorist admiral sir herbert richmond responding to robertson s arguments in an editorial pointed out that local defence would fragment british empire s defence effort and could not secure sea lanes however in view of weakness of royal navy richmond was forced to concede that robertson s approach was not unreasonable second world war libya right thumb 300px alt six senior australian officers pose for a formal picture two are wearing slouch hats remainder are

his first command since first world war he was promoted to temporary rank of colonel in august 1939 and this became substantive in november job involved cooperation with royal australian navy and royal australian air force and administration of a company of regular soldiers known as darwin mobile force after second world war began in september 1939 robertson became responsible for supplying 7th military district s quota of volunteers for second australian imperial force aif a strike on waterfront saw robertson committing troops to help unload cargo on 4 april 1940 robertson joined second aif himself with rank of brigadier and was allocated aif service number he was appointed to command 19th infantry brigade which was then being formed from units made surplus by reduction of 6th division from 12 infantry battalions to nine all three of its battalions 2 4th 2 8th and 2 11th infantry battalions were initially commanded by over age officers but commander of 2 4th was replaced by ivan dougherty in august initially dougherty received a cool reception from robertson who was disappointed at being unable to select his own battalion commanders but dougherty soon made such a good impression that when robertson went on leave in october 1940 he recommended that dougherty act as brigade commander despite fact that he was youngest and most junior of robertson s battalion chiefs battle of bardia brought to fore simmering hostility between regular officers and reservists frank berryman 6th division s general staff officer grade 1 and alan vasey deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster general da qmg were eager for robertson to do well and show that staff corps officers could make good commanders and if that could be done at expense of an old style reservist like stanley savige so much better they pushed for robertson s 19th infantry brigade then in reserve to be committed when attack by savige s 17th infantry brigade slowed down abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between robertson and savige thumb left 300px robertson left confers with captain r i ainslie and captain greave during derna action alt three warmly dressed men in uniforms look at a map 19th infantry brigade then advanced on tobruk attack on this fortified town proceeded along similar lines to that on bardia with 16th infantry effecting a break in of position but this time 19th infantry brigade was to carry out exploitation phase robertson s contribution to plan was to increase its tempo so that attack would be carried through without pause exploitation being carried out before initial break in was complete robertson accepted surrender of fortress commander generale di corpo d armata and later admiral massimiliano vietina italian naval commander comments by a sunburnt red headed australian brigadier made headlines in britain where senior officers rarely spoke to media but did not endear robertson to his critics who felt that his ego was out of control following entry of 19th infantry brigade to benghazi on 7 february robertson declared give me two stout ships and a bearing on rome and we ll dine in hall of caesars for this campaign robertson was made a commander of order of british empire cbe commander of order of british empire but later that month he was hospitalised for varicose veins in leg he had broken in 1917 he was replaced as commander of 19th infantry brigade by alan vasey when robertson recovered he was given responsibility for training of aif reinforcements in middle east robertson s service in field and his long experience in training troops made him an ideal candidate for post for his services robertson was mentioned in despatches a third time mentioned in despatches defence of australia around time of outbreak of war with japan many senior officers with distinguished records in middle east were recalled to australia to lead militia formations and fill important staff posts one of these was robertson who was recalled to take command of 1st cavalry division in january 1942 in march 1942 an unusual event occurred major generals alan vasey and edmund herring and brigadier clive steele fearing that gordon bennett or john lavarack was about to be appointed commander in chief approached minister for army frank forde with a proposal that in view of danger of an invasion of australia all officers over age of 50 be immediately retired and robertson be appointed commander in chief this reflected an extraordinary endorsement of robertson by his colleagues but such favourable opinion was not universally held sydney rowell later explained that thumb left 300px general grant m3 medium tanks of 1st armoured division alt a line up of dozens if not hundreds of tanks revolt of generals collapsed with welcome news that blamey was returning from middle east to become commander in chief in reorganisation of army that followed robertson was appointed to command 1st armoured division initially 1st armoured division had a key role in defence of australia as a mobile reserve but it was only partly trained and equipped representing another major challenge to robertson as a trainer of troops when prospect of an invasion of australia became remote 1st armoured division was sent to western australia in january 1943 where it became part of bennett s iii corps area became a backwater and 1st armoured division was slowly broken up and then disbanded to recoup some of nation s investment in training for armoured warfare robertson arranged for 25 officers to be seconded to british 7th armoured division in europe following disbandment of 1st armoured division robertson took over command of 2nd division other division in western australia and then upon bennett s retirement iii corps in april 1944 this too was disbanded in june 1944 and robertson took over western command because army reached its greatest extent in 1942 and shrank in size thereafter blamey was faced with a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than he needed to fill them he faced public and political criticism over shelving senior officers including robertson that robertson and bennett two troublesome potential rivals of blamey s had been sent to western australia did not escape comment however it was always more likely that robertson would be one recalled nevertheless blamey had serious concerns about robertson s health after latter was hospitalised with internal haemorrhaging in july 1944 and sent to eastern states to convalesce while there he joined vasey and brigadier bertrand coombes commandant of duntroon in conducting an inquiry into future training and organisation of royal military college their report submitted to blamey in january 1945 called for a number of reforms most significant being that postings of regular officers should alternate between staff and regimental duties new guinea in april 1945 robertson returned to field replacing alan ramsay as commander of 5th division which was then engaged in final stages of new britain campaign in july robertson became commander of 6th division leading it through final days of aitape wewak campaign on 13 september 1945 robertson accepted surrender of lieutenant general hatazo adachi and his japanese eighteenth army in december 1945 robertson took over command of first army becoming one of a select number of australians to command such a formation at least on paper with rank of lieutenant general for final campaigns robertson was mentioned in despatches a fourth time mentioned in

replace lieutenant general john northcott as commander of british commonwealth occupation force bcof in occupation of japan northcott had negotiated northcott macarthur agreement in january 1946 with general of army douglas macarthur which governed terms and conditions under which bcof would occupy part of japan they agreed that bcof would serve under american command with american policy being followed it remained to make occupation work robertson had a poor relationship with british component commander major general david tennant cowan who resented being placed under an australian officer it did not occur to me robertson later wrote that officers of british and indian armies looked upon us from australia and new zealand as they looked upon indians and were prepared to do anything to avoid being publicly commanded by us british government s principal interest in japan was to renew pre war trade concessions and to secure new ones it was particularly interested in port city of kobe americans blocked these attempts robertson clashed repeatedly with lieutenant general sir charles gairdner official representative of prime minister of united kingdom gairdner was nominally senior in rank to robertson until march 1947 when robertson was promoted to substantive rank of lieutenant general backdated to january 1944 robertson resisted gairdner s requests for bcof aircraft for personal purposes korean war by mid 1950 bcof was winding down all contingents other than australians had departed and australians were preparing to leave for his services as commander of bcof robertson was created a knight commander of order of british empire military division kbe in king s birthday honours list knight commander of order of british empire robertson intended to travel to london to be invested by king george vi but his plans were disrupted by outbreak of korean war on 25 june 1950 robertson passed on to australian government requests from macarthur for bcof assistance which were agreed to he committed frigate and no 77 squadron raaf but although authorised to do so he hesitated to deploy 3rd battalion royal australian regiment as he considered risks too great thumb left 300px

bcfk while british government had hoped to have americans supply all their logistic support robertson realised that this was impossible us army was being stretched to its limit just supporting itself and army of republic of korea and british commonwealth equipment was different in many respects british army then scrambled to meet its own logistic needs creating ad hoc arrangements and requesting support from robertson and macarthur chief of general staff sydney rowell sent a cable to his british counterpart field marshal sir william slim warning of a bugger s muddle in which only people to suffer will be soldiers slim agreed a maintenance area was established in korea to support commonwealth forces there which drew some resources from american sources such as petrol oil and lubricants engineer stores casualty evacuation and port operations and rest from bcof in japan once again british government did not wish to entrust its interests in japan to a foreign officer so british chiefs of staff appointed air vice marshal cecil bouchier as their representative at macarthur s headquarters his brief made it clear that he had no responsibility or authority over bcof or commonwealth forces in korea after rashly ordering 27th british commonwealth brigade to pusan without transport or heavy equipment much to robertson s annoyance bouchier did attempt to confine himself to acting solely as a liaison officer following dismissal of general douglas macarthur robertson held a press conference in which he defended general and his conduct of war this constituted an implicit condemnation of british government s policy soon after during battle of imjin river robertson was consulted by americans about possible consequences of loss of 1st battalion gloucestershire regiment and he advised them not to endanger rest of i corps line with a rescue attempt for his services in korean war he was awarded american legion of merit legion of merit and south korean order of military merit order of military merit later life robertson was recalled to australia in november 1951 replacing sir edmund herring as director general of recruiting in january 1953 robertson took over southern command again this put him in uncomfortably close proximity to rowell however and two clashed over a number of minor issues robertson turned 60 on 29 october 1954 and retired next day after racking up 3 985 days of active service in 43 years in australian army from 1954 to 1960 he was honorary colonel of royal australian regiment in retirement robertson served on committee of metropolitan golf club and was president of victorian branch of royal empire society for a time he commenced writing his memoirs which he promised would be million pound libel fate of papers he gathered for it and unfinished manuscript itself is unknown on 28 april 1960 he suffered a ruptured aorta and died at repatriation general hospital heidelberg his sudden death came as a shock to many
