at time after boldt died in early 1918 hotel lease was purchased by thomas coleman du pont by 1920s hotel was becoming dated and elegant social life of new york had moved much farther north than 34th street astor family decided to build a replacement hotel further uptown and sold hotel to bethlehem engineering corporation in 1928 for 14 16 million hotel on site of today s empire state building closed on may 3 1929 planning process early plans bethlehem engineering corporation originally intended to build a 25 story office building on waldorf astoria site company s president floyd de l brown paid 100 000 of 1 million down payment required to start construction on tower with promise that difference would be paid later brown borrowed 900 000 from a bank but then defaulted on loan thumb left upright building plans went through fifteen versions before current plan was approved land was then resold to empire state inc a group of wealthy investors that included louis g kaufman ellis p earle john j raskob coleman du pont and pierre s du pont name came from state nickname for new york alfred e smith a former governor of new york and u s presidential candidate whose 1928 campaign had been managed by raskob was appointed head of company group also purchased nearby land so they would have needed for tower s base with combined plot measuring wide by long empire state inc consortium was announced to public in august 1929 empire state inc contracted william f lamb of architectural firm shreve lamb and harmon to create building design lamb produced building drawings in just two weeks using firm s earlier designs for reynolds building in winston salem north carolina as basis concurrently lamb s partner richmond shreve created bug diagrams of project requirements 1916 zoning act forced lamb to design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in lower floors being larger than upper floors consequently tower was designed from top down giving it a pencil like shape design changes original plan of building was 50 stories but was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings to ensure that top fifty floors of planned 80 story building would have unobstructed views of city new york times lauded site s proximity to mass transit with brooklyn manhattan transit s 34th street station and hudson and manhattan railroad s 33rd street terminal one block away as well as penn station two blocks away and grand central terminal nine blocks away at its closest it also praised of proposed floor space near one of busiest sections in world while plans for empire state building were being finalized an intense competition in new york for title of world s tallest building was underway 40 wall street then bank of manhattan building and chrysler building in manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on empire state building race into sky as popular media called it at time was representative of country s optimism in 1920s fueled by building boom in major cities 40 wall street tower was revised in april 1929 from to making it world s tallest chrysler building added its steel tip to its roof in october 1929 thus bringing it to a height of and greatly exceeding height of 40 wall street chrysler building s developer walter chrysler realized that his tower s height would exceed empire state building s as well having instructed his architect william van alen to change chrysler s original roof from a stubby romanesque dome to a narrow steel spire raskob wishing to have empire state building be world s tallest reviewed plans and had five floors added as well as a spire however new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on extension on november 18 1929 smith acquired a lot at 27 31 west 33rd street adding to width of proposed office building s site two days later smith announced updated plans for skyscraper that included an observation deck on 86th floor roof at a height of higher than chrysler s 71st floor observation deck 1 050 foot empire state building would only be taller than chrysler building and raskob was afraid that chrysler might try to pull a trick like hiding a rod in spire and then sticking it up at last minute plans were revised one last time in december 1929 to include a 16 story metal crown and an additional mooring mast intended for roof height was now making it tallest building in world by far even without antenna addition of dirigible station meant that another floor now enclosed 86th floor would have to be built below crown however unlike chrysler s spire empire state s mast would serve a practical purpose final plan was announced to public on january 8 1930 just before start of construction new york times reported that spire was facing some technical problems but they were no greater than might be expected under such a novel plan by this time blueprints for building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were approved lamb described other specifications he was given for final approved plan contractors were starrett brothers and eken paul and william a starrett and andrew j eken who had also constructed other new york city buildings such as original stuyvesant town starrett city and trump tower project was financed primarily by raskob and pierre du pont while james farley s general builders supply corporation supplied building materials john w bowser was construction superintendent of project and structural engineer of building was homer g tight completion schedule necessitated commencement of construction even though design had yet to be finalized construction hotel demolition demolition of old waldorf astoria began on october 1 1929 stripping building down was an arduous process as hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been furthermore old hotel s granite wood chips and precious metals such as lead brass and zinc were not in high demand resulting in issues with disposal most of wood was deposited into a on nearby 30th street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere much of other materials that made up old hotel including granite and bronze were dumped into atlantic ocean near sandy hook new jersey by time hotel s demolition started raskob had secured required funding for construction of building plan was to start construction later that year but on october 24 new york stock exchange suffered a sudden crash marking beginning of decade long great depression despite economic downturn raskob refused to cancel project because of progress that had been made up to that point neither raskob who had ceased speculation in stock market previous year nor smith who had no stock investments suffered financially in crash however most of investors were affected and as a result in december 1929 empire state inc obtained a 27 5 million loan from metropolitan life insurance company so construction could begin stock market crash resulted in no demand in new office space raskob and smith nonetheless started construction as canceling project would have resulted in greater losses for investors steel structure thumb a worker bolts beams during construction chrysler building can be seen in background a structural steel contract was awarded on january 12 1930 with excavation of site beginning ten days later on january 22 before old hotel had been completely demolished two twelve hour shifts consisting of 300 men each worked continuously to dig foundation small pier holes were sunk into ground to house concrete footings that would support steelwork excavation was nearly complete by early march and construction on building itself started on march 17 with builders placing first steel columns on completed footings before rest of footings had been finished around this time lamb held a press conference on building plans he described reflective steel panels parallel to windows large block indiana limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks and tower s lines and rise four colossal columns intended for installation in center of building site were delivered they would support a combined when building was finished structural steel was pre ordered and pre fabricated in anticipation of a revision to city s building code that would have allowed empire state building s structural steel to carry up from thus reducing amount of steel needed for building although 18 000 psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities mayor jimmy walker did not sign new codes into law until march 26 1930 just before construction was due to commence first steel framework was installed on april 1 1930 from there construction proceeded at a rapid pace during one stretch of 10 working days builders erected fourteen floors this was made possible through precise coordination of building s planning as well as mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels on one occasion when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark hauteville marble starrett switched to using rose famosa marble from a german quarry that was purchased specifically to provide project with sufficient marble scale of project was massive with trucks carrying 16 000 partition tiles 5 000 bags of cement of sand and 300 bags of lime arriving at construction site every day there were also cafes and concession stands on five of incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to ground level to eat lunch temporary water taps were also built so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from ground level additionally carts running on a small railway system transported materials from basement storage to elevators that brought carts to desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks of steel ordered for project was largest ever single order of steel at time comprising more steel than was ordered for chrysler building and 40 wall street combined according to historian john tauranac building materials were sourced from numerous and distant sources with limestone from indiana steel girders from pittsburgh cement and mortar from upper new york state marble from italy france and england wood from northern and pacific coast forests and hardware from new england facade too used a variety of material most prominently indiana limestone but also swedish black granite terracotta and brick by june 20 skyscraper s supporting steel structure had risen to 26th floor and by july 27 half of steel structure had been completed starrett bros and eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction a goal that they almost reached with their pace of stories per week prior to this fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been stories per week while construction progressed final designs for floors were being designed from ground up as opposed to general design which had been from roof down some of levels were still undergoing final approval with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized on september 10 as steelwork was nearing completion smith laid building s cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including previous day s new york times a u s currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930 a history of site and building and photographs of people involved in construction steel structure was topped out at on september 19 twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after start of construction workers raised a flag atop 86th floor to signify this milestone completion and scale afterward work on building s interior and crowning mast commenced mooring mast topped out on november 21 two months after steelwork had been completed meanwhile work on walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace with exterior walls built up to 75th floor by time steelwork had been built to 95th floor majority of facade was already finished by middle of november because of building s height it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins so builders contracted with otis elevator company to make 66 cars that could speed at which represented largest ever elevator order at time in addition to time constraint builders had there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly and trucks needed to drop off these materials without traffic this was solved by creating a temporary driveway for trucks between 33rd and 34th streets and then storing materials in building s first floor and basements concrete mixers brick hoppers and stone hoists inside building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing public at one point over 200 trucks made material deliveries at building site every day a series of relay and erection derricks placed on platforms erected near building lifted steel from trucks below and installed beams at appropriate locations empire state building was structurally completed on april 11 1931 twelve days ahead of schedule and 410 days after construction commenced al smith shot final rivet which was made of solid gold thumb alt a photograph of a cable worker taken by lewis hine as part of his project to document empire state building s construction photograph of a cable worker taken by lewis hine project involved more than 3 500 workers at its peak including 3 439 on a single day august 14 1930 many of workers were irish and italian immigrants with a sizable minority of mohawk ironworkers from reserve near montreal according to official accounts five workers died during construction although new york daily news gave reports of 14 deaths and a headline in socialist magazine new masses spread unfounded rumors of up to 42 deaths empire state building cost 40 948 900 to build including demolition of waldorf astoria equivalent to in this was lower than 60 million budgeted for construction lewis hine captured many photographs of construction documenting not only work itself but also providing insight into daily life of workers in that era hine s images were used extensively by media to publish daily press releases according to writer jim rasenberger hine climbed out onto steel with ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above city to capture as no one ever had before or has since dizzy work of building skyscrapers in rasenberger s words hine turned what might have been an assignment of corporate flak into exhilarating art these images were later organized into their own collection onlookers were enraptured by sheer height at which steelworkers operated new york magazine wrote of steelworkers like little spiders they toiled spinning a fabric of steel against sky opening and early years empire state building officially opened on may 1 1931 forty five days ahead of its projected opening date opening was marked with an event featuring united states president herbert hoover who turned on building s lights with ceremonial button push from washington d c over 350 guests attended opening ceremony and following luncheon at 86th floor including jimmy walker governor franklin d roosevelt and al smith an account from that day stated that view from luncheon was obscured by a fog with other landmarks such as statue of liberty being lost in mist enveloping new york city building officially opened next day advertisements for building s observatories were placed in local newspapers while nearby hotels also capitalized on events by releasing advertisements that lauded their proximity to newly opened tower according to new york times builders and real estate speculators predicted that empire state building would be world s tallest building for many years thus ending great new york city skyscraper rivalry at time most engineers agreed that it would be difficult to build a building taller than even with hardy manhattan bedrock as a foundation technically it was believed possible to build a tower of up to but it was deemed uneconomical to do so especially during great depression as tallest building in world at that time and first one to exceed 100 floors empire state building became an icon of city and ultimately of nation in 1932 fifth avenue association gave tower its 1931 gold medal for architectural excellence signifying that empire state had been best designed building on fifth avenue to open in 1931 a year later on march 2 1933 movie king kong was released movie which depicted a large stop motion ape named kong climbing empire state building made still new building into a cinematic icon tenants and tourism thumb upright 1 4 seen from north alt empire state building s opening coincided with great depression in united states and as a result much of its office space was vacant from its opening in first year only 23 of available space was rented as compared to early 1920s where average building would have occupancy of 52 upon opening and 90 rented within five years lack of renters led new yorkers to deride building as empty state building jack brod one of building s longest resident tenants co established empire diamond corporation with his father in building in mid 1931 and rented space in building until he died in 2008 brod recalled that there were only about 20 tenants at time of opening including him and that al smith was only real tenant in space above his seventh floor offices generally during early 1930s it was rare for more than a single office space to be rented in building despite smith s and raskob s aggressive marketing efforts in newspapers and to anyone they knew building s lights were continuously left on even in spaces to give impression of occupancy this was exacerbated by competition from rockefeller center as well as from buildings on 42nd street which when combined with empire state building resulted in surplus of office space in a slow market during 1930s aggressive marketing efforts served to reinforce empire state building s status as world s tallest observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad tickets building became a popular tourist attraction with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to observation decks in 1931 in its first year of operation observation deck made approximately 2 million in revenue as much as its owners made in rent that year by 1936 observation deck was crowded on a daily basis with food and drink available for purchase at top and by 1944 tower had received its 5 millionth visitor in 1931 nbc took up tenancy leasing space on 85th floor for radio broadcasts from outset building was in debt losing 1 million per year by 1935 real estate developer seymour durst recalled that building was so underused in 1936 that there was no elevator service above 45th floor as building above 41st floor was empty except for nbc offices and raskob du pont offices on 81st floor other events per original plans empire state building s spire was intended to be an airship docking station raskob and smith had proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on 86th floor while airships themselves would be tied to spire at equivalent of building s 106th floor an elevator would ferry passengers from 86th to 101st floor after they had checked in on 86th floor after which passengers would have climbed steep ladders to board airship idea however was impractical and dangerous due to powerful updrafts caused by building itself wind currents across manhattan and spires of nearby skyscrapers furthermore even if airship were to successfully navigate all these obstacles its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto streets below in order to maintain stability and then tie craft s nose to spire with no mooring lines securing tail end of craft on september 15 1931 in first and only instance of an airship using building s mast a small commercial united states navy airship circled 25 times in winds airship then attempted to dock at mast but its ballast spilled and craft was rocked by unpredictable eddies near disaster scuttled plans to turn building s spire into an airship terminal although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward on july 28 1945 a b 25 mitchell bomber crashed into north side of empire state building between 79th and 80th floors one engine completely penetrated building and landed in a neighboring block while other engine and part of landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft fourteen people were killed in incident but building escaped severe damage and was reopened two days later profitability empire state building only started becoming profitable in 1950s when it was finally able to break even for first time at time mass transit options in building s vicinity were limited compared to present day despite this challenge empire state building began to attract renters due to its reputation a radio antenna was erected on top of tower starting in 1950 allowing area s television stations to broadcast from building however despite turnaround in building s fortunes raskob put tower up for sale in 1951 with a minimum asking price of 50 million property was purchased by business partners roger l stevens henry crown alfred r glancy and ben tobin sale was brokered by charles f noyes company a prominent real estate firm in upper manhattan for 51 million highest price paid for a single structure at time by this time empire state had been fully leased for several years with a waiting list of parties looking to lease space in building according to cortland standard that year six news companies formed a partnership to pay a combined annual fee of 600 000 to use tower s antenna which was completed in 1953 crown bought out his partners ownership stakes in 1954 becoming sole owner following year american society of civil engineers named building one of seven modern civil engineering wonders in 1961 lawrence a wien signed a contract to purchase empire state building for 65 million with harry b helmsley acting as partners in building s operating lease this became new highest price for a single structure over 3 000 people paid 10 000 for one share each in a company called empire state building associates company in turn subleased building to another company headed by helmsley and wien

started a program of minor improvement projects including first ever full building facade refurbishment and window washing in 1962 installation of new flood lights on 72nd floor in 1964 and replacement of manually operated elevators with automatic units in 1966 little used western end of second floor was used as a storage space until 1964 at which point it received escalators to first floor as part of its conversion into a highly sought retail area loss of tallest building title in 1961 same year that helmsley wien and malkin had purchased empire state building port authority of new york and new jersey formally backed plans for a new world trade center in lower manhattan plan originally included 66 story twin towers with column free open spaces empire state s owners and real estate speculators were worried that twin towers of office space would create a glut of rentable space in manhattan as well as take away empire state building s profits from lessees a revision in world trade center s plan brought twin towers to each or 110 stories taller than empire state opponents of new project included prominent real estate developer robert tishman as well as wien s committee for a reasonable world trade center in response to wien s opposition port authority executive director austin j tobin said that wien was only opposing project because it would overshadow his

it was designated as a national historic landmark in 1986 in 2007 it was ranked number one on aia s list of america s favorite architecture exterior thumb a series of setbacks causes building to taper with height empire state building s art deco design is typical of pre world war ii architecture in new york modernistic stainless steel canopies of entrances on 33rd and 34th streets lead to two story high corridors around elevator core crossed by stainless steel and glass enclosed bridges at second floor level riveted steel frame of building was originally designed to handle all of building s gravitational stresses and wind loads exterior of building is clad in indiana limestone panels sourced from empire mill in sanders indiana which give building its signature blonde color amount of material used in building s construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers with a structural stiffness of versus willis tower s and john hancock center s a december 1930 feature in popular mechanics estimated that a building with empire state s dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of empire state building design featured one major setback and several smaller ones that reduce level dimensions as height increases thus making upper 81 floors much smaller than lower five floors however this design allows sunlight to illuminate interiors of top floors and in addition positions these floors away from noisy streets below this design was mandated as per 1916 zoning resolution which was intended to allow sunlight to reach streets as well normally a building of empire state s dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on fifth avenue side and up to 17 stories on 33rd 34th streets side before it would have to utilize setbacks however setbacks were arranged such that largest setback was on sixth floor above five floor base so rest of building above sixth floor would have a facade of uniform shape interior empire state building was first building to have more than 100 floors it has 6 514 windows 73 elevators a total floor area of and a base covering its original 64 elevators built by otis elevator company are located in a central core and are of varying heights with longest of these elevators reaching from lobby to 80th floor as originally built there were four express elevators that connected lobby 80th floor and several landings in between other 60 local elevators connected landings with floors above these intermediate landings of 64 total elevators 58 were for passenger use comprising four express elevators and 54 local elevators and eight were for freight deliveries elevators were designed to move at at time of skyscraper s construction their practical speed was limited to as per city law but this limit was removed shortly after building opened additional elevators connect 80th floor to six floors above it as six extra floors were built after original 80 stories were approved elevators were mechanically operated until 2011 when they were replaced with digital elevators during 550 million renovation of building empire state building has 73 elevators in all including service elevators utilities are grouped in a central shaft on each floor between levels 6 and 86 central shaft is surrounded by a main corridor on all four sides as per final specifications of building corridor is surrounded in turn by office space deep each of floors has 210 structural columns that pass through it which provide structural stability but limits amount of open space on these floors however relative dearth of stone in building allows for more space overall with a 1 200 stone to building ratio in empire state compared to a 1 50 ratio in similar buildings lobby thumb left upright aluminum relief of building original main lobby is accessed from fifth avenue on building s east side and contains an entrance with one set of double doors between a pair of revolving doors at top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three crafts or industries used in building s construction electricity masonry and heating lobby contains two tiers of marble a lighter marble on top above storefronts and a darker marble on bottom flush with storefronts there is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on lobby floor which leads from entrance on east to aluminum relief on west chapel like three story high lobby which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th streets contains storefronts on both its northern and southern sides these storefronts are framed on each side by tubes of dark rounded marble according to new york city landmarks preservation commission and above by a vertical band of grooves set into marble immediately inside lobby is an airport style security checkpoint walls on both northern and southern sides of lobby house storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level at west end of lobby is an aluminum relief of skyscraper as it was originally built i e without antenna relief which was intended to provide a welcoming effect contains an embossing of building s outline accompanied by what landmarks preservation commission describes as rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind tower and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from spire of empire state building in background is a state map of new york with building s location marked by a medallion in very southeast portion of outline a compass is located in bottom right and a plaque to tower s major developers is on bottom left plaque at western end of lobby is located on eastern interior wall of a one story tall rectangular shaped corridor that surrounds banks of escalators with a similar design to lobby rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on northern and southern sides of rectangle as well as a shorter hallway on eastern side and another long hallway on western side at both ends of northern and southern corridors there is a bank of four low rise elevators in between corridors western side of rectangular elevator bank corridor extends north to 34th street entrance and south to 33rd street entrance it borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators that go both to second floor and to basement going from west to east there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd streets from both northern and southern corridors respectively at approximately two thirds point of each corridor until 1960s an art deco mural inspired by both sky and machine age was installed in lobby ceilings subsequent damage to these murals designed by artist leif resulted in reproductions being installed renovations to lobby in 2009 such as replacing clock over information desk in fifth avenue lobby with an anemometer and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of building when it originally opened revived much of its original grandeur north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by roy and renee in time for 1964 world s fair depicting building as eighth wonder of world alongside traditional seven building s owners installed a series of paintings by new york artist kysa johnson in concourse level johnson later filed a federal

a work consisting of 15 000 stars and 5 000 circles superimposed on a etched glass installation in lobby features above 102nd floor final stage of building was installation of a hollow mast a steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities above 86th floor at top would be a conical roof and 102nd floor docking station elevators would ascend from 86th floor ticket offices to a 101st floor waiting room from there stairs would lead to 102nd floor where passengers would enter airships airships would have been moored to spire at equivalent of building s 106th floor on 102nd floor of empire state building formerly 101st floor there is a door with stairs ascending to 103rd floor formerly 102nd this was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to building s spire and has a circular balcony outside it is now an access point to reach spire for maintenance room now contains electrical equipment but celebrities and dignitaries may also be given permission to take pictures there above 103rd floor there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach spire for maintenance work mast s 480 windows were all replaced in 2015 broadcast stations thumb left antennae for broadcast stations are located at top of building broadcasting began at empire state building on december 22 1931 when nbc and rca began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop spire with two separate transmitters for visual and audio data they leased 85th floor and built a laboratory there in 1934 rca was joined by edwin howard armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his fm system from building s antenna this setup which entailed installation of world s first fm transmitter continued only until october of next year due to disputes between rca and armstrong specifically nbc wanted to install more tv equipment in room where armstrong s transmitter was located after some time 85th floor became home to rca s new york television operations initially as experimental station channel 1 then from 1941 as commercial station channel 1 now wnbc tv channel 4 nbc s fm station began transmitting from antenna in 1940 nbc retained exclusive use of top of building until 1950 when federal communications commission fcc ordered exclusive deal be terminated fcc directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for seven extant new york area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted other television broadcasters would later join rca at building on 81st through 83rd floors often along with sister fm stations construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on july 27 1950 with tv and fm transmissions starting in 1951 broadcast tower was completed by 1953 from 1951 six broadcasters agreed to pay a combined 600 000 per year for use of antenna in 1965 a separate set of fm antennae was constructed ringing 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna thumb alt empire state building as seen from top of rock seen from top of rock placement of stations in empire state building became a major issue with construction of world trade center twin towers in late 1960s and early 1970s greater height of twin towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from empire state building eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to newer towers instead of suing developer port authority of new york and new jersey even though nine stations who were broadcasting from empire state building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984 most of these stations moved to world trade center as soon as it was completed in 1971 broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that port authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in north tower as well as pay broadcasters leases in empire state building until 1984 only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in empire state building september 11 attacks in 2001 destroyed world trade center and broadcast centers atop it leaving most of city s stations without a station for ten days until a temporary tower was built in alpine new jersey by october 2001 nearly all of city s commercial broadcast stations both television and fm radio were again transmitting from top of empire state building in a report that congress commissioned about transition from analog television to digital television it was stated that placement of broadcast stations in empire state building was considered problematic due to interference from other nearby towers in comparison congressional report stated that former twin towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference in 2003 a few fm stations were relocated to nearby conde nast building to reduce number of broadcast stations using empire state building eleven television stations and twenty two fm stations had signed 15 year leases in building by may 2003 it was expected that a taller broadcast tower in bayonne new jersey or governors island would be built in meantime with empire state building being used as a backup since signal transmissions from building were generally of poorer quality with completion of 1 world trade center some tv stations began moving their transmitting facilities to 1 world trade center while others including wabc tv remained at empire state

contain observatories which see a combined average of 4 million visitors per year since opening observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at 30 rockefeller plaza chrysler building first one world trade center or woolworth building despite being more expensive tourists must pay to visit observation deck on 86th floor there is an additional charge to visit 102nd floor other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view sunrise from observatory a premium guided tour with vip access and am pm package which allows for two visits in same day 86th floor observatory contains both an enclosed viewing gallery and an open air outdoor viewing gallery allowing for it to remain open 365 days a year regardless of weather 102nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller in size 102nd floor observatory was closed to public from late 1990s to 2005 observation decks were redesigned in mid 1979 102nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in 2019 according to a 2010 report by concierge com five lines to enter observation decks are as legendary as building itself concierge com stated that there are five lines sidewalk line lobby elevator line ticket purchase line second elevator line and line to get off elevator and onto observation deck however in 2016 new york city s official tourism website com made note of only three lines security check line ticket purchase line and second elevator line following renovations completed in 2019 designed to streamline queuing and reduce wait times guests enter from a single entrance on 34th street where they make their way through exhibits on their way up to observatories guests were offered a variety of ticket packages including a package that enables them to skip lines throughout duration of their stay empire state building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years new york skyride in early 1994 a motion simulator attraction was built on 2nd floor as a complement to observation deck original cinematic presentation lasted approximately 25 minutes while simulation was about eight minutes ride had two incarnations original version which ran from 1994 until around 2002 featured james doohan star trek s scotty as airplane s pilot who humorously tried to keep flight under control during a storm after world trade center terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 ride was closed an updated version debuted in mid 2002 featuring actor kevin bacon as pilot with new flight also going haywire this new version served a more informative goal as opposed to old version s main purpose of entertainment and contained details about 9 11 attacks simulator received mixed reviews with assessments of ride ranging from great to satisfactory to corny skyride attraction permanently closed on december 31 2015 lights thumb lighting at top of building building was originally equipped with white searchlights atop tower they saw their first use in november 1932 when they lit up to signal roosevelt s victory over hoover in presidential election of that year these were later swapped for four freedom lights in 1956 in february 1964 flood lights were added on 72nd floor to illuminate top of building at night so that building could be seen from world fair later that year lights were shut off from november 1973 to july 1974 because of energy crisis at time in 1976 businessman douglas leigh suggested that wien and helmsley install 204 metal halide lights which were four times as bright as 1 000 incandescent lights they were to replace new red white and blue metal halide lights were installed in time for country s bicentennial that july after bicentennial helmsley retained new lights due to reduced maintenance cost about 116 a year since 1976 spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays organizations are allowed to make requests through building s website building is also lit in colors of new york based sports teams on nights when they host games for example orange blue and white for new york knicks red white and blue for new york rangers see for example it was twice lit in scarlet to support new jersey s rutgers university once for a football game against university of louisville on november 9 2006 and again on april 3 2007 when women s basketball team played in national championship game there have also been special occasions where lights are modified from usual schedule after eightieth birthday and subsequent death of frank sinatra in 1998 for example building was bathed in blue light to represent singer s nickname ol blue eyes after actress fay wray who starred in king kong died in september 2004 building lights were extinguished for 15 minutes floodlights bathed building in red white and blue for several months after destruction of world trade center in september 2001 then reverted to standard schedule on june 4 2002 empire state building donned purple and gold royal colors of elizabeth ii in thanks for united kingdom playing star spangled banner

halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with 1 200 led fixtures increasing available colors from nine to over 16 million computer controlled system allows building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels for instance on november 6 2012 cnn used top of empire state building as a scoreboard for 2012 united states presidential election when incumbent president barack obama had reached 270 electoral votes necessary to win re election lights turned blue representing color of obama s democratic party had republican challenger mitt romney won building

world before it was surpassed by griffin television tower oklahoma mast in 1954 and tallest freestanding structure in world until completion of ostankino tower in 1967 an early 1970s proposal to dismantle spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors which would have brought building s height to 1 494 feet 455 m and made it once again world s tallest at time was considered but ultimately rejected with destruction of world trade center in september 11 attacks empire state building again became tallest building in new york city and second tallest building in americas surpassed only by
