spit eggs they had lobbied rudd to come on show for several years thomas described reason for rudd not appearing earlier being that crew were unable to find a good moment for character s entry that

of episode because it was being written by enbom however thomas did not release any details about rudd s plot line in episode before its airing rudd compared his character to andrew ridgeley and peter o toole in scene in which veronica meets desmond film of camera angles while kristen bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later bell had to speak her lines without rudd present scene in which desmond goes nude swimming was not included in same form in etheridge s version of episode however thomas enjoyed take that was eventually used more so he put it in final cut because show could not show full nudity they gave stunt performer who was filling in for rudd flesh colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they

it was a bit too much of another and that s one to grow on conclusion he was also mixed towards episode s subplots enjoying mac s romantic storyline but disliking logan s continued interest in veronica he also referred to vinnie running for sheriff as a bit ridiculous reviewer alan sepinwall on his blog what s alan watching lauded episode particularly rudd s performance he stated that rudd despite playing a stock character made me feel like i hadn t seen it a thousand times before he also enjoyed pairing of mac and max while he believed that impact of vinnie and leo s reappearances was blunted by knowledge that show would likely not return for a fourth season television without pity graded episode a b los angeles times praised rudd s performance while criticizing his storyline and mystery of week while stating that kristen bell is usually scene stealer reviewer thought that rudd took on that role in this episode however reviewer called his mystery an excuse just to get rudd on

chronicle was mixed overall while being complimentary towards rudd s performance and greenfield s reappearance reviewer disliked mystery of desmond s missing tapes stating mystery of week turns out to be lamest non mystery of show s entire run i think reviewer opined that subplot involving fitzpatricks was boring but that marino s reappearance was a good surprise brian raftery of idolator believed

best of season so far he lauded development of romantic storylines of both veronica and mac while stating that veronica s was more realistic describing concert scene in which veronica and piz hold hands again was genuinely emotional he also stated that rudd changes fellows from a painful stereotype into a pantheon one off character reviewer also opined that episode s combination of rudd and subplot involving logan and mac created a very entertaining episode that was exemplary of how well new story structure could work references external links debasement tapes at mars investigations
