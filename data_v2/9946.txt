viper dogfish or viper shark trigonognathus kabeyai is a rare species of dogfish shark in family etmopteridae and only extant member of its genus it has been found in pacific ocean off southern japan bonin islands pacific ocean off northern taitung county and northwestern hawaiian islands this species inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts it may migrate vertically shifting between bottom waters deep during day and upper waters less than deep at night a slender black shark reaching in length viper dogfish can be recognized by its narrow triangular jaws and well spaced fang like teeth it also has two spined dorsal fins dermal denticles with faceted crowns and numerous light emitting photophores concentrated on its ventral surface feeding mainly on bony fishes viper dogfish captures prey by protruding its jaws and impaling them with its teeth its impressive gape allows it to swallow relatively large fish whole skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks this shark gives birth to live young which are nourished by yolk during gestation litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls iucn presently lacks sufficient data to assess conservation status of this species taxonomy first specimens of viper dogfish were two immature males caught off southern japan by bottom trawler seiryo maru in 1986 first designated as holotype measured long and was collected off cape shiono at a depth of second measured long and was collected off tokushima at a depth of shark was described as a new species and genus by university of tokyo researchers kenji mochizuki and fumio ohe in a 1990 article for japanese journal of ichthyology they gave it name trigonognathus kabeyai generic name is derived from greek triangle and jaw while specific name honors hiromichi captain of seiryo maru mochizuki and ohe originally assigned viper dogfish to family which at time was used for all members of order squaliformes aside from bramble and rough sharks in a 1992 morphological study shigeru shirai and osamu okamura placed this species in squalid subfamily which most taxonomists now recognize as separate family etmopteridae phylogeny and evolution position of trigonognathus within etmopteridae is uncertain morphological and molecular phylogenetic data generally support subdivision of etmopteridae into two clades one consisting of etmopterus and and other consisting of centroscyllium and phylogenetic analyses have variously placed trigonognathus as closer to one clade or other or as basal to both depending on which morphological characters nuclear dna markers and or mitochondrial dna markers were used based on molecular clock estimation trigonognathus is thought to have originated around 41 million years ago during middle eocene as part of a larger evolutionary radiation of genera genus is represented in this time period by extinct species t whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from lutetian age 47 8 41 3 mya strata in landes southwestern france fossil teeth virtually identical to those of modern viper dogfish are known from formation in northeastern venezuela which dates to late miocene and early pliocene 11 6 3 6 mya description thumb left narrow jaws and needle like teeth of viper dogfish are distinctive viper dogfish has a slender cylindrical body and a moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout behind large oval eyes are narrow elliptical spiracles nostrils are nearly vertical slits jaws are long and narrowly triangular and can be protruded from head teeth are distinctively fang like and widely spaced most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side along with a single tooth row at upper and lower symphyses jaw midpoints teeth are largest at symphysis and decline in size towards corners of mouth when mouth is closed upper symphysial tooth overlaps lower while lateral teeth interlock five gill slits are seen with fifth pair longer than others fins are small and very thin pectoral fins are rounded and lobe like two dorsal fins are positioned about between pectoral and pelvic fins each dorsal fin bears a slightly grooved spine in front second dorsal spine is longer than first anal fin is absent and caudal peduncle lacks keels or notches upper lobe of caudal fin is larger than lower and has a notch in trailing margin skin excluding on fins is densely covered with irregularly arranged nonoverlapping dermal denticles each denticle has a swollen rhombic shape with 10 40 facets on crown viper dogfish is black with distinct darker markings on underside these markings contain large numbers of tiny light producing photophores more photophores are found sparsely scattered over rest of body as well as in a translucent patch on upper eyelid fins are translucent and tip of caudal fin upper lobe is blackish largest known male is long and weighs and largest female is long and weighs distribution and habitat most specimens of viper dogfish have been collected from a relatively small area of northwestern pacific ocean off kii peninsula in japan a number of specimens were also recovered from stomachs of predatory fishes caught in bonin islands one specimen was caught from hancock seamount located some northwest of kure atoll in northwestern hawaiian islands during day this species has been caught close to bottom on upper reaches of continental slopes and seamounts at depths of at night it has been caught between surface and a depth of in water over deep this pattern suggests viper dogfish performs a diel vertical migration spending day in deeper water and rising towards surface at night such daily movement may relate to feeding biology and ecology thumb bigeye tuna preys on viper dogfish viper dogfish feeds primarily on bony fishes notably lanternfishes in genera and and also takes crustaceans its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting in contrast to short jaws and saw like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat prey is seized by a rapid extension of jaws and swallowed whole shark can consume fish close to 40 as long as itself viper dogfish is only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle which is normally responsible for pulling jaws forward when biting jaw protrusion is instead effected by hyomandibular bone which is articulated to skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward this unique arrangement serves to increase distance shark can protrude its jaws as well as size of its gape both vertically and horizontally known predators of viper dogfish include bigeye tuna obesus and sickle pomfret like other members of its family this species is viviparous giving birth to live offspring with developing embryos sustained to term by yolk adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteri two of recorded female specimens contained 25 and 26 mature ova in related black dogfish centroscyllium fabricii number of mature ova in a female is slightly greater than number of resulting embryos which suggests a litter size under 26 in viper dogfish males and females mature sexually at roughly long respectively human interactions viper dogfish has no economic value it is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species though what effect if any fishing has on its population is unknown as a result iucn has listed it under data deficient references external links trigonognathus kabeyai viper dogfish at fishbase trigonognathus kabeyai viper dogfish at iucn red
