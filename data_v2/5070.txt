cyclones were named using joint army navy phonetic alphabet first of which formed on august 18 final storm of season dissipated on october 28 two and a half weeks before season officially ended on november 15 four of tropical cyclones made landfall during season first being february tropical storm that crossed southern florida first hurricane named able struck south carolina with winds of causing heavy damage near coast and widespread power outages it moved up most of east coast of united states leaving 3 deaths and widespread damage as a developing tropical cyclone hurricane charlie caused damaging flooding and landslides in southwest puerto rico final and strongest of season hurricane fox struck cuba with winds of it killed 600 people and left heavy damage particularly to sugar crop reaching 10 million 1952 usd usd systems tropical storm one on february 2 a non frontal low formed in western caribbean sea two months after end of hurricane season it moved quickly north northwestward and acquired gale force winds as it brushed northern coast of cuba early on february 3 storm struck cape sable florida and quickly crossed state miami national weather service office recorded a wind gust of 68 mph 110 km h during its passage winds damaged windows and power lines catching residents and tourists off guard cyclone also dropped 2 4 inches 50 100 mm of precipitation along its path causing crop damage in miami dade county after leaving florida storm briefly transitioned into a tropical storm on february 3 only tropical or subtropical storm on record in month storm continued rapidly northeastward reaching peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h on february 4 it evolved into an extratropical cyclone off coast of north carolina later that day it passed over cape cod and early on february 5 dissipated after crossing into maine storm caused scattered power outages and gusty winds across new england hurricane able over six months after previous storm dissipated a tropical depression developed just off west coast of africa on august 18 it moved generally west to west northwestward for much of its duration intensifying into a tropical storm on august 24 east of lesser antilles next day hurricane hunters confirmed presence of tropical storm able passing north of islands storm attained hurricane status on august 27 on august 30 able turned to north northwest due to an approaching cold front and next day made landfall near beaufort south carolina as a category 2 hurricane with peak winds of 100 mph 155 km h town was heavily damaged and was briefly isolated after winds downed power and telephone lines across south carolina hurricane caused two indirect deaths as well as moderate damage totaling 2 2 million 1952 usd usd as able turned north and northeastward over land winds quickly weakened to tropical storm force although it retained gale force winds through north carolina virginia and maryland this was due to remaining over flat terrain east of appalachian mountains as well as retaining a plume of tropical moisture from its south it left light damage in north carolina some of it due to a tornado in maryland heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding which washed out tracks of baltimore and ohio railroad near baltimore in ellicott city maryland rains flooded several houses forcing families to evacuate two tornadoes were also reported in region and damage in washington d c area reached 500 000 1952 usd usd further northeast storm continued to produce heavy rainfall causing flooding as well as one indirect death in pennsylvania after moving through new england able dissipated on september 2 near portland maine tropical storm three a cold front was located north of bahamas on august 26 with a broad area of cyclonic turning located east of northern florida atmospheric pressures were falling in region and gale force winds were recorded by 12 00 utc on august 27 based on structure it is estimated that frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18 00 utc that day ship reports in region suggested peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h there was very dry air on west side of system unusual for august and radius of maximum winds was around 115 mi 185 km suggesting that structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone storm continued to northwest making landfall very near myrtle beach south carolina at 02 00 utc on august 28 it spread rainfall across carolinas later enhanced by hurricane able just days later while cities reported winds of around 35 mph 55 km h storm weakened over land and dissipated late on august 28 over eastern kentucky hurricane baker third tropical cyclone of season developed on august 31 a short distance east of northern lesser antilles its presence was reported by a ship next day that encountered rough seas and gale force winds as a result weather bureau sent hurricane hunters to investigate system which reported a strengthening hurricane moving northwestward given name baker hurricane passed north of lesser antilles reaching peak winds of late on september 3 for several days hurricane hunters reported similar winds along with gusts up to with a large anticyclone located over ohio valley baker turned to northeast on september 5 passing about halfway between bermuda and north carolina hurricane slowly weakened as it moved through north atlantic ocean just missing newfoundland while maintaining winds of wind gusts on avalon peninsula reached and heavy fishing damage was reported in lower island cove after affecting island baker transitioned into an extratropical storm which lasted another day before dissipating south of greenland tropical storm five a dissipating cold front stalled across northeastern atlantic ocean on september 7 northeast of azores that day a closed circulation developed and quickly became independent of front based on a uniform thermal structure as well as ship reports in region of gale force winds near center it is estimated that system became a tropical storm early on september 8 forming at a latitude of 42 0degn this system is notable for being northernmost forming tropical cyclone in atlantic hurricane database dating back to 1851 system moved west southwestward atypical for cyclones in that region during september on september 9 storm turned to southeast reaching estimated peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h based on ship observations moving slowly through northern azores storm produced winds of 35 mph 55 km h along terceira island it slowly weakened and by late on september 10 system degraded into a tropical depression by next day system was interacting with an approaching cold front indicating that depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 20 00 utc storm moved ashore southwestern tip of portugal with gale force winds storm turned to northwest through iberian peninsula dissipating on september 14 over southwestern france hurricane charlie on september 22 a tropical wave moved into eastern caribbean sea spawning a tropical depression near hispaniola early on september 24 as it tracked west northwestward low dropped heavy rainfall peaking at in christiansted united states virgin islands as well as in garzas puerto rico in puerto rico rains caused landslides that affected seven towns notably ponce island s second largest city there at least 14 buildings were destroyed floods left more than 1 000 people homeless 300 of whom took refuge in a red cross shelter overall flooding on island killed four people and left moderate damage of around 1 million 1952 usd usd after affecting puerto rico low continued to organize and subsequently struck dominican republic on september 23 circulation became disrupted while crossing hispaniola although it reorganized near turks and caicos islands and became tropical storm charlie before reaching those islands on september 25 charlie attained hurricane status and due to its continued northwest motion weather bureau advised small craft to remain at port in southeastern united states coast however hurricane turned to north and northeast on september 26 during which hurricane hunters recorded peak winds of it briefly threatened bermuda prompting united states air force to evacuate its fleet of airplanes from kindley air force base charlie ultimately northwest of bermuda and later began weakening on september 29 it turned eastward and later that day transitioned into an extratropical cyclone remnants lasted two more days before dissipating southeast of newfoundland tropical storm dog on september 18 a tropical wave exited west coast of africa which spawned a tropical cyclone east of lesser antilles on september 24 system quickly intensified and was given name dog storm moved northwestward for its entire duration on september 26 hurricane hunters observed winds of with gusts to 100 mph 160 km h although they were unable to locate a closed center of circulation operationally dog was upgraded to hurricane status but a reanalysis in 2015 downgraded storm to a peak intensity of 70 mph 110 km h making it a strong tropical storm dog began weakening on september 27 and over next few days circulation lost its definition on september 29 dog weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated next day weather bureau advised ships to avoid storm but overall dog did not affect land tropical storm eight on september 24 a tropical wave moved off west coast of africa it is estimated that a closed circulation developed on next day suggesting formation of a tropical depression on september 26 santiago island within cape verde recorded winds of 30 mph 45 km h as system was passing to southwest a minimum pressure of and ship reports of 35 mph 55 km h winds indicate that system reached peak winds of 45 mph 75 km h or a minimal tropical storm it turned to north on september 27 and likely weakened although observations were sparse by september 30 system lost its circulation and degenerated into an open trough hurricane easy on october 6 a tropical depression formed about east of antigua near where tropical storm dog developed a week prior depression proceeded northward and was detected by hurricane hunters on october 7 as a strengthening tropical storm on that basis storm was named easy on october 8 hurricane hunters observed a 26 mi 46 km eye and wind gusts to 115 mph 185 km h on that basis easy was upgraded to a hurricane with peak winds of 105 mph 165 km h by that time hurricane had turned sharply to east and later began to move toward south as quickly as it strengthened easy began to weaken and an aircraft reported winds of only on october 9 storm headed southwest ultimately dissipating on october 11 about southwest of where it formed easy never affected land hurricane fox strongest tropical cyclone of season formed on october 20 in caribbean sea off northwest coast of colombia believed to have been from intertropical convergence zone it moved northwestward intensifying into a tropical storm on october 21 and a hurricane following day fox subsequently turned to north intensifying to a major hurricane as it passed west of cayman islands late on october 24 cyclone struck small island of cayo guano del estes in archipelago de los south of cienfuegos cuba it struck island with peak winds of 145 mph 230 km h and island reported a minimum pressure of 934 mbar 27 59 inhg shortly thereafter fox crossed mainland coast of cuba west of cienfuegos and it weakened while crossing island hurricane fox crossed cuba in a rural area dominated by sugar plantations with heavy damage reported to 36 mills in one town hurricane destroyed about 600 homes and damaged over 1 000 more across island strongest winds downed large trees and washed a large freighter ashore heavy rainfall affected all but extreme eastern and western end of island with a peak of near havana rains flooded low lying areas and caused rivers to exceed their banks throughout cuba hurricane fox killed 600 people and left behind heavy damage totaling 10 million 1952 usd usd fox was among strongest hurricanes to strike country after crossing cuba fox emerged into atlantic ocean with winds of crossing central andros and turning eastward though bahamas on new providence hurricane dropped of rainfall strong winds caused severe crop damage leaving 30 of tomato crop destroyed after briefly restrengthening to a major hurricane fox began a steady weakening trend it turned abruptly to north northwest followed by another turn to northeast on october 28 fox was absorbed by a cold front west southwest of bermuda tropical storm eleven a cold front stalled north of virgin islands on november 23 spawning an extratropical storm next day system strengthened while moving northward attaining gale force winds on november 25 it was a large system and a ship in vicinity reported a pressure of observation within a warm environment and in concurrence with gale force winds suggested that system became a tropical storm on november 26 although system likely was a subtropical cyclone due to structure turning to west northwest along a dissipating cold front storm reached peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h on november 27 another front in region steered storm to south and east in a counterclockwise circle weakening slightly system briefly transitioned into an extratropical storm on november 30 before dissipating later that day within front storm names these names were used to name storms during 1952 season third and final time storm
