changes of pace and movement in both directions coupled with a leg stump line to a packed leg side field made scoring off him difficult he achieved his success in a manner not dissimilar to derek underwood a generation later his accuracy and stamina allowed ray lindwall and keith miller one of australia s finest fast bowling pairs of all time to draw breath between short and incisive bursts of pace and swing standing he was particularly effective on sticky wickets reducing his speed to slow medium pace and using a repertoire of off cutters inswingers outswingers and leg breaks bowling a leg stump line from over wicket with a leg side cordon of two short legs and a silly mid on he was described by bradman as unique in every way bradman further added i cannot remember another of same type he worried and got out best bats was amazingly accurate and must have turned in fine figures had not his cartilage given way he usually bowled with four men on off side including a slip and five on leg when pitch was wet he moved a further man to on side to field at leg slip pollard 1990 p 6 nicknamed black prince because of his tanned skin toshack s looks and sense of humour made him a crowd favourite as did his theatrical appealing which was more reminiscent of later eras of cricketers his vocal appealing prompted journalist and former australian test batsman jack fingleton to dub him voice while teammate sid barnes called him film star because of his looks his sense of fun was often on show while on 1948 tour he would often wear a bowler hat grab a furled umbrella and place a cigar in his mouth parodying an englishman after cricket following his career toshack joined a firm of builders and spent 25 years as a foreman and supervisor on construction sites around sydney he
