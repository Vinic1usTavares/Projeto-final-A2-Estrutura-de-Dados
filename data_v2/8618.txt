red tailed hawk buteo jamaicensis is a bird of prey that breeds throughout most of north america from interior of alaska and northern canada to as far south as panama and west indies it is one of most common members within genus of buteo in north america or worldwide red tailed hawk is one of three species colloquially known in united states as though it rarely preys on standard sized chickens bird is sometimes also referred to as red tail for short when meaning is clear in context red tailed hawks can acclimate to all biomes within their range occurring on edges of non ideal habitats such as dense forests and sandy deserts preston c r 2000 red tailed hawk stackpole books red tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes including deserts grasslands coniferous and deciduous forests agricultural fields and urban areas its latitudinal limits fall around tree line in arctic and species is absent from high arctic it is legally protected in canada mexico and united states by migratory bird treaty act 14 recognized subspecies vary in appearance and range varying most often in color and in west of north america red tails are particularly often strongly polymorphic with individuals ranging from almost white to nearly all black palmer r s ed 1988 handbook of north american birds volume 5 diurnal raptors part 2 subspecies harlan s hawk b j harlani is sometimes considered a separate species b harlani red tailed hawk is one of largest members of genus buteo typically weighing from and measuring in length with a wingspan from this species displays sexual dimorphism in size with females averaging about 25 heavier than males diet of red tailed hawks is highly variable and reflects their status as opportunistic generalists but in north america it is most often a predator of small mammals such as rodents prey that is terrestrial and diurnal is preferred so types such as ground squirrels are preferential where they naturally occur large numbers of birds and reptiles can occur in diet in several areas and can even be primary foods meanwhile amphibians fish and invertebrates can seem rare in hawk s regular diet however they are not infrequently taken by immature hawks red tailed hawks may survive on islands absent of native mammals on diets variously including invertebrates such as crabs or lizards and birds like many buteo they hunt from a perch most often but can vary their hunting techniques where prey and habitat demand it preston c r and r d beane 2009 red tailed hawk buteo jamaicensis birds of north america because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters majority of hawks captured for falconry in united states are red tails falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks which have left nest are on their own but are less than a year old so as to not affect breeding population adults which may be breeding or rearing chicks may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so passage red tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed adult behaviors which would make them more difficult to train beebe f l 1976 north american falconry and

whitish underbelly with a dark brown band across belly formed by horizontal streaks in feather patterning is present in most color variations this feature is variable in eastern hawks and generally absent in some light subspecies i e b j fuertesi most adult red tails have a dark brown nape and upper head which gives them a somewhat hooded appearance while throat can variably present a lighter brown necklace especially in younger birds underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting and some adults may too manifest this stippling back is usually a slightly darker brown than elsewhere with paler scapular feathers ranging from tawny to white forming a variable imperfect v on back tail of most adults which of course gives this species its name is rufous brick red above with a variably sized black subterminal band and generally appears light buff orange from below in comparison typical pale immatures i e less than two years old typically have a mildly paler headed and

head can sometimes appear small in size against thick body frame cere legs and feet of red tailed hawk are all yellow as is hue of bare parts in many accipitrids of different lineages immature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish irises as bird attains full maturity over course of 3 4 years iris slowly darkens into a reddish brown hue which is adult eye color in all races seen in flight adults usually have dark brown along lower edge of wings against a mostly pale wing which bares light brownish barring individually underwing coverts can range from all dark to off whitish most often more heavily streaked with brown which contrasts with a distinctive black patagium marking wing coloring of adults and immatures is similar but for typical pale morph immatures having somewhat heavier brownish markings brown leslie and amadon dean 1986 eagles hawks and falcons of world wellfleet press thumb left a typical pale western adult in flight though markings and hue vary across subspecies basic appearance of red tailed hawk is relatively consistent overall this species is blocky and broad in shape often appearing and being heavier than other buteos of similar length they are heaviest buteos on average in eastern north america albeit scarcely ahead of larger winged rough legged buzzard buteo lagopus and second only in size in west to ferruginous hawk buteo regalis red tailed hawks may be anywhere from fifth to ninth heaviest buteo in world depending on what figures are used however in northwestern united states ferruginous hawk females are 35 heavier than female red tails from same area on average western red tailed hawks are relatively longer winged and proportioned but are slightly less stocky compact and heavy than eastern red tailed hawks in north america eastern hawks may also have mildly larger talons and bills than western ones based on comparisons of morphology and function amongst all accipitrids these features imply that western red tails may need to vary their hunting more frequently to on wing as habitat diversifies to more open situations and presumably would hunt more variable and faster prey whereas birds of east which was historically well wooded are more dedicated perch hunters and can take somewhat larger prey but are likely more dedicated mammal hunters in terms of size variation red tailed hawks run almost contrary

have a relatively short but broad tails and thick chunky wings although often described as long winged proportional size of wings is quite small and red tails have high wing loading for a buteonine hawk for comparison two other widespread buteo hawks in north america were found to weigh for every square centimeter of wing area in rough legged buzzard buteo lagopus and per square cm in red shouldered hawk buteo lineatus in contrast red tailed hawk weighed considerably more for their wing area per square cm as is case with many raptors red tailed hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size as females are up to 25 larger than males as is typical in large raptors frequently reported mean body mass for red tailed hawks are somewhat higher than expansive research reveals part of this weight variation is seasonal fluctuations hawks tending to be heavier in winter than during migration or especially during trying summer breeding season and also due to clinal variation furthermore immature hawks are usually lighter in mass than their adult counterparts despite averaging somewhat longer winged and tailed male red tailed hawks may weigh from and females may weigh between lowest figure from a migrating female immature from goshute mountains nevada highest from a wintering female in wisconsin some sources claim largest females can weigh up to but whether this is in reference to wild

american buteos range from dainty compact builds of much smaller buteos such as broad winged hawk buteo platypterus to heavyset look of ferruginous hawks or rough legged buzzard which has a compact smaller appearance than a red tail in perched birds due to its small bill short neck and much shorter tarsus while opposite effect occurs in flying rough legs with their much bigger wing area in flight most other large north american buteo are distinctly longer and slenderer winged than red tailed hawks with much paler ferruginous hawk having peculiarly slender wings in relation to its massive chunky body swainson s hawks are distinctly darker on wing and ferruginous hawks are much paler winged than typical red tailed hawks pale morph adult ferruginous hawk can show mildly tawny pink but never truly rufous upper tail and like red tails tend to have dark markings on underwing coverts and can have a dark belly band but compared to red tailed hawks have a distinctly broader head their remiges are much whiter looking with very small dark primary tips they lack red tail s diagnostic marks and usually but not always also lack dark subterminal tail band and ferruginous have a totally feathered tarsus with its whitish head ferruginous hawk is most similar to krider s red tailed hawks especially in immature plumage but larger hawk has broader head and narrower wing shape and ferruginous immatures are paler underneath and on their legs several species share a belly band with typical red tailed hawk but they vary from subtle as in ferruginous hawk to solid blackish latter in most light morph rough legged buzzards more difficult to identify among adult red tails are its darkest variations as most species of buteo in north america also have dark morphs western dark morph

juveniles when perched show a whitish patch in outer half of upper surface of wing which other juvenile buteo lack most difficult to identify stages and plumage types are dark morph juveniles harlan s hawk and some krider s hawks latter mainly with typical ferruginous hawks as aforementioned some darker juveniles are similar enough to other buteo juveniles that it has been stated that they cannot be identified to species with any confidence under various field conditions however field identification techniques have advanced in last few decades and most experienced hawk watchers can distinguish even most plumaged immature hawks especially as wing shapes of each species becomes apparent after seeing many harlan s hawks are most similar to dark morph rough legged buzzards and dark morph ferruginous hawks wing shape is most reliable identification tool for distinguishing harlan s from these but also pale streaking on breast of harlan s which tends to be conspicuous in most individuals

flight showing red tail thumb red tailed hawk hovers in wind red tailed hawk is a member of subfamily buteoninae which includes about 55 currently recognized species unlike many lineages of accipitrid which seemed to have radiated out of africa or south asia buteoninae clearly originated in americas based on fossil records and current species distributions more than 75 of extant hawks from this lineage are found in americas p 1964 catalogue of fossil birds part 2 anseriformes through galliformes university of florida as a subfamily buteoninae seem to be rather old based on genetic materials with monophyletic genera baring several million years of individual evolution diverse in plumage appearance habitat prey and nesting preferences buteonine hawks are nonetheless typically medium to large sized hawks with ample wings while some fossil forms are very large larger than any eagle alive today red tailed hawk is a member of genus buteo a group of medium sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings members of this genus are known as buzzards in eurasia but hawks in north america under current classification genus includes approximately 28 species second most diverse of all extant accipitrid genera behind only accipiter buzzards of eurasia and africa are mostly part of genus buteo although two other small genera within subfamily buteoninae occur in africa at one time rufous tailed hawk buteo ventralis distributed in patagonia and some other areas of southern south america was considered part of red tailed hawk species with a massive distributional gap consisting of majority of south america rufous tailed hawk is considered a separate species now but two hawks still compromise a species pair or superspecies as they are clearly closely related rufous tailed hawk while comparatively little studied is very similar to red tailed hawk being about same size in body mass and possessing same wing structure and having more or less parallel nesting and hunting habits physically however rufous tailed hawk adults do not attain a bright brick red tail as do red tailed hawks instead retaining a dark brownish cinnamon tail with many blackish crossbars similar to juvenile red tailed hawks another more well known close relative to red tailed hawk is common buzzard buteo buteo which has been considered as its eurasian broad ecological counterpart and may too be within a species complex with red tailed hawk common buzzard in turn is also part of a species complex with other old world buzzards namely mountain buzzard buteo oreophilus forest buzzard buteo and madagascar buzzard buteo all six species in alleged species complex although varying notably in size and plumage characteristics that houses red tailed hawk share with it feature of blackish patagium marking which is missing in most other buteos subspecies there may be at least 14 recognized subspecies of buteo jamaicensis which vary in range and in coloration however not all authors accept every

harlan s hawks while wintering harlan s and krider s hawks frequently occur in same general areas but their habitat preferences there were highly different harlan s favoring thickly timbered areas and krider s in quite grassy open areas wintering krider s also used different and more open habitats than resident red tails these authors questioned whether krider s hawk was once a pure subspecies

hawk as a whole is second only to peregrine falcon and great horned owl amongst raptorial birds in terms of use of diverse habitats in north america beyond high arctic as they discontinuous as a breeder at tree line there are few other areas where red tailed hawks are absent or rare in north and central america some areas of unbroken forest especially lowland tropical forests rarely host red tailed hawks although they can occupy forested tropical highlands surprisingly well in deserts they can only occur where there is some variety of growth or ample rocky bluffs behavior thumb left red tailed hawks frequently have to cope with mobbing by crows red tailed hawk is a bird that is highly conspicuous to humans in much of its daily behavior most birds in resident populations which are well more than half of all red tailed hawks usually split non breeding season activity between territorial soaring flight and sitting on a perch often perching is for hunting purposes but many will sit on a tree branch for hours occasionally stretching on a single wing or leg to keep limber with no signs of hunting intent wintering typical pale morph hawks in arkansas were found to perch in open areas near top of tall isolated trees whereas dark morphs more frequently perched in dense groups of trees for many and perhaps most red tailed hawks being mobbed by various birds is a daily concern and can effectively disrupt many of their daily behaviors mostly larger passerines of multiple families from tyrant flycatchers to icterids will mob red tails despite that other raptors such as accipiter hawks and falcons are a notably greater danger to them most aggressive and dangerous attacker as such is likely to be various crows or other corvids i e american crows corvus due to fact that a mobbing group or murder of them can number up to as many as 75 crows which may cause grievous physical harm to a solitary hawk and if hawks are nesting separate parent hawks and endanger eggs or nestlings within their nest to predation by murder of crows mcgowan k j 2001 demographic and behavioral comparisons of suburban and rural american crows in avian ecology and conservation in an urbanizing world springer us pp 365 381 however evidence has shown that birds that mob red tailed hawks can tell how distended hawk s crop is i e upper chest and throat area being puffy versus flat feathered and sleek and thus mob more often when hawk is presumably about to hunt flight thumb red tailed hawks engaging in an inflight battle over prey painted by john james audubon in flight this hawk soars with wings often in a slight dihedral flapping as little as possible to conserve energy soaring is by far most efficient method of flight for red tailed hawks and is used more often than not active flight is slow and deliberate with deep wing beats wing beats are somewhat less rapid in active flight than in most other buteo hawks even heavier species such as ferruginous hawks tend to flap more swiftly due to morphology of wings in wind it occasionally hovers on beating wings and remains stationary above ground but this flight method is rarely employed by this species when soaring or flapping its wings it typically travels from but when diving may exceed although north american red tailed hawks will occasionally hunt from flight a great majority of flight by red tails in this area is for non hunting purpose during nest defense red tailed hawks may be capable of surprisingly swift vigorous flight while repeatedly diving at perceived threats vocalization cry of red tailed hawk is a two to three second hoarse rasping scream variously transcribed as kree eee ar eeee or that begins at a high pitch and slurs downward this cry is often described as sounding similar to a steam whistle red tailed hawk frequently vocalizes while hunting or soaring but vocalizes loudest and most persistently in defiance or anger in response to a predator or a rival hawk s intrusion into its territory at close range it makes a croaking possibly as a warning sound nestlings may give peeping notes with a soft sleepy quality that give way to occasional screams as they develop but those are more likely a soft whistle than harsh screams of adults their latter hunger call given anywhere from 11 days as recorded in alaska to post fledgling in california is different a two wailing klee uk food cry exerted by young when parents leave nest or enter their field of vision a strange mechanical sound not very unlike rush of distant water has been reported as uttered in midst of a sky dance a modified call of chirp is given during courtship while a low key duck like nasal may be given by pairs when they are relaxed fierce screaming cry of red tailed hawk is frequently used as a generic raptor sound effect in television shows and other media even if bird featured is not a red tailed hawk it is especially used in depictions of bald eagle migration red tailed hawks are considered partial migrants as in about northern third of their distribution which is most of their range in canada and alaska they almost entirely vacate their breeding grounds in coastal areas of north however such as in pacific northwest up to southern alaska and in nova scotia on atlantic red tailed hawks do not usually migrate more or less any area where snow cover is nearly continuous during winter months will show an extended absence of most red tailed hawks so some areas as far south as montana may show strong seasonal vacancies of red tails in southern michigan immature red tailed hawks tended to remain in winter only when voles were abundant during relatively long harsh winters up in michigan many more young ones were reported in northeastern mexico to opposite extreme

aspects of red tailed hawk central oklahoma and interior alaska master s thesis univ alaska fairbanks birds of any age tend to be territorial during winter but may shift ranges whenever food requirements demand it wintering birds tend to perch on inconspicuous tree perches seeking shelter especially if they have a full crop or are in midst of poor or overly windy weather adult wintering red tails tend to perch more prominently than immatures do which select lower or more secluded perches immatures are often missed in winter bird counts unless they are being displaced by dominant adults generally though immatures can seem to recognize that they are less likely to be attacked by adults during winter and can perch surprisingly close to them age is most significant consideration of wintering hawks hierarchy but size does factor in as larger immatures presumably usually females are less likely to displaced than smaller ones dark adult red tailed hawks appear to be harder to locate when perched than other red tails in oklahoma for example wintering adult harlan s hawks were rarely engaged in fights or chased by other red tails these harlan s tended to gather in regional pockets and frequently same harlan s occurred year to year in general migratory behavior is complex and reliant on each individual hawks decision making i e whether prey populations are sufficient enough to entice hawk to endure prolonged snow cover during fall migration departure may occur as soon as late september but peak movements occur in late october and full month of november in united states with migration ceasing after mid december northernmost migrants may pass over resident red tailed hawks in contiguous united states while latter are still in midst of brooding fledglings not infrequently several autumn hawk watches in ontario quebec and northern united states will record 4 500 8 900 red tailed hawks migrating through each fall with records of up to 15 000 in a season at hawk ridge hawk watch in duluth minnesota unlike some other buteos such as swainson s hawks and broad winged hawks buteo platypterus red tailed hawks do not usually migrate in groups instead passing by one by one and will only migrate on days when winds are favorable most migrants do not go past southern mexico in late autumn but a few may annually move down as far as to roughly as far as there are breeding red tailed hawks down in panama however there are now a few records of wintering migrant red tails turning up in colombia first records of species in that country or anywhere in south america spring northward movements may commence as early as late february with peak numbers usually occurring in late march and early april seasonal counts may include up to 19 000 red tails in spring at derby hill hawk watch in oswego new york sometimes more than 5 000 are recorded in a day there very most northerly migratory individuals may not reach breeding grounds until june even adults immature hawks migrate later than adults in spring on average but not generally speaking in autumn in northern great lakes immatures return in late may to early june when adults are already well into their nesting season and must find unoccupied ranges however in alaska adults tend to migrate before immatures in early to mid september to contrary of other areas probably as heavy snow fall begins yearlings that were banded in southwestern idaho stayed for about 2 months after fledging and then traveled long distances with a strong directional bias with 9 of 12 recovered southeast of study area six of these moved down to coastal lowlands in mexico and down to as far as guatemala here from their initial banding in california 35 hawks were banded as nestlings 26 were recovered at less than 50 miles away with multi directional juvenile dispersals nestlings banded in southern california sometimes actually traveled up to as far as north to oregon ranging to opposite extreme as far as a banded bird from sierra nevadas that moved south to sinaloa nestlings banded in green county wisconsin did not travel very far comparatively by october november but just a month later in december recoveries were found in varied states including illinois iowa texas louisiana and florida dietary biology thumb left juvenile eating a squirrel red tailed hawk is carnivorous and a highly opportunistic feeder it is said that nearly any small animal they encounter may be viewed as potential food their most common prey are small mammals such as rodents and lagomorphs but they will also consume birds reptiles fish amphibians and invertebrates prey varies considerably with regional and seasonal availability but usually centers on rodents accounting for up to 85 of a hawk s diet in total nearly 500 prey species have been recorded in their diet almost as many as great horned owl have been recorded as taking blumstein d t 1986 diets and breeding biology of red tailed hawks in boulder county 1985 nesting season colorado division of wildlife when 27 north american studies are reviewed mammals make up 65 3 of diet by frequency 20 9 by birds 10 8 by reptiles 2 8 by invertebrates and 0 2 by amphibians and fish geometric mean body mass of prey taken by red tailed hawks in north america averages about based on a pair of compilation studies from across continent regionally varying at least from staple prey excluding invertebrates has been claimed to weigh from ranging roughly from size of a small mouse or lizard to size of a black tailed jackrabbit lepus californicus daily food requirements range from 7 to 11 2 of their own body weight so that about three voles or an individual prey of equivalent weight are required daily for an average range adult talons and feet of red tailed hawks are relatively large for a buteo hawk in an average sized adult red tail hallux claw or rear talon largest claw on all accipitrids averages about in fact talons of red tails in some areas averaged of similar size to those of ferruginous hawks which can be considerably heavier and notably larger than those of only slightly lighter swainson s hawk this species may exert an average of about of pressure per square inch psi through its feet owing to its morphology red tailed hawks generally can attack larger prey than other buteo hawks typically can and are capable of selecting largest prey of up to their own size available at time that they are hunting though in all likelihood numerically most prey probably weighs about 20 of hawk s own weight as is typical of many birds of prey marti c d korpimaki e jaksic f m 1993 trophic structure of raptor communities a three continent comparison and synthesis in current ornithology pp 47 137 springer us red tailed hawks usually hunt by watching for prey activity from a high perch also known as still hunting upon being spotted prey is dropped down upon by hawk red tails often select highest available perches within a given environment since greater height they are at less flapping is required and faster downward glide they can attain toward nearby prey if prey is closer than average hawk may glide at a steep downward angle with few flaps if farther than average it may flap a few swift wingbeats alternating with glides perch hunting is most successful hunting method generally speaking for red tailed hawks and can account for up to 83 of their daily activities i e in winter wintering pairs may hunt together and aseasonally may join together to group hunt agile prey that they may have trouble catching by themselves such as tree squirrels this may consist of stalking opposites sides of a tree in order to surround squirrel and almost inevitably drive rodent to be captured by one after being flushed by other hawk thumb right typical hunting method of red tailed hawks is to dive down on its prey from a lofty perch most common flighted hunting method for red tail is to cruise approximately over ground with flap and glide type flight interspersed occasionally with harrier like quarters over ground this method is less successful than perch hunting but seems relatively useful for capturing small birds and may be show best results while hunting in hilly country hunting red tailed hawks readily will use trees bushes or rocks for concealment before making a surprise attack even showing a partial ability to dodge among trees in an accipiter like fashion among thick stands of spruce in alaska a dodging hunting flight was thought to be unusually important to red tails living in extensive areas of conifers with hawks even coming to ground and walking hurriedly in prey pursuit especially if prey was large a similar behavior to goshawks additional surprisingly swift aerial hunting has reported in red tails who habitually hunt bats in texas here bat hunting specialists would stoop with half close wings quite falcon like plowing through huge stream of bats exiting their cave roosts then zooming upwards with a bat in its talons these hawks would also fly parallel closely to stream then veer sharply into it and seize a bat in neotropics red tails have shown ability to dodge amongst forest canopy whilst hunting in kansas red tailed hawks were recorded sailing to catch flying insects a hunting method more typical of a swainson s hawk goss n s 1891 history of birds of kansas geo w crane and co topeka kansas alternately they may drop to ground to forage for insects like grasshoppers and beetles as well as other invertebrates and probably amphibians and fish except by water in latter cases hunting afoot seems to be particularly prevalent among immatures young red tailed hawks in northeastern florida were recorded often extracting earthworms from near surface of ground and some had a crop full of earthworms after rains ground hunting is also quite common on socorro island where there are no native land mammals and invertebrates are more significant to their overall diet a red tailed hawk was observed to incorporate an unconventional killing method which was drowning a heron immediately after capture one red tailed hawk was seen to try to grab a young ground squirrel and upon missing it screamed loudly which in turn caused another young squirrel to break into a run wherein it was captured whether this was an intentional hunting technique needs investigation upon capture smaller prey is taken to a feeding perch which is almost always lower than a hunting perch among small prey rodents are often swallowed whole as are shrews and small snakes while birds are plucked and beheaded even prey as small as chipmunks may take two to three bites to consume larger mammals of transportable size are at times beheaded and have part of their fur discarded then leftovers are either stored in a tree or fall to ground large prey especially if too heavy to transport on wing is often dragged to a secluded spot and dismantled in various ways if they can successfully carry what remains to a low perch they tend to feed until full and then discard rest mammals thumb thumbtime 12 red tailed hawk eating a rodent rodents are certainly type of prey taken most often by frequency but their contribution to prey biomass at nests can be regionally low and type variety and importance of rodent prey can be highly variable in total well over 100 rodent species have turned up diet of red tailed hawks rodents of extremely varied sizes may be hunted by red tails with species ranging in size from eastern harvest mouse reithrodontomys to marmots marmota ssp weighing some in spring although whether they can take full grown marmots is questionable at least some attacks on adult marmots like groundhogs marmota are abortive at times red tailed hawk is thought of as a semi specialized vole catcher but voles are a subsistence food that are more or less are taken until larger prey can be captured in an area of michigan immature hawks took almost entirely voles but adults were diversified feeders indeed meadow vole microtus was highest frequency prey species in 27 dietary studies across north america accounting for up to 54 of food at nests by frequency it is quite rare for any one species to make up more than half of food at any dietary study for red tailed hawks in total about 9 microtus species are known in overall diet with 5 other voles and lemmings known to be included in their prey spectrum another well represented species was prairie vole microtus which were primary food making up 26 4 of a sample of 1322 in eastern kansas while crepuscular in primary feeding activity voles are known to be active both day and night and so are reliable food for hawks than most non squirrel rodents which generally are nocturnal in activity indeed most other rodents are largely inaccessible to red tailed hawks due to their strongly nocturnal foraging patterns even though 24 species outside of voles and lemmings are known to be hunted woodrats are taken as important supplemental prey in some regions being considerably larger than most other rodents and some numbers of north american deermouse peromyscus may turn up largest representation of latter species was contributing 11 9 of diet in great basin of utah making them second best represented prey species there considering this limited association with nocturnal rodents high importance of pocket gophers in diet of red tailed hawks is puzzling to many biologists as these tend to be highly nocturnal and elusive by day rarely leaving confines of their burrow at least 8 species of pocket gopher are included in prey spectrum not to mention 5 species of pocket mice northern pocket gopher is particularly often reported and by frequency even turns up as third most often recorded prey species in 27 american dietary studies presumably hunting of pocket gophers by red tails which has possibly never been witnessed occurs in dim light at first dawn and last light of dusk when they luck upon a gopher out foraging thumb left voles are often caught by red tails especially immature hawks such as this may depend almost fully upon them by far most important prey among rodents are squirrels as they are almost fully diurnal all told nearly 50 species from squirrel family have turned up as food in particular where they are distributed ground squirrels are doubly attractive as a primary food source due to their ground dwelling habits as red tails prefer to attack prey that is terrestrial there are also many disadvantages to ground squirrels as prey they can escape quickly to security of their burrows they tend to be highly social and they are very effective and fast in response to alarm calls and a good deal of species enter hibernation that in coldest climates can range up to a 6 to 9 month period although those in warmer climates with little to no snowy weather often have brief dormancy and no true hibernation nonetheless red tailed hawks are devoted predators of ground squirrels especially catching incautious ones as they go out foraging which more often than not are younger animals a multi year study conducted on san joaquin experimental range in california seemingly still largest food study to date done for red tailed hawks with 4031 items examined showed that throughout seasons california ground squirrel was most significant prey accounting for 60 8 of breeding season diet and about 27 2 of diet for hawks year around because of extremely high density of red tailed hawks on this range some pairs came to specialize on diverse alternate prey which consisted variously of kangaroo rats lizards snakes or chipmunks one pair apparently lessened competition by focusing on pocket gophers instead despite being near center of ground squirrel activity in snake river nca primary food of red tailed hawks was townsend s ground squirrel urocitellus townsendii which made up nearly 21 of food in 382 prey items across several years

northern goshawks and great horned owls in kluane boreal forest of southwestern yukon phd thesis university of british columbia nearly as important in kluane lake was american red squirrel which constituted 29 8 of above sample red squirrels are highly agile dwellers on dense spruce stands which has caused biologists to ponder how red tailed hawks are able to routinely catch them it is possible that hawks catch them on ground such as when squirrels are digging their caches but theoretically dark color of harlan s hawks may allow them to more effectively ambush squirrels locally while american red squirrel turn up not infrequently as supplementary prey elsewhere in north america other tree squirrels seem to be comparatively infrequently caught at least during summer breeding season it is known that pairs of red tailed hawks will cooperative hunt tree squirrels at times probably mostly between late fall and early spring fox squirrels sciurus niger largest of north america s tree squirrels at are fairly regular supplemental prey but lighter presumably more agile eastern gray squirrel sciurus carolinensis appears to be seldom caught based on dietary studies while adult marmot may be difficult for red tailed hawks to catch young marmots are readily taken in numbers after weaning such as a high frequency of yellow bellied marmot marmota flaviventris in boulder

up 12 3 of a sample of 179 items outside of rodents most important prey for north american red tailed hawks is rabbits and hares of which at least 13 species are included in their prey spectrum by biomass and reproductive success within populations these are certain to be most significant food source to species at least in north america adult sylvilagus rabbits known to be hunted by red tails can range from brush rabbit sylvilagus to tres marias rabbit sylvilagus graysoni at while all leporids hunted may range pygmy rabbit to hares and jackrabbits potentially up twice hawk s own weight while primarily crepuscular in peak activity rabbits and hares often foraging both during day and night and so face almost constant predatory pressure from a diverse range of predators male red tailed hawks or pairs which are talented rabbit hunters are likely have higher than average productivity due to size and nutrition of meal ensuring healthy fast growing offspring most widely reported are

often than adults despite larger size of adults here averaging and that overall prey base was less diverse at this more northerly in both rochester and kluane lake number of snowshoe hares taken was considerably lower than numbers of ground squirrels taken differences of average characteristics of snowshoe hares that were hunted may be partially due to habitat extent of bog openings to dense

grouse were taken but relatively more juveniles were taken of this species than two other main contributors to biomass here snowshoe hare and townsend s ground squirrel as they are fairly independent early on and more readily available here adult grouse was estimated to average against average juvenile which in mid summer averaged beyond galliforms three other quite different families of birds make most significant contributions to red tailed hawk s avian diet none of these three families are known as particularly skilled or swift fliers but species are generally small enough that they would generally easily be more nimble in flight than a red tailed hawk one of these are woodpeckers if only for one species northern flicker colaptes which was best represented bird species in diet in 27 north american studies and was even fourth most often detected prey species of all woodpeckers are often a favorite in diet of large raptors as their relatively slow undulating flight makes these relatively easy targets flicker in particular is a highly numerous species that has similar habitat preferences to red tailed hawks preferring fragmented landscapes with trees and openings or parkland type wooded mosaics and often forage on ground for ants which may make them even more susceptible varied other woodpecker species may turn up in their foods from smallest to largest extant in north america but are much more infrequently detected in dietary studies another family relatively often selected prey family are corvids which despite their relatively large size formidable mobbing abilities and intelligence are also slower than average fliers for passerines 14 species of corvid are known to fall prey to red tailed hawks in kaibab plateau steller s jay cyanocitta were fourth most identified prey species 10 3 of diet american crows are also regularly detected supplemental prey in several areas even huge common raven corvus corax at at least as large as red tailed hawk itself may fall prey to red tails albeit very infrequently and only in a well staged ambush one of most surprising heavy contributors are icterids despite their slightly smaller size and tendency to travel in large wary flocks 12 species are known to be hunted one species pair are most often selected as they do not flock in same ways as many other icterids and often come to ground throughout their life history rarely leaving about shrub height western meadowlark neglecta in particular was third most often detected bird prey species in north america red winged blackbirds which are probably too small at an average weight of and fast for a red tailed hawk to ever chase on wing and do travel in huge flocks especially in winter are nonetheless also quite often found in their diet representing up to 8 of local diet for red tails it is possible that males which are generally bold and often select lofty perches from which to display are most regularly ambushed one bird species that often flocks with red winged blackbirds in winter is even better represented in red tail s diet non native european starling sturnus vulgaris being second most numerous avian prey species and seventh overall in north america although perhaps most vulnerable when caught unaware while calling on a perch a few starlings or various blackbirds may be caught by red tails which test agile

of reptiles by red tailed hawks but these were regionally biased towards east coast and upper midwest of united states fisher a k 1893 hawks and owls of united states in their relation to agriculture u s dept of agriculture bull 3 government printing office washington d c however locally predation on reptiles can be regionally quite heavy and they may become primary prey where large stable numbers of rodents and leporids are not to be found reliably nearly 80 species of reptilian prey have been recorded in diet at this point most predation is on snakes with more than 40 species known in prey spectrum most often found reptilian species in diet and sixth overall in 27 north american dietary studies was gopher snake pituophis red tails are efficient predators of these large snakes which average about in adults although they also take many small and young gopher snakes along columbia river in washington large colubrid snakes were found to be primary prey with eastern racer coluber constrictor which averages about in mature adults most often recorded at 21 3 of 150 prey items followed by gopher snake at 18 this riverine region lacks ground squirrels and has low numbers of leporids 43 2 of overall diet here was made up of reptiles while mammals made up 40 6 in snake river nca gopher snake was second most regularly recorded 16 2 of 382 items prey species over course of years and did not appear to be subject to extreme population fluctuations of mammalian prey here good numbers of smaller can be taken as well especially garter snakes red tailed hawks may engage in avoidance behavior to some extent with regard to venomous snakes for example on san joaquin experimental range in california they were recorded taking 225 gopher snakes against 83 western rattlesnakes crotalus based on surveys however rattlesnakes were five times more abundant on range than gopher snakes nonetheless at least 15 venomous snakes have been recorded in red tailed hawk s diet smallest known snake known to be hunted by red tailed hawks is snake linzey d w clifford m j 1981 snakes of virginia univ of virginia press charlottesville va red tailed hawks have been seen flying off with

2010 eastern indigo snake drymarchon couperi warnell school of forestry and natural resources university of georgia in north america fewer lizards are typically recorded in foods of red tailed hawk than are snakes probably because snakes are considerably better adapted to cooler seasonal weather with an extensive diversity of lizards found only in southernmost reaches of contiguous united states a fair number of lizards were recorded in diet in southern california and red tails can be counted among primary predatory threats to largish lizards in united states such as common sauromalus ater hollingsworth b d 1998 systematics of sauromalus with a phylogenetic analysis of other lizards herpetological monographs pp 38 191 however red tailed hawks ranging into neotropics regularly take numerous species of lizards this is especially true of hawks living on islands which are not naturally colonized by small mammals insular red tails commonly pluck up mostly tiny that may average only in adult mass depending on species not all tropical lizards taken by red tailed hawks are so dainty and some are easily as large as most birds and reptiles taken elsewhere such as adults of san esteban chuckwalla sauromalus varius and even those as large as cape iguanas ctenosaura and green iguanas iguana iguana though it is not clearly noted whether they can take healthy adults iguanas or not beyond snakes and lizards there are a few cases of red tailed hawks preying on baby or juvenile turtles i e gopher tortoise gopherus polyphemus desert tortoise gopherus and common snapping turtle serpentina other prey records of predation on amphibians is fairly infrequent it is thought that such prey may be slightly underrepresented as they are often consumed whole and may not leave a trace in pellets their fine bones may dissolve upon consumption so far as is known north american red tailed hawks have preyed upon 9 species of amphibian four of which are toads known amphibian prey has ranged to as small as red backed salamander cinereus smallest known vertebrate prey for red tailed hawks to american bullfrog invertebrates mostly represented by insects like beetles and crickets are better represented in stomach contents of red tailed hawks than their pellets or prey remains it is possible some invertebrate prey is ingested incidentally as in other various birds of prey they can in some cases be actually from stomachs of birds eaten by raptor however some red tails especially immatures early in their hunting efforts often do spend much of day on ground grabbing terrestrial insects and spiders red tailed hawks of puerto rico frequently consume puerto rican freshwater crabs epilobocera sinuatifrons which average k m s 2006 juvenile epilobocera sinuatifrons growth rates and ontogenetic shifts in feeding in wild populations phd thesis uga other island populations such as those on socorro island also feed often on terrestrial crabs here often blunting their claws while catching them fish are rarest class of prey based on dietary studies among rare instances of them capturing fish have included captures of wild channel catfish punctatus non native common carp cyprinus carpio and ornamental koi cyprinus as well some hawks that were seen scavenging on dead chum salmon oncorhynchus keta tepper j m 2015 predators of koi in 40th world small animal veterinary association congress bangkok thailand 15 18 may 2015 proceedings book pp 349 350 world small animal veterinary association interspecies predatory relationships as easily one of most abundant of all american raptorial birds red tailed hawks have been recorded as interacting with every other diurnal bird of prey due to extreme dietary plasticity of red tails food habits of other birds of prey regularly overlap considerably with red tails furthermore due to its ability to nest in varied habitats home ranges also frequently abut those of other raptor species most obvious similar species in their range are other buteo hawks especially larger species with a similar ecological niche two of larger more widespread other buteos are swainson s hawk and ferruginous hawks and as with many other birds of prey red tailed hawks occur in almost entirety of these birds breeding ranges these species have broadly similar breeding season diets especially ferruginous and red tailed hawks in some areas such as snake river nca diets of two species consist of more than 90 of same species and body mass of prey taken was similar therefore all three large buteo hawks defend their territories from each other with almost same degree of dedication that they defend from others of their own species in some cases territorial clashes of swainson s hawks and red tailed hawks can last up to 12 hours however birds involved are usually careful to avoid physical contact due to similarities of foods and their aggressive dispositions towards one another these buteos need some degree of partitioning in order to persist alongside one another and this usually is given by habitat preferences ferruginous hawk prefers open practically treeless prairie while of these red tailed hawks prefers most wooded areas with large trees while swainson s hawk prefer roughly intermediate areas where habitat is more open such as in cassia county idaho swainson s and ferruginous hawks have advantage in numbers and red tails are scarce however habitat alterations by humans such as fire suppression and recovering pasture usually favor red tailed hawk and are to detriment of other two species these practices have caused range expansions of many other species of birds but declines in many others of these three buteo species swainson s hawk is most dissimilar being a long distance migrant which travels to south america each winter and for much of year prefers to prey on insects except for during breeding when more nutritious food such as ground squirrels are mainly fed to young it also breeds notably later than other two species england a s m j houston c s 1997 swainson s hawk american ornithologists union surprisingly although it s slightly smaller in body mass and has notably smaller and presumably weaker feet than ferruginous and red tailed hawks swainson s is actually usually but not invariably dominant in territorial conflicts over other two part of this advantage is that swainson s hawk is apparently a superior flier both in long and short distance flights with its more pointed wing shape and lower wing loading allowing it more agile sustained and speedier flight that bulkier hawks cannot match janes s w 1985 interspecific interactions among grassland and shrubsteppe raptors smaller species wins behavioral interactions and habitat relations among grassland and shrubsteppe raptors 7 therefore in north central oregon swainson s hawks were shown to be more productive in prairie located trees and partially displaced prior breeding red tails several times although overall breeding success rates were not perceptibly decreased in latter hawk in chihuahuan desert of mexico swainson s hawks usually nested in lowlands and red tails nested in highlands but interspecies conflicts nevertheless were apparently quite frequent usually habitat preferences of red tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks are discrepant enough to keep serious territorial conflicts to a minimum however red tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks occasionally engaged in kleptoparasitism towards one another usually during winter red tails may be somewhat dominant based on prior reports in food conflicts but ferruginous hawk may also win these where they overlap hawk species may adjust their daily routine to minimize contact which tends to be costly of time and energy and may cause hawks to abandon their nests for long stretches of time which in turn leaves their young vulnerable to predation when habitats change rapidly often due to human interference and species nest more closely than natural partitioning would allow in all three nesting success can decline significantly beyond swainson s and ferruginous hawks six other buteos co occur with red tailed hawks in different parts of north america many of these are substantially smaller than red tails and avoid most serious territorial conflicts with them by nesting in deeper wooded areas one other larger species rough legged buzzard mostly nests far north of breeding range of red tailed hawks however in alaska they sometimes nest in same areas rough legged buzzards are both cliff and tree nesters and areas used by two species are not necessarily mutually exclusive but each seems to avoid other in part by differing breeding schedules mindell d p 1983 nesting raptors in southwestern alaska status distribution and aspects of biology alaska technical report 8 anchorage bureau of land management wintering rough legged buzzards may regularly come into conflict over food with red tailed hawks and seem to be subordinate to red tails with several records of them being chased off both kills and carrion by red tailed hawks during winter their hunting habits may keep them somewhat separate rough legged being a much more aerial hunter but rough legged buzzards usually withdrew if a red tailed hawk flew towards them there is at least one case however of a rough legged buzzard being victor of a conflict over a kill with a red tailed hawk red tailed hawks are conspicuously more aggressive and tend to be dominant over slenderer medium sized buteos such as red shouldered hawks and zone tailed hawks buteo in massachusetts red shoulder hawks used mixed forests and hardwoods as nesting habitat while red tails most often used in pitch pine and stunted oaks on cape cod nesting range overlap here most often occurred on white pine forests as habitat has opened over time red tailed hawks frequently took over former red shouldered hawk territories even using their nests in two cases in north central florida it was found during winter that red shouldered and red tailed hawk habitat usage blurred and because local habitat favors red shouldered hawks they easily outnumbered number of red tailed hawks in area therefore again with sufficient habitat partitioning two species can live near one another without negatively effecting one another in american southwest and texas two relatively large buteonine hawks also live alongside red tailed hawks harris s hawk and white tailed hawk usually habitat preferences kept conflicts to a minimum with red tailed hawk favoring taller more isolated saguaro cactus for nesting whereas other species outnumbered red tails in areas that were denser and more shrubby harris s hawk was determined to be a superior aerial hunter over red tailed hawks and could take down flying birds more routinely hawks and kites from outside buteonine lineage are usually substantially smaller or at least different enough in diet and habitat to largely avoid heavy conflict with red tailed hawks on occasion northern harriers circus hudsonius which have much lower wing loading will mob red tailed hawks out of their home ranges but in winter red tails seem to be dominant over them in conflicts over food bildstein k l 1988 northern harrier circus cyaneus in handbook of north american birds r s palmer ed new haven ct yale univ press pp 251 303 among accipiter hawks most similar to red tailed hawk in diet and size is northern goshawk in some areas prey species of these can be very similar and north american populations of goshawks take many more squirrels and leporids than their eurasian counterparts do it was found that feet and striking force of hunting goshawks was more powerful than that of red tailed hawk despite red tails being up to 10 heavier in some parts of north america therefore wild goshawks can dispatch larger prey both on average and at maximum prey size with some victims of female goshawks such as adult hares and galliforms such as turkey and capercaillie weighing up to or exceeding roughly in a comparative study in kaibab plateau of arizona however it was found that red tailed hawks had several population advantages red tails were more flexible in diet although there was a very broad overlap in prey species selected and nesting habitat than goshawks were as red tailed hawks in conflict with other more closely related buteo hawks rarely if ever result in mortality on either side goshawks and red tailed hawks do seem to readily kill one another adults of both species have been shown to be able to kill adults of other thumb a red tailed hawk is mobbed by a northern mockingbird in urban environment of philadelphia pennsylvania great horned owl occupies a similar ecological niche nocturnally to red tailed hawk there have been many studies that have contrasted ecology of these two powerful raptors great horned owl averages heavier and larger footed with northern populations averaging up to 26 heavier in owl than hawk however due in part to red tail s more extensive access to sizable prey such as ground squirrels several contrasting dietary studies found that estimated mean prey size of red tailed hawk at was considerably higher than that of great horned owl at also diet of red tailed hawk seems to be more flexible by prey type as only just over 65 of their diet is made of mammals whereas great horned owls were more restricted feeders on mammals selecting them 87 6 of time voous k h 1988 owls of northern hemisphere mit press 0262220350 however overall prey spectrum of great horned owls includes more species of mammals and birds but far less reptiles and great horned owl can attack prey of a wider size range including much larger prey items than any taken by red tailed hawks mean prey weights in different areas for great horned owls can vary from so is far more variable than that of red tailed hawks at and can be much larger by about 45 than largest estimated size known for red tailed hawk s mean prey weight but conversely owl can also subsist on prey communities averaging much smaller in body size than can support hawk jaksic f m marti c d 1984 comparative food habits of bubo owls in

biomes 298 306 some prey killed by great horned owls was estimated to weigh up to great horned owls and red tailed hawks compete not only for food but more seriously over nesting areas and home ranges great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and readily expropriate existing red tail nests habitat preferences of two species are quite similar and owl frequently uses old red tail nests but they do seem to prefer more enclosed nest locations where available over generally open situation around red tailed hawk nests sometimes in warmer areas owls may nest sufficiently early to have fledged young by time red tails start to lay however when there is a temporal overlap in reproductive cycles owl sometimes takes over an occupied red tail nest causing desertion red tailed hawks have an advantage in staple prey flexibility as aforementioned while great horned owl populations can be stressed when preferred prey is scarce especially when they rely on leporids such as hares and jackrabbits for example in alberta when snowshoe hares were at their population peak red tailed hawks did not increase in population despite taking many with only a slight increase in mean clutch size whereas owls fluctuated in much more dramatic ways in accordance with snowshoe hare numbers red tails migratory behavior was considered as likely cause of this lack of effect whereas great horned owls remained through winter and was subject to winter stress and greater risk of starvation w b 1972 predator prey relations and breeding biology of great horned owl and red tailed hawk in central alberta university of wisconsin madison as a nester great horned owl has advantage in terms of flexibility being somewhat spread more evenly across different habitats whereas in undisturbed areas red tailed hawks seem to nest more so in clusters where habitat is favorable predatory relationships between red tailed hawks and great horned owls are quite one sided with great horned owl likely overall major predator of red tails on other hand red tailed hawks are rarely if ever a threat to great horned owl occasionally a red tailed hawk can strike down an owl during day but only in a few singular cases has this killed an owl most predation by owls on hawks is directed at nestlings at point where red tails nestlings are old enough that parents no longer roost around nest at night up to at least 36 of red tailed hawk nestlings in a population may be lost to great horned owls adult and immature red tailed hawks are also occasionally preyed upon at night by great horned owls in any season in one case a great horned owl seemed to have ambushed killed and fed upon a full grown migrating red tail even in broad daylight occasionally both red tails and great horned owls will engage each other during day and even though red tailed hawk has advantage at this time of day either may succeed in driving away other despite their contentious relations two species may nest quite close to one another for example in saskatchewan smallest distance between nests was only in these close proximity areas all owl nests succeeded while only two red tail nests were successful in waterloo wisconsin two species were largely segregated by nesting times as returning red tailed hawks in april june were usually able to successfully avoid nesting in groves holding great horned owls which can begin nesting activities as early as february petersen l 1979 ecology of great horned owls and red tailed hawks in southeastern wisconsin technical bulletin no 111 department of natural resources in delaware county ohio and in central new york state divergence of hunting and nesting times usually allowed both species to succeed in nesting in all three areas any time red tails tried to nest closer to great horned owls their breeding success rates lowered considerably it is presumable that sparser habitat and prey resources increased closeness of nesting habits of two species to detriment of red tails due to nesting proximity to great horned owls mature red tails may have losses ranging from 10 to 26 red tailed hawks may face competition from a very broad range of predatory animals including birds outside of typically active predatory families carnivoran mammals and some reptiles such as snakes mostly these diverse kinds of predators are segregated by their hunting methods primary times of activity and habitat preferences in california both red tails and western diamondback rattlesnakes crotalus atrox live mainly on california ground squirrel but rattlesnake generally attacks squirrels in and around their burrows whereas hawks must wait until they leave burrows to capture them hawks have been observed following american badgers taxus to capture prey they flush and two are considered potential competitors especially in sparse sub desert areas where rodent foods they both favor are scarce competition over carcasses may occur with american crows and several crows usually about six or more working together can displace a hawk another avian scavenger turkey vulture aura is dominated by red tails and may be followed by red tails in order to supplant a carcass found by vulture with their keen sense of smell in some cases red tailed hawks may be considered lessened as food competitors by their lack of specialization for instance no serious competition probably occurs between them and

however as opposed to other medium to largish hawks which chase off red tails most likely as competition in much smaller raptors such as kestrels and smaller accipiter hawks their aggressive reaction to red tailed hawks is almost certainly an anti predator behavior although less prolific than goshawks some eagles and especially great horned owls red tailed hawks can and do prey upon smaller birds

is distracted such as those migrating on windy days feeding on their own prey and tending to their nest thumb at end of an aggressive flight in turn red tailed hawks may engage in behavior that straddles territorial exclusion and anti predator behavior to two much larger raptors in north america which actively hunt eagles red tails are most commonly seen flying towards and aggressively displacing both flying bald eagles haliaeetus and golden eagles aquila chrysaetos but may also to contrary unobtrusively duck down out of flight to an inconspicuous perch when an eagle is spotted behavioral variation is probably related to activity of hawks which may feel need to protect their nests and food resources while actively breeding but are not usually willing to risk their lives in attacking an eagle while migrating or wintering at times mobbing behavior of smaller raptors may cause both eagles to turn over and present their large talons to their attacker which can be dangerous for smaller hawk besides great horned owl two eagle species are only known animals known to regularly threaten red tailed hawks of any age in particular golden eagle is probably greatest daytime threat to fledged immature and adult red tails as these have turned up in many dietary studies of powerful eagle less efficient as a predator of red tails bald eagles nonetheless have been recording killing adults in some cases or more often red tailed hawk nests on occasion this may result in bald eagle bringing nestling red tails to their own nest and for some reason not killing them in some cases bald eagles inadvertently actually raise nestling red tails themselves and baby red tailed hawks may successfully fledge in one case a red tailed hawk was observed to kill a bald eagle chick whether this was predatory or competitive it quickly abandoned dead nestling after eagle s parents returned on several tropical islands which are often shared only with other hawks owls and falcons of only medium or small size and typically lack larger raptors or carnivorans red tailed hawk may be largest native predator and will in these cases be considered apex predator other than large birds of prey extensive records of predation on red tailed hawks is surprisingly poor in spite of several populations recording nestlings and eggs disappearing through presumed acts of natural predation most likely major predator of eggs and nestlings that disappear is raccoon which during its nocturnal foraging is a notorious enemy of nearly any kind of birds nest it is also known that unidentified large snakes probably consisting of same species that red tails so readily predate during broad daylight will prey upon nestling red tails rosen p c 2000 a monitoring study of vertebrate community ecology

hawks or when they can successful harass parent hawks via mobbing so severely that they temporarily leave nest blackflies simulium have been recorded as killing several red tail chicks through blood loss there are also several cases of possible prey turning tables on red tailed hawks and either maiming or killing them this is especially true of snakes with some prey species of pituophis and coluber known to overpower and nearly kill often hawk survives only if by human intervention not infrequently prey such as coral snakes and rattlesnakes may succeed in killing red tailed hawks with their venom even if they themselves are also killed and partially consumed peregrine falcons are also known to kill red tailed hawks that have come too close to their nests by stooping upon them reproduction thumb territorial adult chasing away an immature red tailed hawk courtship and pre laying behaviors pairs either court for first time or engage in courtship rituals to strengthen pre existing pair bonds before going into breeding breeding season usually begins in late february through march but can commence as early as late december in arizona and late january in wisconsin or to opposite extreme as late as mid april as in alberta in this pre nesting period high circling with much calling will occur one or both members of a pair may be involved courtship display often involves dangling legs at times pair will touching each other s wings and male s feet may touch female s back she may occasional roll over and present talons food passes are rarely reported high soaring occurs aseasonally circling above territory tends to be done noisily and conspicuously helping insure against possible takeovers spring circling of a pair can be a prelude to copulation a typical sky dance involves male hawk climbing high in flight with deep exaggerated beats and then diving precipitously on half closed wings at great speed checking and shooting back up or often plunging less steeply and repeating process in a full rollercoaster across sky sky dances are done on periphery of pair s territory and it appears to designate territory limits occasionally one male s sky dance may also trigger a sky dance by a neighboring male who may even run a parallel course in sky sky dances no longer occur after late incubation boundary flight displays may be engaged in by all four birds of 2 adjacent pairs cartwheeling with interlocking talons is also seen occasionally in spring almost always a territorial male expelling an intruding one latter often being a second or third year male that is newly mature a perched display with fluffed out breast feathers may too occur at this time even males that are in spring migration have been recorded engaging in a separate display circling at slow speed before partially closing wings dropping legs with talons spread and tilting from side to side a female hawk is usually around when migrating male does this but she does not engage in this display herself area of occupancy of breeding territories by pairs is variable based on regional habitat composition highest recorded density of pairs was in california where each pair occurred on which was actually just ahead of puerto rico where pair occupancy averaged in peak habitat largest known average territory sizes were surprisingly in ohio where average area of occupancy by pairs was recorded as in wisconsin mean ranges for males range from in males and from in females respectively in summer and winter here and elsewhere both members of pair stay quite close together throughout winter if they are sedentary on other hand migrant populations tend to separate while migrating and return to same territory to find its prior mate sometimes before they reach their home range in alaska returning migrant pairs were able to displace lone red tailed hawks that had stayed on residence especially lone males but sometimes even lone females in general red tailed hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies although pairs often mate for life replacement of mates can often be quite fast for this common bird species in one case in baja california when a female was shot on may 16 male of that pair was seen to have selected a new mate following day anthony a w 1893 birds of san pedro martir lower california zoe 4 228 247 in copulation female when perched tilts

field guide to western bird s nests of 520 species found breeding in united states west of mississippi river boston ma a field guide to western birds nests they are incubated primarily by female with male substituting when female leaves to hunt or merely stretch her wings rarely do males incubate more than four hours of daylight male brings most food to female while she incubates hatching development and brooding thumb parent in nest with chicks after 28 to 35 days of incubation averaging about three days longer in caribbean as does fledgling as compared to north american red tails eggs hatch over 2 to 4 days like most raptorial birds nestlings are altricial and nidicolous at hatching hatchlings average in body mass with no difference in sizes of sexes until young are about 29 days old for mass and 21 days or so for external linear standard measurements such as bill and talon size female broods them while male provides most of food to female and young which are also known as eyasses pronounced eye ez female feeds eyasses after tearing food into small pieces young red tails are active by second day when they issue soft peeping calls bounce and wave continuously with their wings by day 7 bouncing and peeping begin to wane and young start to peck at prey in their nest nestlings emit high whistling notes usually in response to adults overhead by day 10 sit up on by day 15 become aggressive toward intruders by day 16 strike out with talons and wings by day 21 begin to stretch wings and exercise regularly by day 30 after 42 to 46 days eyasses begin to leave nest and tear apart prey for themselves amount of food brought to nest daily varies considerably based on brood size and prey availability in alberta an average of is brought each day for 1 to 3 nestlings while in washington it was estimated a minimum of per day for 1 surviving nestling and in wisconsin an estimated was needed for 1 nestling and for 2 brooding is strenuous for parent red tails and both members of pair usually lose some weight especially female some females may lose over between hatching and fledging during brooding female may become aggressive to intruders including humans in east red tailed hawk females rarely defend nests from humans but historically in california and quite often still in alaska some female will dive repeatedly and savagely sometimes snapping off large branches in her temper occasionally stunning herself or inadvertently knocking down her own youngster if it is attempting to fledge apparently less extensive prior exposure they have to humans may make mature females more aggressive towards humans near nest although development is in most nests may sometimes be recorded and even siblicide may occur with parents feeding weaker younger chicks less so and both siblings and parents occasionally aggressively pecking of nest ultimately runt in such cases does not usually survive and may be either found crushed in nest discarded out of nest after starvation or consumed by parents or siblings however as a whole such killings are fairly rare and only occur when food supplies are extremely low often this being in sync with poor spring weather such as overly rainy or cold conditions if there is too much food such as california ground squirrels in california parents will discard remains after a day or two since decomposition of their prey invites infection other diseases and blood sucking insects to nest that may endanger nestlings however after about four weeks female often stops discarding leftover prey and increased presence of flies may form somewhat of a risk to disease in young but may also merely get young to leave nest sooner one nest in california had two females and one male attended to male performed his usual function but both females would brood and tend to nest additionally bald eagles have been recorded to occasionally adopt red tail fledglings into their nests as recorded in shoal harbor migratory bird sanctuary located near sydney british columbia on june 9 2017 a juvenile red tailed hawk was taken by a pair of bald eagles back to their nest whereupon chick originally taken as prey was accepted into family by both parents and eagles three fledglings after surviving six weeks amongst eagles fledgling nicknamed spunky by birdwatchers had successfully begun learning to hunt and fly showing that aggressive hawk was able to survive amongst a nest of much larger adoptive siblings fledging and immaturity thumb left a red tailed hawk chick peers out of its cliff nest young typically leave nest for first time and attempt their first flights at about 42 46 days after hatching but usually they stay very near nest for first few days during this period fledglings remain fairly sedentary though they may chase parents and beg for food parents deliver food directly or more commonly drop it near young short flights are typically undertaken for first 3 weeks after fledgling and young red tails activity level often doubles about 6 to 7 weeks after fledging young begin to capture their own prey which often consists of insects and frogs that young hawks can drop down to onto ground with relative ease at point they are 15 weeks old they may start attempts to hunt more difficult mammal and bird prey in sync with their newly developed skills for sustained flight and most are efficient mammal predators fairly soon after their first attempts at such prey shortly thereafter when young are around 4 months of age they become independent of their parents in some extreme cases juvenile red tails may prolong their association with their parents to as long as they are half a year old as was recorded in wisconsin after dispersing from parental territory juveniles from several nests may congregate and interact in a juvenile staging area although post fledgling siblings in their parents care are fairly social they are rarely seen together post distribution from their parents range usually newly independent young hawks leave breeding area and migrate if necessary earlier than adults do however opposite was true in extreme north of alaska where adults were recorded to leave first immature hawks in migratory populations tend to distribute further in winter than adults from these populations do d f erdman t c 1985 characteristics of autumn red tailed hawk migration through wisconsin in proc hawk migration conf vol 4 pp 107 136 immatures attempting to settle for winter often are harassed from territory to territory by older red tails settling only in small marginal areas in some cases such as near urban regions immatures may be driven to a small pockets of urban vegetation with less tree cover and limited food resources when a distant adult appear immature may drop from a prominent perch to a more concealed one in some cases hungry immature red tails have been recorded making attempts at hunting prey beyond their capacities expending valuable energy such as healthy adults of larger carnivorans such as coyotes canis latrans foxes and badgers and healthy flying passerines there are some cases of red tailed hawks presumably younger than two years of age attempting to breed often with an adult bird of opposite sex such cases have been recorded in alberta arizona and wisconsin with about half of these attempts being successful at producing young millsap b a 1981 distributional status of falconiformes in west central arizona with notes on ecology reproductive success and management us bureau of land management phoenix district office however while adult plumage and technically sexual maturity is attained at two years old many red tails do not first successfully breed until they are around 3 years of age breeding success and longevity thumb a recent fledgling on ground probably making its early hunting attempts breeding success is variable due to many factors estimated nesting success usually falls between 58 and 93 nesting success rates are probably drive primarily by prey populations regional habitat composition competition levels with other red tailed hawks predation rates often due to great horned owls or perhaps raccoons and human disturbance levels in oregon specifically nesting success varied primarily based on dispersion and density of perches secondarily to ground squirrel abundance and whether nest of other pairs red tails was directly visible from a nest repeated disturbances at nest early in nesting cycle may cause abandonment of eggs or nestlings in some cases but seemingly pairs are less likely to abandon young later in season in cases of human disturbance 30 of nesting deaths in a study from wisconsin were from nestlings falling to their death or nest collapsing in puerto rico habitat appeared to be primary driver of breeding success as in lowland pastures nesting success was 43 producing a mean number of fledglings of 1 5 whereas in cloud forest success was 34 producing a mean of 0 7 fledglings a modelling study in puerto rico showed that apart from adult survival nestling survival had second greatest influence on population growth in wyoming 12 pairs on a 12 square mile tract produced an average of 1 4 young per pair in comparison mean number of fledglings was 0 96 in michigan 1 36 in montana and was 1 4 in appalachians in wisconsin number of young successfully to fledge ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 from year to year probably depending on staple prey numbers record lifespan in wild for a red tailed hawk is 25 years and 5 months from banding studies in comparison lifespans of up to 29 5 years have been recorded in captivity in wild other red tailed hawks have lived for at least 25 years for example pale male was born in 1990 and in spring 2014 is still raising eyasses however of banded wild red tailed hawks in one s recordings only 31 were reported to have survived to 17 years of age and only 11 survived for 20 years average mortality rate at 1 year of age for red tails is 54 and thereafter is around 20 from banding sources estimated average lifespan of red tailed hawks who attain maturity per palmer 1988 was claimed as only 6 to 7 years main causes of mortality considered as electrocution on power lines other collisions shooting consumption of poisoned baits set for other animals and collision with vehicles and other crafts while most mortality of young red tails is at least mainly due to natural causes mortality of fledged or older red tails is now mostly attributable to human killing accidental or intentional as well as flying into manmade materials hawks in urban areas are threatened by use of rat traps and poisoned bait to kill rodents this generally consists of warfarin cookies which induce internal bleeding in rats and mice and a hawk that ingests rodents who have consumed rat poison can itself be affected raptors and rat poison allaboutbirds org 15 july 2015 red tailed hawks are also vulnerable to fatal bacterial infections include peritonitis myocarditis and as well as some forms of viral infection to which immature hawks especially as they often have less access to coverage in poor weather conditions are most vulnerable neither this nor

publishers they are also long lived and highly disease resistant allowing a falconer to maintain a red tailed hawk as a hunting companion for potentially up to two decades there are fewer than 5 000 falconers in united states so despite their popularity any effect on red tailed hawk population estimated to be about one million in united states is negligible thumb a falconer s red tailed hawk comes in for a landing not being as swift as falcons or accipiters red tailed hawks are usually used to hunt small game such as rabbits and squirrels as well as larger quarry such as hares however some individuals may learn to ambush game birds on ground before they are able to take off and accelerate to full speed or as they have fly into cover after a chase some have even learned to use a falcon like diving stoop to capture challenging game birds such as pheasants in open country in course of a typical hunt a falconer using a red tailed hawk most commonly releases hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point falconer who may be aided by a dog then attempts to flush prey by stirring up ground cover a well trained red tailed hawk will follow falconer and dog realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game once a raptor catches game it does not bring it back to falconer instead falconer must locate bird and its captured prey make in
