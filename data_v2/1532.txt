tupolev tu 80 was a soviet prototype for a longer ranged version of tupolev tu 4 bomber built after world war ii it was cancelled in 1949 in favor of tupolev tu 85 program which offered even more range sole prototype was used in various test programs before finally being used as a target development tu 80 was designed as a modernized and enlarged tu 4 with greater range this was to be achieved by use of more fuel efficient engines better aerodynamics and added fuel tanks it was intended to have a range of and carry a maximum bombload of with a top speed of work began on design in february 1948 and this was confirmed by a council of ministers order of 12 june that required prototype be ready for state acceptance trials in july 1949 gordon p 112 forward portion of fuselage was redesigned with an airliner style stepped windscreen and fuselage was lengthened by almost which allowed bomb bays and their doors to be lengthened radar and its operator were moved into forward pressurized compartment and radar itself was located in chin position in a new streamlined fairing wings were enlarged to a total of and rubber deicing boots were replaced by more efficient and aerodynamic bleed air engine nacelles were redesigned with smaller cross sections with less drag originally shvetsov ash or dobrynin vd engines were considered but neither engine was ready so shvetsov ash was used fully feathering propellers were also used all of these changes increased lift drag ratio to 18 from 17 0 of tu 4 gordon pp 112 14 construction of tu 80 began in november 1948 using as many tu 4 components as possible to speed up construction but first flight was not until 1 december 1949 after council of ministers had canceled program on 16 september 1949 in favor of tu 85 which was expected to have much better performance tu 80 became a research aircraft testing reversible pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft it eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range gordon p 114 specifications see also references tu 0080 category 1940s soviet bomber aircraft category abandoned military aircraft projects of soviet union category soviet union united states relations category four engined tractor aircraft tu 80 category mid wing aircraft category aircraft first flown in 1949 category four engined piston aircraft
