had negotiated on sardinia s behalf after bombardment of algiers in 1816 seeing that karamanli had no intention of offering acceptable terms sivori decided his best course of action would be to attack tripoli before returning to his squadron sivori managed to get british consul to take under his protection what sardinians remained in tripoli salvori s force had a significant advantage over tripolitanian fleet which only had a 12 gun brig and a pair of 6 gun schooners defending harbor despite disadvantage in naval power karamanli had significant forces ashore and several forts and shore

consul at tripoli sardinian commander sent dutch vessel back into port with a message to karamanli that if he did not commence negotiations further military action would be taken against city rather than suffer continued action from sardinians karamanli acceded to sardinian requests and sent an envoy out to sardinian squadron burke 1826 p 144 upon negotiating with tripolitanian envoy sivori was able to get an agreement restoring diplomatic situation to as it had been prior to events that had sparked hostilities in order to ensure that karamanli would abide by terms of treaty sardinians

had sardinian consulate s national colors raised and saluted by his forces next day sivori upon invitation arrived at karamanli s palace where he and his force were greeted with great respect and honor by monarch though a stipulation was included in peace treaty that required sardinia to pay tripoli 7 000 gold francs it was canceled and as a result long practice of sardinian tributary payments
