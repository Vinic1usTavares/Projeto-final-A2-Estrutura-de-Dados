clarinet is a family of woodwind instruments it has a single reed mouthpiece a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore and a flared bell a person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist sometimes spelled clarinettist while similarity in sound between earliest clarinets and trumpet may hold a clue to its name other factors may have been involved during late baroque era composers such as bach and handel were making new demands on skills of their trumpeters who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in high or as it came to be called clarion register since trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons melodic passages would often require use of highest part of trumpet s range where harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to scales or arpeggios of lower register trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by term clarino and this in turn came to apply to musicians themselves it is probable that term clarinet may stem from diminutive version of clarion or clarino and it has been suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly developed mock trumpets pino pp 198 and 233 johann christoph denner is generally believed to have invented clarinet in germany around year 1700 by adding a register key to earlier chalumeau usually in key of c over time additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve tone and playability in modern times most popular clarinet is b clarinet however clarinet in a just a semitone lower is regularly used in orchestral music an orchestral clarinetist must own both a clarinet in a and b since repertoire is divided fairly evenly between two since middle of 19th century bass clarinet nowadays invariably in b but with extra keys to extend register down a few notes has become an essential addition to orchestra clarinet family ranges from extremely rare bbb octo contrabass to a piccolo clarinet clarinet has proved to be an exceptionally flexible instrument used in classical repertoire as in concert bands military bands marching bands klezmer jazz and other styles etymology word clarinet may have entered english language via french clarinette feminine diminutive of old french clarin or clarion or from provencal clarin oboe it would seem however that its real roots are to be found among some of various names for trumpets used around renaissance and baroque eras clarion clarin and italian clarino are all derived from medieval term claro which referred to an early form of trumpet oxford companion to music percy a scholes tenth edition trumpet family 3 this is probably origin of italian clarinetto itself a diminutive of clarino and consequently of european equivalents such as clarinette in french or german according to johann gottfried walther writing in 1732 reason for name is that it sounded from far off not unlike a trumpet english form clarinet is found as early as 1733 and now archaic appears from 1784 until early years of 20th century rendall pp 1 2 69 characteristics sound cylindrical bore is primarily responsible for clarinet s distinctive timbre which varies between its three main registers known as chalumeau clarion and altissimo tone quality can vary greatly with clarinetist music instrument mouthpiece and reed differences in instruments and geographical isolation of clarinetists led to development from last part of 18th century onwards of several different schools of playing most prominent were german viennese traditions and french school latter was centered on clarinetists of conservatoire de paris lawson p 87 proliferation of recorded music has made examples of different styles of playing available modern clarinetist has a diverse palette of acceptable tone qualities to choose from a and b clarinets have nearly same bore and use same mouthpiece pino p 26 orchestral clarinetists using a and b instruments in a concert could use same mouthpiece and often same barrel see usage below a and b have nearly identical tonal quality although a typically has a slightly warmer sound tone of e clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures bass clarinet has a characteristically deep mellow sound while alto clarinet is similar in tone to bass though not as dark range clarinets have largest pitch range of common woodwinds intricate key organization that makes this possible can make playability of some passages awkward bottom of clarinet s written range is defined by keywork on each instrument standard keywork schemes allowing a low e on common b clarinet lowest concert pitch depends on transposition of instrument in question nominal highest note of b clarinet is a semitone higher than highest note of oboe since clarinet has a wider range of notes lowest note of b clarinet is significantly deeper a minor or major sixth than lowest note of oboe nearly all soprano and piccolo clarinets have keywork enabling them to play e below middle c as their lowest written note in scientific pitch notation that sounds d3 on a soprano clarinet or c4 i e concert middle c on a piccolo clarinet though some b clarinets go down to e3 to enable them to match range of a clarinet on b soprano clarinet concert pitch of lowest note is d3 a whole tone lower than written pitch most alto and bass clarinets have an extra key to allow a written e3 modern professional quality bass clarinets generally have additional keywork to written c3 shigeru yamaha

attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts and fingerings as high as a7 exist range of a clarinet can be divided into three distinct registers lowest register from low written e to written b above middle c b4 is known as chalumeau register named after instrument that was clarinet s immediate predecessor middle register is known as clarion register sometimes in u s as clarino register from italian and spans just over an octave from written b above middle c b4 to c two octaves above middle c c6 it is dominant range for most members of clarinet family top or altissimo register consists of notes above written c two octaves above middle c c6 all three registers have characteristically different sounds chalumeau register is rich and dark clarion register is brighter and sweet like a trumpet clarion heard from afar altissimo register can be piercing and sometimes shrill acoustics thumb sound wave propagation in soprano clarinet sound is a wave that propagates through air as a result of a local variation in air pressure production of sound by a clarinet follows these steps acoustics of clarinet university of new south wales mouthpiece and reed are surrounded by player s lips which put light even pressure on reed and form an airtight seal air is blown past reed and down instrument in same way a flag flaps in breeze air rushing past reed causes it to vibrate as air pressure from mouth increases amount reed vibrates increases until reed hits mouthpiece at this point reed stays pressed against mouthpiece until either of reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave bumps into reed and opens it each time reed opens a puff of air goes through gap after which reed swings shut again when played loudly reed can spend up to 50 of time shut puff of air or compression wave around 3 greater pressure than surrounding air travels down cylindrical tube and escapes at point where tube opens out this is either at closest open hole or at end of tube see diagram image 1 more than a neutral amount of air escapes from instrument which creates a slight vacuum or rarefaction in clarinet tube this rarefaction wave travels back up tube image 2 rarefaction is reflected off sloping end wall of clarinet mouthpiece opening between reed and mouthpiece makes very little difference to reflection of rarefaction wave this is because opening is very small compared to size of tube so almost entire wave is reflected back down tube even if reed is completely open at time wave hits image 3 when rarefaction wave reaches other open end of tube air rushes in to fill slight vacuum a little more than a neutral amount of air enters tube and causes a compression wave to travel back up tube image 4 once compression wave reaches mouthpiece end of tube it is reflected again back down pipe however at this point either because compression wave bumped reed or because of natural vibration cycle of reed gap opens and another puff of air is sent down pipe original compression wave now greatly reinforced by second puff of air sets off on another two trips down pipe travelling 4 pipe lengths in total before cycle is repeated again cycle repeats at a frequency relative to how long it takes a wave to travel to first open hole and back twice i e four times length of pipe for example when all holes bar very top one are open i e trill b key is pressed note a4 440 hz is produced this represents a repeat of cycle 440 times per second in addition to this primary compression wave other waves known as harmonics are created harmonics are caused by factors including imperfect wobbling and shaking of reed reed sealing mouthpiece opening for part of wave cycle which creates a flattened section of sound wave and imperfections bumps and holes in bore a wide variety of compression waves are created but only some primarily odd harmonics are reinforced these extra waves are what gives clarinet its characteristic tone bore is cylindrical for most of tube with an inner bore diameter between but there is a subtle hourglass shape with thinnest part below junction between upper and lower joint baines anthony 1991 woodwind instruments and their history dover reduction is depending on maker this hourglass shape although invisible to naked eye helps to correct pitch scale discrepancy between chalumeau and clarion registers perfect twelfth diameter of bore affects characteristics such as available harmonics timbre and pitch stability how far player can bend a note in manner required in jazz and other music bell at bottom of clarinet flares out to improve tone and tuning of lowest notes most modern clarinets have undercut tone holes that improve intonation and sound undercutting means chamfering bottom edge of tone holes inside bore acoustically this makes tone hole function as if it were larger but its main function is to allow air column to follow curve up through tone hole surface tension instead of blowing past it under increasingly directional frequencies of upper registers fixed reed and fairly uniform diameter of clarinet give instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at octave when thumb register hole is pinched open while clarinet with its cylindrical bore at twelfth adjusting angle of bore taper controls frequencies of overblown notes harmonics changing mouthpiece s tip opening and length of reed changes aspects of harmonic timbre or voice of clarinet because this changes speed of reed vibrations generally goal of clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of reed vibrate as possible making sound fuller warmer and potentially louder lip position and pressure shaping of vocal tract choice of reed and mouthpiece amount of air pressure created and evenness of airflow account for most of clarinetist s ability to control tone of a clarinet almeida a j sheahan m judge j r dang k s wolfe j 2010 clarinet parameter cartography automatic mapping of sound produced as a function of blowing pressure and reed force in proc int symp music acoustics a highly skilled clarinetist will provide ideal lip and air pressure for each frequency note being produced they will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles airflow will also be carefully controlled by using strong stomach muscles as opposed to weaker and erratic chest muscles and they will use diaphragm to oppose stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure breathing edu 2013 their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with tone being produced covering or uncovering tone holes varies length of pipe changing resonant frequencies of enclosed air column and hence pitch a clarinetist moves between chalumeau and clarion registers through use of register key clarinetists call change from chalumeau register to clarion register break open register key stops fundamental frequency from being reinforced and reed is forced to vibrate at three times speed it was originally this produces a note a twelfth above original note most instruments overblow at two times speed of fundamental frequency octave but as clarinet acts as a closed pipe system reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a puff of air at time previous puff is returning as a rarefaction this means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away chalumeau register plays fundamentals whereas clarion register aided by register key plays third harmonics a perfect twelfth higher than fundamentals first several notes of altissimo range aided by register key and venting with first left hand hole play fifth harmonics a major seventeenth a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth above fundamentals clarinet is therefore said to overblow at twelfth and when moving to altissimo register seventeenth by contrast nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at octave or like ocarina and tonette do not overblow at all a clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes a chromatic octave and a half from bottom e to b in its lowest register to play chromatic scale this overblowing behavior explains clarinet s great range and complex fingering system fifth and seventh harmonics are also available sounding a further sixth and fourth a flat diminished fifth higher respectively these are notes of altissimo register this is also why inner waist measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies highest notes can have a shrill piercing quality and can be difficult to tune accurately different instruments often play differently in this respect due to sensitivity of bore and reed measurements using alternate fingerings and adjusting embouchure helps correct pitch of these notes since approximately 1850 clarinets have been nominally tuned according to twelve tone equal temperament older clarinets were nominally tuned to a skilled performer can use his or her embouchure to considerably alter tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature however certain clarinetists such as richard stoltzman use vibrato in classical music special fingerings may be used to play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals lawson pp 174 175 around 1900 dr richard h stein a berlin musicologist made a quarter tone clarinet which was soon abandoned years later another german fritz schuller of built a quarter tone clarinet with two parallel bores of slightly different lengths whose tone holes are operated using same keywork and a valve to switch from one bore to other thumb 150px left schuller s quarter tone clarinet construction right thumb 350px construction of a clarinet oehler system materials clarinet bodies have been made from a variety of materials including wood plastic hard rubber metal resin and ivory rendall pp 11 15 vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from african hardwood african blackwood or grenadilla rarely because of diminishing supplies honduran rosewood and sometimes even historically other woods notably boxwood were used most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin such as abs is selmer s trademark name for its type of plastic metal soprano clarinets were popular in early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them metal construction is still used for bodies of some contra alto and contrabass clarinets and necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets lawson p 74 ivory was used for a few 18th century clarinets but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well buffet crampon s greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier hard rubber such as ebonite has been used for clarinets since 1860s although few modern clarinets are made of it clarinet designers alastair hanson and tom ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber hanson clarinets of england manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite known as btr reinforced grenadilla this material is also not affected by humidity and weight is same as that of a wooden clarinet mouthpieces are generally made of hard rubber although some inexpensive mouthpieces may be made of plastic other materials such as crystal glass wood ivory and metal have also been used pino p 200 ligatures are often made of metal and plated in nickel silver or gold other materials include wire wire mesh plastic naugahyde string or leather reed clarinet uses a single reed made from cane of a type of grass reeds may also be manufactured from synthetic materials ligature reed to mouthpiece when air is blown through opening between reed and mouthpiece facing reed vibrates and produces clarinet s sound basic reed measurements are as follows tip wide lay long distance from place where reed touches mouthpiece to tip gap distance between underside of reed tip and mouthpiece adjustment to these measurements is one method of affecting tone color most clarinetists buy manufactured reeds although many make adjustments to these reeds and some make their own reeds from cane blanks reeds come in varying degrees of hardness generally indicated on a scale from one soft through five hard this numbering system is not standardized reeds with same number often vary in hardness across manufacturers and models reed and mouthpiece characteristics work together to determine ease of playability pitch stability and tonal characteristics components note a bohm system soprano clarinet is shown in photos illustrating this section however all modern clarinets have similar components thumb 200px left clarinet reed mouthpiece and ligature reed is attached to mouthpiece by ligature and top half inch or so of this assembly is held in player s mouth in past clarinetists used to wrap a string around mouthpiece and reed instead of using a ligature formation of mouth around mouthpiece and reed is called embouchure reed is on underside of mouthpiece pressing against player s lower lip while top teeth normally contact top of mouthpiece some players roll upper lip under top teeth to form what is called a double lip embouchure pino p 59 adjustments in strength and shape of embouchure change tone and intonation tuning it is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve pressure on upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to top of mouthpiece or putting temporary padding on front lower teeth commonly from folded paper pino p 38 thumb 200px right barrel of a b soprano clarinet next is short barrel this part of instrument may be extended to fine tune clarinet as pitch of clarinet is fairly temperature sensitive some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out barrel and thus increasing instrument s length particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments such as in an orchestra or concert band some performers use a plastic barrel with a that adjusts barrel length on basset horns and lower clarinets barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck thumb 200px left upper joint of a bohm system clarinet main body of most clarinets is divided into upper joint holes and most keys of which are operated by left hand and lower joint with holes and most keys operated by right hand some clarinets have a single joint

models of clarinet such as many albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher end bohm system clarinets register key is a wraparound key with key on back of clarinet and pad on front advocates of wraparound register key say it improves sound and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in tube beneath pad bore clarinets net nevertheless there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment i e it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close hole securely what s my french stencil clarinet worth net body of a modern soprano clarinet is

origin of clarinet clarinets net middle east and europe since middle ages such as and double clarinet lawson pp 14 15 modern clarinet developed from a baroque instrument called chalumeau this instrument was similar to a recorder but with a single reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore lacking a register key it was played mainly in its fundamental register with a limited range of about one and a half octaves it had eight finger holes like a recorder and two keys for its two highest notes at this time contrary to modern practice reed was placed in contact with upper lip around turn of 18th century chalumeau was modified by converting one of its keys into a register key to produce first clarinet this development is usually attributed to german instrument maker johann christoph denner though some have suggested his son jacob denner was inventor this instrument played well in middle register with a loud shrill sound so it was given name clarinetto meaning little trumpet from clarino early clarinets did not play well in lower register so players continued to play for low notes as clarinets improved chalumeau fell into disuse and these notes became known as chalumeau register original denner clarinets had two keys and could play a chromatic scale but various makers added more keys to get improved tuning easier fingerings and a slightly larger range classical clarinet of mozart s day typically had eight finger holes and five keys clarinets were soon accepted into orchestras later models had a mellower tone than originals mozart d 1791 liked sound of clarinet he considered its tone closest in quality to human voice and wrote numerous pieces for instrument and by time of beethoven c 1800 1820 clarinet was a standard fixture in orchestra pads next major development in history of clarinet was invention of modern pad because early clarinets used felt pads to cover tone holes they leaked air this required pad covered holes to be kept to a minimum restricting number of notes clarinet could play with good tone in 1812 iwan muller a baltic german community born clarinetist and inventor developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather or fish bladder it was airtight and let makers increase number of pad covered holes muller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys this allowed instrument to play in any key with near equal ease over course of 19th century makers made many enhancements to muller s clarinet such as albert system and system all keeping same basic design modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic pads clarinet lessons and rentals in buford dunwoody and lilburn ga com retrieved on 2015 05 12 arrangement of keys and holes final development in modern design of clarinet used in most of world today was introduced by hyacinthe klose in 1839 he devised a different arrangement of keys and finger holes which allow simpler fingering it was inspired by boehm system developed for flutes by theobald bohm klose was so impressed by bohm s invention that he named his own system for clarinets boehm system although it is different from one used on flutes this new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became standard and today boehm system is used everywhere in world except germany and austria these countries still use a direct descendant of mueller clarinet known as oehler system clarinet pino p 212 also some contemporary dixieland players continue to use albert system clarinets lawson pp 31 189 other key systems have been developed many built around modifications to basic bohm system full bohm full bohm system clarinet mazzeo mcintyre includes images of booklet and fingering chart benade nx and reform boehm system for example each of these addressed and often improved issues of particular weak tones or simplified awkward fingerings but none has caught on widely among players and boehm system remains standard to date usage and repertoire use of multiple clarinets modern orchestral standard of using soprano clarinets in b and a has to do partly with history of instrument and partly with acoustics aesthetics and economics before about 1800 due to lack of airtight pads see history practical woodwinds could have only a few keys to control accidentals notes outside their diatonic home scales low chalumeau register of clarinet spans a twelfth an octave plus a perfect fifth so clarinet needs keys holes to produce all nineteen notes in this range this involves more keywork than on instruments that overblow at octave oboes flutes bassoons and saxophones for example which need only twelve notes before overblowing clarinets with few keys cannot therefore easily play chromatically limiting any such instrument to a few closely related keys for example an eighteenth century clarinet in c could be played in f c and g and their relative minors with good intonation but with progressive difficulty and poorer intonation as key moved away from this range in contrast for octave overblowing instruments an instrument in c with few keys could much more readily be played in any key this problem was overcome by using three clarinets in a b and c so that early 19th century music which rarely strayed into remote keys five or six sharps or flats could be played as follows music in 5 to 2 sharps b major to d major concert pitch on a clarinet d major to f major for player music in 1 sharp to 1 flat g to f on c clarinet and music in 2 flats to 4 flats b to a on b clarinet c to b for clarinetist difficult key signatures and numerous accidentals were thus largely avoided with invention of airtight pad and as key technology improved and more keys were added to woodwinds need for clarinets in multiple keys was reduced lawson p 25 however use of multiple instruments in different keys persisted with three instruments in c b and a all used as specified by composer lower pitched clarinets sound mellower less bright and c clarinet being highest and therefore brightest of three fell out of favour as other two could cover its range and their sound was considered better while clarinet in c began to fall out of general use around 1850 some composers continued to write c parts after this date e g bizet s symphony in c 1855 tchaikovsky s symphony no 2 1872 smetana s overture to bartered bride 1866 and ma 1874 dvorak s slavonic dance op 46 no 1 1878 brahms symphony no 4 1885 mahler s symphony no 6 1906 and richard strauss deliberately reintroduced it to take advantage of its brighter tone as in der rosenkavalier 1911 lawson pp 42 63 while technical improvements and an equal tempered scale reduced need for two clarinets technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted and a has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument in addition by late 19th century orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in a that disuse of this instrument was not practical attempts were made to standardise to b instrument between 1930 and 1950 e g tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral a parts on b clarinet including solos written for a clarinet and some manufacturers provided a low e on b to match range of a but this failed in orchestral sphere similarly there have been e and d instruments in upper soprano range b a and c instruments in bass range and so forth but over time e and b instruments have become predominant lawson b instrument remains dominant in concert bands and jazz b and c instruments are used in some ethnic traditions such as klezmer classical music in classical music clarinets are part of standard orchestral and concert band instrumentation orchestra frequently includes two clarinetists playing individual parts each

is generally only one player per part on other clarinets there are not always e clarinet alto clarinet and contra alto clarinets contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music but all three are quite common this practice of using a variety of clarinets to achieve variety was common in 20th century classical music and continues today however many clarinetists and conductors prefer to play parts originally written for obscure instruments on b or e clarinets which are often of better quality and more prevalent and accessible clarinet is widely used as a solo instrument relatively late evolution of clarinet when compared to other orchestral woodwinds has left solo repertoire from classical period and later but few works from baroque era many clarinet concertos have been written to showcase instrument with concerti by mozart copland and weber being well known many works of chamber music have also been written for clarinet common combinations are clarinet and piano including
