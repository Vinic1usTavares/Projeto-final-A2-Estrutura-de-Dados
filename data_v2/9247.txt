description three minotaur class armoured frigatesironclad is all encompassing term for armoured warships of this period armoured frigates were basically designed for same role as traditional wooden frigates but this later changed as size and expense of these ships forced them to be used in line of battle were essentially enlarged versions of ironclad with heavier armament armour and more powerful engines they retained broadside ironclad layout of their predecessor but their sides were fully armoured to protect 50 guns they were designed to carry their plough shaped ram was also more

their hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse bulkheads and had a double bottom underneath engine and boiler rooms parkes p 60 agincourt was considered an excellent sea boat and a steady gun platform but under steam and practically unmanageable under sail ballard p 24 as built ship s steadiness was partially a result of her metacentric height of parkes p 63 propulsion thumb left cutaway

agincourt had five masts and a sail area of agincourt only made under sail mainly because ship s propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into stern of ship to reduce drag both funnels were semi retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail parkes pp 60 63 admiral george a ballard described agincourt and her sisters as dullest performers under canvas of whole masted fleet of their day and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose ballard p 26 in 1893 4 after her withdrawal from active service agincourt had two masts removed and was re rigged as a barque

shipyard in birkenhead ship was launched on 27 march 1865 commissioned in june 1868 for sea trials and completed on 19 december lengthy delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design

floating drydock from england to madeira where it would be picked up by and and taken to bermuda ships departed nore on 23 june 1869 loaded down with of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks and transferred floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage agincourt was assigned to channel squadron upon her return and she became flagship of second in command of fleet until she began a

she ran aground on pearl rock near gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank agincourt was leading inshore column of ships contrary to normal practice where senior flagship lead inshore column and gently ran aground sideways when senior flagship s navigator failed to compensate for set of tide warrior immediately following her nearly collided with her but managed to sheer off in time penrose fitzgerald pp

weather set in night after agincourt was freed and it would have wrecked her if she had still been aground both fleet commander and his deputy were relieved of their commands as a result of incident ship was repaired in devonport and captain j o hopkins assumed command in september with commander charles penrose fitzgerald as his executive officer hopkins later commented we turned agincourt from noisiest and worst disciplined ship in squadron into quietest and smartest and a few months after we commissioned we went out to mediterranean for lord clyde court martial and beat whole mediterranean fleet in their drills and exercises which was a great triumph penrose fitzgerald pp 300 02 305 06 in 1873 vice admiral sir geoffrey hornby commander of channel squadron transferred his flag to agincourt as her sister minotaur his former flagship was taken in hand for a refit that lasted until 1875 that year agincourt was paid off in turn for a refit and re armament that lasted until 1877 during russo turkish war of 1877 78 government became concerned that russians might advance on ottoman capital of constantinople and ordered hornby to form a particular service squadron to show flag at constantinople and deter any russian threat agincourt served as flagship for his second in command and squadron sailed up dardanelles in a blinding snowstorm in february 1878 after those tensions faded ship returned to channel where she served as second flag until 1889 including during queen victoria s golden jubilee fleet review in 1887 over her active career she served as flagship to no less
