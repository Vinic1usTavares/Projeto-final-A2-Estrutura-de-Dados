wasting light is seventh studio album by american rock band foo fighters it was released on april 12 2011 on roswell and rca records and is first album to feature rhythm guitarist pat smear since colour and shape 1997 wanting to capture essence of their earlier work and avoid artificiality of digital recording foo fighters recorded in garage of frontman dave grohl in encino california using only analog equipment sessions were produced by butch vig with whom grohl had worked on nirvana s nevermind since old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post production band spent three weeks rehearsing songs and vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques band sought a heavier and rawer sound in contrast to experimentation of their previous albums most of lyrics were written as grohl reflected upon his life and possible future guest musicians include bob mould krist novoselic jessy greene rami jaffee and fee waybill recording sessions were documented on band s website and twitter promotion included documentary back and forth and a worldwide concert tour that included performances in fans garages wasting light was preceded by successful single rope which became only second song ever to debut at number one on billboards rock songs chart follow up single walk also charted highly wasting light debuted at number one in eleven countries and received positive reviews from most music critics who praised production and songwriting in 2012 wasting light earned four grammy awards including best rock album background thumb left butch vig produced wasting light alt a man wearing glasses and black clothes sits in control room of a recording studio after echoes silence patience grace tour ended in 2008 foo fighters went to grandmaster recorders in hollywood to record 14 compositions written during tours so as to possibly release a new album without much promotion and touring band eventually decided to take a break instead of continuing to work on those recordings three songs from those sessions saw a later release wheels and word forward were rerecorded for band s greatest hits album and rope became a part of wasting light as wheels and word forward were reunion of frontman dave grohl with producer butch vig who had previously worked with nirvana on their breakthrough album nevermind grohl thought it was finally time to bring vig to produce next foo fighters album idea of a new album came back in 2010 as frontman dave grohl was touring australia with them crooked vultures grohl decided that we should make a documentary about recording of this new album and make it a history of band too rather than just record album in most expensive studio with most state of art equipment what if butch and i were to get back together after 20 years and dust off tape machines and put them in my garage 2011 preview foo fighters making music to break into cars to q november 2010 grohl later elaborated that vig was brought in so record could be that one album that kinda defines band it might not be their best album but it s one people identify band with most like back in black or metallica black album it s like you take all of things that people consider your band s signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that and that s sorta what i thought we could do with butch because butch has a great way of trimming all fat and making sense of it all grohl also used tour with vultures to turn song ideas into demos which were then brought to drummer taylor hawkins to be further developed i have all these huge fucking riffs i can scream for three hours let s go classic rock may 2011 album would also mark return of guitarist pat smear as a permanent member smear left foo fighters after release of colour and shape but had been part of touring band since 2006 unlike band s previous two albums wasting light was recorded in dave grohl s garage in encino california as opposed to band s home built studio studio 606 regarding this decision grohl states there s poetry in being band that can sell out wembley but also makes a record in a garage why go into most expensive studio with biggest producer and use best state of art equipment where s rock n roll in that grohl added it was a way to do something really primal sounding innovate break people s expectations and make records way we used to fucking make records album was recorded using entirely analogue equipment until post mastering grohl said it was done that way because he felt digital recording was getting out of control when i listen to music these days and i hear pro tools and drums that sound like a machine it kinda sucks life out of music according to grohl analog strategy would make record sound rawer and somewhat imperfect something which guitarist chris shiflett agreed was beneficial declaring that rock n roll is about flaws and imperfections bassist nate mendel added that we grew up making records on tape which has a certain sound certain limitations and drummer taylor hawkins said that digital recording in contemporary rock n roll lead to an artificial sound they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer to make them sound a certain way hawkins believed an analog project would help band reclaim its artistic freedom once vig learned about analog project at first he considered grohl was joking garbage super producer on recording foo fighters new album wasting light rhythm june 2011 but then replied that you guys have to play really well because nothing is gonna be fixed since mistakes are not as easily as in a digital recording with that in mind band spent three weeks doing pre production and rehearsals at studio 606 where composition was completed going from forty songs to fourteen and said songs were rehearsed to be recorded live while in previous records as put by mendel we d often come up with parts in studio and songs would evolve fox brian mendelian genesis bass player august 2011 smear added that band committed to not change what they recorded whatever we did we didn t change it if a distorted vocal went through a pedal that s what it was going to be mettler mike maximum impact sound and vision july 2011 recording thumb left whiteboard showing progress in recording songs of wasting light alt table drawn at a whiteboard on left are song names on top instruments squares below instruments are coloured according to progress grohl s garage was equipped with microphones sound baffles on garage door and behind drums to prevent sound and a carpet under drum kit to make it sound less loud and bright to reduce cymbal bleed microphones were rearranged and crash cymbal was traded for a shorter decay zildjian cymbal with holes drilled in it a room next to study was turned into an isolation booth to record vocals for recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on backyard and a system of two cameras and a television provided communication between garage and control room equipment was same band employed to record albums there is nothing left to lose and one by one at grohl s former house in alexandria virginia recording of album began september 6 2010 lasting for eleven weeks each one focusing on a particular song something vig stated was good because each song kinda had its own life recordings started with grohl s rhythm guitar and taylor hawkins drumming to provide foundations and see if both could lock in hawkins usually played for hours before he got a drum track i d be proud of click tracks were used but vig said that there was not a worry for drums to follow it exactly as they wanted it to groove and we realized that when everything is off just a few milliseconds sound gets wider and thicker after guitar and drum track mendel would play his basslines which were practiced enough for them to be recorded perfectly on first take following day shiflett and smear would play guitars with latter being last and usually being given a baritone guitar to have a different sound from other guitarists after instrumental backing was ready grohl did vocals either on control room or isolation booth as grohl wanted songs to have maximum emotional potential vocals were screamed to point he had headaches when mic is picking up every tiny inconsistency you really strain to make it sound right thumb right bob mould sang and played guitar on dear rosemary alt a bald man sings and plays a guitar on stage bob mould of husker du one of grohl s idols was brought in to do vocals in a song grohl conceived as a duet with him dear rosemary mould also played guitar on track even though vig s plans had him just singing grohl s and smear s former nirvana bandmate krist novoselic appeared in i should have known as grohl thought it would be nice to have him come down and share experience and that song would be enhanced by his bass and accordion playing miss misery features fee waybill of tubes a personal friend of grohl who said that frontman invited him because background vocal sounded like him other guest musicians included three members of expanded touring band keyboardist rami jaffee violinist jessy greene and percussionist drew hester vig started doubting it could be done fully analog once tapes for first song recorded miss misery started falling apart but grohl reassured him no butch i don t want any computer in this house at all producer said that during recording he had to force my brain to fire different synapses to remember how to deal with analog equipment and lack of a digital display one of habits vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade i used to be able to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be it took me about 20 minutes to do first edit a technique he employed for first songs recorded eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead as process was time consuming and a more tape sent to vig from smart studios was mostly ruined by one of grohl s daughters some bands go quietly into good night but not foos with nevermind producer butch vig urging them hot press may 2011 while many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded only song that had to be redone from scratch was i should have known as grohl felt vig was trying to make this into a radio single when singer wanted it to sound really raw and primal mixing started at chalice recording studios but moved to grohl s house as engineer alan moulder said it was way to make it sound like your garage since grohl s mixing console was not automated at times four people vig grohl moulder and engineer james brown had to work simultaneously on board something grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and even mixes sounded like performances mixes were tested out in cars of band members and vig as they felt that if it sounds good on a lousy stereo it will sound good anywhere recording of album was filmed as part of a career spanning documentary called back and forth which grohl said was essential to make audiences understand decision to record album in his garage foo fighters discuss back and forth documentary at sxsw billboard album name taken from a lyric in miss misery was chosen by grohl because it seemed to resonate with me ok that s what we re here doing as band always recorded each album thinking it could be our last and tried to take most of their tenure together we re only here for a short time we re lucky to be alive lucky to be a band i don t take any of this for granted i don t want to spend my time looking backwards i want to look forwards composition for wasting light grohl stated that they would go back to a rawer and heavier sound after exploring new musical ground on previous records adding that with last album we were too concerned with being musical now it s time for us to be a rock band again to contrast with seven or eight minute long songs with seven or eight sections and two or three time changes grohl played with them crooked vultures he instead tried to compose tightest catchiest four and a half minute softball bat to your face songs hawkins added that he liked wasting light for being straightforward and that s a good thing for us right now last couple records had some big dynamic changes grohl described effort as their heaviest yet later saying it was done because i m 42 now i don t know if i m going to be able to make this record when i m 46 or 49 it s my last chance while demos that prompted grohl to say album would be their heaviest yet were not used on album vig took declarations to heart following three criteria while recording it s got to be hooky heavy and we re going analog all way for guitar sound group tried to balance grohl s playing rhythm straight up middle shiflett s sharp and clean sense of melodic playing and smear s more aggressive sound with grohl declaring that with three guitars you have to be careful that it doesn t become a huge fucking mess but when everybody s playing their thing really well it sounds perfectly orchestrated smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar which would both contrast with grohl and shiflett and add a heavier sound as grohl declared if we ever felt like a section wasn t heavy enough we put fuckin baritone on it and it became huge hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at suggestion of vig as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of producer s favorite drummers ian paice lyrics for wasting light were completed during week each song was being recorded grohl said that words were what was on my mind each week most being written from perspective of who i was then and who i am now with references to past life and death and time but questioning whether it matters at all there s so much focus on before that people forget there s an after frontman said this was helped by environment a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to way we used to make records and working with vig again which made me think a lot about starting over and rebirth and making your way through tragedy and coming out other side an example was i should have known partially inspired by former nirvana bandmate kurt cobain a song like i should have known is about all people i ve lost not just kurt grohl still tried to do simpler songs such as white limo which had its lyrics written in just two minutes specially after mendel sent him an e mail saying i really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing too you don t have to try to write imagine every time you sit down with a pen and paper packaging and formats first cd copies of album contain a small section of original analogue master tape grohl decided to it both for thinking it would be an extraordinary move to destroy all masters and give pieces of tapes to fans as digital recording does not allow for such a memento and also due to every technician involved with wasting light being overtly worried about tapes art direction was done by new york studio morning breath inc and keeping with album s analog recording images did not use computer graphics instead being created with old tools of trade such as copy machines transparent ink and x blades and end result was not printed in cmyk album was issued on cd a double vinyl record and digital download pre orders had option for both cd and lp with a t shirt and a deluxe packaging that came with both cd and lp a t shirt a beer coaster an iron on patch a wristband and a signed lithograph of album cover itunes in turn issued a deluxe edition that included a remix of rope made by deadmau5 outtake better off video for white limo and a live performance of walk release and promotion extensive updates on production of wasting light were up on band s website and twitter because as put by rca records executive aaron borns band wanted to be more engaged with fans earlier this time along with images of sessions themselves and both a whiteboard and papers that showed progress in recording a live feed of tape machine would be put on foo fighters website on december 21 2010 same day album was finished band played a secret gig at california bar paladino s on which four songs from new record made their live debuts wasting light world tour started in 2011 with some concerts having album played in its

a music video was released for white limo featuring lemmy of motorhead on february 23 2011 rope was made available for online stream it debuted at 1 on billboard s rock chart making it only second

fame and it was played again after he said he wanted real rock n roll to close out ceremony critical reception wasting light received generally positive reviews from music critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album received an average score of 78 based on 37 reviews andrew perry of daily telegraph viewed it as by far band s best album and found it tough but accessible reliably catchy yet also surprising at last allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine called its rock sound untrammeled and cited it as fiercest album they ve ever made kind of record they ve always seemed on verge of delivering but never have mikael wood of spin observed a back to basics aspiration and dubbed album grohl s most memorable set of songs since 1997 s colour and shape rob parker of nme said that it sounds phenomenal on headphones or sound systems and is both broad and focused enough to appeal to casuals and longhairs alike paul brannigan of q praised grohl s lyrics and called wasting light most life affirming positively charged album of his career david fricke writing for rolling stone commended grohl s themes and butch vig s nuanced approach to weight and release kyle ryan of a v club said that although it lacks recognizable hooks album also lacks filler of band s previous albums and stated as a return to foo fighters specialty melodic hard hitting rock with soaring choruses wasting light is a success in a mixed review slant magazines kevin liedel criticized band s growing aversion to anthemic songs writing that obvious high points of wasting light are those that strive for stadium pleasing melodies dave simpson of guardian noted an undue arena influence and called album a typically supersized arena rock barrage with lots of howling and wailing every chorus tailored to imaginary walls of pyrotechnics and some tracks seemingly specifically constructed to accommodate a guitar spot or drum solo greg kot of chicago tribune felt that although it is competently performed songs are not innovative and suffer from cliches including hardcore punk screed streamlined rocker and melodramatic power ballad pitchforks david bevan commented that there just isn t a melody or hook to really amplify andy gill of independent criticized its bombastic level and stated presumed desire for back to roots simplicity jettisons diversity of echoes silence patience grace accolades wasting light and its songs were nominated for five grammy awards including album of year record won best rock album award while white limo was chosen as best hard rock metal performance and walk won both best rock performance and best rock song album was chosen as 4th best album of 2011 by kerrang and listed in three rankings of 50 best albums of year
