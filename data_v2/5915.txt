alloxylon pinnatum commonly known as dorrigo waratah is a tree of family proteaceae found in warm temperate rainforest of south east queensland and northern new south wales in eastern australia it has shiny green leaves that are either pinnate lobed and up to long or lanceolate spear shaped and up to long prominent pinkish red flower heads known as inflorescences appear in spring and summer these are made up of 50 to 140 individual flowers arranged in corymb or raceme these are followed by rectangular woody seed pods which bear two rows of winged seeds known for many years as oreocallis pinnata it was transferred to new genus alloxylon by peter weston and mike crisp in 1991 this genus contains four species previously classified in oreocallis that are found in australasia its terminal tubular flowers indicate that species is pollinated by birds classified as near threatened under queensland nature conservation act 1992 dorrigo waratah has proven difficult to keep alive in cultivation description dorrigo waratah is a rainforest tree that reaches high with a non buttressed trunk of diameter at breast height dbh bark is greyish brown and covered in many small pimples rendering it sandpaper like in texture green foliage consists of several distinct juvenile and adult leaf forms which are arranged alternately along stems juvenile leaves are light green and at first simple with a single blade successive leaves on more mature plants become more complex or pinnate with deep lobes these leaves are up to long with 2 11 leaflets some adult leaves are simple with a single lanceolate leaf blade and up to long these are generally located near flower heads among green foliage there are occasional yellow leaves new branchlets and leaves are covered in brown hair pinkish red compound flowerheads known as inflorescences are up to 20 cm 8 in across in spring to summer and contain between 50 and 140 smaller flowers arranged in a corymb or raceme these individual flowers are long and sit atop stalks known as pedicels up to in length which arise in pairs off main stalk within inflorescence each flower consists of a tubular perianth which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release thick style stigma is contained within a slanting disc like structure at tip of style tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip and anther lies in concave parts within each of these segments flower parts are smooth and hairless pollen is crimson after flowering long woody seedpod develops cylindrical in shape it splits down one side to release seeds which are ripe from february to june they are arranged in two rows with at least four seeds in each row each seed is separated from others by a membranous separator and has a long rectangular wing which is much longer than seed itself dorrigo waratah can be distinguished from other members of genus alloxylon by its pinnate adult leaves this feature serves to differentiate it as other species in genus have simple adult leaves other species have inflorescences with fewer flowers 50 maximum and have yellow pollen taxonomy first described as a variety of what was then known as embothrium wickhamii by joseph maiden and ernst betche in 1911 after a collection by j l boorman dorrigo waratah was raised to species status and reclassified as oreocallis pinnata by dutch botanist hermann otto in 1954 australian members of genus oreocallis were recognised as markedly distinct from south american species which saw them allocated to new genus alloxylon hence oreocallis pinnata was given new combination alloxylon pinnatum in 1991 by peter weston and mike crisp of royal botanic gardens in sydney species name refers to pinnate leaves aside from dorrigo waratah it has also been called dorrigo oak red silky oak tree waratah pink silky oak red oak queensland waratah and waratah oak genus name is derived from ancient greek allo meaning other or strange and xylon meaning wood it refers to genus s unusual cell architecture compared with related genera telopea and oreocallis a pinnatum and other three tree waratah species lie in subtribe embothriinae along with true waratahs telopea oreocallis and chilean firetree embothrium coccineum from south america almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal arising at ends of branches and hence subtribe s origin and floral appearance most likely predates splitting of supercontinent gondwana into australia antarctica and south america over 60 million years ago position colour and tubular shape of flowers suggest that they are bird pollinated and have been so since radiation of nectar feeding birds such as honeyeaters in eocene is an ancient member of proteaceae known only from pollen deposits originally described from eocene deposits in victoria fossil pollen closely resembles that of tasmanian waratah telopea truncata a pinnatum and oreocallis grandiflora cladistic analysis of morphological features within embothriinae showed a pinnatum to be earliest offshoot within genus and sister to other three species along with members of other genera in embothriinae a pinnatum has crimson pollen while other three alloxylon species have yellow pollen hence ancestral pollen colour was likely red and remained so with emergence of genus alloxylon yet changed to yellow after divergence of a pinnatum distribution and habitat right thumb cultivated at queensland dorrigo waratah is found in warm temperate rainforest from altitudes of along mcpherson range in south east queensland and dorrigo plateau in northern new south wales with dominant tree species such as and antarctic beech moorei in queensland it is associated with golden sassafras sassafras and native crabapple ovata it commonly grows on southern aspects of hills and slopes conservation status dorrigo waratah is classified as under rare or threatened australian plant rotap criteria for threatened species and listed as near threatened under queensland nature conservation act 1992 flowers are visited by rare richmond birdwing butterfly ornithoptera which occurs in same region in 2016 dorrigo waratah was one of eleven species selected for save a species walk campaign in april 2016 scientists walked to raise money for collection of seeds to be prepared and stored at australian at australian botanic garden mount annan protected areas it grows in in new south wales include bellinger river national park and dorrigo national park cultivation bright prominently displayed flowers and bird attracting properties of dorrigo waratah make it a desirable garden plant it reaches only about in cultivation but has proven difficult to grow dorrigo waratah has been successfully cultivated at australian national botanic gardens in canberra in a sheltered position in part shade with a thick layer of mulch it is propagated most easily by seed which is ripe from february to june and keeps for around twelve months seedlings often perish when they reach high and are difficult to transplant it has also been grown at mount tomah botanic garden where it was noted to be exacting in its requirements needing very good drainage as well as a sheltered location to survive it is slow growing specimens planted in 1989 have been flowering since 1999 considerably easier to grow queensland tree waratah a flammeum has been considered as a stock plant for grafting pinkish red timber has been used for making cabinets and furniture it is soft and light weighing 500 kg 1100 lb per cubic metre cut flowers have a long vase life references pinnatum
