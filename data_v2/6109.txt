felicette was first cat launched into space on 18october 1963 as part of french space program felicette was one of 14 female cats trained for spaceflight cats had electrodes implanted onto their skulls so their neurological activity could be monitored throughout flight electrical impulses were applied to brain and a leg during flight to stimulate responses capsule was recovered 13 minutes after rocket was ignited most of data from mission was of good quality and felicette survived flight only cat to have survived spaceflight a second feline was launched on 24 october but mission resulted in a fatality felicette had designation of c 341 before flight and after flight media gave her name felix after felix cat cerma modified this to feminine felicette and adopted it as her official name she has been commemorated on postage stamps around world and a statue with her likeness is being designed for display at international space university france s feline biological rocket payloads were preceded by rats and followed by monkeys background on 3november 1957 soviet union launched laika a stray dog found on streets of moscow into space on sputnik 2 she died in space but was first animal to orbit earth brazilian army colonel manuel dos santos lage planned to launch a cat named flamengo aboard felix i rocket on 1 january 1959 but flight was cancelled over ethical concerns regarding use of a cat on 31january 1961 as part of project mercury chimpanzee ham became first hominid launched into space for a suborbital flight on 29november 1961 enos became second chimpanzee launched into space and third hominid after cosmonauts yuri gagarin and gherman titov to achieve earth orbit french rocket program began in 1961 flights of veronique rocket had been reinstated in 1959 and were run by comite des recherches crs france s base in sahara launched a rat named hector on 22february 1961 causing france to become third country to launch animals into space hector had electrodes implanted on his skull so neurological activity could be monitored two further rockets with rat payloads followed on 15 and 18october french scientists wanted to use larger mammals and chose cats since they already had a significant amount of neurological data on them mission selection and training in 1963 cerma purchased 14 cats from a pet dealer for testing with individual animals selected based on their temperament all of cats were female for their calmer demeanor cats were unnamed prior to launch to reduce likelihood that scientists would become attached to them all of cats had permanent electrodes surgically implanted into their brain to assess neurological activity some of cats spaceflight training was similar to training for humans this was carried out by cerma and included using high g centrifuge three axis chair with simulated rocket noise cat specific training included confinement in their container and experience withstanding restraint cloth animals trained for about two months this limit was set by risk of electrode polarization flight launch crew began preparing at launch site on 8october 1963 on 11october heading beacon was tested by placing it in a helicopter and tracking it with ground stations on 12th telemetry in nose cone was unsuccessfully tested followed by a successful test next day there were issues testing homing beacon on 14th and 15th but all of electronics functioned to a satisfactory level on 16 october on 17october six feline finalists were selected as candidates for flight and a tuxedo cat with designation c341 was chosen for flight on launch day along with a backup weighing in at c341 was selected as best of six finalists due to her calm demeanor and appropriate weight electrodes were attached to her forward left and right rear leg to monitor cardiac activity nine electrodes had previously been implanted on her skull two in front sinus one in somatic area two in ventral hippocampal two in reticular area and two in association cortex two electrodes were glued to a foreleg so that electrical impulses could be used to stimulate them during flight two microphones one on her chest and one on nose cone of rocket monitored her breathing launch vehicle used was veronique sounding rocket made in vernon haute normandie veronique rocket came from german world war ii aggregate rocket family developed for international geophysical year in 1957 for biological research on 18october 1963 at 8 c341 was launched into space from centre d d site in algeria mission was a sub orbital flight and lasted 13 minutes rocket engine burned for on ascent and c341 experienced 9 5 g of acceleration nose cone separated from rocket before reaching a height of and cat was subjected to five minutes of weightlessness prior to parachute deployment spin and vibration on nose cone caused 7 g of acceleration parachutes deployed 8 minutes and 55 seconds into launch applying 9 g thirteen minutes after rocket was ignited a helicopter arrived at payload c341 was recovered safely and mission made her first cat to reach space results and aftermath high quality data was recorded throughout flight other than reticular measurements and data recorded during reentry electrical shocks were administered to c341 at a higher rate than intended she was vigilant during ascent phase due to being a payload in a rocket during microgravity phase her heart rate slowed and her breathing became nominal turbulent reentry caused her heart rate to rise but poor data made it difficult to analyze flight s biological data were given to media who named c341 felix after felix cat cartoon series cerma changed it to feminine felicette and adopted name as official felicette was euthanized two months after launch so that scientists could perform a necropsy to examine her brain a second cat was launched into space by french on an explosive bolt that would release rocket from launch pad failed to function causing rocket to launch at an extreme angle radio transponder stopped working on launch pad which created difficulties in finding rocket a helicopter spotted parachute but was unable to land so agency dispatched ground vehicles they were unable to get past some barbed wire next day a helicopter was again dispatched and was able to land at site nose cone where payload was housed was heavily damaged and cat had died of remaining 12 cats that were trained fate of 11 is known one cat s health was deteriorating after electrode surgery so scientists had them removed group adopted her as their mascot and gave her name scoubidou as she had a scoubidou braid around her neck a popular style at time other nine cats were decommissioned at end of program france continued its biological payload research changing to monkeys a monkey known as martine was launched on 7march 1967 and pierrette six days later they were both successfully recovered france concluded biological payload research at national level with these flights but later worked on biological payloads with soviet union in 1970s legacy according to an article in space com on 8november 2017 participation of felicette in space race was certainly not voluntary but it was a huge milestone for france which had just established world s third civilian space agency after u s and soviet union felicette s mission helped bring france into space race felicette s flight was much less popular than other spaceflights at time burgess and dubbs believe this is due to photos of her with electrodes implanted on her skull and new animal rights movement former french colonies have created stamps to commemorate felicette s flight comoro islands released a stamp in 1992 as one of a series of stamps featuring animals involved in spaceflight stamp mistakenly used name felix in 1997 postage stamps commemorating felicette and other animals in space were issued in chad again using name felix a 1999 stamp in niger also used incorrect name ups student astronomy club at universite will name its future astronomical observatory in honor of felicette it will be first french observatory entirely managed by students and is due to open in 2021 500 mm dall kirkham telescope 3500 mm focal length will be housed in a motorized dome 3 90m in diameter statue while some non human animals which traveled in space were celebrated as heroes chimpanzee ham was buried at international space hall of fame in new mexico u s a and soviet dog laika has a bronze monument at yuri gagarin cosmonaut training center near star city in russia there is no memorial for felicette in 2017 a crowdfunding campaign was started by matthew serge guy to erect a bronze statue of felicette to commemorate her contribution to science statue will be designed by sculptor gill parker a preliminary sketch of monument depicts a cat on top of a rocket and will include a plaque featuring names of major donors in april 2018 project met its ps40 000 funding target in april 2019
