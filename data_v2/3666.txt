severe tropical cyclone tia was first of six tropical cyclones to affect vanuatu during 1991 92 south pacific cyclone season system was first noted within south pacific convergence zone as a small tropical depression on november 13 to northeast of solomon islands over next few days system gradually developed further within an area of light winds in upper troposphere before it was named tia early on november 16 later that day due to a developing northerly steering current system slowed down and undertook a small anticlockwise loop before starting to move towards southwest and rapidly intensify after rapidly intensifying throughout november 16 and 17 tia passed within of solomon island anuta at around 1800 utc on november 17 before passing near tikopia island six hours later as tia moved near tikopia system reached its peak intensity as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone with 10 minute sustained windspeeds of during november 18 due to cooler waters and increased wind shear tia started to weaken as it moved southwards under influence of a strengthening upper level northerly wind flow over next 24 hours system continued to move southwards and passed within of vanuatu s banks islands while gradually weakening further tia subsequently degenerated into a tropical depression during november 20 before it was last noted next day as it crossed a part of its former track where it had been producing hurricane force wind speeds a few days earlier while it was active tia directly affected solomon islands and vanuatu while it indirectly affected kiribati solomon island of tikopia was worst affected island after more than 1 000 people were left homeless on island and 90 of all dwellings were destroyed damage was minimal in vanuatu and was mainly confined to crops and fruit trees on banks and torres islands after this usage of name tia name was retired and withdrawn from use on tropical cyclone naming lists meteorological history a small tropical depression developed within south pacific convergence zone to northeast of solomon islands during november 13 during that day system moved towards south west before it sharply turned towards east early next day as an equatorial westerly wind burst took place to north of cyclone depression subsequently gradually developed further within an area of light winds in upper troposphere and sea surface temperatures of over early on november 15 united states joint typhoon warning center initiated advisories on depression and designated it as tropical cyclone 03p after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm during that day system s upper level outflow characteristics became more favourable for further development before system was named tia by fiji meteorological service after system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on australian tropical cyclone intensity scale when it was named tia moving slowly and was located about to northeast of santa cruz islands before jtwc reported at around 0600 utc that tia had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale with 1 minute sustained windspeeds of 120 km h 75 mph around this time because of a developing northerly steering current tia slowed down and undertook a small anticlockwise loop before starting to move towards southwest and rapidly intensify after rapidly intensifying throughout november 16 and 17 tia passed within of anuta island at around 1800 utc on november 17 before passing near tikopia island six hours later as tia moved near tikopia tcwc nadi reported that system had reached its peak intensity as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone with sustained windspeeds of 140 km h 85 mph jtwc followed suit six hours later and reported that cyclone had peaked as a category 2 equivalent hurricane with sustained windspeeds of 175 km h 110 mph by 1800 utc on november 18 due to cooler waters and increased wind shear tia started to weaken as it moved southwards under influence of a strengthening upper level northerly wind flow over next 24 hours system continued to move southwards and passed within of vanuatu s banks islands while gradually weakening further before moving to southeast under influence of strong upper level by 0000 utc on november 20 tia had weakened into a category one tropical cyclone on australian scale and became slow moving while located about to east of port villa in during that day system turned and moved towards northwest before tcwc nadi reported later that day at 1200 utc that tia had weakened below tropical cyclone intensity however jtwc monitored system as a tropical cyclone for another 24 hours before issuing their final advisory on system at 1200 utc as system had weakened below tropical cyclone intensity tia was subsequently last noted by tcwc nadi and jtwc later that day as it crossed a part of its former track where it had been producing hurricane force windspeeds a few days earlier preparations and impact apart from several smaller islands no major inhabited islands lied in path of tia while no deaths were associated with system after this usage of name tia name was retired and withdrawn from use on tropical cyclone naming lists solomon islands during november 17 warnings were issued by solomon islands meteorological service for parts of temotu province in solomon islands after it became apparent that tia was moving towards eastern most islands of anuta and tikopia during that day system affected province and came to within of anuta at around 1800 utc on november 17 before passing near to tikopia six hours later southern most solomon island of tikopia was worst affected island with 90 of all dwellings destroyed and remaining 10 either having walls destroyed or roofs blown off as a result more than 1000 people were left homeless on island which was declared a disaster area by solomon islands national disaster council cyclone also destroyed seven of eight church buildings and all but one of classroom buildings belonging to two primary schools food crops were destroyed with all coconut trees either blown down or uprooted high seas and waves caused extensive damage to coasts and flooded low lying areas which damaged taro other food crops and water supply on island due to salt spray sustained windspeeds of wind gusts of and a minimum pressure of were all reported by automatic weather station on anuta other islands on november 16 kiribati islands suffered side effects of cyclone tia with several houses in tarawa and seaweed farms damaged late on november 17 fms started to release special advisories for vanuatu after it had become clear that systems south southwest movement would bring cyclone sufficiently close to banks and torres islands to cause either gale or storm force winds over next 24 hours fms continued to issue these bulletins as system moved southwards and brought gale force winds to maewo pentecost and banks islands before they issued final advisory early on november 19 tia was first of six tropical cyclones to affect vanuatu during 1991 92 south pacific cyclone season and caused minor damage that was mainly confined to houses crops and fruit trees on banks and torres islands within banks islands a church was flattened several roads were blocked and a man was slightly injured by flying debris see also cyclone zoe references external links category 1991 in
