his performances primarily to those of his own works in 1927 he wrote his second symphony subtitled to october a patriotic piece with a great pro soviet choral finale owing to its experimental nature

closest friend until latter s death in 1944 sollertinsky introduced composer to music of mahler which had a strong influence on his music from fourth symphony onwards while writing second symphony shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera nose based on story by nikolai gogol in june 1929 against composer s own wishes opera was given a concert performance it was ferociously attacked by russian association of proletarian musicians wilson 2006 p 84 its stage premiere on 18 january 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians wilson 2006 p 85 in late 1920s and early 1930s shostakovich worked at tram a proletarian youth theatre although he did little work in this post it shielded him from ideological attack much of this period was spent writing his opera lady macbeth of mtsensk district which was first performed in 1934 it was immediately successful on both popular and official levels it was described as result of general success of socialist construction of correct policy of party and as an opera that could have been written only by a soviet composer brought up in best tradition of soviet culture shostakovich married his first wife nina varzar in 1932 initial difficulties led to a divorce in 1935 but couple soon remarried when nina became pregnant with their first child galina fay 2000 p 80 first denunciation on 17 january 1936 joseph stalin paid a rare visit to opera for a performance of a new work quiet flows don based on novel by mikhail by little known composer ivan who was called to stalin s box at end of performance and told that his work had considerable ideological political value on 26 january stalin revisited opera accompanied by vyacheslav molotov andrei zhdanov and anastas mikoyan to hear lady macbeth of mtsensk district he and his entourage left without speaking to anyone shostakovich had been forewarned by a friend that he should postpone a planned concert tour in arkhangelsk in order to be present at that particular performance eyewitness accounts testify that shostakovich was white as a sheet when he went to take his bow after third act in letters written to sollertinsky shostakovich recounted horror with which he watched as stalin shuddered every time brass and percussion played too loudly equally horrifying was way stalin and his companions laughed at love making scene between sergei and katerina next day shostakovich left for arkhangelsk and was there when he heard on 28 january that pravda had published a tirade titled muddle instead of music complaining that opera was a deliberately dissonant muddled stream of sounds that quacks hoots pants and gasps this was signal for a nationwide campaign during which even soviet music critics who had praised opera were forced to recant in print saying they failed to detect shortcomings of lady macbeth as pointed out by pravda downes olin shostakovich affair shows shift in point of view in u s s r new york times 12 april 1936 p x5 there was resistance from those who admired shostakovich including sollertinsky who turned up at a composers meeting in leningrad called to denounce opera and praised it instead two other speakers supported him when shostakovich returned to leningrad he had a telephone call from commander of leningrad military district who had been asked by marshal mikhail tukhachevsky to make sure that he was all right when writer isaac babel was under arrest four years later he told his interrogators that it was common ground for us to proclaim genius of slighted shostakovich on 6 february shostakovich was again attacked in pravda this time for his light comic ballet limpid stream which was denounced because it jangles and expresses nothing and did not give an accurate picture of peasant life on a collective farm wilson 2006 p 130 fearful that he was about to be arrested shostakovich secured an appointment with chairman of ussr state committee on culture platon who reported to stalin and molotov that he had instructed composer to reject formalist errors and in his art attain something that could be understood by broad masses and that shostakovich had admitted being in wrong and had asked for a meeting with stalin which was not granted as a result of this campaign commissions began to fall off and shostakovich s income fell by about three quarters his fourth symphony was due to receive its premiere on 11 december 1936 but he withdrew it from public possibly because it was banned and symphony was not performed for 25 years until 30 december 1961 lady macbeth of mtsensk district was also suppressed a bowdlerised version was eventually performed under a new title katerina on 8 january 1963 anti shostakovich campaign also served as a signal to artists working in other fields including art architecture theatre and cinema with writer mikhail bulgakov director sergei eisenstein and theatre director vsevolod meyerhold among prominent targets more widely 1936 marked beginning of great terror in which many of composer s friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed these included his friend marshal mikhail tukhachevsky shot months after

kornilov and adrian piotrovsky executed wilson 2006 pp 145 6 his only consolation in this period was birth of his daughter galina in 1936 his son maxim was born two years later withdrawal of fourth symphony publication of pravda editorials coincided with composition of shostakovich s fourth symphony work marked a great shift in style owing to substantial influence of mahler and a number of western style elements symphony gave shostakovich compositional trouble as he attempted to reform his style into a new idiom composer was well into work when pravda article appeared he continued to compose symphony and planned a premiere at end of 1936 rehearsals began that december but after a number of rehearsals shostakovich for reasons still debated today decided to withdraw symphony from public a number of his friends and colleagues such as isaak glikman have suggested that it was in fact an official ban that shostakovich was persuaded to present as a voluntary withdrawal wilson 2006 pp 143 4 whatever case it seems possible that this action saved composer s life during this time shostakovich feared for himself and his family yet he did not repudiate work it retained its designation as his fourth symphony a piano reduction was published in 1946 and work was finally premiered in 1961 well after stalin s death during 1936 and 1937 in order to maintain as low a profile as possible between fourth and fifth symphonies shostakovich mainly composed film music a genre favored by stalin and lacking in dangerous personal expression fifth symphony and return to favor composer s response to his denunciation was fifth symphony of 1937 which was musically more conservative than his earlier works premiered on 21 november 1937 in leningrad it was a phenomenal success fifth brought many to tears and welling emotions later shostakovich s purported memoir testimony stated i ll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel fifth symphony of course they understood they understood what was happening around them and they understood what fifth was about success put shostakovich in good standing once again music critics and authorities alike including those who had earlier accused shostakovich of formalism claimed that he had learned from his mistakes and become a true soviet artist in a newspaper article published under shostakovich s name fifth symphony was characterized as a soviet artist s creative response to just criticism composer dmitry kabalevsky who had been among those who disassociated themselves from shostakovich when pravda article was published praised fifth symphony and congratulated shostakovich for not having given in to seductive temptations of his previous erroneous ways wilson 2006 p 152 it was also at this time that shostakovich composed first of his string quartets his chamber works allowed him to experiment and express ideas that would have been unacceptable in his more public symphonies in september 1937 he began to teach composition at leningrad conservatory which provided some financial security but interfered with his creative work second world war in 1939 before soviet forces attempted to invade finland party secretary of leningrad andrei zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from shostakovich suite on finnish themes to be performed as marching bands of red army paraded through helsinki winter war was a bitter experience for red army parade never happened and shostakovich never laid claim to authorship of this work it was not performed until 2001 mtv3 in finnish after outbreak of war between soviet union and germany in 1941 shostakovich initially remained in leningrad he tried to enlist for military but was turned away because of his poor eyesight to compensate he became a volunteer for leningrad conservatory s firefighter brigade and delivered a radio broadcast to soviet people photograph for which he posed was published in newspapers throughout country wilson 2006 p 171 his greatest and most famous wartime contribution was seventh symphony composer wrote first three movements in leningrad and completed work in kuibyshev now samara where he and his family had been evacuated it remains unclear whether shostakovich really conceived idea of symphony with siege of leningrad in mind it was officially claimed as a representation of people of leningrad s brave resistance to german invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting symphony was first premiered by bolshoi theatre orchestra in kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in london and united states most compelling performance was leningrad premiere by radio orchestra in besieged city orchestra had only 14 musicians left so conductor karl eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play an instrument to perform symphony family moved to moscow in spring 1943 at time of eighth symphony s premiere tide had turned for red army as a consequence public and most importantly authorities wanted another triumphant piece from composer instead they got eighth symphony perhaps ultimate in sombre and violent expression in shostakovich s output in order to preserve shostakovich s image a vital bridge to people of union and to west government assigned name stalingrad to symphony giving it appearance of mourning of dead in bloody battle of stalingrad but piece did not escape criticism its composer is reported to have said when eighth was performed it was openly declared counter revolutionary and anti soviet they said why did shostakovich write an optimistic symphony at beginning of war and a tragic one now at beginning we were retreating and now we re attacking destroying fascists and shostakovich is acting tragic that means he s on side of fascists shostakovich volkov 2000 p 162 work was unofficially but effectively banned until 1956 wilson 2006 p 203 ninth symphony 1945 in contrast was much lighter in tone popov wrote that it was splendid in its joie de vivre gaiety brilliance and fay 2000 p 147 but by 1946 it too was subject of criticism israel nestyev asked whether it was right time for a light and amusing interlude between shostakovich s significant creations a temporary rejection of great serious problems for sake of playful filigree trimmed trifles fay 2000 p 152 new york world telegram of 27 july 1946 was similarly dismissive russian composer should not have expressed his feelings about defeat of nazism in such a childish manner shostakovich continued to compose chamber music notably his second piano trio op 67 dedicated to memory of sollertinsky with a bittersweet jewish themed finale in 1947 composer was made a deputy to supreme soviet of rsfsr second denunciation thumb right left to right 1945 sergei prokofiev shostakovich aram khachaturian in 1948 shostakovich along with many other composers was again denounced for formalism in zhdanov decree andrei zhdanov chairman of rsfsr supreme soviet accused shostakovich and other composers such as sergei prokofiev and aram khachaturian of writing inappropriate and formalist music this was part of an ongoing anti formalism campaign intended to root out all western compositional influence as well as any perceived non russian output conference resulted in publication of central committee s decree on v s opera great friendship which targeted all soviet composers and demanded that they write only proletarian music or music for masses accused composers including shostakovich were summoned to make public apologies in front of committee wilson 2006 p 241 most of shostakovich s works were banned and his family had privileges withdrawn yuri lyubimov says that at this time he waited for his arrest at night out on landing by lift so that at least his family wouldn t be disturbed decree s consequences for composers were harsh shostakovich was among those dismissed from conservatory altogether for him loss of money was perhaps largest blow others still in conservatory experienced an atmosphere thick with suspicion no one wanted his work to be understood as formalist so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti proletarian music wilson 1994 p 252 in next few years shostakovich composed three categories of work film music to pay rent official works aimed at securing official rehabilitation and serious works for desk drawer latter included violin concerto no 1 and song cycle from jewish folk poetry cycle was written at a time when postwar anti semitic campaign was already under way with widespread arrests including that of i and compilers of book from which shostakovich took his texts wilson 2006 p 269 restrictions on shostakovich s music and living arrangements were eased in 1949 when stalin decided that soviets needed to send artistic representatives to cultural and scientific congress for world peace in new york city and that shostakovich should be among them for shostakovich it was a humiliating experience culminating in a new york press conference where he was expected to read a prepared speech nicolas nabokov who was present in audience witnessed shostakovich starting to read in a nervous and shaky voice before he had to break off and speech was continued in english by a suave radio baritone fully aware that shostakovich was not free to speak his mind nabokov publicly asked him whether he supported then recent denunciation of stravinsky s music in soviet union shostakovich who was a great admirer of stravinsky and had been influenced by his music had no alternative but to answer in affirmative nabokov did not hesitate to write that this demonstrated that shostakovich was not a free man but an obedient tool of his government nabokov 1951 p 205 shostakovich never forgave nabokov for this public humiliation wilson 2006 p 274 that same year shostakovich was obliged to compose cantata song of forests which praised stalin as great gardener stalin s death in 1953 was biggest step toward shostakovich s rehabilitation as a creative artist which was marked by his tenth symphony it features a number of musical quotations and codes notably dsch and elmira motifs elmira nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under shostakovich in year before his dismissal from moscow conservatory wilson 2006 p 304 meaning of which is still debated while savage second movement according to testimony is intended as a musical portrait of stalin tenth ranks alongside fifth and seventh as one of shostakovich s most popular works 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of desk drawer works during forties and fifties shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils galina ustvolskaya and elmira nazirova in background to all this remained shostakovich s first open marriage to nina varzar until her death in 1954 he taught ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947 nature of their relationship is far from clear mstislav rostropovich described it as tender ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after nina s death fay 2000 p 194 shostakovich s daughter galina recalled her father consulting her and maxim about possibility of ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother fay 2000 p 194 wilson 2006 p 297 ustvolskaya s friend viktor said that she had been deeply disappointed in shostakovich by time of her graduation in 1947 relationship with nazirova seems to have been one sided expressed largely through his letters to her and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956 he married his second wife komsomol activist margarita in 1956 couple proved ill matched and divorced three years later in 1954 shostakovich wrote festive overture opus 96 it was used as theme music for 1980 summer olympics his theme from film opus finale was played as cauldron was lit at 2004 summer olympics in athens greece in 1959 shostakovich appeared on stage in moscow at end of a concert performance of his fifth symphony congratulating leonard bernstein and new york philharmonic orchestra for their performance part of a concert tour of soviet union later that year bernstein and new york philharmonic recorded symphony in boston for columbia records joining party year 1960 marked another turning point in shostakovich s life he joined communist party government wanted to appoint him general secretary of composers union but in order to hold that position he was required to attain party membership it was understood that nikita khrushchev first secretary of communist party from 1953 to 1964 was looking for support from leading ranks of intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with soviet union s artists wilson 1994 pp 373 80 this event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment a mark of cowardice result of political pressure or his free decision on one hand was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before stalin s death on other his son recalled that event reduced shostakovich to tears and he later told his wife irina that he had been blackmailed yakubov programme notes for 1998 shostakovich seasons at barbican london lev has said that composer was suicidal wilson 1994 p 340 from 1962 he served as a delegate in supreme soviet of ussr once he joined party several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in pravda under his name in joining party shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing homage to lenin that he had promised before his twelfth symphony which portrays bolshevik revolution and was completed in 1961 was dedicated to vladimir lenin and called year 1917 around this time his health began to deteriorate thumb upright shostakovich in 1950 shostakovich s musical response to these personal crises was eighth string quartet composed in only three days he subtitled piece to victims of fascism and war 1979 37 ostensibly in memory of dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945 yet like tenth symphony this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram shostakovich confessed to his friend isaak glikman i started thinking that if some day i die nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me so i had better write one myself letter dated 19 july 1960 reprinted in glikman pp 90 91 several of shostakovich s colleagues including natalya 2006 p 263 and cellist valentin wilson 2006 p 281 were also aware of eighth quartet s biographical intent peter j rabinowitz has also pointed to covert references to richard strauss s in eighth quartet in 1962 shostakovich got married for third time to irina in a letter to glikman he wrote her only defect is that she is 27 years old in all other respects she is splendid clever cheerful straightforward and very likeable shostakovich glikman 2001 p 102 according to galina vishnevskaya who knew well this marriage was a very happy one it was with her that dmitri dmitriyevich finally came to know domestic peace surely she prolonged his life by several years in november he made his only venture into conducting conducting a couple of his own works in gorky wilson 2006 pp 426 7 otherwise he declined to conduct citing nerves and ill health that year saw shostakovich again turn to subject of anti semitism in his thirteenth symphony subtitled babi yar symphony sets a number of poems by yevgeny yevtushenko first of which commemorates a massacre of ukrainian jews during second world war opinions are divided how great a risk this was poem had been published in soviet media and was not banned but remained controversial after symphony s premiere yevtushenko was forced to add a stanza to his poem which said that russians and ukrainians had died alongside jews at babi yar in 1965 shostakovich raised his voice in defence of poet joseph brodsky who was sentenced to five years of exile and hard labor shostakovich co signed protests together with yevtushenko and fellow soviet artists anna samuil marshak and french philosopher jean paul sartre after protests sentence was commuted and brodsky returned to leningrad later life and death in 1964 shostakovich composed music for russian film hamlet which was favourably reviewed by new york times but lack of this aural stimulation of shakespeare s eloquent words is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by dmitri shostakovich this has great dignity and depth and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity crowther bosley in new york times 15 september 1964 in later life shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand eventually forcing him to give up piano playing in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis he also suffered heart attacks following year and again in 1971 and several falls in which he broke both his legs in 1967 he wrote in a letter target achieved so far 75 right leg broken left leg broken right hand defective all i need to do now is wreck left hand and then 100 of my extremities will be out of order shostakovich glikman 2001 p 147 a preoccupation with his own mortality permeates shostakovich s later works among them later quartets and fourteenth symphony of 1969 a song cycle based on a number of poems on theme of death this piece also finds shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language with twelve tone themes and dense polyphony throughout he dedicated piece to his close friend benjamin britten who conducted its western premiere at 1970 aldeburgh festival fifteenth symphony of 1971 is by contrast melodic and retrospective in nature quoting wagner rossini and composer s own fourth symphony shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 august 1975 a civic funeral was held he was interred in novodevichy cemetery moscow even before his death he had been commemorated with naming of shostakovich peninsula on alexander island antarctica shostakovich peninsula usgs 01 jan 75 despite suffering from motor neurone disease or als from as early as 1960s shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence and music himself even when his right hand was virtually unusable this is a last hallmark of his extraordinarily determined and tenacious character thumb right shostakovich voting in election of council of administration of soviet musicians in moscow in 1974 he was survived by his third wife irina his daughter galina and his son maxim a pianist and conductor who was dedicatee and first performer of some of his father s works shostakovich himself left behind several recordings of his own piano works other noted interpreters of his music include emil mstislav rostropovich tatiana maria yudina david oistrakh and members of beethoven quartet his last work was his viola sonata which was first performed on 28 december 1975 four months after his death shostakovich s musical influence on later composers outside former soviet union has been relatively slight although alfred schnittke took up his eclecticism and his contrasts between dynamic and static and some of andre previn s music shows clear links to shostakovich s style of orchestration his influence can also be seen in some nordic composers such as lars erik larsson musicweb international lars erik larsson retrieved on 18 november 2005 many of his russian contemporaries and his pupils at leningrad conservatory were strongly influenced by his style including german boris tishchenko whose 5th symphony of 1978 is dedicated to shostakovich s memory sergei slonimsky and others shostakovich s conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond russia as avant garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed music overview shostakovich s works are broadly tonal and in romantic tradition but with elements of atonality and chromaticism in some of his later works e g twelfth quartet he made use of tone rows his output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies and string quartets each totaling fifteen works symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career while quartets are concentrated towards latter part among most popular are fifth and seventh symphonies and eighth and fifteenth quartets other works include operas lady macbeth of mtsensk nose and unfinished gamblers based on comedy of nikolai gogol six concertos two each for piano violin and cello two piano trios and a large quantity of film music shostakovich s music shows influence of many of composers he most admired bach in his fugues and beethoven in late quartets mahler in symphonies and berg in his use of musical codes and quotations among russian composers he particularly admired modest mussorgsky whose operas boris godunov and khovanshchina he re orchestrated mussorgsky s influence is most prominent in wintry scenes of lady macbeth and eleventh symphony as well as in his satirical works such as rayok fay 2000 pp 119 165 224 prokofiev s influence is most apparent in earlier piano works such as first sonata and first concerto influence of russian church and folk music is very evident in his works for unaccompanied choir of 1950s shostakovich s relationship with stravinsky was profoundly ambivalent as he wrote to glikman stravinsky composer i worship stravinsky thinker i despise shostakovich glikman 2001 p 181 he was particularly enamoured of symphony of psalms presenting a copy of his own piano version of it to stravinsky when latter visited ussr in 1962 meeting of two composers was not very successful however observers commented on shostakovich s extreme nervousness and stravinsky s cruelty to him wilson 1994 pp 375 7 many commentators have noted disjunction between experimental works before 1936 denunciation and more conservative ones that followed composer told flora litvinova without party guidance i would have displayed more brilliance used more sarcasm i could have revealed my ideas openly instead of having to resort to camouflage wilson 1994 p 426 articles published by shostakovich in 1934 and 1935 cited berg schoenberg hindemith and especially stravinsky among his influences fay 2000 p 88 key works of earlier period are first symphony which combined academicism of conservatory with his progressive inclinations nose most uncompromisingly modernist of all his stage works new grove 2001 p 289 lady macbeth which precipitated denunciation and fourth symphony described in grove s dictionary as a colossal synthesis of shostakovich s musical development to date new grove 2001 p 290 fourth symphony was also first in which influence of mahler came to fore prefiguring route shostakovich took to secure his rehabilitation while he himself admitted that preceding two were his least successful shostakovich glikman 2001 p 315 in years after 1936 shostakovich s symphonic works were outwardly musically conservative regardless of any subversive political content during this time he turned increasingly to chamber works a field that permitted composer to explore different and often darker ideas without inviting external scrutiny see also new grove 2001 p 294 while his chamber works were largely tonal they gave shostakovich an outlet for sombre reflection not welcomed in his more public works this is most apparent in late chamber works which portray what is described in grove s dictionary as a world of purgatorial numbness new grove 2001 p 300 in some of these he included use of tone rows although he treated these as melodic themes rather than serially vocal works are also a prominent feature of his late output setting texts often concerned with love death and art jewish themes even before stalinist anti semitic campaigns in late 1940s and early 1950s shostakovich showed an interest in jewish themes he was intrigued by jewish music s ability to build a jolly melody on sad intonations wilson 1994 p 268 examples of works that included jewish themes are fourth string quartet 1949 first violin concerto 1948 and four monologues on pushkin poems 1952 as well as piano trio in e minor 1944 he was further inspired to write with jewish themes when he examined s thesis on jewish folk music in 1946 https www com download sample in 1948 shostakovich acquired a book of jewish folk songs and from this he composed song cycle from jewish folk poetry he initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent hardships of being jewish in soviet union to disguise this shostakovich added three more songs meant to demonstrate great life jews had under soviet regime despite his efforts to hide real meaning in work union of composers refused to approve his music in 1949 under pressure of anti semitism that gripped country from jewish folk poetry could not be performed until after stalin s death in march 1953 along with all other works that were forbidden wilson 1994 pp 267 9 self quotations throughout his compositions shostakovich demonstrated a controlled use of musical quotation this stylistic choice had been common in previous composers but shostakovich developed it into a defining characteristic of his music rather than quoting other composers shostakovich preferred to quote himself his compositions have been connected by musicologists through their quotations one example is main theme of katerina s aria seryozha moy from fourth act of lady macbeth of mtsensk district it accompanies katerina as she reunites with her lover sergei aria s beauty comes as a breath of fresh air in intense overbearing tone of scene this goes well with dialogue as katerina visits her lover in prison theme is made tragic when sergei betrays her and finds a new lover upon blaming katerina for his incarceration more than 25 years later shostakovich quotes this theme in his eighth string quartet in midst of this quartet s oppressive and somber themes only time listener receives a light and cheerful moment is when cello introduces seryozha theme about three minutes into fourth movement quotation uses katerina s hope amid misery as a means to demonstrate hope of those oppressed by fascists this theme emerges once again in his 14th string quartet as in eighth cello introduces theme but for an entirely different purpose last in shostakovich s quartet of quartets fourteenth serves to honor cellist of beethoven string quartet sergei shirinsky rather than reflecting original theme s intentions quotation serves as a dedication to shirinsky posthumous publications in 2004 musicologist olga digonskaya discovered a trove of shostakovich manuscripts at glinka state central museum of musical culture moscow in a cardboard file were some 300 pages of musical sketches pieces and scores in shostakovich s hand a composer friend bribed shostakovich s housemaid to regularly deliver contents of shostakovich s office waste bin to him instead of taking it to garbage some of those cast offs eventually found their way into glinka glinka archive contained a huge number of pieces and compositions which were completely unknown or could be traced quite indirectly digonskaya said among these were shostakovich s piano and vocal sketches for a prologue to an opera orango 1932 they were orchestrated by british composer gerard mcburney and premiered in december 2011 by los angeles philharmonic criticism according to mcburney opinion is divided on whether shostakovich s music is of visionary power and originality as some maintain or as others think derivative trashy empty and second hand william walton his british contemporary described him as greatest composer of 20th century british composers in interview by r murray schafer faber 1960 musicologist david fanning concludes in grove s dictionary that amid conflicting pressures of official requirements mass suffering of his fellow countrymen and his personal ideals of humanitarian and public service he succeeded in forging a musical language of colossal emotional power some modern composers have been critical pierre boulez dismissed shostakovich s music as second or even third pressing of mahler mcburney 2002 p 288 romanian composer and webern disciple philip called shostakovich a hack in a trance mcburney 2002 p 290 a related complaint is that shostakovich s style is vulgar and strident stravinsky wrote of lady macbeth brutally hammering and monotonous mcburney 2002 p 286 english composer and musicologist robin holloway described his music as battleship grey in melody and harmony factory functional in structure in content all rhetoric and coercion in 1980s finnish conductor and composer esa pekka salonen was critical of shostakovich and refused to conduct his music for instance he said in 1987 shostakovich is in many ways a polar counter force for stravinsky when i have said that 7th symphony of shostakovich is a dull and unpleasant composition people have responded yes yes but think of background of that symphony such an attitude does no good to anyone salonen esa pekka lauri kirja p 73 helsinki tammi salonen has since performed and recorded several of shostakovich s works including piano concertos nos 1 and 2 1999 violin concerto no 1 2010 prologue to orango and symphony no 4 2012 it is certainly true that shostakovich borrows extensively from material and styles both of earlier composers and of popular music vulgarity of low music is a notable influence on this greatest of haas shostakovich s eighth c minor symphony against grain p 125 mcburney traces this to avant garde artistic circles of early soviet period in which shostakovich moved early in his career and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique to allow him to create patterns of contrast repetition exaggeration that gave his music large scale structure mcburney 2002 p 295 personality thumb shostakovich with close friend ivan sollertinsky shostakovich was in many ways an obsessive man according to his daughter he was obsessed with cleanliness michael memories of shostakovich p 139 he synchronised clocks in his apartment and regularly sent cards to himself to test how well postal service was working elizabeth wilson s shostakovich a life remembered 1994 edition indexes 26 references to his nervousness mikhail remembers that even as a young man composer was fragile and nervously agile wilson 1994 pp 41 5 yuri lyubimov comments fact that he was more vulnerable and receptive than other people was no doubt an important feature of his genius wilson 1994 p 183 in later life krzysztof meyer recalled his face was a bag of tics and grimaces wilson 1994 p 462 in his lighter moods sport was one of his main recreations although he preferred spectating or umpiring to participating he was a qualified football referee his favourite football club was zenit leningrad now zenit saint petersburg which he would watch regularly mentioned in his personal correspondence shostakovich tr phillips 2001 as well as other sources he also enjoyed playing card games particularly patience he was fond of satirical writers such as gogol chekhov and mikhail zoshchenko influence of latter in particular is evident in his letters which include wry parodies of soviet zoshchenko himself noted contradictions in composer s character he is frail fragile withdrawn an infinitely direct pure child but he is also hard acid extremely intelligent strong perhaps despotic and not altogether good natured although good natured quoted in fay 2000 p 121 he was diffident by nature flora litvinova has said he was completely incapable of saying no to anybody wilson 1994 p 162 this meant he was easily persuaded to sign official statements including a denunciation of andrei sakharov in 1973 his widow later told helsingin sanomat that his name was included without his permission vesa siren mita sai in helsingin sanomat on page a 6 2 november 2018 on other hand he was willing to try to help constituents in his capacities as chairman of composers union and deputy to supreme soviet oleg prokofiev commented that he tried to help so many people that less and less attention was paid to his pleas wilson 1994 p 40 when asked if he believed in god shostakovich said no and i am very sorry about it fay 2000 p 263 orthodoxy and revisionism thumb shostakovich represented himself in some works with dsch motif consisting of d e c b shostakovich s response to official criticism and whether he used music as a kind of covert dissidence is a matter of dispute he outwardly conformed to government policies and positions reading speeches and putting his name to articles expressing government line wilson 2006 pp 369 70 but it is evident he disliked many aspects of regime as confirmed by his family his letters to isaak glikman and satirical cantata rayok which ridiculed anti formalist campaign and was kept hidden until after his death wilson 2006 p 336 he was a close friend of marshal of soviet union mikhail tukhachevsky who was executed in 1937 during great purge it is also uncertain to what extent shostakovich expressed his opposition to state in his music revisionist view was put forth by solomon volkov in 1979 book testimony which claimed to be shostakovich s memoirs dictated to volkov book alleged that many of composer s works contained coded anti government messages placing shostakovich in a tradition of russian artists outwitting censorship that goes back at least to alexander pushkin he incorporated many quotations and motifs in his work most notably his musical signature dsch this appears in several of his works including pushkin monologues symphony no 10 and string quartets nos 5 8 11 his longtime musical collaborator yevgeny mravinsky said shostakovich very often explained his intentions with very specific images and connotations wilson 1994 p 139 revisionist perspective has subsequently been supported by his children maxim and galina although maxim said in 1981 that volkov s book was not his father s work volkov has further argued both in testimony and in shostakovich and stalin that shostakovich adopted role of or holy fool in his relations with government other prominent revisionists are ian macdonald whose book new shostakovich put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music and elizabeth wilson whose shostakovich a life remembered provides testimony from many of composer s acquaintances musicians and scholars including laurel 2000 p 4 whether testimony faithfully reproduces shostakovich s confidences in a form and context he would have recognized and approved for publication remains doubtful yet even were its claim to authenticity not in doubt it would still furnish a poor source for serious biographer and richard taruskin contest authenticity and debate significance of testimony alleging that volkov compiled it from a combination of recycled articles gossip and possibly some information directly from composer fay documents these allegations in her 2002 article volkov s testimony reconsidered showing that only pages of original testimony manuscript that shostakovich had signed and verified are word for word reproductions of earlier interviews he gave none of which are controversial against this allan b ho and dmitry have pointed out that at least two of signed pages contain controversial material for instance on first page of chapter 3 where shostakovich notes that plaque that reads in this house lived vsevolod meyerhold should also say and in this house his wife was brutally murdered recorded legacy thumb a russian stamp in shostakovich s memory published in 2000 in may 1958 during a visit to paris shostakovich recorded his two piano concertos with andre cluytens as well as some short piano works these were issued by emi on an lp reissued by seraphim records on lp and eventually digitally remastered and released on cd shostakovich recorded two concertos in stereo in moscow for shostakovich also played piano solos in recordings of cello sonata op 40 with cellist daniil and also with mstislav rostropovich violin sonata op 134 with violinist david oistrakh and piano trio op 67 with violinist david oistrakh and cellist milos there is also a short sound film of shostakovich as soloist in a 1930s concert performance of closing moments of his first piano concerto a colour film of shostakovich supervising one of his operas from his last year was also made a major achievement was emi s recording of original opera lady macbeth of mtsensk there was at least one recording of cleaned up version katerina that shostakovich had made to satisfy soviet censorship but when conductor mstislav rostropovich and his wife soprano galina vishnevskaya were finally allowed to emigrate to west composer begged them to record full original score which they did in 1979 it features vishnevskaya as katerina nicolai gedda as sergei petkov as boris ismailov and a brilliant supporting cast under rostropovich s direction awards belgium member of royal academy of science letters and
