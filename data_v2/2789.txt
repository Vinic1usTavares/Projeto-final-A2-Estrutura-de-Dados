history of universities of oxford and cambridge in late 19th and early 20th centuries it was carried over from athleticism prevalent at public schools such as eton winchester shrewsbury and harrow all students regardless of their chosen area of study were required to spend at least their first year preparing for a first year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with greek language study removed from their required courses this concept of a bachelor of science had been adopted at other european universities london university had implemented it in 1860 but an 1880 proposal at oxford to replace classical requirement with a modern language like german or french was
