fire broke out aboard blucher which could not be contained fire spread to one of her anti aircraft gun magazines causing a large explosion and then spread further to ship s fuel bunkers blucher then capsized and sank with major loss of life wreck lies at bottom of oslofjord and in 2016 was designated as a war memorial to protect it from looters several artifacts have been raised from wreck including one of her arado 196 floatplanes which was recovered during an operation to pump out leaking fuel oil from ship in 1994 design thumb left recognition drawing of an admiral hipper class cruiser of heavy cruisers was ordered in context of german naval rearmament after nazi party came to power in 1933 and repudiated disarmament clauses of treaty of versailles in 1935 germany signed anglo german naval agreement with great britain which provided a legal basis for german naval rearmament treaty specified that germany would be able to build five treaty cruisers admiral hippers were nominally within 10 000 ton limit though they significantly exceeded figure as launched blucher was long overall had a beam of and a maximum draft of ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of blucher was powered by three sets of blohm voss geared steam turbines that drove three propellers turbines were supplied with steam by twelve ultra high pressure oil fired boilers ship s top speed was at as designed her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1 340 enlisted men bluchers primary armament was eight sk l 60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft her anti aircraft battery consisted of twelve l 65 guns twelve guns and eight guns she had four triple torpedo launchers all on main deck next to four range finders

three arado ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult blucher never had more than two seaplanes on board and en route to oslo one had to rest on catapult as one of hangars was used for storing bombs and torpedoes service history thumb blucher launching at kiel 8 june 1937 blucher was ordered by kriegsmarine from deutsche werke shipyard in kiel her keel was laid on 15 august 1936 under construction number 246 ship was launched on 8 june 1937 and was completed slightly over two years later on 20 september 1939 day she was commissioned into german fleet commanding admiral of marinestation der ostsee baltic naval station admiral conrad albrecht gave christening speech mrs erdmann widow of fregattenkapitan frigate captain alexander erdmann former commander of who had died in ship s sinking performed christening as built ship had a straight stem though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow increasing overall length to a raked funnel cap was also installed blucher spent most of november 1939 fitting out and finishing additional improvements by end of month ship was ready for sea trials she steamed to gotenhafen in baltic sea trials lasted until mid december after which ship returned to kiel for final modifications in january 1940 she resumed her exercises in baltic but by middle of month severe ice forced ship to remain in port on 5 april she was deemed to be ready for action and was therefore assigned to forces participating in invasion of norway operation weserubung thumb blucher en route to norway as seen from light cruiser emden on 5 april 1940 konteradmiral rear admiral oskar kummetz came aboard ship while she was in swinemunde an 800 strong detachment of ground troops from 163rd infantry division also boarded three days later on 8 april blucher left port bound for norway she was flagship for force that was to seize oslo norwegian capital group 5 of invasion force she was accompanied by heavy cruiser lutzow light cruiser and several smaller escorts british submarine spotted convoy steaming through kattegat and skagerrak and fired a spread of torpedoes germans evaded torpedoes however and proceeded with mission night had fallen by time german flotilla reached approaches to oslofjord shortly after 23 00 norwegian time norwegian patrol boat spotted flotilla german torpedo boat attacked pol iii and set her on fire but not before norwegian patrol boat raised alarm with a radio report of being attacked by unknown warships at 23 30 norwegian time south battery on rauoy spotted flotilla in searchlight and fired two warning shots five minutes later guns at rauoy battery fired four rounds at approaching germans but visibility was poor and no hits were scored guns at bolaerne fired only one warning shot at 23 32 before blucher could be targeted again she was out of firing sector of these shore guns and was seen no more by them after 23 35 german flotilla steamed on at a speed of shortly after midnight norwegian time an order from commanding admiral to extinguish all lighthouses and navigation lights was broadcast over nrk norsk norwegian broadcasting corporation german ships had been ordered to fire only in event they were directly fired on first between 00 30 and 02 00 flotilla stopped and 150 infantrymen of landing force were transferred to escorts and r21 from emden and r18 and from blucher battle of drobak sound thumb left one of three guns at oscarsborg fortress r boats were ordered to engage rauoy bolaerne and naval port and city of horten despite apparent loss of surprise blucher proceeded further into fjord to continue with timetable to reach oslo by dawn at 04 20 norwegian searchlights again illuminated ship and at 04 21 guns of oscarsborg fortress opened fire on blucher at very close range beginning battle of drobak sound with two hits on her port side first was high above bridge hitting battle station for commander of anti aircraft guns main range finder in top of battle mast was knocked out of alignment but blucher had four more major rangefinders second 28 cm shell struck near aircraft hangar and started a major fire as fire spread it detonated explosives carried for infantry hindering firefighting efforts explosion set fire to two arado seaplanes on board one on catapult and other in one of hangars explosion also probably punched a hole in armored deck over turbine room 1 turbine 1 and generator room 3 stopped for lack of steam and only outboard shafts from turbine room 2 3 were operational germans were unable to locate source of gunfire blucher increased speed to in an attempt to get past norwegian guns guns on drobak some on bluchers starboard side opened fire as well at a distance of blucher entered narrows between kopas and main battery at kopas battery ceased firing at blucher and engaged next target lutzow scoring multiple hits first engineer karl wrote in his report that hits from guns on drobak which were fired on starboard side were all between section iv and x in a length of amidships between b turret and c turret however all damage was on port side after first salvo from 15 cm batteries in drobak steering from bridge was disabled blucher had just passed drobak shallows and was in a turn to port commander got her back on track by using side shafts but she lost speed at 04 34 norwegian land based torpedo batteries scored two hits on ship thumb blucher on fire and sinking in drobak sound according to kummetz s report first torpedo hit boiler room 2 just under funnel and second hit turbine room 2 3 turbine room for side shafts boiler 1 had already been destroyed by gunfire only one boiler remained but steam pipes through boilers 1 and 2 and turbine room 2 3 had been damaged and turbine 1 had lost power by 04 34 ship had been severely damaged but had successfully passed through firing zone most of norwegian guns could no longer bear on her 15 cm guns in kopas battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing and they were still within range battery crews asked for orders but commander of fortress birger eriksen concluded fortress has served its purpose after passing gun batteries crew including personnel manning guns were tasked with fighting fire by that time she had taken on a list of 18 degrees although this was not initially problematic fire eventually reached one of ship s 10 5 cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2 3 which exploded violently blast ruptured several bulkheads in engine rooms and ignited ship s fuel stores battered ship slowly began to capsize and order to abandon ship was given blucher rolled over and sank at 07 30 with significant casualties naval historian erich groner states that number of casualties is unknown and henrik lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1 000 soldiers and sailors jurgen rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in sinking loss of blucher and damage done to lutzow caused german force to withdraw ground troops were landed on eastern side of fjord they proceeded inland and captured oscarborg fortress by 09 00 on 10 april they then moved on to attack capital airborne troops captured fornebu airport and completed encirclement of city and by 14 00 on 10 april it was in german hands delay caused by temporary withdrawal of bluchers task force however allowed norwegian government and royal family to escape city wreck thumb upright one of bluchers anchors is now at aker brygge in oslo blucher remains at bottom of drobak narrows at a depth of ship s screws were removed in 1953 and there have been several proposals to raise wreck since 1963 but none have been carried out when blucher left germany she had about of oil on board she expended some of fuel en route to norway and some was lost in sinking but she was constantly leaking oil in 1991 leakage rate increased to per day threatening environment norwegian government therefore decided to remove as much oil as possible from wreck in october 1994 company as together with deep sea divers drilled holes in 133 fuel tanks and removed of oil 47 fuel bunkers were unreachable and may still contain oil after being run through a cleaning process oil was sold oil extraction operation provided an opportunity to recover one of bluchers two arado 196 aircraft plane was raised on 9 november 1994 and is currently at museum sola aviation museum near stavanger shipwreck was protected as a war memorial on 16 june 2016 but also protected by law by norwegian directorate for cultural heritage for those who actually have their burial at bottom of fjord intention was to protect ship from looters blucher protected by law to prevent looting nrk 6 16 2016
