recorded history that two tropical storms struck florida within 1 day previously hurricane gordon and tropical storm helene struck state within five days of each other in september 2000 originally it was thought that two storms in 1906 season hit state within 12 hours however suspected tropical storm was determined to be a tropical depression in a more recent analysis bonnie was first of five tropical systems to make landfall in florida during 2004 atlantic hurricane season and second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during month of august because bonnie hit florida immediately before charley damage between two storms was often difficult to differentiate president george w bush responded to storm by declaring much of florida a federal disaster area on
