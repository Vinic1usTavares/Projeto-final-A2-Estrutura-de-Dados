persecution of zoroastrians is religious persecution inflicted upon followers of zoroastrian faith persecution of zoroastrians occurred throughout religion s history discrimination and harassment began in form of sparse violence and forced conversions muslims are recorded to have destroyed fire temples zoroastrians living under muslim rule were required to pay a tax called jizya volume 2 zoroastrian places of worship were desecrated fire temples were destroyed and mosques were built in their place many libraries were burned and much of their cultural heritage was lost gradually an increasing number of laws were passed which regulated zoroastrian behavior and limited their ability to participate in society over time persecution of zoroastrians became more common and widespread and number of believers decreased by force significantly most were forced to convert due to systematic abuse and discrimination inflicted upon them by followers of islam once a zoroastrian family was forced to convert to islam children were sent to an islamic school to learn arabic and study teachings of islam as a result some of these people lost their zoroastrian faith however under samanids who were zoroastrian converts to islam persian language flourished on occasion zoroastrian clergy assisted muslims in attacks against those whom they deemed zoroastrian heretics persecution of zoroastrians by muslims islamic conquest until arab invasion and subsequent muslim conquest in mid 7th century persia modern day iran was a politically independent state spanning from mesopotamia to indus river and dominated by a zoroastrian majority zoroastrianism was official state religion of four pre islamic persian empires last being sassanian empire that passed a decree solidifying this in 224 ce arab invasion abruptly brought to an end religious domination of zoroastrianism in persia and instituted islam as official religion of state yemen s zoroastrians who had jizya imposed on them after being conquered by muhammad are mentioned by islamic historian al baladhuri after muslim conquest of persia zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and subjected to persecutions discrimination and harassment began in form of sparse violence those paying jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by tax collectors zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to islam many fire temples with their four axial arch openings were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab prayer niche on place of arch nearest to qibla direction of mecca zoroastrian temples converted into mosques in such a manner could be found in bukhara as well as in and near istakhr and other persian cities urban areas where arab governors made their quarters were most vulnerable to such religious persecution great fire temples were turned into mosques and citizens were forced to conform or flee many libraries were burnt and much cultural heritage was lost gradually there were increased number of laws regulating zoroastrian behavior limiting their ability to participate in society and made life difficult for zoroastrians in hope that they would convert to islam over time persecution of zoroastrians became more common and widespread and number of believers decreased significantly many converted some superficially to escape systematic abuse and discrimination by law of land others accepted islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would according to zoroastrian dogma make them impure as their work involved defiling fire according to thomas walker arnold muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining islamic tenants to zoroastrians as there were many similarities between faiths according to arnold for persian he would meet ahura mazda and under names of allah and iblis once a zoroastrian family converted to islam children had to go to muslim religion school and learn arabic and teachings of quran and these children lost their zoroastrian identity these factors continued to contribute to increasing rates of conversion from zoroastrianism to islam a persian scholar commented why so many had to die or suffer because one side was determined to impose his religion upon other who could not understand 642 to 10th century in 7th century ce persia succumbed to invading arabs with death of yazdegerd iii who was treacherously slain in 651 after being defeated in battle sassanid line came to an end and zoroastrian faith which had been state religion for more than a thousand years was deposed and islam took its place as national religion of persia in following centuries zoroastrians faced much religious discrimination and persecution harassments as well as being identified as najis polluted and impure to muslims making them unfit to live alongside muslims and therefore forcing them to evacuate from cities and face major sanctions in all spheres of life zoroastrians have been subject to public humiliation through dress regulations to being labeled as najis and to exclusion in fields of society education and work rashidun caliphs 642 661 under first four caliphs persia remained predominantly zoroastrian zoroastrians were awarded status of people of book or dhimmi status by caliph umar although some practices contrary to islam were prohibited when persian capital of ctesiphon in province of today known as iraq fell to muslims during islamic conquest of persia in 637 under military command of sa ad ibn abi waqqas during caliphate of umar palaces and their archives were burned according to an account in tarikh al tabari by al tabari arab commander sa ad ibn abi waqqas wrote to caliph umar ibn al b asking what should be done with books at ctesiphon umar wrote back if books contradict qur an they are blasphemous on other hand if they are in agreement they are not needed as for us qur an is sufficient thus huge library was destroyed and books product of generations of persian scientists and scholars were thrown into fire or euphrates nearly 40 000 captured persian noblemen were taken as slaves and sold in arabia arabs called persians ajam meaning foreign first voice of protest came from piruz an enslaved persian artisan who assassinated umar when city of in south a zoroastrian religious center put up stiff resistance against arab invaders 40 000 residents were slaughtered or hanged umayyads 661 750 umayyads who ruled from syria followed caliphs persecution increased in 8th century during reign of late umayyad caliphs whose dynastic predecessors had conquered most of last zoroastrian state by 652 jizya tax was imposed upon zoroastrians and official language of persia became arabic instead of local persian in 741 umayyads officially decreed that non muslims be excluded from governmental positions iranian muslims at this time started a new tradition which made islam appear as a partly iranian religion they pointed out that an iranian salaman i farsi had a great influence on muhammad prophet another myth was created that husayn son of fourth caliph had married a sassanian princess named shahr banu lady of land whose son became fourth muslim imam and started shia branch of islam iranian muslims thus believed that shia islam was derived from sassanian royalty these two beliefs made it easier for zoroastrians to convert an instance of religious oppression is recorded when an arab governor appointed a commissioner to supervise destruction of shrines throughout iran regardless of treaty obligations one of umayyad caliphs was quoted saying milk persians and once their milk dries suck their blood quoting ibn e yazid ibn mohalleb a general under umayyads was appointed head of a great army to lead mazandaran expedition on way to mazandaran general ordered captives to be hanged at two sides of road so that victorious arab army pass through attack on tabarestan present day mazandaran failed but he established his control in gorgan by orders of yazid ibn mohalleb so many persians were beheaded in gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him as he had vowed extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people s blood for three days and he fed his army with bread made from that very bloody flour but tabarestan remained invincible until majority of zoroastrians migrated towards india and rest converted to islam gradually abbasids 752 804 umayyads were followed by abbasid dynasty which came to power with help of iranian muslims persecution of zoroastrians increased significantly under abbasids temples and sacred fire shrines were destroyed also during abbasid rule status of zoroastrians in persian lands was reduced from or dhimmi people who were protected by state and generally considered people of book to kafirs non believers as a result zoroastrians were not granted same rights and status as jews and christians iranian muslims were welcomed to court but not zoroastrians zoroastrians were denied access to bathhouses on grounds that their bodies were polluted hardly any zoroastrian family was able to avoid conversion to islam when employed by abbasids because of their harshness towards unbelievers and due to their lavish patronage of persian muslims abbasids proved to be deadly foes of zoroastrianism according to ibn tahir an arabicized persian and governor of khorasan for abbasid caliphs banned publication in persian and by his order all zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to be thrown in fire as a result many literary works written in pahlavi script disappeared during abbasid reign zoroastrians for first time became a minority in iran nevertheless there were instances of toleration during abbasid era particularly under reign of al mu tasim who flogged an imam and for destroying a fire temple and replacing it with a mosque saffarids 869 903 abbasids were followed by saffarids zoroastrians lived under leadership of their high priest since they had no king in iraq political center of sassanian state zoroastrian institutions were viewed as appendages of royal government and family and suffered much destruction and confiscation closely associated with power structures of persian empire zoroastrian clergy quickly declined after it was deprived of state support samanids 819 999 samanids were of zoroastrian theocratic nobility who voluntarily converted to sunni islam during their reign approximately 300 years after arab conquest fire temples were still found in almost every province of persia including khorasan kirman sijistan and other areas under samanid control according to al there were fire temples even in baghdad at time historian al masudi a baghdad born arab who wrote a comprehensive treatise on history and geography in about 956 records that after conquest he also added sindh and sin of indian subcontinent al hind to list this general statement of al masudi is fully supported by medieval geographers who make mention of fire temples in most of iranian towns 10th to 20th century migration to india thumb a parsi wedding portrait 1948 zoroastrians moved to india in successive migrations in islamic period initial migration following conquest has been characterized as a religious persecution by invading muslims according to account zoroastrians suffered at their hands and in order to protect themselves and safeguard their religion fled first to northern iran then to island of hormuz and finally to india this generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises muslim persecution while identifying parsis as religious refugees recently scholars have questioned this explanation of iranian origins there is a scarcity of sources about migration historians are forced to rely exclusively on qissa i sanjan written in 1599 by a parsi priest and ye e hindustan written more than 200 years later this is complicated by fact that there were already zoroastrians in india in sasanian period according to legend at beginning of 10th century a small group of zoroastrians living around town of and fort of sanjan in province of greater khorasan decided that iran was no longer safe for zoroastrians and their religion refugees accepted conditions and founded settlement of sanjan gujarat which is said to have been named after city of their origin sanjan near merv in present day turkmenistan iranian zoroastrians are known to have been trading with india for centuries before dates calculated for arrival of parsis per qissa i sanjan and homi while discussing archaeological evidence for landing of zoroastrians at sanjan conclude that most likely date for migration at start of middle phase of their chronology namely early to mid eighth century nevertheless they express their general skepticism about qissa i sanjan account scholar andre wink has theorized that zoroastrian immigrants to india both before and after muslim conquest of iran were primarily merchants since evidence suggests it was only some time after their arrival that religious experts and priests were sent for to join them he argues that competition over trade routes with muslims may also have contributed to their immigration although historically unsubstantiated story of how zoroastrians gained permission to step on shores of gujarat continues to be critical to self identity of group per commonly told narrative rajah of sanjan summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn t be a burden on or a threat to indigenous communities replying to their request of practising their religion and till land he showed them a jug full of milk saying sanjan like it was full in one version a dastur added a coin to milk saying like coin no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich milk nonetheless in another version he added sugar instead and claimed that like it they would sweeten lands of sanjan in both of them their settlement is approved by rajah who addresses certain conditions for it they would explain their religion promise not to proselytise adopt gujarati speech and dress surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall one of dates that can be fixed with certainty is arrival of parsees in navsari when a named arrived there in 1142 ad to perform religious ceremonies for zoroastrians settled there traditionally parsee settlers had named it navsari after sari in iran however this was considered wrong by gazetteer of bombay presidency who noted that town was already shown in ptolemy s map apart from two accounts of confrontation in qissa parsi lore presents a smooth integration into local culture of first their hindu and then muslim neighbors community still exists in western india and it currently contains largest concentration of zoroastrians in world parsi legends regarding their ancestors migration to india depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping harsh rule of fanatical muslim invaders in order to preserve their ancient faith epic poem qissa i sanjan story of sanjan is an account of early years of zoroastrian settlers on indian subcontinent it is only in recent times that parsis have become aware of extent of oppression that their ancestors in iran had to endure safavids 1502 1747 zoroastrians had difficult time during safavid period and faced repeated persecution and forced conversion safavid kings sought to compel them to accept shia islam sunnis too were forced to convert to shia or were persecuted imprisoned exiled or killed cambridge illustrated history of islamic world francis robinson p 72 iraq old land new nation in conflict william spencer p 51 zoroastrians were also branded as impure in addition to being infidels as earlier in century so this period also witnessed sporadic campaigns for conversion of armenians and zoroastrians focusing blame for economic and other ills on these and other minorities whose involvement in spice export for example was well known in early 16th century great safavid king shah abbas i settled a number of zoroastrians in a suburb of his new capital isfahan suburb of isfahan where zoroastrians lived was called gabr mahal or gabrabad derived from word gabr europeans who visited his court left accounts of gabars or an insulting term used for zoroastrians by muslims agree on poverty and simplicity of their lives fearing desecration by muslims zoroastrians hid sacred fires and conversed in a newly invented dialect called dari later safavid kings were not as tolerant as shah abbas muhammad baqir persuaded sultan husayn 1688 1728 ce to decree forcible conversion of zoroastrians those who refused were killed accounts in mino written during period demonstrate that zoroastrians were subjected to harassment by shi ite majority their places of worship were under a constant threat of being destroyed by 1707 when le bruyn visited isfahan zoroastrians were no longer able practice their religion freely he notes that most deprived zoroastrians had been brought to isfahan and had been forced to become muslim three years earlier in 1821 ker porter visiting isfahan notes that there were hardly any zoroastrians left in isfahan and gabrabad was in ruins qajar dynasty 1796 1925 a zoroastrian family in qajar iran circa 1910 thumb right a zoroastrian astrologer named mulla gushtasp predicted fall of zand dynasty to qajar army in kerman because of gushtasp s forecast zoroastrians of kerman were spared by conquering army of agha mohammad khan qajar despite aforementioned favorable incident zoroastrians during qajar dynasty remained in agony and their population continued to decline even during rule of agha mohammad khan founder of dynasty many zoroastrians were killed and some were taken as captives to azerbaijan zoroastrians regard qajar period as one of their worst many foreign visitors to iran of time had commented on their pitiful situation traveller a v w jackson noted that zoroastrians lived in constant fear of persecution by muslim extremists and their lives were in danger whenever fanatical spirit of islam broke out such as one witnessed by him in yazd according to edward browne wall of zoroastrian houses had to be lower than that of muslims and prohibited from marking their houses with distinctive signs zoroastrians were forbidden from erecting new houses and repairing old ones various methods were used to proselytize minorities according to a law if any

turbans tightly and neatly carrying watch or a ring were all forbidden to zoroastrians during rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public because water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute muslims zoroastrian men in yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a muslim s home so as to prevent carpet from being polluted forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys upon facing a muslim they had to dismount not until 1923 was general proscription against zoroastrians riding horses and donkeys lifted by reza shah on top of all misery zoroastrians had to pay a heavy religious tax known as jizya zoroastrian sources record method of extracting this as designed to humiliate dhimmi taxed person who was compelled to stand while officer receiving money sat on a high throne upon receiving payment officer gave dhimmi a blow on neck and drove him roughly away public was invited to watch spectacle arab tax collectors would mock zoroastrians for wearing kushti and would rip it off hanging cord around necks of beleaguered faithful due to corruption of tax officials at times twice and even three times official figure would be collected because every intermediary had to receive his share if families could not afford paying jizya their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire that is how term came about under woeful conditions some had to convert and there were those who declared themselves muslims picked up islamic names but in secret continued zoroastrian practices today latter group among zoroastrians is known as in response to persecution and segregation policies zoroastrians community became closed

by their parsi brethren there they formed second major indian zoroastrian community known as iranis emissaries to iran when news of their plight reached parsis who by this time had become quite prosperous parsi funds were set up to help iranian zoroastrians and emissaries were dispatched to iran a parsi philanthropist maneckji was sent to help them he found only zoroastrians in kerman yazd
