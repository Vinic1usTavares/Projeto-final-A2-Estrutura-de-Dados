rain world is a 2017 survival platformer video game in which player controls a slug like creature a slugcat searching a hostile derelict world for its family slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies forage for food and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive which was intention of developers who wanted players to feel like a rat living on subway tracks in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher level function game was developed by videocult a small indie team over six years and published by adult swim games for playstation 4 and windows in march 2017 it received mixed reviews from critics who praised its art design and fluid animations but disliked its brutal difficulty inconsistent save points and imprecise controls some of this criticism was addressed with later updates which also added a multiplayer mode a later version game was released for nintendo switch in late 2018 gameplay player s character referred as a slugcat uses spears and rocks to survive a hostile ruined and obtuse 2d world in search of family from whom it was separated player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens each with randomized enemies slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food which is used to hibernate in scarce designated safe rooms hibernation resets day cycle and saves player s progress if player does not reach hibernation point before end of day a crushing rain will pour both flooding world and possibly pummeling slugcat to death however if player has not eaten sufficient food then it will not be allowed to hibernate upon death slugcat returns to last hibernation save point player also loses a karma point which are indicated at bottom of screen karma is gained upon successfully hibernating and player can shield their current karma level by eating a yellow flower flower appears at start of each area and is re planted wherever slugcat dies player needs to meet a karmic threshold to reach specific areas of game enemies range from camouflaged plants to large vultures to komodo dragon like lizards and large aquatic creatures many enemies can kill slugcat in one hit and some species have internal variation such as pink lizards that can climb enemies spawn at random such that player cannot progress through trial and error experimentation enemies possess dynamic ai and exist in game s world perpetually even when not on same screen as player players are expected to mainly evade enemies but they do need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit out of trees it is possible to kill enemies through use of prolonged attacks though it is usually more recommended to just attack them to ward them off however this becomes more of a requirement in harder difficulty where slugcat must consume more meat to hibernate slugcat can hold two objects at once and switch between them it can also eat power up plants which grant status effects such as slowing time rain world setting is destroyed by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art its story is communicated through details in environment images during hibernation and holograms from a worm that monitors slugcat game offers little to guide player apart from worm who gives some hints about where to go and what to collect towards beginning of game player can view a map to check their progress through large in game world development prior to creating rain world jakobsson was a graphic designer in sweden who taught himself how to animate sprites he had played few games and had little industry experience when development began in 2011 he began with a sketch of an elongated cat which was named slugcat by one of his youtube viewers though character has no official name jakobsson had previous interest in derelict environments and what they reveal about humans who previously occupied them partly inspired by his feelings of foreignness while living as an exchange student in seoul south korea a core idea in game s development was to recreate life of rat in manhattan this rat understands how to find food hide and live in subway but does not understand subway s structuring purpose or why it was built jakobsson and his development partner james primate hoped that players would similarly feel as if they were close to making sense of game s abstraction of an industrial environment without fully understanding jakobsson designed rain world enemies to live their own lives in which they hunt for food and struggle to survive rather than serve as obstacles for player enemy placements are randomly generated and in final playtests a week prior to release developers noted how some players became more or less interested in game based on luck of their enemy spawns developers expected players to learn to avoid combat and play game primarily through stealth and flight jakobsson served as game s artist designer and programmer his levels are made by hand in a standalone level editor designer brushes recurring cloned elements such as plants and chains onto map software combines and processes to add shadow at one point rain world included a multiplayer mode and separate story and custom modes development team successfully crowdfunded some development costs via kickstarter in early 2014 by early 2015 about four years into development team had switched to unity game engine and released a test version of game to its kickstarter backers music primate who is also known as james therrien wrote rain world soundtrack handled indie studio s business and designed levels primate first found game on an indie game internet forum and sent jakobsson 12 tracks as a successful pitch he originally composed a chiptune style soundtrack with his musician partner lydia but turned to field recordings of litter for otherworldly sounds rain world music is low fi and electronic primate wanted music to approximate game s eclectic visuals which mix industrial science fiction jungle and various architectural elements in lieu of traditional character dialogue and narration rain world story was partly communicated through its soundtrack early game sound is primitive and based on slugcat s feelings of fear and hunger and eventually builds to describe new areas rain world has over 3 5 hours of recorded music across 160 tracks at any given time between eight and twelve tracks will simultaneously layer to create ambiance and respond to slugcat s in game context release team announced that it was in last phases of development in early 2016 animations from rain world were popularized on social media in praise of their uncanny fluidity game was developed by videocult published by adult swim games and released for playstation 4 and windows on march 28 2017 previews compared rain world to predecessors including difficulty of super meat boy soundtrack of fez and puzzle platforming to metroid and oddworld after release videocult announced a series of major content updates which were planned for release later in 2017 slated features included local multi player functionality featuring over 50 new rooms and two alternative which make game easier and harder respectively subsequently 1 5 patch which contained all of those features was released on december 11 2017 an additional 1 7 update in late 2018 added two new play modes that either increase or decrease gameplay s intensity this release also brought multiplayer feature to playstation in 2018 videocult and adult swim games released rain world for nintendo switch platform in december 2018 limited run games released a physical edition of rain world for playstation 4 later that month reception game received mixed reviews according to video game review aggregator metacritic reviewers praised game s art design and criticized harshness of its gameplay mechanics particularly its unpredictable deaths ruthless enemies and time consuming hibernation requirements eurogamer compared its savage survival elements to 2012 tokyo jungle rain world punishing gameplay frustrated reviewers who often descended into apathy considering random enemy spawns one hit kills infrequent game saves frequent repetition crushing rain some inexplicable enemy movements and sometimes clumsy controls ign wrote that any of game s challenging elements taken alone would be tough but fair but when considered together odds are stacked so high against player that it risks toppling entire structure of game reviewers were bored by repeated navigation of rooms with random enemies after each death which tempered their strong urge to explore polygon reviewer was miserable following loss of her multi hour progression she wrote about futility as a central tenet of rain world and felt that she was not given proper tools to survive reviewers lamented in particular how slugcat s jerky animations and imprecise throwing mechanics led to many unwarranted deaths multiple reviewers concluded that while some hardcore players might enjoy tough gameplay rain world excluded a large audience with its design choices as its choice of emergent enemy strategy would feel unfair to most players rock paper shotgun called game s checkpointing among worst in modern platformers and its challenge unlike similarly punishing dark souls without purpose rain world karmic gates which require players to have a positive hibernate to death ratio were arbitrary goals disrespectful of player s time according to gamespot making players trudge through an area a dozen times ign argued is antithetical in a game in which exploration itself is reward pc gamer reviewer with time began to see rain world cumbersome controls less as bad design than as thematically appropriate given game s intent to disempower player some reviewers fondly recalled serendipitous in game encounters as they learned game environment s unwritten rules not knowing how foreign figures would react rock paper shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles this experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across a room to avoid a new encroaching enemy type and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone rain world was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation according to gamespot reviewer whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room s lantern using weapons as climbable objects and luring enemies into battle to distract from slugcat s presence those critics considered these mysterious perceptive interactions to be among game s best features though far outweighed by rain world punishing game mechanics during development rain world animations became popular on social media for their uncanny fluidity which reviewers continued to praise at release ign described slugcat s animations as beautiful and reactive to angle and physics of movement from clinging to poles to squeezing through ventilation reviewer said it was among best aesthetics in a 2d game with each screen showing abundant detail and meticulous craft graphics were more interesting than beautiful to polygon reviewer who also praised limited color palette s role in distinguishing slugcat prey and enemies from environment while some journalists compared game s aesthetic to that of limbo rock paper shotgun reviewer felt that rain world had more in common with oddworld abe s oddysee aesthetic both featured similarly dark yet attractive worlds scary yet fascinating characters frequent inter enemy conflict and frustrating or masochistic controls oddworld though had more frequent saves rain world successfully depicted cruel indifference of nature according to gamespot its imaginative and compelling inhabitants in a bleak alien spirit of games like bioshock and abzu in which reviewer was too attracted to artistic detail to contemplate credulity of man made environment accolades game was nominated for best platformer in pc gamers 2017 game of year awards and also for best platformer best art direction and most innovative in ign s best of 2017 awards it was also nominated for statue of liberty award for best world at new york game awards
