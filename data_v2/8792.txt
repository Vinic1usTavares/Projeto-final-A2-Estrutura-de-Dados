even so title of adjutant was itself perceived as demeaning joaquim inacio later complained in what part of world does navy minister have a general officer as an adjutant what is an adjutant other than a young officer who transmits orders and even messages he receives from his chief he concluded thus title of adjutant cannot encumber an officer who supervises armada s discipline and answers for

humaita that prevented further progress upriver beyond fortress he anchored his ships in a cove that became known as porto elisiario elisiario port for six months brazilian warships remained stationed between curupayty and humaita bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage encirclement of humaita could not be completed until allies gained full control of river allied commander in chief argentine president bartolome mitre had pressed inhauma for months to execute that goal brazilian had however developed second thoughts about enterprise and procrastinated he believed unfairly that mitre would welcome destruction of brazil s warships severely weakening empire militarily and there were other factors that prompted inhauma to have second thoughts level of river had fallen and as encirclement on land had not been completed even if brazilian ships did manage to get past batteries they could well become stranded with little or no fuel and possibly no supporting allied troops on banks inhauma also argued that ironclads were too large and had limited manoeuvrability in narrow channel at humaita being better suited to seagoing operations than on a river he preferred to wait for shallow draft monitors that were under construction in rio de janeiro after a year in paraguay inhauma had also become ill with a lingering disease not positively identified although malaria is suspected and had fallen into depression becoming what historian francisco doratioto themed no more than a ghost of an admiral by january 1868 humaita had been completely cut off from land reinforcement and shallow draft monitors had arrived both inhauma and his officers balked at putting new vessels into action it was inhauma s son in law captain of sea and war delfim carlos de carvalho soon baron of passagem who volunteered to lead a squadron on 19 february brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up paraguay river under heavy fire gaining full control of river and thus isolating humaita from resupply by water on 2 march 1868 parties of paraguayans in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded brazilian ironclads anchored in imperiled vessels dispatched a boat to warn inhauma who was aboard flagship brasil downriver at elisiario port by time he arrived brazilians had locked themselves inside their ships and paraguayans had taken control of decks inhauma ordered brasil and two other vessels to open fire decimating paraguayans and saving ironclads a day later he was raised from baron to viscount by pedro ii on 25 july allies occupied humaita

rodrigues torres viscount of itaborai back into power on 16 july 1868 during progressive administration inhauma had developed a trusting friendship with able young navy minister afonso celso de assis figueiredo later viscount of ouro preto return of conservatives resulted in inhauma s election to chamber of deputies as a representative for province of amazonas although he would never assume office in new political climate inhauma was also considered a contender for a senatorial chair representing province of rio de janeiro meanwhile caxias had organized an assault on new paraguayan defenses which lopez had thrown up along pikysyry south of asuncion paraguay s capital this stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by paraguay river and by swampy jungle of chaco region caxias had a road cut through supposedly impenetrable chaco located on other side of paraguayan river where allied army was camped brazilian ships carried allied troops across river where they moved over road which had been finished in december allied forces outflanked paraguayan lines and attacked from rear combined allied forces annihilated paraguayan army and on 1 january 1869 asuncion was occupied inhauma reached paraguayan national capital on 3 january 1869 increasingly sick and depressed he lamented in his private journal that conflict cannot be called a war but a killing of people extermination of paraguayan nation inhauma temporarily transferred his command to his son in law baron of passagem on 16 january on 28 january inhauma was officially discharged from that post and promoted to admiral highest rank in armada having received permission from conservative cabinet to depart he left for rio de janeiro on 8 february arriving ten days later although welcomed with greatest demonstrations of enthusiasm inhauma was so weak that he had to be carried from docks to his carriage alfredo d escragnolle taunay viscount of taunay in his memoirs said that pedro ii upon learning of inhauma s arrival refused to pay a visit to him it had become common for officers to claim sickness so that they could withdraw from war emperor soon realized that inhauma was indeed very ill and asked for daily updates on his condition inhauma s health steadily deteriorated and he died on 8 march at around 04 30 in morning according to historian eugenio vilhena de morais malaria was cause of death his coffin was placed in a carriage reserved for funerals of members of imperial family it was escorted by three cavalry squadrons and followed by three hundred carriages while onlookers crowded both sides of streets along procession s route tamandare and future viscount of ouro preto were among pallbearers he was buried in sao francisco xavier cemetery popularly known as

fondly called uncle joaquim by his subordinates brazilian navy s slang phrase na which meant to behave correctly was derived from his name since 1870 no comprehensive biography of inhauma has been published even though he according to francisco eduardo alves de is and always will be important to navy of brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief inhauma class corvette built in 1980s and 1990s was named after him despite scant attention paid him in historical literature there are some historians who share a highly positive view of inhauma americo lacombe said that he was one of
