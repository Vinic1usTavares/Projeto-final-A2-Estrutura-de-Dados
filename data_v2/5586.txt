complete with tilt or touch options but d pad controls were too easy for those who could not handle former albeit necessary for aforementioned impossible levels chris watters made note that game had a vague clumsiness to it no matter chosen control scheme due to cube s rolling momentum zachary miller in particular criticized game s ability to hold onto moving blocks by balancing cube s edge against it and also found minimap unhelpful at times edge extended expansion s ios release received universal acclaim according to video game aggregator metacritic toucharcade writer troy gave game a perfect score harry slater of pocket gamer gave expansion same gold award rating as previous title slide to play described levels as cleverly built however found dark environments difficult to see in when
