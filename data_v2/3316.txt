knowledge of budget had to be educated on accepted business procedures on which rest of world operated price 130 1 while middleton was helping lsu recover from this traumatic ordeal he was also keeping an eye on events in europe in july 1940 he wrote a letter to general george marshall asking if his services were needed by army as united states was making preparations for war marshall replied that as much as army would like to have middleton back in uniform all army could do would be to place him in some training role which would not effectively use his battle experience price 134 5 middleton stayed at lsu until 1942 describing his days as comptroller of lsu as long days that he would not want to relive but after first year he found both work and his association with hebert borth and hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding he felt that during this period of time from 1939 to 1941 he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in past world war ii troy middleton was out dove hunting with his son troy jr and a friend on sunday morning 7 december 1941 having had a successful morning trio decided to take a break for lunch

highways this highway originally in american sector had been usurped by montgomery with no word of change of boundaries given to middleton price 150 word eventually came down from alexander that boundaries had been changed which meant that when 45th reached highway they became frozen in place with no opportunity to advance middleton not willing to sit out remainder of battle moved his division from right of ii corps to left traveling ninety miles out of way through back areas of other american divisions to get in position for march north price 150 3 on 23 july first elements of

price 155 in recalling events on sicily in his biography middleton noted a strain in his relationship with general patton patton never comfortable as brunt of someone else s humor felt that mauldin cartoons published in division newspaper were irreverent and middleton consistently defended mauldin but was verbally ordered by patton to get rid of mauldin and his cartoons when middleton told patton to put order in writing issue was dropped price 160 soon thereafter patton had much more to worry about after he slapped two soldiers who he suspected of malingering in hospitals these incidents brought general patton public condemnation and loss of his command italian mainland month of august 1943 was used by 45th division for some rest and planning seven plans for invasion of italy were put on table and three of them were adopted of which british had two operation baytown and operation slapstick and americans had one called operation avalanche price 164 45th division would

faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking troops back off beaches price 165 middleton telling his staff that they were not leaving spread around word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting on morning of 14 september units of 45th did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern germans were dug in here and repulsed americans initially but with aid of some naval gun fire germans were eventually pushed back clark visited front later that day and was convinced that his army was going to stay price 166 general dwight d eisenhower now supreme allied commander in mediterranean visited beachhead on 17 september observing that battle had been won following day germans had pulled out of area and 45th was able to advance to venafro before meeting any resistance division was at far right of fifth army working up center of italian boot adjacent to montgomery s british eighth army which was responsible for eastern half of boot by 24 september division had taken and after some heavy fighting and by 3 october they had taken benevento price 167 on 21 october division was put into corps reserve following almost six weeks of uninterrupted action there was still some german resistance around venafro and elements of 179th infantry regiment secured town on 2 november with this fighting came to a large pause as allied planners studied further action price 167 8 with lull in fighting and onset of autumn rains coupled with endless hills and deepening mud middleton s left knee which had been uncomfortable for more than a year was now becoming agonizing he had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football but there was no immediate explanation for pain in his left leg medics studied his leg but had no answers price 168 9 in late november middleton went to hospital in naples staying well into december still without adequate diagnosis he was able to hobble around and did some staff work then flew to general eisenhower s headquarters in north africa he stayed there until mid january when he was sent to walter reed hospital back in united states price 169 while middleton was at walter reed general eisenhower communicated to general george marshall u s army chief of staff that he needed middleton back overseas acknowledging middleton s difficulty with his knees eisenhower said i don t give a damn about his knees i want his head and his heart and i ll take him into battle on a litter if we have to price 171 command of 45th division went to major general william w eagles two generals came up with a plan and middleton was sent to six army installations in tennessee colorado and washington d c with a brief stopover to visit his family in baton rouge middleton would be taking command of viii corps in england and was sent to various locations to confuse enemy about personnel change accompanying him was a sergeant who had been a physical therapist in civilian life and who would massage middleton s knees twice a day for next year when asked what staff he needed to take with him middleton replied that he would keep staff that was already in place except that for an aide he would like his old lsu friend mack hornbeak who had served with him through sicily and italy price 172 3 viii corps thumb right 100px viii corps insignia u s viii corps had arrived in united kingdom in december 1943 and was commanded by major general emil f reinhardt who middleton had known for many years while he was an able commander his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by middleton though reinhardt would later command a division in european fighting middleton s first stop in europe before assuming command of viii corps was to confer with his friend and commander dwight eisenhower eisenhower had asked middleton about his views on making patton commander of an army middleton thought it was a good idea since patton was such an able fighter eisenhower agreed but was concerned about patton s propensity to embarrass army by things he said to press following this patton was given command of third army which was headquartered north of london during preparation for invasion of normandy middleton s viii corps headquarters was in town of kidderminster about fifteen miles from birmingham and about 110 miles northwest of london in order to deceive germans middleton moved his headquarters another 75 miles to north near liverpool this made it appear that corps would move east to english channel for a landing near calais france ruse was effective keeping germans guessing and compelling them to split their forces among multiple locations along french coast instead of concentrating their forces at one probable landing point viii corps fell under patton s third army and trained in england from march to late may 1944 two weeks before invasion corps was pulled out of third army and placed in omar bradley s first army first army was responsible for d day landings in normandy and once allies were established on shore middleton was to bring his viii corps across shortly before invasion middleton took his corps to southampton where they awaited their channel crossing time cotentin peninsula and operation cobra viii corps sat in southampton from d day 6 june until 11 june 1944 when it began crossing english channel corps lost only one of its landing ship tanks lsts to a mine during crossing but on it was about half of middleton s headquarters complement other than members of sunken lst who would rejoin corps ten days later entire corps was ashore on 12 june near carentan where joe collins vii corps had cleared beach on d day at this point divisions of viii corps included 82nd airborne 101st airborne 79th infantry and 90th infantry 82nd under major general matthew bunker ridgway performed admirably but soon left corps and once in brittany corps would have an entirely different complement of divisions thumb left bocage landscape in cotentin peninsula impeded allied advance after vii corps took port city of cherbourg viii corps began moving south against german forces in middle of cotentin peninsula germans had high ground and fighting was further complicated by bocage countryside a series of farmers fields and pastures forming a latticework with each unit separated by walls of earth up to six feet high supporting dense shrubbery and trees german defenders had every advantage over americans whose tanks would tip up and expose their thin bottom armor as they attempted to cross barriers by mid july field expedient devices were developed to equip tanks to penetrate hedgerows and restore battlefield mobility such specially equipped tanks were referred to as rhino tank after breaking out of bocage viii corps was able to roll fifty miles in seven days but it and remainder of bradley s first army remained bottled up on cotentin peninsula next phase of fight codenamed operation cobra was to break out of peninsula and once this occurred patton s third army would join fight operation began on 24 july 1944 when american air commanders were asked to lay a carpet of bombs on germans to soften them up for advancing ground forces poor weather curtailed operation on first day but more than a thousand bombing missions were carried out following day lieutenant general lesley mcnair chief of army ground forces came to middleton s headquarters to witness bombing middleton warned him to stay at corps headquarters but mcnair strayed away far enough that he and other members of his party were killed when they got caught by a stick of allied bombs more than 600 u s troops were killed or wounded in this friendly fire incident when bombs fell short of their intended target despite mishap bombing was effective in reducing german resistance and over next few days viii corps was able to move south along coast on 30 july they seized town of avranches gateway to brittany and southern normandy once in command of avranches viii corps then secured bridges at pontaubault and in doing so broke out of cotentin peninsula and into brittany this brought about planned command change and at noon on 1 aug 1944 omar bradley moved up to command 12th army group courtney hodges took over first army and patton s third army was activated into group along with first army with middleton s viii corps now falling under general patton following breakout middleton found himself in a doctrinally uncomfortable situation as allies were now in a position to pursue germans cautious and methodical middleton was in command of two infantry divisions and two armored divisions within his corps and impatient and audacious patton could not understand why middleton was not moving his armor quickly in pursuit kaune 20 in early august patton wrote in his diary i cannot make out why middleton was so apathetic or dumb i don t know what was matter with him despite his wealth of battlefield experience and years of military schooling middleton had only limited experience in conducting pursuit operations and was a bit overwhelmed by them kaune 20 28 ultimately he allowed his armored divisions some autonomy in their operations while using his infantry to clean up pockets of resistance en route to brest kaune 20 9 his estimates of enemy strength turned out to be much more accurate than those provided to him by patton and patton ultimately acknowledged middleton s value as a corps commander by presenting him with a distinguished service medal within seven weeks of calling him dumb in his diary battle for brest after breakout from cotentin peninsula viii corps followed brittany coast westward en route to brest port of middleton s arrival and departure from europe during world war i as corps passed st malo middleton turned his 83rd division on town resulting in capture of 14 000 germans patton had already directed corps 6th armored division under major general bob grow to move on to brest while middleton was still cleaning up in st malo which fell on 17 august grow had arrived outside of brest on 7 august and met stiff resistance once there city housing important german submarine pens and extensive machine facilities was defended by three elite german divisions and several powerful 90 millimeter guns which were capable of destroying most of armor in 6th armored division siege of brest required infantry and once 2nd infantry division under major general walter m robertson arrived armored division was released back to patton for other operations also joining viii corps for siege was 8th division commanded by major general donald a and 29th division a national guard unit from virginia commanded by major general charles h gerhardt middleton also had a cavalry group and two ranger battalions commanded by colonel earl rudder who later became president of texas a m university left thumb brest in september 1944 city was well organized for defense and in battle for brest middleton s units went about capturing it methodically defense of city was under german generalleutnant hermann ramcke with whom middleton carried on a dialog during siege ramcke sent middleton a map showing where several hundred american prisoners were being held in city but also slyly placed on map a number of red crosses where allies knew some good bombing targets were located such as ammunition depots middleton wrote back to ramcke telling him to remove some of bogus red crosses or some terms of geneva convention might have to be ignored middleton also reminded ramcke of allies superior artillery and air power battle for brest was intense and very destructive after two weeks of constant day and night attacks middleton s units forced germans into ever tighter positions on 12 september middleton sent a letter to ramcke offering him an opportunity to stop bloodshed and to surrender city in a humane and reasonable way with terms of surrender spelled out in letter ramcke s terse reply was simply i must decline your proposal unhappy with response middleton directed his soldiers to enter fray with renewed vigor take them apart and get job finished one week later on 19 september germans surrendered to middleton who with much of his staff had 99 unbroken days of combat in a formal ceremony middleton gave city back to its mayor and general patton arrived to pin a distinguished service medal oak leaf cluster on middleton for outstanding conduct during campaign in brittany resulting in capture of brest americans captured more than 36 000 germans and evacuated 2 000 wounded far exceeding estimate of 10 000 germans given to middleton by patton before operation ramcke was captured by troops of 8th division and asked deputy division commander for his credentials american general pointed to m 1 rifles being carried by his soldiers and told ramcke that those were his credentials ramcke appeared at his formal surrender clean shaven and with a well groomed irish setter with plenty of reporters and photographers documenting occasion ramcke commented in english that he felt like a film star he was soon sent to a prisoner of war camp in clinton mississippi not more than 50 miles from where middleton was born and raised after war he spent time in a prison camp in england and then was sent to france where he was tried and found guilty of war crimes against french civilians during fighting at brest ramcke continued a correspondence with middleton for 15 years following war move to ardennes thumb right dwight d eisenhower and middleton conferring in belgium 1944 with western france in hands of allies in late september middleton made a leisurely trip east across france to ardennes mountains stopping en route to visit battlefields where he had served with distinction in 1918 during great war germans were now behind a line from west of metz france through luxembourg and east of belgian cities of bastogne liege and antwerp allies had outrun their supply lines and had to slow their advance to resupply middleton s viii corps was assigned a 50 mile front half of which belonged to 2nd division and other half to 8th division front extended from losheim on german belgian border to central luxembourg on 11 october 83rd division was brought back under viii corps control and another 38 miles of front in luxembourg was added to responsibility of corps new 9th armored division was added to lineup on 20 october but put into corps reserve by middleton during october and into november these divisions ran deception maneuvers to confuse germans and also became thoroughly familiar with terrain so as to be able to absorb a heavy thrust from enemy should they be attacked however from mid november to early december three well prepared infantry divisions were all replaced by two battle weary divisions and one green division both 28th infantry division and 4th infantry division middleton s old division from world war i had taken heavy losses in forest and were at less than 75 normal strength 106th infantry division was just entering lineup with no combat experience middleton now had about 68 000 officers and men in his corps many weary and many uninitiated along an 88 mile front facing about 200 000 veteran german troops who were deftly moving into position under cover of darkness battle of bulge striking at 5 30 a m on saturday 16 december germans achieved almost total surprise in breaking through allied lines beginning what is commonly called battle of bulge germans launched their great attack of 1940 through same region with generalfeldmarschall gerd von rundstedt in command then as he was once again in this campaign his goal was to separate american forces from british and canadian forces and take important port city of antwerp by late afternoon germans had 14 divisions operating in ardennes but this number would swell to an estimated 25 divisions with 600 tanks and 1 000 aircraft 106th division located in most exposed positions along corps line and 28th division took brunt of attack middleton headquartered in bastogne was awakened by a guard and could hear guns from there throughout day 106th was able to hold its position but additional german units poured in during night much of 106th was on german side of our river in an area known as schnee eifel division s commander major general alan jones called middleton concerned about his two regiments east of river conversation was interrupted by another call and then resumed at end of conversation middleton told an aide that he had given his approval to have two regiments pull back to west side of river jones on other hand was convinced that middleton had directed these units to stay and was further convinced of this based on a written order from earlier in day but just received as a result of miscommunication pullback did not occur and two regiments were ultimately surrounded with most of men captured on 17 december while two of 28th division s regiments survived german onslaught intact 110th infantry regiment commanded by colonel hurley fuller was directly in path of massive advance on 17 december fuller counterattacked but his lone regiment was up against three german divisions and when fuller s command post was attacked his escape was thwarted and he was taken prisoner middleton next heard from him in april when he was released though 110th regiment was shattered stubborn resistance given by them and other viii corps units greatly slowed down german timetable thumb left middleton in ardennes 1944 city of bastogne belgium was a hub of several major roads and became a prime target for germans seeing its capture as necessary to their advance middleton was in continuous communication with bradley at 12th army group headquarters in luxembourg and maintained that though bastogne could soon be surrounded it should be held as germans advanced on bastogne both bradley and first army commander hodges recognized threat to middleton and had him move his headquarters he was supposed to leave bastogne on 18 december but spent another night there so that he could brief his relief force 101st airborne division not only did that division s acting commander brigadier general anthony mcauliffe show up ahead of schedule but so did colonel william roberts from 10th armored division combat command r ccr sent by patton another welcome guest arriving later that evening was major general matthew ridgway commander of xviii airborne corps en route to his headquarters but advised by middleton to stay in bastogne for night to avoid capture by germans while middleton and his guests slept elements of 101st airborne poured into bastogne all during night and into following day having conferred with mcauliffe at length previous evening middleton left bastogne after full daylight on 19 december and set up headquarters in a school building in neufchateau 17 miles to southwest for next several days bastogne was defended by 101st along with elements of ccr and some corps artillery assets that middleton was able to supply mcauliffe had units scattered in towns surrounding bastogne which bore brunt of attacks by panzer lehr division and second panzer division at one point on 19 december some of mcauliffe s units wanted to fall back and mcauliffe concurred calling middleton for his approval middleton s response was we can t hold bastogne if we keep falling back and units were ordered to stay on 20 december viii corps was moved from hodges first army back to patton s third army bastogne was being surrounded by germans and without adequate weather for airdrops supplies were running low by 22 december germans felt that their position around bastogne was strong enough to send in an emissary with a note advising americans to surrender city or they would be attacked in afternoon mcauliffe s famous reply nuts was sent back to german commander germans did renew their attack that afternoon but it was muted by freshly falling snow and a stiff american response next morning 23 december was eighth day of fighting and first day that sun had emerged from behind thick fog and clouds since beginning of battle ninth air force was able to send 240 aircraft over bastogne that day each dropping about 1200 pounds of critically needed supplies including artillery rounds that were delivered in morning and used against germans same afternoon over next three days offensives made by germans were countered with responses from americans in late afternoon on 26 december first elements of long awaited 4th armored division arrived in bastogne breaking siege of city hitler demanded that bastogne be taken but even with nine divisions in fight germans were not able to break in with siege broken and additional elements of 4th armored division coming in middleton stipulated that top priority was to get 964 wounded troops out of bastogne and into area hospitals despite small opening to city it was clear by 27 december that germans were throwing their principal effort against bastogne in response to this renewed german thrust against bastogne eisenhower released two new divisions on 28 december 87th infantry and 11th armored these units joined 101st airborne division in corps lineup just in time for a new offensive on 30 december to shrink bulge created in allied line americans began their attack at 7 30 that morning which coincidentally was exact time that germans under general der lieutenant general equivalent hasso von manteuffel scheduled an attack of their own 11th armored division had difficulty meeting its objectives for reasons not related to strength of germans but 87th division fought well in snow sleet and deepening cold on 3 january new 17th airborne division relieved 11th armored division and corps stretched along a crude 15 mile line due west of bastogne with 101st continuing to hold city for next two weeks corps moved steadily north in heavy sometimes even desperate fighting and on 16 january they met units from first army pushing south at over following twelve days combined force pushed germans back eastward across our river returning allied line to its original position before 16 december battle began eliminating bulge created in allied line on 16 december push across germany and victory thumb right lorelei near where middleton led his troops across rhine with front restored to its previous boundary bradley summoned his army and corps commanders to his headquarters he wanted hodges first army to advance to rhine while patton s third army would stay put until first army reached river patton was very reluctant to hold in place and questioned advisability to do so bradley explained that all available ammunition and reinforcements would go to first army since two armies could not be simultaneously supplied patton reluctantly accepted bradley s explanation but after that meeting he called together his three corps commanders manton eddy of xii corps walton h walker of xx corps and middleton he asked eddy if he could ease forward and capture trier walker if he could do same with bitburg and middleton if he could take gerolstein all three commanders agreed to this and within a few days all three had reached their objectives middleton was then asked by patton to take his corps all way to koblenz on rhine river which he did and viii corps reached river before any units of first army arrived once viii corps was at koblenz patton took most of its divisions away for an operation with xii corps further up river at mainz leaving middleton with some corps units mostly artillery and a single division 87th infantry middleton asked patton if he could take koblenz with 87th eliciting a laugh from army commander middleton pressed him to let him try and with commander s approval he was able to take city which only had about 500 defenders most of other german troops were on other side of rhine not wanting to get trapped between rhine and moselle rivers thumb left generals patton bradley and middleton at a nazi concentration camp 1945 once koblenz was captured in mid march 1945 viii corps was assigned a 25 mile front from koblenz upstream southeast to beyond boppard and famous landmark lorelei patton then gave middleton 89th division and 76th division for river crossing middleton chose to cross river near lorelei where river was narrow swift and flanked by steep terrain eliciting another laugh from patton middleton knew there would be little german resistance there and he was able to get entire 89th across in one night using inflatable rafts and then put a pontoon bridge in place by early morning 87th initially attempted to cross at koblenz but met too much resistance there compelling them to move further upstream closer to boppard where their crossing went smoothly within two days middleton had all three of his divisions across rhine in late march viii corps advanced eastward through eisenach and then across fulda river here some of middleton s infantrymen came across concentration camp at ohrdruf discovering sickening evidence of what had transpired there middleton called patton to come take a look and patton was joined by bradley and eisenhower in his diary patton described place as one of most appalling sights that i have ever seen this was first nazi concentration camp to be discovered by united states army and eisenhower cabled marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there middleton later had officials from town come in to witness what was going on in their midst while every one of them denied knowing what was happening mayor and his wife both committed suicide that night viii corps continued its eastward advance well into month of april and was ordered to stop between chemnitz and czechoslovakian border where corps would make contact with russians immediate problem was dealing with prisoners of war americans were almost overwhelmed by number of germans wanting to surrender to them and despite orders to take no more prisoners thousands of germans filtered through viii corps lines at night desperately trying to avoid capture by russians during last week of april a russian cavalry unit made contact with middleton while leaders of both americans and russians exchanged luncheon invitations russians were extremely reluctant to allow any americans across russian line and their american lunch guests were taken by a very circuitous route into russian held territory on 25 april 1945 patton wrote a recommendation citing middleton s outstanding tactical skill and determination his magnificent resistance against von s attack and his tireless energy and unfaltering aggressiveness with war in europe almost over disposition of various units was being decided by higher command some would remain as occupation forces in europe some would return to united states and some would be sent to pacific theater to fight against japanese germans formally surrendered in american sector on 7 may 1945 and two days later patton issued his general order number 98 thanking soldiers of third army past and present for their accomplishments on 13 may middleton wrote a letter to bradley requesting to be released from active duty once his combat services were no longer needed he asked to return to lsu by 1 august 1945 but also paid compliments to bradley and others by writing that men such as you ike joe collins courtney hodges and others have accomplished so much in this war are available to guide future of our army we cannot but feel future is in safe hands middleton was only commander that viii corps had ever had in combat he had been away from home for over 1 200 days since departing in january 1942 and had logged 480 days in combat more time than any

return to louisiana state university in late august 1945 middleton returned to louisiana state university lsu and reported to president hatcher requesting his old job as comptroller while still in europe in may he was very busy getting troops returned to states now at lsu he was at other end of pipeline getting things ready for thousands of soldiers who would be going back to school enrollments had swollen in 1945 but in 1946 bulge in new students became an avalanche one of middleton s priorities was to get housing for all of these new students many of whom were married with keen insights into military procurement he was able to find a variety of types of excess housing units that military no longer needed and was able to provide both students and faculty with adequate housing at a very small cost he was a stone cold racist who did not believe that blacks and whites should play on same athletic teams and wrote a letter dated october 27 1961 to this effect to chancellor at university of texas military advisory roles thumb right army chief of staff j lawton collins requested middleton s services to look into honor code violations at west point though retired from military middleton was soon called to serve in a variety of advisory capacities in april 1946 he was appointed to doolittle board set up to investigate officer enlisted men relationships and headed by former air corps general james h doolittle board made a number of recommendations one of more significant ones being to allow non commissioned officers to establish their own clubs a recommendation supported by bill mauldin three years later middleton was asked to serve on military education panel of service academy board to look at curricula of military and naval academies and proposed air force academy as well working for nine months on recommendations middleton stressed a more liberal education for academies and much of what he recommended was accepted middleton was also asked to speak to military groups on occasion such as for commissioning exercises at fort benning in 1951 as late as 1958 he was called on by united states military academy to come and review curriculum offered to cadets and then was called again in 1959 to do related work in spring of 1951 middleton got a call from general j lawton collins who was now army chief of staff asking for middleton to take an assignment on behalf of army price 323 middleton was compelled to say yes there were allegations of wholesale honor code violations at u s military academy in west point and middleton was to serve on a committee to oversee proceedings and make recommendations price 324 though personally painful to middleton committee s recommendation was to dismiss 82 cadets for cheating including most of members of football team a headline in a new orleans newspaper wryly summarized event as army football team severely penalized for illegal passing while this was a drastic undertaking committee also recommended that same tests not be given to different groups on different days which practice offered cadets a big temptation to cheat though this was not a pleasant assignment for middleton he had been selected for task because of his reputation for fairness price 325 though he had never attended west point in 1952 he was asked to serve academy on its board of visitors a position which he held for one three year term price 322 university presidency dr hatcher president of lsu resigned his position in february 1947 because of ill health search went out for a new president and when middleton was asked to be considered for job he declined being very content with his job as comptroller following search harold w stoke was brought in from university of new hampshire middleton thought stoke had many good qualities but he could not work well with board of supervisors stoke was sometimes doctrinaire and his formality when working with board members was found to be annoying by some while he was respected by most of faculty stoke continued to have run ins with board members and in december 1950 his differences with board resulted in his tendering his resignation stoke asked board to hold a special meeting on 28 december to act on his resignation following meeting three members of board came to middleton s office and told him board has elected you president of university and we are here to notify you it is board s desire that you accept middleton was pressed to make a quick decision and feeling confident that he could fulfill job with no misgivings he accepted position there was some backlash from resignation of stoke as students and members of community criticized board nevertheless resignation became effective on 1 february 1951 on which day middleton began his role as university president years that middleton was president of lsu were marked by tremendous growth resulting in many battles over funding priorities four major projects being considered were a new library enclosure of football stadium a new auditorium and an addition to medical school in new orleans middleton s priorities put library at head of list and stadium last board of supervisors on other hand gave priority to stadium and in february 1953 voted to accept a bid for project price 332 after stadium expansion had been approved board of supervisors agreed to give priority to a new library in september 1953 within a year state legislature had given lsu all of funds it asked for about 20 more than previous request to be used mostly for higher staff salaries but also including 3 6 million dollars for new library to be built across from hill memorial library in central part of campus price 333 5 in 1954 projections indicated that student enrollment would nearly double in next 15 years and in response university entered into its most ambitious building program to date price 337 as university president middleton was constantly involved in personnel decisions some of them making national news one such ordeal occurred in february 1955 when board of supervisors decided that it was time for head football coach tinsley to be relieved following a break even record in seven years his successor paul dietzel was a 29 year old assistant coach at united states military academy dietzel had a rough beginning at lsu with three losing seasons and calls for his removal became louder middleton supported dietzel however and in his fourth season as coach lsu tigers not only had an undefeated season but also won sugar bowl and were declared national champions price 338 41 a serious issue facing most southern schools in 1956 was that of desegregation while middleton like most white louisianans was in favor of segregation as university president his responsibility was to uphold laws of state and nation in a letter to university of texas chancellor harry ransom middleton detailed his efforts to keep black and white students separate and to prevent black students from participating in athletics in spite of accepting black students into university he wrote our negro students have made no attempt to attend social functions participate in athletic contests go in swimming pool etc if they did we would for example discontinue operation of swimming pool in april he wrote a sobering report to board of supervisors entitled lsu and segregation price 344 here he outlined history of enrollment of blacks at lsu which showed how resistant university had been to such an undertaking while there were avid who declared federal desegregation laws would not be fulfilled more practical minds could see futility and extreme expense of having to create duplicate facilities in every area of advanced education and process of integration which had already begun at a slow pace now became accelerated price 348 when middleton reached university s mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1959 alumni council adopted a resolution to have board of supervisors waive age requirement and allow middleton to stay on as president this was done and again at end of 1959 1960 school year he was once again declared to be essential to university and once again reluctantly agreed to stay for one but only one additional year price 354 363 though it became a long year on 1 february 1962 middleton officially retired and three weeks earlier 11th of january was declared as

response to his mail thumb left grave marker for middleton and his wife baton rouge national cemetery two years after his retirement in may 1964 governor john j came to his office hoping that middleton would accept a job on a commission that he was forming governor was wanting to ease state s growing racial tensions by creating a biracial commission composed of 21 blacks and 21 whites governor needed a chairman who would command a tremendous amount of respect and his choice was middleton middleton said he would do it for a year beginning in 1965 but as had often happened in past year stretched into five and it wasn t until 1970 when commission had reached its goals and was disbanded that middleton was freed from this duty price 374 middleton s black counterpart on commission was dr albert dent president of dillard university in new orleans price 377 and directors chosen to head staff of this commission on human relations rights and responsibilities were white attorney john and black attorney jesse n stone some of potential trouble spots where commission was able to have a positive effect included towns of and and commission helped to open ranks of louisiana state police to qualified blacks price 378 9 commission was disbanded in may 1970 after having effectively served its purpose and members each received a letter of thanks from governor price 383 in january 1969 coordinating council for higher education was authorized and middleton agreed to serve once again but this time refused pressure from governor to become chairman price 386 after two years middleton felt that council had more than justified itself by merging redundant facilities and disapproving projects that were wasteful of taxpayer s money price 386 7 middleton served in this role until 1973 when he was 83 years old and also served in a number of other capacities but continued to hunt and fish when he could while also enjoying his growing family price 392 middleton died in baton rouge on 9 october 1976 three days before his 87th birthday his wife jerusha died on 16 march 1980 aged 89 and both were interred in baton rouge national cemetery sharing a tall granite marker
