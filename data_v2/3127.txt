piano which guitarist edge said is not an instrument he is noted for playing mccormick 2006 p 228 torch songs of jacques brel influenced bono s songwriting his initial plan was to send it to nina simone one of his favourite singers although after playing song together band decided to keep it for themselves luerssen 2010 p 262 they did not include song on rattle and hum because they believed it was not u2 enough during recording sessions for achtung baby edge separated from his wife aislinn o sullivan reflecting on impact it had on u2 bono said we re a really tight community this is not like somebody s you know girlfriend s left we ve grown up with these people this our family our community this was really hard for us it was like first cracks on beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community starting to go crack edge explained that travelling to berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage i was disappearing into music for a different reason it was a refuge in a way that approach didn t completely work you know i wasn t really in a good positive headspace i was running away i suppose while recording guitar solo that concludes song edge put everything into it all feeling all hurt all angst everything went into that solo bono said his whole life came out of him when he played when we went for take one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder another string broke and he has such a light touch ordinarily he s so gentle all that left him for a kind of rage and yet there s not one bum note in there mccormick 2006 p 232 audio engineer flood said bold unadulterated naked guitar solo sound was a combination of part moment a good guitar a small amp a simple mic edge just got an idea tried it and it worked straightaway composition and theme thumb right upright alt edge pictured in 2011 separated from his wife during recording of achtung baby he channeled his painful emotions from that time into his guitar playing on song love is blindness runs for 4 23 4 minutes 23 seconds according to hal leonard corporation s sheet music published at musicnotes com it is played in a 6 4 time signature at a tempo of 48 beats per minute in a key of b flat minor production team gave bassist adam clayton s bass a low end bass throbbing effect which edge described as a real stroke of genius from production team drummer larry mullen jr s drum pattern was taken from u2 s 1987 single i still haven t found what i m looking for and slowed down lyrics mix up personal and political bono noted that there was some reference to little death which can be taken to mean a faint during orgasm but also works as an image of terrorism quoting lyric a little death without mourning no call and no warning baby a dangerous idea that almost makes sense he said there s nothing more deadly than an idea or a person that s almost right you know it took 20th century a hundred years to get over communism there s another dangerous idea that almost made sense u2 biographer bill flanagan credits bono s habit of keeping his lyrics in flux until last minute with providing a narrative coherence to album flanagan 1996 p 20 flanagan interpreted achtung baby as using moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing singer away from his virtuous love sun he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home flanagan 1996 p 187 for flanagan final three songs on achtung baby ultraviolet light my way acrobat and love is blindness are about how couple deal with suffering they have forced on each other uncut contributor gavin martin believed song contained images of love debased or abandoned he wrote with its stark organ intro pulsating bass synth and guitar reverb stretched into a hallucinatory squall it brilliantly describes discord and dread that provide a constant undertow to achtung baby and yet through its alluring sonic palette and wounded but sensual vocal love is blindness also maps out a search for harmony and salvation author atara stein wrote that song suggests that love can operate only through a willful self deception a voluntary surrender to what one knows is an illusion singer begs his lover to wrap night around him because as he proclaims i don t want to see singer knows that image he creates of his loved one is false but it is only image that can satisfy him he must perceive his beloved in idealized terms so she can reflect back to him image of himself that he desires to see richey 1999 p 271 journalist bill graham believed song was a bleak account of a failing romance graham 2004 p 45 hot press editor niall stokes wrote that song takes us back again to shadowy world of deceit infidelity and betrayal it depicts love at end very end of its tether it is as bleak and as despairing a view of world as you re likely to get reflecting emotional climate in which entire album had been made he noted in terms of its mood love is blindness had dark sensual and decadent feel of pre war berlin adding that lyric love is blindness i don t want to see was a desolate acknowledgement of terrible reality that it is sometimes better not to know reception love is blindness was favourably received by critics uncut contributor gavin martin rated song five stars calling it rapturous and unsettling hot press editor niall stokes said its sentiments made it perfect conclusion to achtung baby describing edge s playing as a mournful guitar solo stabbing out thick emotional blues notes that linger and then fall away like tears third way reviewer roland howard described it as haunting and melodic believing it to be about loss of virginity music journalist bill wyman said edge s guitar playing on song sounded like a dentist s drill jon pareles of new york times described it as a kind of summation calling it an elegy that compares love to drowning in a deep well and wishes for it anyway geoffrey himes of washington post wrote that it has a gospel quality as swooning synth parts are set against block piano chords and bono acknowledges that mismatched lovers will suffer their inevitable fate greg potter of vancouver sun believed it to be a dour closer that was riddled with images of self doubt and uncertainty a critic for waterloo region record said it was hardly great u2 but u2 closers have always been anti climactic writing for boston herald romandetta called it a broken hearted lament that was gentle and subdued george varga of san diego union tribune said it was one of most interesting tracks on albums calling it a spare david bowie like ode to tormented love michael ross of sunday times and james healy of san diego union tribune lamented that u2 did not include it on compilation album best of 1990 2000 edge called it a great end to album and probably one of bono s finest lyrics bono said bass sounds like liquid at centre of earth a kind of molten lava bass sound describing edge s guitar playing he said it s incredible live performances love is blindness debuted on 29 february 1992 in lakeland florida on opening night of zoo tv tour where it closed concert de la parra 2003 pp 140 141 it remained in this position throughout first and second leg of tour with only two concerts concluding with an alternate song with or

buenos aires argentina on 1 march 2006 when u2 performed song spontaneously to conclude concert u2 concert historian pimm jal de la parra called live rendition sultry as screens show a constellation map giving crowd a feeling of floating across universe by way it moves transmitting a mood of distance and loneliness that corresponds with nature of song mark lepage of gazette described dance at conclusion as an appropriate moment of human contact after almost two hours of uproar julie romandetta of boston herald believed it to be an anticlimatic finish to concert calling song low key and saying u2 soared for more than 90 minutes but left with a whimper instead of a bang gary graff of houston chronicle believed it to be a moody show closer writing for arizona daily star gene armstrong
