time battle system story follows protagonist fei fong wong and several others as they journey across world to overthrow all powerful rule of solaris and uncover mysteries concerning their world story incorporates themes of jungian psychology freudian thought and religious symbolism created by tetsuya takahashi and his wife kaori tanaka as a proposal for final fantasy vii it was allowed to be developed as its own project first as a sequel to chrono trigger and then as a wholly original game with a science fiction premise it was developed under working title project noah characters and mecha were designed by kunihiko tanaka whose designs were portrayed during in game cinematics through use of anime cutscenes due to time constraints and team s general inexperience second half of game s plot was primarily told through cutscenes game was nearly left unlocalized due to its religious content its localization was handled entirely by square electronic arts staff and translator richard honeywood who described it as one of most troublesome games of his career game received critical acclaim with praise particularly going towards storyline gameplay characters and psychological and religious themes but received criticism for rushed pace of second disc due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration by 2003 game had shipped over a million copies worldwide it has since gained a cult following while a direct sequel was never developed takahashi would later found monolith soft and develop xenosaga trilogy as a spiritual successor gameplay xenogears combines traditional role playing video game structures such as square s signature active time battle system with new features particular to game s martial arts combat style it features two slightly different battle systems in first user controls human characters in turn based combat manipulated through sequencing of learned combos second making use of gears introduces different sets of statistics and abilities for each character xenogears features both traditional anime and pre rendered cgi movie clips by production i g to illustrate important plot points player advances protagonist and his companions through a three dimensional fictional world with visitable cities geographical sites and other important locations spread out across several continents some locations exist not on original world map but in sky at first party only travels on foot but can eventually use a variety of vehicles including their gears and sand submarine yggdrasil battle system thumb left typical battles use active time battle system once a character s atb gauge fills player can input a battle command for that character battle in xenogears is a variant of active time battle system found in games such as chrono trigger and final fantasy series most enemy encounters in xenogears are random when a battle begins there is a transition to a separate screen with a combat interface player characters use a combination of martial arts moves ether magical attacks and special deathblow combinations which are learned through repetition of specific proportions of strong moderate and weak hits all offensive actions use action points ap costing either three points two points or one point corresponding to intensity of attack each character can initially use only three ap per turn but at higher levels they can eventually use up to seven ap per turn at a certain point in game characters can use elemental deathblows which attach elemental attributes to physical combos in addition to being used for attacks ap may be saved and allocated to attack points for combo attacks during later turns a total of 28 ap may be accumulated for combo attacks characters can also use a variety of magical abilities for both offense and ally support these abilities are limited by number of available ether points ep which must be replenished using items during exploration non combat sequences for most characters these abilities are attributed to ether a mysterious power to which presumably all humans have access some characters magical abilities are referred to by different names implying differences in their origins for example fei s magic is called chi and citan s is called arcane while fighting in gears human ether abilities are amplified though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat gear battle in addition to hand to hand combat characters sometimes fight from within giant robots called gears in gear combat limiting factor of ap is replaced by fuel with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power for these battles deathblows may only be executed after first building up attack level represented by a number in bottom left of gear combat interface through execution of strong moderate or weak attacks one deathblow is allowed per point on attack level gauge there are three levels for normal gear deathblows and beyond third level an infinite level with its own set of deathblows to reach infinity mode a character must stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action with each turn there is a chance that infinity mode will be reached having a duration of three turns infinity mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and while in this mode gears have access to infinity attacks gears can regain fuel with a charge command gears can also activate boosters which enable them to act faster at a cost of extra fuel per turn special option command allows for gear hp restoration abilities and special fuel consuming attacks when a gear has no fuel left it can no longer execute attacks use special options or use boosters they can however charge to regain fuel and use ether abilities gear fuel parts and upgrades may be purchased in shops or from certain individual vendors plot setting xenogears initially takes place on ignas largest continent of xenogears world and site of a centuries long war between nations of aveh and kislev a church like organization known as ethos has excavated gears giant robot suits for preservation of world s culture although kislev originally had upper hand in war a mysterious

learns that citan has been working for emperor cain though he s actually a double agent on their side and that solaris has been producing food and medicine out of recycled humans in soylent system facility citan soylent system organism experiment lab and its disposal facility in solaris and production facility for food and medicine to maintain limiter seal party also learns that gazel ministry seeks to revive god and achieve eternal life while krelian seeks to possess elly back at shevat citan informs his friends that id is actually fei s split personality with fei s gear turning red when he switches to id due to their connection citan yes if it were only id and fei but that does not seem to be case id only manifests when fei s mental energy is in a weakened state it is a mystery in itself that lower level personality of fei has any control over upper level personality of id it is obvious that there exists a third personality id calls this existence coward in my observation this coward may be fundamental personality of fei gazel ministry uses key an artifact that manipulates dna of massive amounts of humans around world turning them into mutants called wels to collect flesh to reconstruct their god an all powerful gear called deus that crash landed on planet ten thousand years ago elly as miang yes but there is more core that was detached from zohar biological crashed onto this primitive planet it activated persona its plant that can generate organic material during this time elly and fei become romantically involved with each i also learned that i really do need you it s not because i need you as a sanctuary for my problems i need you because i truly love you and learn that they are reincarnations of sophia and lacan lacan was a painter while sophia was holy mother of nisan around time of war between shevat and solaris five hundred years earlier lacan blamed himself for sophia s death during war and with help of miang became grahf and sought to destroy world although defeated he and miang have their minds into other humans since krelian and miang dispose of emperor and gazel ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap elly mother who must be sacrificed in order to revive deus miang is killed by an enraged ramsus as he realizes he has been used and elly turns into miang becoming absorbed by deus fei as id attempts to make contact with zohar wiseman who reveals himself to be fei s father stops him giving peace to fei s other personalities fei s gear transforms into xenogears and grahf appears revealing that he had been inside fei s father s body grahf i hear you fei you see he and i are one i am khan khan is me he has become one with me so you too should open your heart and unite with me then we can go onto eliminate everything at this time fei makes contact with wave existence an extra dimensional being who is trapped inside deus and is source of power for all gears and learns that he must destroy deus to free humanity grahf tries to merge with fei and is defeated fei discovers that he is a descendant of abel a young boy who was a passenger on board eldridge a spaceship that was being used to transport deus core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled deus however had become self aware and took over eldridge amidst confusion abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with wave existence through zohar deus power source it gave him power to one day destroy deus and zohar in order to free itself wave existence also sensed abel s longing for his mother and used biological computer to create a woman for a companion wave existence as a contact being but only a child you defined my existence with your desire to return to your mother thus i came to prepare mother s will that will is when deus gained full control over eldridge captain decided to initiate self destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it both deus and zohar survived explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with abel under protection of wave existence he was sole survivor but was soon united with woman that wave existence had created for him as a companion elly abel and elly at first led a happy life but deus had also created miang cain and gazel ministry to begin a human civilization on planet one which would be under their control to one day be turned into wels and be absorbed into deus to recover its strength when now adult abel and elly discovered this they openly challenged cain and gazel ministry but lost however through power of wave existence they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat deus one of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in zeboim where abel s incarnation went by name kim and created emeralda ramsus revealed to be a biologically engineered clone of emperor cain created by solaris scientists as a means of controlling deus who was rejected in favor of fei hence his hatred of latter attacks one more time and is finally defeated he is later rescued during an attack and convinced to let go of his anger and aid group fei sets out to destroy deus and free wave existence and elly in party defeats deus but they realize that energy released from wave existence s shift will destroy planet citan it is like a shock wave that is induced by dimensional displacement but so much energy if this much energy is unleashed here now elly inside deus tries to move it away from planet and fei in his xenogears follows to save her but both disappear in rift krelian confronts them telling fei he only sought to end pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began when all was one to ascend to realm of god fei rejects krelian s ideology with his love for elly but krelian challenges fei telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of god and calls forth urobolus a gigantic serpentine incarnation of miang xenogears appears and fei uses it to defeat urobolus krelian releases elly and reveals to fei that he had planned to become one with god along with elly during her time with krelian elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all atrocities he had committed despite everything elly says that krelian truly loved people more than anyone else elly yes i came to understand after becoming one with krelian his heart was so full of sadness that is why he desired for he and i to become one with god because that would be return to beginning of everything he told me you should be with him that is what he said you see he already knew yes he already knew how i felt how you felt but there was nothing we or he could do he had no choice but to go forward even if it meant he lost all feelings lost everything that was human for all humankind s sake there was no going back even looking back held too many memories and he would have just wanted to go back even though he couldn t so please forgive him krelian loved people more than anyone else because no one will forgive his sins he declines fei s offer to return and ascends to a higher plane of existence along with wave existence telling fei and elly that he them fei and elly then return to their planet along with xenogears and reunite with rest of party krelian since that time i have stopped being human i have committed so many sins that any attempt at living as a human is impossible only one who could have forgiven me is god development xenogears was produced by hiromichi tanaka who previously worked on snes game secret of mana scenario of game was written by director tetsuya takahashi and by kaori tanaka yasuyuki honne served as art director while kunihiko tanaka was responsible for character designs tetsuo mizuno tomoyuki and final fantasy creator hironobu sakaguchi were executive producers for xenogears koichi mashimo an animation director and his studio bee train was in charge of anime cut scenes xenogears started out as an early concept conceived by tetsuya takahashi and kaori tanaka for square game final fantasy vii their superior in company deemed it too dark and complicated for a fantasy but takahashi was allowed to develop it as a separate project project began under working title project noah main impetus for takahashi was that he was growing frustrated with final fantasy series initial concept was to make xenogears a sequel to chrono trigger but after multiple clashes with company over this and unspecified practical difficulties it was decided to make it a completely original title due to this initial development idea there were concepts unsuited for a fantasy world so a compromise was made by incorporating both fantasy and science fiction into game s world development took approximately two years and included a staff of thirty developers preliminary planning and creation of backstory extended to several years before that word xeno had been decided between staff from an early stage with its meaning being something strange or alien gears was chosen from multiple suggested words game s gears were not present during early stages with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters game s use of anime cutscenes was chosen as it was difficult to properly recreate tanaka s gear artwork into 3d cgi game s engine was also designed to be best suited for 3d map displays and battle arenas takahashi had wanted to create game in full 3d but playstation s capacities meant this could not be managed resulting in current mesh of 2d sprites against 3d backgrounds themes and story were greatly influenced by works and philosophies of friedrich nietzsche sigmund freud and carl jung according to tanaka reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband according to her story revolved around where do we come from what are we where are we going there was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into final game game s second disc consisted mainly of narration by fei and elly of events following party s escape from solaris while it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints takahashi later revealed full reason as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create entire proposed game in expected two year development time so instead of ending prematurely with end of first disc takahashi offered up a compromise which became second disc s content allowing staff to finish game within time and budget deadlines square had announced that xenogears may not have come out in united states due to sensitive religious issues english translation of xenogears was first instance in which an english localization team worked directly with square developers it also was first major project of square translator richard honeywood according to honeywood translating game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies he came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge in a later interview honeywood stated that biggest issue was with multiple religious references and concept at end of killing god which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to original premise while stepping around some content that might offend honeywood unintentionally had a hand in japanese naming of deus staff were originally going to call it yahweh and during his argument against it he said yabeh o a japanese phrase meaning something dangerous seeing it as a good pun staff used yabeh as name square enix released xenogears on japanese playstation

shipped in japan and 280 000 abroad as a result of these sales it was re released as a greatest hits title in december 2003 in japanese gaming magazine famitsu xenogears was voted 16th best video game of all time by its readers in a poll held in 2006 on a similar poll at gamefaqs users of website voted xenogears 32nd best game ever in 2005 it was placed in same position in ign s top 100 games readers choice feature in 2006 and as number 28 in 2008 critical response xenogears was met with critical acclaim electronic gaming monthly praised story characters gameplay graphics and soundtrack ign described it as hands down best rpg of year praising storyline gameplay graphics presentation and soundtrack gamespot described it as one of squaresoft s best role playing games praising story gameplay and audio but criticized lack of graphical polish allgame pointed out in a positive light that character battles are unlike most role playing games from this company retrospectively edge commented that although it is considered by some to be a multimillion yen convoluted science fiction vanity project xenogears nevertheless remains one of most keenly eulogized playstation rpgs magazine also noted that it was takahashi s most challenging and pure work and that xenosaga series never quite matched up to xenogears game s story and characters were well received electronic gaming monthly said it is rich in story and character development game informer and next generation agreed that plot was one of game s highlights former drawing comparisons to star wars star blazers old testament and many other square games making it a game every rpg fanatic must play ign said storyline is intricate engrossing deep complex and once in a while even confusing until more of real underlying plotline is uncovered gamespot said story is excellent and thought provoking but said it can be a little preachy at times but went on to say that religious and existential themes enhance story and our understanding of game s deep characterizations game revolution described storyline as epic and fabulous with many twists and turns and a large cast of characters rpgfan said story is unique and probably most complex and interesting of any rpg giving it a 99 rating for story retrospectively edge praised plot s scope and ambition and protagonist as most complicated freudian hero in video games but said it has a flawed script and muddied translation as well as too many cut scenes especially on second disc where use of world map is restricted for an extended period and amount of cut scenes increases years after game s release jeremy parish of electronic gaming monthly called game s plot one of wackiest game plotlines ever but said that it actually makes sense if player ignores all of ign however stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot immersion is a key factor in xenogears and questions you may have about storyline are all answered at some point in game following psn release rpgfan s james quentin clark said xenogears has hands down best single story i have seen in any video game giving it a 100 rating for story reviewers largely praised xenogears gameplay next generation praised square s active time battle gauge and said that inclusion of ap meter and combo attacks is not only refreshing in a turn based rpg but gives players a higher level of interaction during battle ign claimed that most impressive feature in combat is ability to use massive gears or mechs noting that square s attention to programming these battles is made evident by how visually satisfying they are ign praised game s exploration saying that ability to jump and climb adds even more depth to exploration of different environments and distances xenogears from being too straightforward of a traditional rpg only complaint being that rotating camera is sometimes clumsy soundtrack was well received electronic gaming monthly said game sounds as beautiful as it looks gamespot said it expertly uses audio to push story along and noted that many of games tracks include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with game s mood but said there were many areas with silence or ambience making game s soundtrack a tad sparse xenogears was first square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes electronic gaming monthly said they are some of slickest animation cinemas they have seen game revolution praised absolutely spectacular and stunning hand drawn anime cut scenes but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with voice acting legacy shortly after xenogears was released there was speculation of a sequel being released although this never occurred in 1999 tanaka said that a project related to xenogears was being developed he also revealed that a sequel to xenogears was initially planned but never came to be while xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel there was wide speculation that namco and monolith soft s xenosaga was a prequel when it was first announced tetsuya takahashi was director and writer for both xenogears and xenosaga and has noted that with our relation between square i think it is difficult for us to say it is a direct sequel or prequel approximately twenty members of xenosaga development staff had previously worked on xenogears on connection between xenogears and xenosaga takahashi has stated it s probably more suitable to say that it follows direction and style of xenogears now that we are under a different company we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in xenosaga others are more like self parodies so we don t really want xenogears fans to like movies sometimes you have director of movie or friend of leading actor appearing as cameos so it s similar to that several members of xenogears staff came together in 2008 to work on sands of destruction a role playing game published by sega for nintendo ds these staff members include masato kato kunihiko tanaka and yasunori mitsuda in 2017 gears from game along with avatars of fei and bart were included as pre order cosmetic bonuses in square enix s mecha shooting game figureheads notes references external links official website category 1998 video games category
