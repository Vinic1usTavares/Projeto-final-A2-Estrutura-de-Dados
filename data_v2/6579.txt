thumb right map santa ana river santa ana river is largest river entirely within southern california in united states it rises in san bernardino mountains and flows for most of its length through san bernardino and riverside counties before cutting through northern santa ana mountains via santa ana canyon and flowing southwest through urban orange county to drain into pacific ocean santa ana river is long u s geological survey national hydrography dataset high resolution flowline data national map accessed march 16 2011 and its drainage basin is in size santa ana drainage basin has a diversity of terrain ranging from high peaks of inland mountains in north and east to hot dry interior and semi desert basins of inland empire to flat coastal plain of orange county although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest majority of watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments due to low regional rainfall river carries only a small flow except during brief winter season when it is prone to massive flash floods san jacinto river which drains southern half of watershed rarely reaches santa ana except in extremely wet years however a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on riparian zones and remnant wetlands along santa ana river humans have lived on santa ana river for at least 9 000 years in period immediately before and during european colonization there were four distinct indigenous groups in area river was first seen by europeans in 1769 when it received its name from members of spanish portola expedition because it was one of only reliable sources of water in a wide region many large ranchos developed along river and one of its major tributaries santiago creek after area became part of united states economy transitioned to agriculture before urbanizing in 20th century many cities established during this time including santa ana riverside and anaheim derived their names from river in order to protect urban areas from river s flood threat major channelization and damming projects were undertaken in 20th century resulting in loss of much of natural river channel course thumb right alt a dry wash threads through a

south fork santa ana river 101 hikes in southern california p 110 river flows west through a wide deep and heavily forested mountain valley about from its headwaters it receives its first major tributary bear creek which enters from north bear creek receives its water from big bear lake a popular recreational mountain lake from crest to coast p 10 river turns south passing through seven oaks dam and reaches arid inland empire lowland covering large parts of san bernardino county and riverside county it receives mill creek from south and passes to south of san bernardino then receives city creek from north and san timoteo creek from south due to water diversions for groundwater recharge river bed is usually dry in this stretch between mill creek and outlet of veolia water treatment plant north of riverside which restores a year round flow from there to prado dam river supports a riparian zone with considerable greenery not far below confluence with san timoteo creek lytle creek enters from north lytle creek is one of largest tributaries of santa ana river rising from three forks in san gabriel mountains and flowing southeast before emptying into santa ana river as lytle creek wash from there river turns southwest and after passing through western riverside it discharges into normally dry flood control reservoir formed by prado dam two major tributaries of river join in reservoir area chino creek from north and temescal creek from south temescal creek drains largest area of all tributaries because it provides outflow from lake elsinore into which san jacinto river flows it is also one of longest at in length except during wettest years when lake elsinore fills high enough to overflow temescal creek contributes little to no water into santa ana river from crest to coast p 11 below prado dam santa ana river crosses into orange county and cuts between santa ana mountains and chino hills via narrow santa ana canyon river roughly bisects county as it flows southwest towards ocean in anaheim entire flow of river except during wet seasons is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of north orange county aquifer providing about half of county s municipal water supply downstream of there river is mostly confined to a concrete channel serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage and is usually dry or a small trickle at orange it receives santiago creek from east before entering santa ana after crossing under interstate 5 it passes through river view golf course one of its few non concreted sections within orange county and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of santa ana and fountain valley to a point below 405 freeway where river bed becomes natural though banks remain concrete mouth of river is located in a small tidal lagoon between huntington beach and newport beach at northern end of santa ana river county beach from crest to coast p 12 watershed santa ana river drains largest watershed of california s south coast region covering in parts of san bernardino riverside orange and los angeles counties although river does not pass through los angeles county some of its tributaries including san antonio creek extend into it watershed consists mainly of high mountain ranges that surround and divide large dry alluvial valleys san gabriel san bernardino and san jacinto mountains encircle arid inland empire lowland on north and east santa ana mountains and chino hills divide inland empire from orange county coastal plain santa ana canyon is only natural break in range between two lowlands southern part of watershed drained by san jacinto river into lake elsinore and via temescal creek into santa ana river constitutes some 45 of total area and extend its boundaries as far south as colorado desert at anza borrego desert state park river has over 50 named tributaries most of which are intermittent streams as of 2000 about 4 8 million people lived in santa ana river watershed most of population is concentrated close to river in urban centers such as san bernardino riverside anaheim and santa ana inland empire still has large areas dedicated to agriculture and ranching although it is rapidly urbanizing in orange county nearly all valley lands are urbanized some major bodies of water in watershed include irvine lake lake mathews lake perris diamond valley lake lake skinner and big bear lake all of these are water supply reservoirs constructed by county or state water agencies and with exception of big bear much of water is imported from other parts of california due to arid local climate diamond valley lake with a storage capacity of is largest and most recently constructed lake elsinore is only major natural lake in watershed thumb

further south in san diego county watershed is bordered by those of san mateo creek santa margarita river and san luis rey river on east watershed shares borders with those of whitewater river and coachella valley flowing into salton sea and on north with mojave river which flows into endorheic basin of mojave desert in orange county river flows across a vast gently sloping alluvial fan created from its own sediments and thus its drainage basin is extremely narrow because surrounding land slopes away from river bed in its natural state river would frequently change course into one of many intermittent channels that fan out across plain today these auxiliary river beds have been converted into flood control channels including talbert and huntington beach channels which empty into pacific very near mouth of santa ana river combined talbert huntington beach watershed drains of mostly suburbanized land river originally had many different outlets to pacific one of which even extended as far north as san gabriel river original mouth of river was located at newport bay which drained into pacific ocean at what is today entrance to newport harbor based on a u s coastal survey from 1878 newport bay was predominantly a river estuary with few open channels river flowed into bay bringing with it heavy silt and making boating difficult to eventually create newport harbor sand deposited by santa ana river had to be constantly dredged away in 1920 bitter point dam was built to divert river away from bay and on its current course to ocean at huntington beach stone jetties were built to form new river mouth all of islands in newport harbor are product of dredging and man made forming from sands and silt deposited over time by santa ana river geology thumb right 200px alt three mountain ridges cross foreground with a large lake visible beyond third ridge and rolling hills beyond lake transverse ranges were formed by uplift along san andreas fault santa ana canyon is between first and second ridges and big bear lake is in background ancient igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rock underlie and form geologic base of santa ana river watershed most of strata in flat valleys and basins of watershed are underlain by thousands of feet of sediment deposited by shallow seas that covered parts of southern california in ancient times from crest to coast p 17 most of mountains in and around basin consist of granite batholiths about 75 million years old however above elevations of ancient metamorphic rock up to 1 7 billion years old is exposed from crest to coast p 16 this rock originally formed at bottom of ancestral pacific ocean and was uplifted to highest peaks of mountains by tectonic action even during ice ages southern california mountains were not subjected to extensive glaciation so rock has remained for tens of millions of years without significant erosion diverse and complex faulting and geologic instability have shaped santa ana river watershed san andreas fault runs across northern section of watershed and is responsible for formation of san bernardino and san gabriel mountains part of transverse ranges of southern california elsinore whittier fault zone crosses santa ana river further downstream near orange riverside county line tectonic action along this fault created santa ana mountains puente hills east orange hills chino hills loma ridge and other mountain ranges and ridges that run northwest southeast across lower section of watershed coastal peninsular ranges from crest to coast p 15 while transverse ranges rise above in many places highest peaks of peninsular ranges reach less than half that elevation cutting of santa ana canyon across peninsular ranges is attributed to wetter southern california climate during wisconsinian glaciation and earlier ice ages during which rivers in southern california were substantially bigger in volume santa ana river which existed prior to creation of peninsular ranges maintained its course as an antecedent stream due to its increased erosive power canyon was eroded through bedrock that today divides groundwater basins of inland empire and coastal plain because groundwater in watershed generally flows from east to west it is forced to surface at bedrock sill of santa ana canyon resulting in a perennial stream that prior to development flowed freely across coastal plain to pacific during this period santa ana changed course multiple times eroding now dry wind gaps in peninsular range and coastal mesas around huntington beach and newport beach ecology hundreds of species of animals and plants characterize santa ana river s diversity of climates and vegetation zones there are over ten of these vegetation zones in watershed including sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in mountains mid elevation forests of pine lodgepole and oak chaparral coastal sage scrub increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along river bed lined with trees and rushes and thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level watershed supports up to 200 bird species fifty mammal species 13 reptile species 7 amphibian species and 15 fish species including steelhead trout from crest to coast p 13 largest portion of watershed inland empire portion is dominated by a hot dry desert climate that supports sparse wildlife while climate and vegetation of san jacinto river and temescal creek watershed is similar to that of southern central valley flora of santa ana river and environs p 4 downstream of desert was once coastal sage scrub and dry grassland community of orange county coastal plain but that region has been almost entirely lost to urbanization rimming arid portions of watershed are chaparral zones consisting of sclerophyllous thick low bushes and small trees chaparral generally is found between elevations of and and occurs mainly closer to coast on windward side of peninsular ranges scrub oak is one of most common plants in chaparral regions forming a dense groundcover that makes it difficult for humans and large animals such as mountain lions coyotes and bobcats to traverse from crest to coast pp 23 25 chaparral growth is determined by wildfires and droughts and depends on semi arid climate of region perennial and seasonal streams often are lined with live oak and sycamore which transition into riparian zones of main stem santa ana river inland riparian marshes upstream of riverside orange county line although degraded by pollution have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state flora of santa ana river and environs p 3 although much of riparian system along river has been degraded one of largest places where it occurs is enormous marsh behind prado dam an area closed to development because it functions as a flood control basin similar to sepulveda dam santa ana sucker a small bottom dwelling fish once was found throughout riparian zones but now is rarely seen in santa ana river drainage near mouth river was once abundant in salt marshes which stretched for miles on either side of river even near upper newport bay which has also served as an alternate mouth of river alpine and subalpine zones despite their high elevation above 9500 feet 2900 meters and significant rainfall at least 35 inches 89 cm per year except in drought years are sparsely vegetated windswept terrain of alpine zone is primarily small brush and weeds while trees mostly small gnarled pines and occur in canyons and shielded depressions in subalpine zone inland elevations above support much denser forest jeffrey pine ponderosa pine black oak lodgepole pine and willow constitute most of forested lands mountain habitats of watershed support many animals typical of californian mountain regions including squirrels chipmunks black bears mule deer and many species of migratory birds from crest to coast pp 21 22 in canyons of san river is abundant in rainbow trout and is lined with alders willow and cottonwoods from crest to coast p 55 where river and its large upper tributaries empty out of mountain canyons into inland empire basin they are surrounded by alluvial scrub

tall grass with a sheer rocky cliff in background this segment of santa ana river just downstream of seven oaks dam marks beginning of inland riparian zone historically santa ana was named best stream in southern california for steelhead trout habitat steelhead is an anadromous fish similar to salmon that migrates up rivers and streams to spawn unlike salmon which usually only reproduce once steelhead may reproduce multiple times and have a much longer life span steelhead was once found along entire main stem of santa ana river as well as on some of its main tributaries santiago creek san antonio and chino creeks cucamonga creek lytle creek city creek and mill creek few if any steelhead were present in temescal creek although one of its tributaries was stocked in 1930s and none inhabited san jacinto river because it is disconnected from most of santa ana river system up to 1950s significant numbers of steelhead trout still migrated in from ocean because of pollution and modifications to river very few steelhead still use river there is a population of wild stream resident coastal rainbow trout upstream of seven oaks dam and in upper reaches of a few tributaries despite rarity of steelhead in recent years fin samples from 13 trout were collected from harding canyon in santiago creek tributary of santa ana river and genetic analysis has shown them to be of native and not hatchery stocks invasive species those that are not native to region have caused problems in watershed for many years one of most troublesome invasive species is giant reed which plagues many coastal southern california waterways giant reed is similar to a tall grass or thin bamboo but grows quickly and can take over native stands of vegetation block streambed hurts habitat of native animals and increases hazard of wildfires perhaps largest effect that giant reed has is its usage of water to support its fast growth rate giant reed population in santa ana river watershed can consume of water per year other invasive species also have affected santa ana river one of most prominent is brown headed cowbird which feeds off parasites and insects identified with cattle which were brought to southern california during spanish rancho period brown headed cowbird is a brood parasite or a bird that lays its eggs in another bird s nest one of most afflicted birds is least bell s vireo whose population also suffers from loss of riparian habitat least bell s vireo is considered an endangered species as is southwestern willow flycatcher whose habitat is often shared with other bird saltcedar is another invasive large weed that also like giant reed uses large amounts of water unlike giant reed saltcedar has deeper roots not only making it more difficult to remove but allowing it to access and use up deep groundwater however saltcedar is similar in that it also provides little usable habitat for native animals history first peoples human habitation on santa ana river dates back 9 000 to 12 000 years ago close to early stages of holocene period first native americans to live in area were nomadic tribes that traveled from place to place grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food ancestors of these early people originated from shoshone and uto aztecan people of northwestern united states eventually human population of watershed reached a peak of about 15 000 from crest to coast p 35 about 8 000 years ago climate experienced a change becoming more arid and originally nomadic tribes began to stay in individual places longer becoming semi nomadic however they did not establish agriculture nor did they raise animals or live in villages like many native american tribes in california acorns were a staple food of many of inland valley people people closer to ocean often fished and hunted small animals often from tide pools and coastal stream areas for food from crest to coast p 33 34 several major premodern native american groups eventually gained control of lands along river yuhaviatam or people in upper basin in southeastern basin cahuilla in desert areas of watershed and tongva people in lower basin from crest to coast p 36 yuhaviatam generally lived in mountain headwaters of santa ana river and its tributaries rimming present day inland empire basin in present day san bernardino county as well as in foothills of san bernardino mountains tongva lived on flat coastal plains of present day orange county south of santa ana mountains they were also larger of two groups controlling all coastal lands from san gabriel mountains in north to aliso creek in south including all of los angeles basin spanish period thumb right alt black and white photo of a small brick house between fields of crops bernardo yorba adobe was built by mexican settlers in rancho canon de santa ana in 1835 when spanish explorer juan rodriguez cabrillo sailed along southern california coast on his voyage of 1542 he passed mouth of santa ana river without noting it neither did any of subsequent spanish sea borne explorers leave any written notice of river mouth it was not until 1769 that gaspar de portola led first overland expedition northwards through coastal southern california still a largely unexplored part of alta california province of new spain and gave river its name on july 28 party camped about three leagues from where santa ana river exits canyon through northern santa ana mountains near present day olive fray juan crespi one of members of expedition wrote in his diary that he called spot jesus de los referring to an earthquake that struck while they were camped alongside there crespi also noted that soldiers were calling river rio de santa ana probably because they had recently celebrated saint anne s day that name remains today second oldest place name in orange county after santiago creek and name of mountain range and city were derived from river from crest to coast p 37 although no missions were actually located along santa ana river or within watershed from crest to coast p 38 river basin was nearly depleted of native people because spanish forced them to work at nearby missions including mission san gabriel arcangel and mission san luis rey affected tribes were usually renamed after missions resulting in tribal names such as gabrielino and luiseno difficult working and living conditions and european diseases such as smallpox killed much of native population during roughly 50 year long mission period secularization act of 1833 passed by newly independent country of mexico eventually brought an end to mission period post mission period native population was almost entirely devastated population was very little their native religions were nearly lost and most of their land had been taken by spanish settlers although mexican government s original intention with secularization act was to provide native americans with their own land and property most of provisions made by act never actually happened spanish settlers continued to press into remaining tribal lands and eventually tribes were forced into surrounding desert lands or into high mountains following mission period came rancho period this occurred when enormous land holdings of missions were subdivided into ranchos owned by individuals some of new private ranchos were merely converted mission ranchos first private rancho along santa ana river was rancho santiago de santa ana a rancho on left bank of lower santa ana river this rancho was acquired by don juan pablo grijalva as early as 1801 hoover and kyle p 266 other ranchos on river followed including ones in inland areas that had not been exploited in mission period ranchos beginning with missions established tradition of raising cattle in coastal southern california a custom upheld until late 19th century agriculture however although established was not yet a major industry a flood that raged down santa ana in 1825 caused river s course to change temporarily to an outlet at newport bay depositing sediment that partially created balboa island spread throughout ranchos on santa ana river were a few towns military outposts and trading posts santa ana river valley was one of most prosperous regions in southern california for many decades american settlement in late 1840s california fought for its independence from mexico in mexican american war santa ana river played an important part in victory of americans over mexican army in 1847 one year after bear flag revolt a mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller american force in los angeles area however santa ana river flooded preventing mexicans from crossing river to attack americans when river s flow finally subsided american forces had been reinforced enough to drive mexicans out of region from crest to coast p 41 thumb left alt a broad river runs between rocky banks santa ana river near riverside when california republic was assimilated into united states in 1848 american settlers began to move into santa ana river region in great numbers mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties and irrigated agriculture began on a large scale city of santa ana viejo original location of santa ana was founded in this period in 1854 mormons settled in upper inland empire area and started city of san bernardino gaining prosperity by using water from river as well as lytle creek and mill creek to irrigate crops cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches soon white settlers in region were more numerous than hispanics as well california gold rush around this time was responsible for attracting many of these people to state but many remained in southern california afterwards in 1860 a much closer gold rush occurred in san bernardino mountains when prospector william holcomb discovered significant deposits just over northern drainage divide of santa ana river this discovery exploded into a full scale gold mining operation in days santa ana river served as a conduit for miners traveling to region and many of forests in upper basin experienced clearcutting as a result of high resource demands of boom gold was also discovered in lytle creek in that same year following gold rush cultivation of citrus became mainstay of economy of lower santa ana river

natural disasters in great flood of 1862 heavy rains dropped by a series of winter storms caused santa ana to burst its banks flooding thousands of acres of land and killing 20 to 40 people in greatest flood it had experienced in recorded history levees along river burst in many places flooding part of inland empire into a continuous body of water several miles wide stretching from mouth of santa ana canyon to where river cuts through santa ana mountains downstream in orange county river overwhelmed nearly all existing and transformed coastal plain into a transient inland sea flow now calculated as a 1 000 year flood peaked at roughly over half average flow of mississippi river from crest to coast p 42 even after flood detrimental conditions continued in region for two years following flood an intense drought caused deaths of tens of thousands of head of livestock despite all of hardships experienced in three years after conditions finally returned to normal santa ana

increased dramatically but brought with it threat of greater damage from floods somewhat compromising protection afforded by prado dam because housing and urban areas encroached on river s historic floodplain an area once occupied by farms and river became confined to a narrow channel a flood similar to ones surrounding turn of 20th century would cause much more damage construction of roads and buildings also heightened runoff that would flow into river during rainfall a process known as urban runoff in fact river flooded again in 1969 and while much of runoff from inland empire was captured behind prado dam probably saving orange county from an even greater flood santiago creek a large tributary flowing from santa ana mountains eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in cities of tustin and orange from crest to coast p 46 in 1964 santa ana river mainstem project which involved concreting lower of river was first proposed construction work began in 1989
