series creator chris carter felt this was one of his favorite episodes to write as he found it interesting to explore how character of fox mulder would react to death of his father carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on episode frank spotnitz said of episode expectations were very high coming after a summer s worth of anticipation to see how mulder got out of boxcar we knew we had to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma at end of show to bring viewers back for third and final part i also thought it was a big gamble to do all that indian mysticism stuff i thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that so i was nervous about that but very excited about scully storyline and way all of that played out with mulder and

largely positive review and rated it a 10 out of 10 keegan described it as perfect counterpoint to anasazi and a strong beginning to third season other reviews were more mixed in an overview of third season in entertainment weekly blessing way was rated a b episode was derided for its corny dream sequence and high flown cosmic hooey although introduction of well manicured man and mitch pileggi s portrayal of walter skinner were seen as highlights writing for a v club emily vanderwerff panned episode s pseudo mystical bullshit rating episode a b she felt that resolution of cliffhanger from previous episode anasazi that of mulder s apparent death was poorly handled and that character of albert hosteen was perhaps worst in series however introduction of plot threads such as scully s implant and alien human hybrids were deemed positive factors david duchovny was somewhat disappointed with episode hoping he would have had a chance to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one actor said i like psychology and i like thinking that went into episode as a viewer as an actor i felt like an opportunity passed me by if i had to do any episode over again it would be that one actor called episode in 1995 greatest missed opportunity they had chris carter disagreed stating that fox mulder s role in episode was right way to do it and that dramatic weight for episode had to shift from mulder to dana scully footnotes bibliography external links blessing way on x files official website category 1995 american television episodes
