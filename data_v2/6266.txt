generations a variant of 1991 jeep wrangler and older cj 6 cj 8 wheelbase it is entirely produced in israel by automotive industries ltd with exception of engines as their manufacture is not

to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role and can be outfitted with a machine gun or other weapons systems when armed with a 105 mm 4 1 in m40 recoilless rifle vehicle is uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood rather than in perpendicular position required by most other vehicles a variant of extended version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear facing heavy machine gun mount while canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post an air conditioned version of extended model is often used by officers and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along rear sides and roof as well as gunports for less lethal weapons shielding allows for a wide field of view while at same time protecting against firebombs and rock throwing armoured version thumb members of israel border police with a sufa mini suv in jewish quarter of jerusalem s old city as with several analogous light military vehicles despite being originally designed to fill a light reconnaissance role rise of urban warfare and close quarters combat meant that israel defense forces had to recast storm in new roles when need for a light armoured vehicle became apparent to israeli security forces ail s engineering department designed a vehicle protection system from bottom up integrating it into existing vehicle in a manner that did not compromise its off road and other capabilities and that did not create mechanical strain and increase in maintenance often associated with up armouring in part due to its computerized injected engine armour protects against 7 62x39mm 0 3 in armour piercing ammunition and maintains a high protection to weight and cost ratio by employing idf approved advanced materials protected israeli configuration s gross vehicle weight is 3 000 kilograms 6 614 lb though several varying protection levels are in use with individual units thumb ail storm i left ail abir right another important asset are storm s narrow dimensions which allow it to traverse narrow alleyways common to of many middle eastern cities places that armoured humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability if at all full height rear doors which allow for quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles civilian use first generation storms were made available to general public in israel from 1992 to 2001 a small number were purchased directly by private consumers while larger numbers were acquired second hand from israeli government owned firms like israel electric company and water company as well as national parks authority and israel police modified storms are popular with off roading enthusiasts in israel note loose translation and summary of hebrew jeepolog com reference storm ii beginning in 2006 ail began delivery of an improved model to idf m 242 storm mark ii known in

available in local market mdt david controversy developed in 2000s at an investment of us 2 million after idf commitments for 1 200 units some ail jobs were believed to be in jeopardy following a mid 2005 announcement that idf would purchase 100 us sold land rover defender based mdt david announcement provoked threats of protests from ail s management and labourers who had recently faced blow of local humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations mdt david was chosen over armoured version of storm because heavy storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems safety hazards and limited mission however idf said that purchase of david was to fill a temporary gap in production until storm ii s testing was completed and has since begun filling its commitment storm iii a storm mark iii was set to be produced for israeli defense forces starting in june 2008 when idf was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011 based on then new four door jeep wrangler jk design mark iii is meant to address some of shortfalls of earlier mark ii whereas previous vehicle was an update of original tk storm storm iii was designed from outset with a five door configuration unlike tj l new jk storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier duty shock absorbers springs and axles necessary for an armored version it includes a standard 2 8l vm motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission like storm ii mark iii was initially available only to military with versions set to be delivered to israel police in 2009 a civilian version would
