gender roles of seventeenth century europe mary was dutiful wife and william held power george and anne however reversed roles george was dutiful husband and it was anne who exercised royal prerogatives william had assumed incorrectly that george would use his marriage to anne as a means of building a separate power base in britain but george never challenged his wife s authority and never strove to accrue influence anne occasionally used image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming as a woman she knew nothing except what prince tells me but it was an artifice husbands had a legal right to their wife s property and it was argued that it was unnatural and against church s teachings for a man to be subject to his wife somerset pp 181 182 george made no such claim or demand he was content to remain a prince and duke i am her majesty s subject he said i shall do naught but what she commands me somerset p 181 in words of historian anne somerset fact that prince george was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status and so almost by accident george achieved a major advance for feminism somerset p 182 winston churchill wrote that he was a fine looking man tall blond and good natured he was neither clever nor learned a simple normal man without envy or ambition and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst
