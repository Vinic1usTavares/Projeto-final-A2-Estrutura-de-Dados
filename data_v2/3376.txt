he enjoyed wearing fine clothes contrary to quakers preference for plain dress some of his family s other virtues such as thrift and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco he adopted early in life when he turned eighteen dow sought to avoid required militia musters more out of distaste for drunkenness that they often involved than out of quaker belief in pacifism instead he joined volunteer fire department whose members were exempted from muster in 1827 dow lobbied maine legislature to reform fire companies to increase their efficiency that same year he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration members compromised and served only wine not hard liquor at times dow let his politics interfere with his duties after being promoted to fire chief he allowed a

temperance advocate early prohibition efforts in 19th century a typical american male consumed on average more than three times alcohol of his modern day counterpart in his memoirs dow noted that in portland a significant portion of a working man s pay was in form of daily rum rations it was rule to quit work at eleven in forenoon and four in afternoon to drink in every grocer s shop were casks of rum punch constantly prepared in a tub sometimes on sidewalk just as lemonade is to be seen now on fourth of july he saw alcohol as responsible for downfall of individuals families and fortunes often pointing out ramshackle homes or businesses to his family and saying rum did that his quest to reform people by reforming their environment grew out of religious movements of second great awakening and as historian judith n mcarthur later wrote temperance reformers urged their listeners to cast demon rum out of their lives just as evangelical ministers exhorted them to cast devil out of their hearts many of portland s middle and upper class citizens including dow believed drunkenness was a great threat to city s moral and financial well being in 1827 he became a founding member of maine temperance society group initially focused its efforts on evils of distilled beverages but by 1829 dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages at same time he associated himself with anti masonic and anti slavery causes and became more involved with politics generally in 1832 presidential election unsatisfied with both andrew jackson and henry clay dow backed william wirt a minor party candidate in 1837 maine temperance society split over whether they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits dow sided with anti wine forces who formed their own organization maine temperance union that year james appleton a whig representative in state legislature proposed a prohibition law and dow spoke often and forcefully in favor of effort which was unsuccessful appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839 but despite his and dow s best efforts he continued to be defeated thumb dow and his fellow temperance advocates saw alcohol as cause of many of society s ills dow worked fervently on behalf of whig candidates and came to detest democrats as tools of alcohol industry maine s whig governor edward kent granted dow a colonel s commission in state militia in 1841 as a reward for his efforts despite his lack of military experience nevertheless dow did not consider himself a party man in politician s understanding of term and had no qualms about encouraging his supporters to vote against any whig whom he considered insufficiently anti alcohol dow spent early 1840s attending to his tanning business but also found time to encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence in 1842 he and his allies succeeded in getting city government in portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers a referendum on question was decided in prohibitionists favor later that year next year saw democrats win election to city government replacing more prohibition friendly whigs and many liquor sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely dow kept up his speaking efforts around state despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer in 1846 dow spoke before legislature in favor of statewide prohibition bill passed but lacked enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect following year he ran for state legislature in a special election but was narrowly defeated in 1850 now a member of new free soil party he encouraged like minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law they did so but saw it vetoed by democratic governor john w dana legislature fell one vote short of overriding veto mayor of portland left thumb upright dow in early 1850s in 1850 dow was elected president of maine temperance union next year he ran for mayor of portland on whig ticket and was elected by a vote of 1332 to 986 within a month of taking office he lobbied state legislature to pass a statewide prohibition law it did so and dow met with new governor john hubbard who signed bill into law on june 2 maine was first state to ban alcohol and statewide prohibition became known around country as maine law law s passage propelled dow to national fame he was called napoleon of temperance and was featured speaker in august at a national temperance convention in new york city after maine law came into force dow allowed liquor dealers a two week grace period to sell their stock out of state then began confiscations his enforcement efforts quickly drove respectable drinking establishments out of business but less fancy saloons especially those frequented by portland s poor and immigrant residents simply moved their operations to secret locations even so dow proclaimed in an address to city council that he had eliminated all but a few secret grog shops whose persistence he blamed on foreigners despite his growing national fame dow continued to face opposition at home both dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against other often making personal attacks alongside political arguments for 1852 municipal election democrats nominated albion parris a former governor and united states senator to run against dow while democrats rallied behind their candidate dow s vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party and in two wards whigs ran an anti dow ticket instead on election day dow slightly increased his vote total from year before with 1496 but parris outpolled him bringing in 1900 votes although whigs controlled voter registration at time dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by irish immigrants after his defeat dow continued to promote prohibition around country and was gratified to see it spread to eleven states he also made efforts to refute charge made by his enemies including his cousin john neal that maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in portland during dow s term in office in 1854 dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully as whig party began to break apart dow attracted support from free soilers and know nothings a nativist party by next year those two parties began to join anti slavery whigs in a new party republicans they soon controlled state legislature and with dow s encouragement strengthened enforcement provisions of maine law dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re elected to office he had left three years earlier portland rum riot thumb portland s city hall site of rum riot two months into his term dow inadvertently ran afoul of his own prohibition laws after setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use only uses permitted dow ordered 1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at city hall dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there because was in his name this placed dow in technical violation of law dow s enemies seized on mistake and demanded that police search municipal building for illegal liquor because recent additions to maine law had removed judicial discretion judge had no choice but to issue warrant police seized alcohol but did not arrest dow that evening june 2 a crowd of anti prohibitionists gathered to demand that law be enforced shouting threats to spill neal dow s liquor dow ordered state militia to block protesters and had sheriff read crowd riot act as darkness fell dow ordered crowd to disperse when they refused he ordered militia to fire one man was killed and seven were wounded and crowd fled on learning of fatality dow maintained that shooting was justified and asked if dead man was irish he was not violence turned public opinion against dow and he was denounced in newspapers across nation he was tried for violation of prohibition law prosecutor was former u s attorney general nathan clifford a longtime dow opponent and defense attorney was a fellow founder of maine temperance society future senator william p fessenden dow was acquitted but his opponents convinced coroner to impanel a jury that pronounced protester s death a homicide he was ultimately acquitted of that charge but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re election as mayor state legislator republicans lost governorship that fall and in 1856 democrats combined with remaining whigs in state legislature to repeal maine law entirely some of other states that had passed maine laws followed suit as they learned that promised benefits were not forthcoming and enforcement was difficult if not impossible dow continued to travel country and united kingdom speaking in support of prohibition but to little legislative effect maine passed a new much milder maine law in 1858 which dow disliked but defended as better than nothing in 1858 dow won a special election to maine house of representatives as a republican when one of members elected declined to serve he won reelection to a full term in 1859 and continued to agitate for stricter prohibition laws but was unsuccessful he also became entangled in scandal when state treasurer benjamin d peck lent out state funds to private citizens including dow contravening state law peck lent large sums to himself which were lost when his business ventures failed dow had guaranteed some of peck s borrowing and faced ruin as it became clear that peck could not repay state treasury dow was able to settle debts and conceal much of his role in affair but enough of scandal became known that some of his many enemies attacked him in local newspapers even some of his prohibitionist allies became less openly supportive of him in september 1860 he did not run for re election civil war thumb left upright general dow dow continued to promote prohibition after leaving office but also added his voice to growing chorus advocating abolition of slavery several slaveholding states seceded after election of republican presidential candidate abraham lincoln and formed confederate states of america even before outbreak of civil war dow called for rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished he was 57 years old at outbreak of war and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father after confederate attack on fort sumter however dow felt compelled to join union cause governor israel washburn appointed him colonel of 13th maine volunteer infantry regiment on november 23 1861 many of officers dow recruited to cause were his associates from prohibition movement new orleans after a winter of training in maine dow and 13th maine were dispatched to gulf of mexico in february 1862 even before departing dow quarreled with his superiors when he learned his unit would be placed under command of major general benjamin f butler a democrat whom dow regarded as soft on slavery and pro rum dow s protests were ineffective but they earned butler s enmity after joining butler at fort monroe virginia regiment sailed south and was forced to land in north carolina after a storm dow s performance in emergency won butler s praise but two still cordially loathed each other after damaged ships were repaired butler s army continued south to ship island mississippi butler s army aided by flag officer david farragut s fleet captured new orleans on april 29 1862 dow and 13th maine did not join in attack remaining behind to guard ship island a day earlier congress had approved dow s promotion to brigadier general he blamed butler for excluding him from battle believing that butler was threatened by his promotion and calling him a bully and a beast he spent much of time quarreling with his second in command lieutenant colonel francis s while regiment occupied forts around new orleans while there dow encouraged black slaves to run away from captivity and take shelter with union army he also confiscated property from nearby planters including those who supported union and tried unsuccessfully to claim personal salvage rights over confederate military property abandoned in river in october 1862 dow was given command over district of pensacola and moved to join other units there he immediately earned troops disfavor by placing pensacola under prohibition he also without authorization from washington began to recruit black troops from local slave population while continuing his confiscation of rebel property butler soon countermanded confiscation order which dow believed was done in revenge for his banning of alcohol port hudson and capture thumb libby prison site of dow s imprisonment in december 1862 nathaniel p banks replaced butler in command at new orleans banks a massachusetts republican with prohibitionist sympathies had known dow before war but he initially displeased dow by refusing to repeal butler s order against confiscation of rebel property he did however allow dow to return to new orleans to take part in planned spring offensive as union armies looked to complete their control over mississippi river only vicksburg mississippi and port hudson louisiana held out against federal control major general ulysses s grant moved on vicksburg from north while banks advanced to port hudson from south by may 21 town was surrounded banks was determined to break siege by a direct assault on confederate lines dow believed attack to be a mistake and delayed his units participation until later in day in assault which was unsuccessful dow was wounded in right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce while in hospital he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater on june 30 having healed enough to mount a horse again dow visited his troops as he returned to hospital after dark he was captured by confederate cavalry operating behind union lines dow was taken by wagon and train to jackson mississippi then to montgomery alabama before finally being confined to libby prison in richmond virginia confederacy s capital in august he was transferred to mobile alabama where confederate officials investigated whether dow had armed slaves to fight against rebels which confederate congress had made a capital offense dow had done so but his prosecutors could find no evidence of such an action after law was passed so charges were dropped and dow was returned to libby prison in october he remained there until february 1864 when he was exchanged for captive confederate general william henry fitzhugh lee son of general robert e lee his health was damaged by his prison experience and after spending several months convalescing in portland he resigned from army in november 1864 postwar politics after war dow returned to his leadership of prohibition movement co founding national temperance society and publishing house with james black in 1865 he spent rest of 1860s and 1870s giving speeches in support of temperance across united states canada and great britain his efforts produced little success as public turned against prohibition and alcohol industry was better organized to resist dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving speeches in support of liberal party before british elections of 1874 as their leader william ewart gladstone was sympathetic to prohibition liberals lost decisively a result gladstone and dow blamed on liquor interests dow continued to promote prohibition in britain until may 1875 when exhausted he returned home against calls for personal temperance instead of government restraint dow remained steadfast saying that only way to fight drunkenness was more jail for rascals in 1876 he supported election of rutherford b hayes a republican and teetotaler following year dow saw some success for prohibition as maine s legislature strengthened weak prohibition law there by banning distilling in state despite that minor victory dow began to sour on republican party believing them insufficiently committed to his cause and disappointed at their failure to protect rights of southern blacks as reconstruction came to an end other temperance advocates felt same way and some had organized a new prohibition party in 1869 prohibitionists focused their efforts on banning alcohol to exclusion of all other issues most party members came from pietist churches and most like dow were former republicans they had won very few votes in 1872 and 1876 presidential elections but as temperance advocates grew disenchanted with republican party they hoped to win converts in 1880 presidential election of 1880 thumb upright dow at age 87 in 1880 maine republicans refused to pass more anti alcohol legislation and dow quit party to join prohibitionists he instantly became party s most prominent member his friend and ally james black requested that dow s name be placed in nomination for presidency at 1880 convention to which dow agreed convention that met in cleveland that june welcomed delegates from twelve states but attracted almost no attention from press dow himself did not attend staying home with his ailing wife candidates for a party s nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time he was nominated heading a ticket with vice presidential nominee henry adams thompson of ohio dow mostly ignored national contest that summer focusing on campaigning for pro temperance candidates in local maine elections republicans pressured dow to withdraw fearing that he would claim enough votes to cost their nominee james a garfield election dow declined to do so but his vote totals were too small to harm garfield in any case prohibition ticket polled just 10 305 votes 0 1 of total garfield narrowly won popular vote over democrat winfield scott hancock but in electoral college he carried a clear majority dow was not displeased with result happy that republicans had triumphed over ex rebel element later years after election dow began to work with republicans again in maine to advance prohibition issues and in 1884 he endorsed fellow mainer and republican candidate for president james g blaine blaine narrowly lost election first republican loss in 28 years and many republicans blamed prohibition party whose votes would have tipped new york and with it electoral college majority to blaine resentful republicans in maine refused to advance any more prohibition laws and as a result dow made his final break with republican party in 1885 in 1886 state election he spoke fervently against his former party and in support of prohibitionist candidate for governor in 1888 at age of 84 dow accepted prohibition party nomination for mayor of portland an office he had held more than thirty years earlier democrats were unable to decide on a candidate so they endorsed their former enemy dow in an effort to unseat republican incumbent many regular democrats refused to support fusion ticket and dow lost election by 1934 votes to later that year dow attended 1888 prohibition party national convention in indianapolis in a break from his erstwhile contempt for former confederacy dow called for sectional unity and no more waving of bloody shirt he also spoke against political expediency of party backing women s suffrage although he personally endorsed idea cornelia dow had died in 1883 but dow s unmarried daughter also named cornelia lived with him and assisted in temperance causes in 1891 his son frederick and his family moved in as well frederick remained active in his father s former republican party and was editor of portland evening express despite a fall from a horse in 1890 dow continued in good health reading and writing about his signature issue but travelling less on his ninetieth birthday in 1894 a large crowd gathered to celebrate him and his life s work in 1895 he gave his final public speech criticizing city government for not enforcing prohibition laws he began to write his memoirs reminiscences of neal dow recollections of eighty years but died on october 2 1897 before completing book dow s body lay in state at second parish church
