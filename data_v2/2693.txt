and distributed second translation in 1957 was done by tatsui sato in 1995 book of mormon was translated again into a more colloquial style missionary work from opening of japan mission through 1924 was challenging due to language barriers and cultural differences as well as 1923 tokyo earthquake and immigration act of 1924 few baptisms were performed during this time period due to these difficulties japan mission was closed from 1924 to 1945 until after end of world war ii during twenty years missionary work was halted in japan work was moved to hawaii in order to reach japanese people living there a small number of latter day saints in japan met together privately in their homes from 1924 to 1945 under leadership of fujiya nara and later fujiwara takeo mission was reopened in 1948 with edward l clissold as president missionary work flourished after 1948 with number of baptisms increasing requiring new missions to be opened lds church decided to open mormon pavilion

gibson sent by brigham young attempted to send missionaries to pacific in 1861 but stopped his mission in hawaii he wrote a book of strict instructions for a morally and physically clean life that hawaiian people should follow called sanitary instructions he was excommunicated from church in 1864 for selling church offices to islanders and using money to buy large amounts of land on lanai in 1895 japanese consul in san francisco asked abraham h cannon if there were plans to open up a mission in japan however he died before mission could be established then in 1901 church s first presidency announced opening of japan mission heber j grant of quorum of twelve apostles and later church s 7th president was assigned to establish first lds church mission in asia headquartered in tokyo panic of 1893 caused him to go into a lot of debt so at time he was in serious financial distress first presidency allowed him one year to get out of debt which he did in allotted time grant handpicked first three missionaries to serve with him in japan horace s ensign louis a kelsch and alma o taylor they became known as japanese quartet they arrived in japan on august 12 1901 despite their arrival missionaries did not yet have permission from government to proselyte so they spent their time learning language after lobbying with chief of police missionaries received permission to preach in early october missionaries particularly grant had great difficulties learning language missionaries met takahashi goro who had previously published a defense of mormons in periodical sun takahashi spoke good english and had a knowledge of other languages he decided to help grant by writing a book that would introduce mission of latter day saints to japanese people nakazawa hajime became first baptized member in japan nakazawa soon began asking grant for money to start a new business and because lds church is prohibited in loaning members money to start businesses grant refused nakazawa was caught robbing mission house and was excommunicated from church and arrested after arrest of nakazawa takahashi no longer supported missionaries describing grant as cruel and cold blooded for refusing to pay from 1902 to 1924 eighty eight missionaries in twenty nine locations laboring largely in tokyo sapporo and osaka performing 166 baptisms however on august 7 1924 grant then president of church closed mission to await a more favorable time due to low number of baptisms several issues contributed to low number of baptisms ongoing problems in mission included difficulty of language as well as cultural differences also small number of missionaries and their extended service caused fatigue among them and hardships for their loved ones there were also external problems earthquake in tokyo in 1923 stalled proselytizing united states immigration act of 1924 caused racial tensions between japan and united states finally general sense of defeatism of missionaries in japan and church leaders in salt lake city influenced decision to close mission in japan nevertheless even though they did not baptize many members they translated book of mormon into japanese they also wrote a japanese a history of church a biography of joseph smith and other literature missionaries as well as church in general gained experience that would make reestablishment of mission in 1948 more successful first japanese church members first baptized japanese member was hajime nakazawa a former shinto priest he was baptized on march 8 1902 on shore of omori in tokyo bay although he was first baptized member he was not first active member of lds church after he was baptized he and his wife asked missionaries for a significant amount of money missionaries refused and he was later caught attempting to rob missionaries home possibly indicating that he only agreed to get baptized in hopes of obtaining money from church he was then excommunicated and subsequently arrested one of most prominent first japanese church members was katsunuma a veterinarian and immigration inspector in honolulu honored as father of immigrants he is notable as one of first members of lds church with japanese ancestry he moved to united states during emigration fever he had many contacts with lds church members in logan utah which influenced his decision to get baptized on august 8 1895 after his death headline of obituary read dr katsunuma first japanese mormon dies tokujiro sato was another one of church s first japanese converts tokujiro immigrated to hawaii from japan supposedly joined church in 1892 though because of lack of records it is unclear when he was baptized or whether he was baptized at all he was listed in membership records in waipio branch but there is no baptism record however baptisms of his children were recorded and despite lack of records attended lds church throughout his life portrayal of church in japan other christian churches often preached against lds church criticizing its doctrines yet admitting strange propensity it seemed to have in attracting followers doctrine of church and polygamy in particular was seen as a threat to japanese culture and meiji society s ideals of civilization even though japanese people heard about church through iwakura mission to united states in 1872 earliest official printed introduction of japanese people to lds church was likely 1879 japanese translation of jules verne s around world in 80 days jean passepartout a character in book heard a lecture on mormonism and polygamy which disturbed him magazine articles helped to spread knowledge of church in japan however articles focused on polygamy and its dangers to women and society in an increasingly westernizing country some japanese saw polygamous practices of latter day saints as a direct offense to attempts to eliminate laws and traditions surrounding concubines when church missionaries taught about church s doctrine to japanese it was often necessary to counter assumptions japanese people had about church and polygamy japanese translation of book a brief history of church of jesus christ of latter day saints included an extra chapter on polygamy in order to provide some clarification that lds church no longer practiced it translation of book of mormon translation of book of mormon began in 1904 and went through 1909 taking almost six years elders had no working knowledge of japanese and reputation of lds church made it difficult for them to find native speakers who were willing to help them with language mission president horace s ensign requested that each missionary use his spare time translating book of mormon into japanese seven months later compiled translation was assigned to alma o taylor who worked full time to complete it taylor finished translation in 1906 after working 21 months next 18 months were used to edit re read and correct book of mormon noguchi zenshiro a delegate to world s parliament of religions and recommended to taylor that style of book of mormon should be changed from colloquial style to bunsho a more elegant written style historically used in literature records and official documents choko ikuta changed style of translation to bunsho and finished in may 1909 final corrections were made july 24 1909 first five thousand copies were released october 11 1909 with special editions made for monarchs and government leaders task of translating of book of mormon into japanese was taken with great care taylor read his translations about fourteen times while critics read translation seven times they recruited help from some of best japanese authors of time such as and a second translation of book of mormon was published in 1957 translation was made by tatsui sato who belonged to first baptized japanese family after closure of mission in 1924 most recent translation of book of mormon was published in 1995 in a colloquial style this style became more widely used after world war ii 1924 1945 closed japan mission from 1924 to 1945 church of jesus christ of latter day saints withdrew its missionaries leadership and organizational structure leaving japanese latter day saints on their own losing contact with their mother church created a challenge for remaining japanese latter day saints they had no one to lead their congregation because of lack of church leadership in japan

in japan members of relief society held bazaars selling cheap goods for low prices to raise money in postwar japan relief society worked to help repair missionary clothing and wash missionaries bedding eventually branches formed small official groups of relief society however auxiliary manuals had not yet been translated into japanese so relief society materials came from sister missionaries from 1965 to 1966 materials for christian instruction came in seito no michi a worldwide church magazine but sometimes no lessons were featured as only issues october through may contained lesson plans during months when relief society didn t have lessons they had work meetings creating their own manual to be approved by relief society general board 1968 1980 church expansion on september 1 1968 walter bills was named new mission president of northern far east mission renamed japan mission southern far east mission was named japan okinawa mission and was presided over by edward okazaki

2000 with sapporo japan temple third in japan dedicated in 2016 recent problems two events that created challenges to latter day saint missionary work in japan were death of emperor hirohito in 1989 and tokyo subway attack in 1995 by religious group aum shinrikyo death of emperor made japanese citizens reevaluate role of emperor in state and in their lives even though period after wwii had been characterized by a de deification of emperor after death of emperor hirohito his death rituals were widely publicized this reignited an interest in old japanese symbols rites and rituals due to deeply rooted religious and cultural belief systems that have lasted for centuries converting to another religion was associated with becoming non japanese second event that created challenges for lds missionaries in japan was tokyo subway sarin attack by aum shinrikyo this attack which killed twelve and injured more than five thousand people greatly affected japanese people it caused fear of and a resentment to japanese new religions and japanese people had a hard time distinguishing between proselytizing lds missionaries and new religions cultural obstacles thumb 250px right plan of salvation in japanese language japan is culturally and historically a non christian nation this poses problems in lds missionary work because japanese are culturally not familiar with western notion of god however despite japanese unfamiliarity with christian or western religiosity japanese are a religious people many japanese people state to be a part of one or more religion mostly shinto and buddhism and these religions affect their world view deeply thus cultural differences in ethics and morality challenge missionary work another cultural difference is impact of confucian ethics western culture puts emphasis on individual while japanese culture values group over individual japanese culture values harmony over individual ambition and aggressiveness large decisions are often made together for example a japanese person may be more willing to be baptized if their family joined them in their decision if not they will likely not choose to be baptized in order to avoid isolation from their family mormonism emphasizes individual agency and individual s relationship with jesus christ values which make mormon baptism in japan less likely several scholars have pointed out that little study has been made of internal factors that have limited success of lds missions in japan specifically distinctiveness of lds culture as well as its specific american characteristics may have limited to what extent japanese have accepted mormonism statistics and other information as of march 2018 lds church reported 129 335 members 7 missions 265 congregations and 3 temples in japan as of april 2013
