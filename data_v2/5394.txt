thumb 300px portrait of sir francis grant lord cullen and his family by john smybert 1688 1751 family in early modern scotland includes all aspects of kinship and family life between renaissance and reformation of sixteenth century and beginnings of industrialisation and end of jacobite risings in mid eighteenth century in scotland scottish kinship in this period was agnatic with descent judged through a common ancestor helping to create surname system in borders and clans in highlands with these systems beginning to break down in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries respectively there was considerable concern over safety of children abolition of godparents in reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising role and responsibilities of fathers wet nurses were used for young children but in most families mothers took primary role in bringing up children while kirk emphasised role of father for older children after reformation there was an increasing emphasis on education resulting in growth of a parish school system but its effects were limited for children of poor and for girls most children left home for a period of life cycle service as domestic or agricultural servants or as apprentices before marriage marriages were often subject of careful negotiations particularly higher in society marriage lost its sacramental status at reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout period women managed household and might work beside their husbands and although obedience to husbands was stressed this may have been limited in practice divorce developed after reformation and was available for a wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in england because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state and some women acquired independence and status but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for dead that dominated in late medieval scotland were removed at reformation and simpler services adopted burial inside church was discouraged as a result separate aisles for rich and graveyards with stone markers for majority became common kinship thumb upright right painting by george jamesone of campbell of glenorchy family tree 1635 unlike in england where kinship was predominately cognatic derived through both males and females in early modern scotland kinship was agnatic with members of a group sharing a sometimes fictional common ancestor through only male line women retained original surname of their family of origin at marriage and marriages were intended to create alliances between kin groups rather than a new bond of kinship that joined two families
