sonic x treme was a platform game developed by sega technical institute from 1994 until its cancellation in 1997 it was intended to be first fully 3d sonic hedgehog game and first original sonic game for sega saturn it built on past sonic games while introducing elements to take sonic into 3d era of video games storyline followed sonic on his journey to stop dr robotnik stealing six magic rings from tiara boobowski and her father x treme was conceived as a side scrolling platform game for sega genesis to succeed sonic knuckles 1994 development shifted to 32x and then saturn and windows and game was redesigned as a 3d platform game for 1996 holiday season plan was disrupted by company politics an unfavorable visit by sega of japan executives and obstacles using a game engine developed by sonic team for another project staff illness made it impossible to finish x treme on time leading to its cancellation a film tie in with metro goldwyn mayer was also canceled in place of x treme sega released a port of genesis game sonic 3d blast but did not release an original 3d sonic platform game until sonic adventure for dreamcast in 1998 cancellation is considered an important factor in saturn s commercial failure as it left system with no original sonic platform game elements similar to those in x treme appeared in later games such as sonic lost world 2013 premise thumb left alt a screenshot of jade gully zone jade gully zone from senn and alon s engine see game engines which used a fish eye style view known as reflex lens x treme was a platform game in which players controlled sonic hedgehog with ability to move in any direction gameplay was similar to saturn platform game bug though producer mike wallis said that x treme would differ in that sonic would be free to roam levels unconstrained by linear paths game featured a fisheye camera system reflex lens that gave players a wide angle view making levels appear to move around sonic levels would rotate around a fixed center of gravity meaning sonic could run up walls arriving at what was previously ceiling sonic was also able to enter and exit screen as he moved for boss battles levels were free roaming and arena style and rendered bosses as polygonal characters as opposed to sprites these levels used shading transparency and lighting effects to showcase saturn s technical potential developers wanted to take sonic into modern era while building on series successes in 1996 wallis said we plan to have all of familiar sonic elements in game as well as additional ones we re giving sonic new moves because sonic is a hedgehog of times we re bringing him up to speed in line with other sonic games x treme emphasized speed and featured collectable rings additions included abilities to throw rings at enemies create a shield from rings do spinning midair attacks strike enemies below with a power ball attack jump higher with less control than normal and execute a sonic boom attack in concert with shield that struck in 360 degrees surfing and bungee jumping were included as activities considered cool at time at least four stages were developed jade gully red sands galaxy fortress and crystal frost lead designer chris senn stated that he modeled and textured four main characters as well as designs for 50 enemies and an hour of music fang sniper and metal sonic were planned as bosses plot described in promotional materials involves a tiara boobowski who was set to become a major character and her father calling on sonic to help defend six magical rings of order from dr robotnik background original sonic hedgehog was developed by sonic team in japan released in 1991 it greatly increased popularity of sega genesis in north america after its release developer yuji naka and other japanese staff relocated to california to join sega technical institute sti a development division led by mark cerny cerny aimed to establish an elite development studio combining design philosophies of american and japanese developers in 1991 sti began developing several games including sonic hedgehog 2 which was released following year though sonic hedgehog 2 was successful language barrier and cultural differences created a rift between japanese and american developers once development ended cerny departed sti and was replaced by former atari employee roger hector american staff developed sonic spinball while japanese staff developed sonic hedgehog 3 and sonic knuckles according to developer takashi iizuka japanese team experimented with 3d computer graphics for sonic 3 but were unable to implement them with limited power of genesis after sonic knuckles was completed in 1994 naka returned to japan to continue work with sonic team at time sega of japan and sega of america ran as separate entities and relations were not always smooth some of this conflict may have been caused by sega president hayao nakayama and his admiration for sega of america according to former sega of america ceo tom kalinske there were some guys in executive suites who really didn t like that nakayama in particular appeared to favor us executives a lot of japanese executives were maybe a little jealous and i think some of that played into decisions that were made by contrast author steven l kent wrote that nakayama bullied american executives and believed japanese executives made best decisions according to hector after release of sony playstation in 1994 atmosphere at sega became political with lots of finger pointing development after naka s return to japan with his team in late 1994 sti was left with mostly american staff early ideas for next sonic game included experimental sonic crackers which became knuckles chaotix for 32x development of sonic x treme began in late 1994 at sti michael kosaka was executive producer and team leader and designer and cgi artist senn created animations to pitch game to sega executives sonic x treme was conceived for sega genesis as a side scrolling platform game like previous sonic games as new consoles and 32 bit era were on way game was moved to 32x under working titles sonic 32x and sonic mars after project mars codename used for 32x initial 32x design was for an isometric side scroller but became a full 3d game with a view set on a floating plane kosaka completed design documents for 32x version before 32x was released without a clear picture of hardware in mid 1995 kosaka resigned according to senn kosaka and executive producer dean lester were not getting along and i believe michael felt it was his best option to simply remove himself from what he thought was a politically unhealthy environment lester resigned later in 1995 and was replaced by manny granillo wallis who had worked on genesis games ooze and comix zone was promoted to producer and placed in charge of sonic x treme lead programmer don goddard was replaced with ofer alon who some staff felt was difficult to work with saying he did not share his work as design had changed significantly and 32x struggled commercially development moved to a planned sega cartridge console to be powered by nvidia 3d hardware to compete with upcoming nintendo 64 wallis said this request was made without hardware specifications after sega of japan announced that sega would focus solely on sega saturn development shifted again when naka visited sti and observed x treme development he simply said good luck move to saturn thumb alt a screenshot of a level in boss engine screenshot from coffin s boss engine one of two engines used to develop sonic x treme this version was displayed at e3 in may 1996 saturn version was developed by two teams with two different game engines starting in second half of 1995 one team led by sti tech director robert morgan and including programmer chris coffin developed free roaming boss levels this engine used tools used by saturn games such as panzer dragoon ii zwei and rendered bosses as fully polygonal characters other team led by senn and alon developed main levels working on pc with intent of porting their work to saturn alon and senn focused on building an editor to construct main levels music and backgrounds could not be coded in editor and had to be coded manually for each level enemies were created as pre rendered sprites other staff included composer howard drossin lead artist ross harris artist designers fei cheng and andrew probert and designers jason kuo and richard wheeler according to senn his team was completely different from sti teams led by naka this combined with their inexperience set up seeds of doubt and a political landmine waiting to go off if we didn t produce amazing results quickly wallis stated that sti shifted its resources toward sonic x treme in late 1995 he expressed frustration with team structure and felt that internal politics hampered development coffin felt division of responsibilities would ensure every element was perfect other difficulties arose from design according to wallis theme of game was to take basic sonic 2d side scrolling and add ability to have him go into and out of screen on paper that sounded great but when we actually started to implement it addition created some design challenges we didn t initially account for 3d graphics were new and developers were still learning how they would affect controls and gameplay programming for saturn proved difficult as alon could not get his engine developed on windows to run fast enough on saturn morgan outsourced port to a third party disputes with sega of japan in march 1996 sega of japan representatives visited sti to evaluate progress senn and other sources indicate that key visitor was president nakayama though wallis recalls executive vice president shoichiro irimajiri executive was unimpressed by senn and alon s work as version he saw ported from pc to saturn by third party ran at a poor frame rate senn and alon attempted to show their most recent pc version but visitor left before they had opportunity although neither senn nor alon were officially part of production after visit they continued working on their version hoping to pitch it to sega as a pc game visitor was impressed by coffin s boss engine and requested that x treme be reworked around it concerned about need to create essentially a new game before strict december 1996 deadline wallis isolated coffin s team preventing outside influence team consisted of four artists two programmers a contractor and three designers set up in an old sti location they worked between sixteen and twenty hours a day according to wallis coffin actually left his apartment cancelling his lease moved all his belongings into office and worked day and night in april sega executive vice president bernie stolar approached sti and asked what he could do to help game meet its deadline at wallis suggestion he provided tools and source code for sonic team s 3d saturn game nights into dreams two weeks later stolar requested that team stop using engine as naka had threatened to leave sega if it were used senn said personally i can understand naka s interest in keeping technology his team developed under tight control sonic was a franchise he clearly felt should be handled solely by sonic team he must have felt very strongly about it if he was willing to even threaten to quit sonic team was also developing its own 3d sonic game using nights engine which may have motivated naka s threat loss of nights engine cost sonic x treme team two weeks of development cancellation in may 1996 sega displayed a playable demo of x treme at e3 1996 and displayed a version of coffin s engine by this time team morale had dropped and turnover was high wallis claims that he fired an artist for not pulling his weight and for disrupting team by august coffin had contracted severe pneumonia wallis praised coffin s effort calling him a human dynamo but said that coffin had worked himself into ground and that team had no chance of meeting its deadline without him around same time senn became so ill that he was told he had six months to live though he survived with both teams crippled and only two months left before deadline wallis canceled game sega initially stated that x treme had been delayed but in early 1997 announced that it had been canceled for 1996 holiday season sega instead concentrated on sonic team s nights into dreams and a port of genesis game sonic 3d blast by traveller s tales which wallis contributed to sti developer peter requested that x treme be reworked into bonus stages in 3d blast but traveller s tales was unable to properly transfer sonic s model sonic team s work on a saturn 3d sonic game became sonic adventure for dreamcast remnants of their prototype can be seen in saturn compilation game sonic jam while senn felt version he and alon were developing could have been completed with an additional six to twelve months sega s pc division would not pay for its development and may have been hesitant to do so after engine had been rejected for x treme after project was rejected alon left sega sega of america disbanded sti in 1996 following management changes sti s roger hector believed that success of playstation led to corporate turmoil within sega that resulted in sti s dissolution according to wallis sti was restructured as sega of america s product development department after previous product development department had become segasoft film in august 1994 sega of america signed a deal with metro goldwyn mayer and trilogy entertainment to produce a live action animated film based on sonic hedgehog and tie into sonic x treme in may 1995 screenwriter richard jeffries pitched a treatment to sega titled sonic hedgehog wonders of world treatment saw sonic and dr robotnik escaping from sonic x treme into real world film was canceled as none of companies could come to an agreement legacy image sega saturn console set mk1 jpg thumb alt an image of a sega saturn with x treme s cancellation sega saturn had no original sonic hedgehog platform game sonic x treme s cancellation is cited as a key reason saturn failed while sega claimed up to 55 of console market in 1994 by august 1997 sony controlled 47 nintendo 40 and sega only 12 neither price cuts nor high profile game releases could save console saturn never received an exclusive sonic platform game instead it received a port of genesis game sonic 3d blast and sonic jam a compilation of past sonic games featuring a 3d level journalists and fans have speculated about impact x treme might have had had it been released david houghton of gamesradar described prospect of a good 3d sonic game on saturn as a what if situation on a par with dinosaurs not becoming extinct ign travis fahs described x treme as an empty vessel for sega s ambitions and hopes of their fans it was turning point not only for sega s mascot and their 32 bit console but for entire company levi buchanan also writing for ign stated that while lack of a true sonic sequel for saturn certainly didn t wholly destroy console s chances lack of appearances by sega mascot sure didn t help matters much dave zdyrko who operated a prominent saturn fan site said i don t know if x treme could ve saved saturn but sonic helped make genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn t a great new sonic title ready at or near launch of saturn in a 2007 retrospective producer wallis said that x treme definitely would have been competitive with nintendo s super mario 64 senn believed that a version of x treme built by him with alon s engine could have sold well next generation said that x treme would have damaged sega s reputation if it did not compare well to competition such as super mario 64 and crash bandicoot naka was dissatisfied with game in a 2012 interview he recalled being relieved when he learned it had been cancelled journalists also noted similarities in level themes and mechanics between x treme and 2013 game sonic lost world for years little content from x treme was released beyond promotional screenshots in 2006 a copy of an early test engine was sold at auction for us 2500 to an anonymous collector an animated gif image of gameplay was released and after a fundraising project by website community purchased disc from collector disk image was leaked on july 17 2007 senn opened sonic x treme compendium website and revealed large amounts of development history including early footage a playable character named tiara and concept music senn considered finishing x treme himself and used some of its concepts in a sonic fan game in february 2015 fans obtained sonic x treme source code and created
