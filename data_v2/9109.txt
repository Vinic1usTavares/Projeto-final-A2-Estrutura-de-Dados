mercury atlas 8 ma 8 was fifth united states crewed space mission part of nasa s mercury program astronaut walter m schirra jr orbited earth six times in sigma 7 spacecraft on october 3 1962 in a nine hour flight focused mainly on technical evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation this was longest u s crewed orbital flight yet achieved in space race though well behind several day record set by soviet vostok 3 earlier in year it confirmed mercury spacecraft s durability ahead of one day mercury atlas 9 mission that followed in 1963 planning began for third u s orbital mission in february 1962 aiming for a six or seven orbit flight to build on previous three orbit missions nasa officially announced mission on june 27 and flight plan was finalized in late july mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation mission finally launched on morning of october 3 having been delayed two weeks because of problems with atlas booster a series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in schirra s pressure suit were only technical problems noted during flight spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments after six orbits capsule landed in pacific ocean half a mile from recovery carrier and was hoisted aboard for schirra to disembark scientific results of mission were mixed astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low gravity environment observation of earth s surface proved unproductive however because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures public and political reaction was muted compared with that of earlier missions as cuban missile crisis soon eclipsed space race in news mission was a technical success all engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions and spacecraft used even less fuel than expected this confirmed capabilities of mercury spacecraft and allowed nasa to plan with confidence for a day long flight ma 9 which had been an early goal of mercury program crew backup crew mission parameters mass perigee 156 km apogee 285 km inclination 32 5deg period 88 91 min background by 1962 both united states and soviet union had flown two solo spaceflights in space race there was a widespread perception however that united states was falling behind its two missions had been suborbital and had lasted only a few minutes soviet missions had both orbited earth and second vostok 2 had remained in orbit for a full day using new high powered atlas booster coming orbital mercury missions were expected to reduce gap between two countries this new ocean p 411 nasa announced first two orbital missions at end of november 1961 shortly after mercury atlas 5 ma 5 test flight which had carried a chimpanzee and twice orbited earth ma 6 was planned as first orbital flight with john glenn as primary crew and scott carpenter as his backup follow up mission ma 7 was to be crewed by deke slayton with wally schirra as his backup this new ocean p 407 in february 1962 first draft planning began for ma 8 third orbital mission with a goal of six or seven orbits as an intermediate step towards a day long 18 orbit flight this new ocean p 462 decision to move to six orbits rather than seven was driven by mission rules on contingency recovery operations a seventh orbit would have required significant additional recovery forces to be able to reach capsule anywhere on its trajectory within eighteen hours six orbit profile had other effects on recovery plans optimum recovery point was moved to pacific ocean rather than atlantic this new ocean p 464 on march 15 1962 nasa announced that slayton was medically unfit and would be replaced by scott carpenter as prime crew for ma 7 mission this new ocean p 440 decision to replace him with carpenter rather than his official backup schirra was justified by large amount of training carpenter had managed while preparing for long delayed ma 6 mission this new ocean p 443 after success of ma 6 and ma 7 missions both of three orbits pressure began to mount to fly an extended mission on june 27 1962 nasa first announced its plan for upcoming ma 8 mission which would last for as many as six orbits schirra was named as prime crew for ma 8 with gordon cooper as his backup repeating backup one fly one pattern set by previous two missions this new ocean p 460 pattern would be repeated for ma 9 flown by cooper and planned but cancelled ma 10 which would have been flown by cooper s backup alan shepard soviet union had not flown any further flights by time ma 7 landed putting both sides of space race even at two orbital flights each while soviets had flown for longer mercury program was gaining momentum with a six orbit mission currently planned and press speculation about a one day mission this new ocean pp 459 460 however in mid august soviet union launched two orbital missions vostok 3 and vostok 4 within a day of each other two craft were in intersecting orbits but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively just under four and three days landing within a few minutes of each other on august 15 this was far ahead of anything currently planned for mercury and nasa quickly considered prospect of modifying a capsule to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability using technology being developed for gemini program however after examining time and safety implications of this proposal it was decided to abandon idea and continue with planned six orbit mission this new ocean pp 461 2 mission objectives thumb left schirra discussing flight plan with flight director chris kraft alt two men seated at a desk both reading from a large book younger man is holding original ma 8 flight plan was issued on july 27 although it was revised slightly in august and september it remained broadly unchanged until launch this was an improvement on situation with ma 7 which had had frequent and extensive alterations making it difficult for pilot to train efficiently aim was for flight to be an engineering oriented mission focusing on operation of spacecraft rather than on scientific experimentation to help pave way for a future long duration mission this new ocean p 461 schirra chose name sigma 7 for capsule in reflection of this focus using mathematical symbol for summation as appropriate for an engineering evaluation and 7 to refer to seven mercury astronauts this new ocean pp 470 71 thumb upright right sigma 7 in its hangar alt men in overalls clustered around base of an upright conical spacecraft which is two or three times taller than them inside a large room mission objectives involved evaluating performance of spacecraft over six orbits as well as effect of prolonged microgravity on pilot specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested and worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 1 flight control experiments included manually turning spacecraft around yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine how easy it was to control spacecraft attitude realignment of onboard gyroscopes in flight and leaving spacecraft to drift on orbit results of third u s manned orbital space flight pp 42 5 four non engineering scientific experiments were planned two requiring active involvement of astronaut and two completely passive first involved astronaut watching for four high powered flares while passing over woomera australia and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over durban south africa results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 8 second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of earth from orbit focusing on geological features and cloud patterns photographs were to be taken through a set of colored filters provided by u s weather bureau latter were intended to help calibrate spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features which in turn would help improve cameras on future weather satellites results of third u s manned orbital space flight pp 8 9 passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation sensitive photographic films from goddard space flight center and u s navy school of aviation medicine and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to outside of spacecraft to test their performance during re entry results of third u s manned orbital space flight pp 9 10 spacecraft modifications spacecraft and booster were almost identical to those used on two preceding mercury orbital flights spacecraft had heating blankets removed from motors to save weight and a sofar bomb was added this would be ejected at time main parachute was deployed and would help recovery crews find spacecraft after it landed results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 2 a number of modifications were made to reaction control system results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 3 and communications equipment was upgraded results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 4 atlas booster vehicle 113d had been modified since previous flight and now included baffled fuel injectors and a new hypergolic fuel igniter instead of original pyrotechnic igniter this would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on pad for a few moments there were considerable delays getting vehicle ready for flight it was supposed to be shipped to cape canaveral in july but after failing factory composite test at convair planned delivery of atlas was delayed a month results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 10 mission preparation thumb left mercury

157 atlas lv 3b booster assigned to mission no 113 d was accepted by nasa at convair plant on july 27 and delivered on august 8 grimwood p 169 after delayed arrival of booster at cape air force then revealed that two recent static firings of ma 3 engines had suffered turbopump failures and that explosion of atlas 11f one second after liftoff in april had been traced to a malfunction of sustainer turbopump all of these failures had occurred while sustainer hs valve was moving to open position and while running untested hardware modifications air force recommended that nasa conduct a static firing test of 113d just to be on safe side on september 6 tests were scheduled to continue until september 24 which allowed for a probable launch on october 3 this new ocean p 467 a static firing test on pad would expose sustainer turbopump to failure mode in question in meantime a fuel leak caused by a faulty weld in a piece of plumbing caused further delays static firing test was carried out on september p 170 and booster reported as ready for assembly on september 18 grimwood pp 171 2 concerns had been raised that radiation belt produced in orbit by recent operation dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to crewed space missions but an extensive study announced in early september declared that it was safe to fly while outside of capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 rontgens study concluded that shielding and effect of spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 rontgens experienced by astronaut well within established tolerance limits grimwood p 170 to put this in context an unprotected dose of 500 rontgens over a few hours would be easily fatal schirra began training for mission in early july logging 29 hours in simulators as well as 31 hours in spacecraft itself this included multiple systems tests and three simulated flights culminating in a six and a half hour simulated flight on september 29 with spacecraft and booster fully stacked on pad results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 40 highlights of training period included a visit from president john f kennedy on september 11 results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 39 mission was reported as ready to go except for weather on october 1 major concern with weather was a major tropical storm in atlantic though there were also worries over a series of typhoons in pacific which could pose a problem for recovery operations on evening of october 2 decision was taken to launch next morning this new ocean p 471 launch thumb upright launch of mercury atlas 8 alt a

schirra was awakened at 1 40 am et on morning of october 3 and after a hearty breakfast including a bluefish he had speared day before and a brief physical he left for launchpad at around 4 am this new ocean pp 471 2 he entered spacecraft at 4 41 am et where he found a steak sandwich left for him in glove compartment and began pre launch checks launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6 15 when there was a 15 minute hold to allow canary islands tracking station to repair a radar set this new ocean p 472 countdown resumed at 6 30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays liftoff proceeded smoothly but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff which reached 7 per second and approached 80 of required threshold to trigger asis abort system this new ocean p 473 this was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of main engines and was kept under control by booster s vernier thrusters sustainer engine thrust during launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in sustainer fuel system results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 11 around three and a half minutes into flight deke slayton capsule communicator cut in to ask schirra are you a turtle today schirra unfazed announced that he was switching to on board voice recorder rather than broadcast radio circuit to leave his answer mission communications transcript noted this as correct answer recorded results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 57 turtle club was a recurrent joke among astronaut corps on being challenged with this question correct response was you bet your sweet ass i am with a failure to give password being punishable by buying a round of drinks schirra noted later that he wasn t ready for all world to hear it and chose to use on board recorder to avoid saying answer over air schirra s space pp 91 92 because atlas was flying on a slightly lofted trajectory booster engines cut off 2 seconds earlier than planned but sustainer engine burned for about 10 seconds longer than intended giving an extra of velocity and putting spacecraft in a slightly higher orbit than planned initial analysis of trajectory confirmed that capsule could remain in a stable orbit for at least seven orbits ensuring there would be no need for an early de orbit results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 51 orbital activities after separating from atlas booster schirra stabilized spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into correct attitude he deliberately kept motion slow to conserve fuel and was able to position capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves he briefly tracked spent booster which was rotating slowly past but made no attempt to move towards it as spacecraft moved across atlantic he turned his attention to testing manual control of spacecraft which he found sloppy compared to fly by wire system this new ocean p 474 schirra noted after his flight that a rendezvous in orbit would certainly be possible given sufficient fuel and precise positioning information he would later go on to fly gemini 6a mission first successful close rendezvous of two spacecraft crossing over eastern coast of africa he began to feel overheated this problem was also apparent to ground controllers who were having a debate with flight surgeon over whether it was safe to continue or if mission should be ended after first orbit flight director christopher kraft followed surgeon s advice to see if problem would settle and gave go for a second orbit this new ocean p 474 schirra eventually stabilized problem over time slowly dialing suit s control knob to a high cooling setting this new ocean p 475 he compared heat to that of mowing a lawn in texas this new ocean p 476 over australia schirra watched for a flare launched from ground but it was occluded by clouds he was however able to see lightning and lit outline of brisbane through night pass over pacific he tested capsule s on board periscope though he found it difficult to use and quickly covered it up as soon as sun rose crossing over mexico he reported that he was in chimp configuration with capsule running entirely on automatic without any input from pilot and as he began his second orbit began testing a yaw maneuver using earth through main window as a reference rather than via much maligned periscope thumb left cumulus clouds photographed from orbit alt on second orbit he confirmed existence of glenn s fireflies shower of small bright particles first reported on ma 6 and during night section practiced yaw manoeuvres using first moon and then known stars as reference points second proved difficult to work with as small windows of mercury capsule gave a very limited field of view making it hard to identify constellations travelling across pacific he again fell back into automatic flight chatting with gus grissom at hawaiian tracking station about qualities of manual control system this new ocean pp 476 7 as he began third orbit schirra disconnected spacecraft s gyroscopes turned off part of electrical power system and let capsule drift he took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness and to eat a light meal he powered spacecraft back up over indian ocean and continued over pacific at hawaii he was given clearance for a full six orbit mission and as he crossed over towards california shut down electrical power for a second period of drifting flight during which he occupied himself taking photographs with onboard camera this new ocean p 478 on fourth orbit drifting in an inverted spacecraft with earth above him schirra continued his photography and attempted unsuccessfully to spot echo 1 satellite while passing over east africa as he approached california he spoke briefly to john glenn in a two minute conversation broadcast live across united states on radio and television problems began to recur with pressure suit with water condensing on faceplate schirra concerned about internal temperature avoided opening visor to clean it for fear that suit temperature would misbehave again this new ocean pp 479 80 thumb right view over south america on sixth orbit alt edge of earth heavily overexposed in lower half of image with black space above in between them a blue haze layer from atmosphere there is a lens flare in one corner by fifth orbit schirra had begun to relax commenting that it was first rest he had had since december 1961 he used a small bungee cord exercise device for a little bit of stretching before dropping into manual attitude control where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use over atlantic he returned to observation and photography he failed to spot planned high power light near durban in south africa due to cloud cover but did make out brightly lit city of port elizabeth over philippines he reported on his fuel status after four and a half of planned six orbits he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks this new ocean pp 480 1 passing over quito ecuador towards end of his fifth orbit schirra was asked by tracking station if he had any message to pass on in spanish to fellows down here and he made some comments on how beautiful country appeared from orbit ending with a cheery buenos dias y all results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 111 schirra later noted that he was furious at this point he was preparing for re entry and didn t want to be distracted with making public statements ref schirra s space p 88 ref sixth orbit was dominated by preparations for re entry though schirra was able to take a last set of photographs of south america and try another set of spatial orientation tests he armed retrorockets passing over western pacific and fired first one at 8 52 mission elapsed time automatic control system held capsule steady as a rock during this period though after retrorockets had stopped firing schirra noted that system had burned almost a quarter of its fuel in process this new ocean pp 481 82 reentry and recovery thumb right

in it is just behind spacecraft as spacecraft continued towards re entry after de orbit burn schirra used high power thrusters to put capsule in correct orientation noting that attitude control felt sloppy he then enabled rate stabilization control system an automatic control method which used up fuel at a very high rate to maintain control during re entry this was a specific engineering request and it dismayed schirra to see fuel he had for six orbits be used so quickly this new ocean p 482 local recovery group in prime target area in central pacific consisted of an aircraft carrier in center of landing area with three destroyers strung out along orbital path four search aircraft were also assigned to area and three recovery helicopters were based aboard kearsarge results of third u s manned orbital space flight p picked up capsule on radar while still from landing further up landing path destroyer reported a sonic boom as it passed overhead at schirra deployed drogue parachute and then main parachute at landing was surprisingly precise from target point and from kearsarge and schirra joked that he was on course for recovery carrier s number three elevator capsule hit water submerged and bobbed to surface again righting itself after about 30 seconds three pararescue swimmers were dropped by one of helicopters to help him climb out but schirra radioed that he would prefer to be towed to carrier and a whaleboat from kearsarge was sent with a line this new ocean pp 482 3 forty minutes after landing sigma 7 was hoisted aboard kearsarge five minutes later schirra blew explosive hatch and climbed out to a waiting crowd this new ocean p 484 after doing this examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating heavy ejector switch which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot gus grissom s hatch expulsion accident during liberty bell 7 mission grissom had maintained that hatch blew without his input fact that he had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown hatch early and sunk his capsule but that it was a mechanical malfunction schirra remained aboard for three days of medical tests and debriefing before disembarking while spacecraft was offloaded at midway island and transferred to an aircraft for further transport results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 22 it was returned to cape canaveral for analysis with long term intention of putting it on permanent display grimwood p 174 spent atlas booster re entered atmosphere on october 4 day after launch and burned up p 31 post flight post flight analysis reported no major malfunctions only troublesome anomaly being suit temperature controls and all engineering objectives of mission were deemed successfully completed fuel conservation measures were found to have worked particularly well with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed despite technical changes official report gave full credit for this to pilot results of third u s manned orbital space flight pp 3 4 medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of weightlessness and noted that schirra had received no significant radiation exposure results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 23 analysis of radiation sensitive plates confirmed that there had been a very low radioactive flux inside spacecraft boynton pp 74 75 further analysis was presented by hermann j schaeffer in proton dosimetry with nuclear on mercury missions ma 8 and ma 9 at twelfth annual meeting of radiation research society 1964 and six ablative materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other boynton pp 75 77 scientifically light observation experiments were unsuccessful as both target locations were covered by thick cloud cover however schirra was able to view lightning near woomera and noted lights of a city a few hundred miles from durban filtered photography for weather bureau worked as planned with 15 photographs taken conventional color photography was less successful with several of 14 photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess cloud cover results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 9 in end conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems boynton p 74 schirra noted that sheer amount of cloud coverage worldwide could provide problems for future activity of this kind however africa and south western united states were perfectly clear postflight medical examination of schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of hypotension caused by sitting inside cramped capsule for hours results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 52 schirra s post flight report noted fireflies seen on previous two missions and emphasized remarkable visual effect of thick band of atmosphere visible around horizon results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 53 however he was unimpressed with view of earth from space amount of detail he could make out compared well with that from high flying aircraft and he told that it was nothing new compared to flight at this new ocean p 477 overall he concluded that sigma 7 was on top of list of aircraft he had flown displacing f8f bearcat a naval piston engined fighter results of third u s manned orbital space flight p 55 bearcat was first fighter schirra had flown after training and he remembered it as not a plane you climb into rather you strap it on schirra s space p 24 while mission itself had been textbook first us crewed six pass orbital mission p 53 schirra gave a public lecture at rice university after returning to houston where he received a motorcade through city schirra s space p 91 however cuban missile crisis had been steadily escalating through september and helped drive discussion of schirra s successful flight down news schedules public concern about relative effectiveness of soviet and american space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over soviet military rockets this new ocean p 486 he visited washington d c to receive nasa distinguished service medal from president kennedy on october 16 same day kennedy had first seen u 2 photographs of missile sites in cuba meeting was friendly and informal despite circumstances robert kennedy schirra later noted took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career same way he had sounded out john glenn a year earlier unlike glenn however schirra politely turned suggestion down and chose to remain with nasa schirra s space p 92 his later career saw him commanding backup crew for first gemini mission then prime crew for 1965 gemini 6a mission where he flew first active rendezvous between two spacecraft earlier plans for it to conduct first on orbit docking had been cancelled and finally commanding first apollo mission apollo 7 in 1968 he retired from nasa in summer of 1969 only astronaut to fly on mercury gemini and apollo success of ma 8 made preparation for ma 9 considerably easier though it did cause some observers to suggest program should be ended abruptly in order to conclude on a clear note of success rather than risking another potentially catastrophic flight this new ocean pp 486 7 however this was not a view shared by nasa planners who had been pressing for a one day mercury mission since mid 1961 when it first began to seem technically feasible this new ocean p 487 to prepare spacecraft for a long duration mission involved trimming as much on board weight as possible to offset additional consumables required changes made to capsule hardware on ma 8 were now used to justify removal of of control equipment and of radio equipment as well as periscope which schirra had found so unhelpful in total there were 183 alterations listed between capsules for ma 8 and ma 9 missions this new ocean p 490 spacecraft was to be equipped with several cameras building on schirra s photographic work though weight and power limitations did restrict amount of scientific experiments that could be scheduled this new ocean pp 491 492 spacecraft location thumb right sigma 7 on display
