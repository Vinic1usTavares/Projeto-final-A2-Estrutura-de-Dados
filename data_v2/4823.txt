right of drawing on october 10 1848 galena and chicago union railroad chicago s first railroad began operating out of a depot on west side of chicago river near corner of canal and kinzie streets though city of chicago had authorized railroad to construct a bridge across north branch of river as early as july 17 1848 it was not until 1851 that railroad began to purchase land needed to build wells street station to east of river in order to access new station a floating pontoon bridge designed by jenks d perkins was built across north branch at roughly same location as earlier pedestrian bridge this bridge first railroad bridge in chicago was completed in 1852 historic american engineering record historian justin m spivey notes that 1852 pontoon bridge may have been short lived as a bird s eye view of chicago published in 1857 shows what appears to be a swing bridge crossing river at this location see and allowing trains to access railroad s new wells street station and subsequently industry on north bank of chicago river as far as ogden slip and navy pier original railroad bridge was replaced by a swing bridge in 1879 that along with glasgow railroad bridge across missouri river was one of united states first all steel railroad bridges this bridge was constructed from bessemer steel which proved too brittle and so bridge was replaced again in 1898 replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position allowing old structure to be removed and new one put in place in 27 1 2 hours on march 13 and march 14 1898 bascule bridge thumb left alt black and white drawing showing a plan of chicago river and bridges 1897 plan of north branch of chicago river showing close proximity of three bridges at kinzie street and obstruction that they created in river river traffic and railroad traffic were increasingly in competition with each other in october 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time ending up with its front wheels hanging off approach road over river meanwhile boats on river were getting larger and finding it increasingly difficult to navigate bridges at mouth of north branch so army corps of engineers ordered clearing of three swing bridges near kinzie street that were obstructing river traffic therefore in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on river design and construction thumb right alt drawing of kinzie bridge showing three stages of opening bridge schematic of kinzie street railroad bridge bridge is designed to carry two railroad tracks across river its superstructure consists of two spans constructed by strauss bascule concrete bridge company a plate girder span on west bank of river and movable main span that rests on east trunnion pier size and weight of main span which when completed would be world s longest and heaviest bascule span required trunnion pier to be constructed on foundations that extend to bedrock below river bed to achieve this caissons were sunk to a depth of below river bed and then diameter wells were sunk remaining substructure of bridge was constructed by great lakes dredge and dock company usage chicago and north western railway originally planned for two bridges side by side that could carry four railroad tracks into wells street station however by time that first bridge opened on september 19 1908 an alternative scheme was already underway that led to closure of wells street station and its replacement with a new terminal on west bank of river when new chicago and northwestern terminal at 500 madison street now ogilvie transportation center opened in 1911 kinzie street railroad bridge was left to handle freight traffic only in 1930 merchandise mart was opened on site of old wells street station merchandise mart was built on air rights of chicago and north western and in spring of 1932 railroad opened a new freight house underneath building that was designed to handle of outbound and of inbound freight per day abandonment during second half of 20th century number of companies using railroad for shipping on chicago s near north side declined severely in 1970s customers at east end of line included curtiss candy factory and jardine water purification plant construction of columbus drive bridge in 1982 wiped out part of right of way and spur to navy pier was abandoned service to tribune tower also ended in 1980s and by 1990s traffic along remaining section of spur served only one customer chicago sun times with only one train per day newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across bridge and it has since been permanently raised in open position on december 12 2007 bridge was one of 12 historic chicago railroad bridges to be designated as chicago landmarks proposals for reuse tests were conducted in 1953 to see if spur could be used as a part of a commuter line with stops at merchandise mart state street and michigan avenue but plan was dropped in 1954 for financial reasons in 1970s architect harry suggested a light rail line along spur to connect chicago s downtown stations with river north neighborhoods in 2008 city of chicago department of transportation commissioned an alternatives analysis to look at a proposal to create a transit link from union station and ogilvie transportation center to michigan avenue using union pacific train tunnel running under apparel center merchandise mart and other buildings east toward north michigan avenue proposed carroll avenue transitway would include retrofitting of kinzie street railroad bridge to carry buses or trams see
