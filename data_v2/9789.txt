thumb right 180px title page to 1773 expanded edition plays of william shakespeare was an 18th century edition of dramatic works of william shakespeare edited by samuel johnson and george steevens johnson announced his intention to edit shakespeare s plays in his miscellaneous observations on macbeth 1745 and a full proposal for edition was published in 1756 edition was finally published in 1765 in preface to his edition johnson justifies trying to determine original language of shakespearean plays to benefit reading audience he added explanatory notes to various passages later editors followed johnson s lead and sought to determine an authoritative text of shakespeare background thumb right 180px samuel johnson one of editors johnson began reading shakespeare s plays and poetry when he was a young boy he would involve himself so closely with plays that he was once terrified by ghost in hamlet and had to have people about him johnson s fascination with shakespeare continued throughout his life and johnson focused his time on shakespeare s plays while preparing a dictionary of english language so it is no wonder that shakespeare is most quoted author in it johnson came to believe that there was a problem with collections of shakespearean plays that were available during his lifetime he believed that they lacked because they were transcribed for players by those who may be supposed to have seldom understood them they were transmitted by equally who still multiplied errors they were perhaps sometimes mutilated by actors for sake of shortening speeches and were at last printed without correction of press although johnson was friends with actors such as david garrick who had performed shakespeare onstage he did not believe that performance was vital to plays nor did he ever acknowledge presence of an audience as a factor in reception of work instead johnson believed that reader of shakespeare was true audience of play furthermore johnson believed that later editors both misunderstood historical context of shakespeare and his plays and underestimated degree of textual corruption that plays exhibit he believed that this was because style of shakespeare was in itself perplexed ungrammatical and obscure to correct these problems johnson believed that original works would need to be examined and this became an issue in his proposal johnson also believed that an edition of shakespeare could provide him with income and recognition that he needed however a full edition of shakespeare would require a publisher to make a large commitment of time and money so johnson decided to begin by focusing on a single play macbeth miscellaneous observations thumb right title page of miscellaneous observations first edition johnson began work on macbeth to provide a sample of what he thought could be achieved in a new edition of shakespeare he got much of his information while working on harleian catalogue a catalogue of collection of works and pamphlets owned by robert harley 1st earl of oxford and earl mortimer he published this work along with a commentary on sir thomas hanmer 4th baronet s edition of shakespeare s plays as miscellaneous observations or miscellaneous observations on tragedy of macbeth on 6 april 1745 by edward cave hanmer produced an edition of shakespeare s plays for clarendon press in october 1744 and johnson felt that he could attract more attention to his own work by challenging some of hanmer s points johnson criticised hanmer for editing shakespeare s words based on subjective opinion instead of objective fact in particular johnson writes he appears to find no difficulty in most of those passages which i have represented as unintelligible and has therefore passed smoothly over them without any attempt to alter or explain them such harmless industry may surely be forgiven if it cannot be praised may he therefore never want a monosyllable who can use it with such wonderful dexterity if anyone is going to burst with envy let him do so martial he then continues rest of this edition i have not read but from little that i have seen i think it not dangerous to declare that in my opinion its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy there is no distinction made between ancient reading and innovations of editor there is no reason given for any of alterations which are made emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement and few of difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed readers of shakespeare miscellaneous observations contains many of johnson s early thoughts and theories on shakespeare for instance johnson thought that there was an uncanny power in shakespeare s supernatural scenes and wrote he that peruses shakespeare looks round alarmed and starts to find himself alone at end of work johnson announced that he would produce a new edition of shakespeare proposals for printing a new edition of plays of william shakespeare with notes critical and explanatory in which text will be corrected various readings remarked of former editors examined and their omissions supplied by author of miscellaneous observations on tragedy of macbeth in response jacob tonson and his associates who controlled copyright of current edition of shakespeare threatened to sue johnson and cave in a letter written on 11 april 1745 they did so to protect their new edition edited by shakespeare scholar william warburton proposal thumb right title page of proposal first edition on 1 june 1756 johnson reprinted his miscellaneous observations but attached his proposal or proposals for printing by subscription works of william shakespeare corrected and illustrated on 2 june 1756 he signed a contract to edit an eight volume set of shakespeare s writings including a preface and on 8 june 1756 johnson printed his proposal now called proposals for an edition of shakespeare proposal sold subscriptions for johnson s future edition at cost of two guineas first paid before and second upon printing when johnson achieved scholarly renown for his a dictionary of english language warburton s publishers tonson et al granted him permission to work on shakespeare in proposal johnson describes various problems with previous editions of shakespeare and argues how a new edition written by himself would correct these problems in particular johnson promised to correct what is corrupt and to explain what is obscure he would accomplish this by relying on a careful collation of all oldest copies and to read same story in very book which shakespeare consulted unlike other editors who slight their predecessors johnson claimed that all that is valuable will be adopted from every commentator that posterity may consider it as including all rest and exhibiting whatever is hitherto known of great father of english drama later in work he promised that it would be ready by december 1757 johnson was contracted to finish edition in 18 months but as months passed his pace slowed he told charles burney in december 1757 that it would take him until following march to complete it before that could happen in february 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of ps40 debt was soon repaid by tonson who had contracted johnson to publish work this motivated johnson to finish edition to repay favour although it took him another seven years to finish johnson completed a few volumes of his shakespeare to prove his commitment to project johnson s shakespeare johnson admitted to john hawkins my inducement to it is not love or desire of fame but want of money which is only motive to writing that i know of however money was not a strong enough motivator and in 1758 partly as a way to avoid having to finish his shakespeare johnson began to write a weekly series idler which ran from 15 april 1758 to 5 april 1760 thumb left 180px contract for shakespeare s plays by 1762 johnson had gained a reputation for being a slow worker contemporary poet charles churchill teased johnson for delay in producing his long promised edition of shakespeare he for subscribers baits his hook and takes your cash but where s book comments soon stung johnson into renewed work it was only in 20 july 1762 when he received first payment on a government pension of 300 pounds a year that he no longer had to worry about money and was finally able to dedicate most of his time to finishing work on 10 january 1765 day after johnson was introduced to henry and hester thrale johnson noted in his diary that he corrected a sheet afterwards he began visiting his friend richard farmer who was writing his essay on learning of shakespeare to aid in his completely revising work during this time johnson added more than 550 notes as he began to revise work for publication in june johnson advertised that his edition would be published on 1 august 1765 however he was unable to work on preface until august and it was not printed until 29 september george steevens volunteered to help johnson work on preface during this time johnson s edition of shakespeare s plays was finally published on 10 october 1765 as plays of william shakespeare in eight volumes to which are added notes by sam johnson in a printing of 1 000 copies edition sold quickly and a second edition was soon printed with an expanded edition to follow in 1773 and a further revised edition in 1778 preface thumb right title page of preface first edition there are four components to johnson s preface to shakespeare a discussion of shakespeare s greatness especially in his portrayal of human nature faults or weakness of shakespeare shakespeare s plays in relationship to contemporary poetry and drama and a history of shakespearean criticism and editing down to mid 1700 s and what his work intends to do johnson begins that praises are without reason lavished on dead and that honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity is a complaint likely to be always continued by those who being able to add nothing to truth hope for eminence from heresies of paradox or those who being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients are willing to hope from posterity what present age refuses and flatter themselves that regard which is yet denied by envy will be at last bestowed by time antiquity like every other quality that attracts notice of mankind has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it not from reason but from prejudice some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved without considering that time has sometimes co operated with chance all perhaps are more willing to honour past than present excellence and mind contemplates genius through shades of age as eye surveys sun through artificial opacity great contention of criticism is to find faults of moderns and beauties of ancients while an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance and when he is dead we rate them by his best to works however of which excellence is not absolute and definite but gradual and comparative to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and but appealing wholly to observation and experience no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem what mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared and if they persist to value possession it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour as among works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high without knowledge of many mountains and many rivers so in productions of genius nothing can be excellent till it has been compared with other works of same kind demonstration immediately displays its power and has nothing to hope or fear from flux of years but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to general and collective ability of man as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours of first building that was raised it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect but poems of homer we yet know not to transcend common limits of human intelligence but by remarking that nation after nation and century after century has been able to do little more than transpose his incidents new name his characters and paraphrase his sentiments reverence due to writings that have long subsisted arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in superior wisdom of past ages or gloomy persuasion of degeneracy of mankind but is consequence of acknowledged and positions that what has been longest known has been most considered and what is most considered is best understood johnson then introduces shakespeare poet of whose works i have undertaken revision may now begin to assume dignity of an ancient and claim privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration he has long outlived his century term commonly fixed as test of literature merit whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions local customs or temporary opinions have for many years been lost and every topic of merriment or motive of sorrow which modes of artificial life afforded him now only obscure scenes which they once illuminated effects of favour and competition are at an end tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished his works support no opinion with arguments nor supply any faction with they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity but are read without any other reason than desire of pleasure and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained yet thus unassisted by interest or passion they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners and as they devolved from one generation to another have received new honours at every transmission plays johnson in his proposal said that corruptions of text will be corrected by a careful collation of oldest copies accordingly johnson attempted to obtain early texts of plays but many people were unwilling to lend him their editions out of a fear that they might be destroyed david garrick offered johnson access to his collection of shakespeare texts but johnson declined offer believing that garrick would expect preferential treatment in return johnson s strength was to create a set of corresponding notes that allow readers to identify meaning behind many of shakespeare s more complicated passages or ones that may have been transcribed incorrectly over time included within notes are occasional attacks upon rival editors of shakespeare s works and their editions in 1766 steevens published his own edition of shakespeare s plays that was designed to transcend johnson s in proceeding further towards a sound text but it lacked benefit of johnson s critical notes two worked together to create a revised edition of shakespeare s plays in ten volumes published in 1773 with additional corrections in 1778 steevens provided most of textual work with johnson contributing an additional eighty notes critical response after johnson was forced to back down from producing his edition of shakespeare in 1746 his rival editor william warburton praised johnson s miscellaneous observations as some critical notes on macbeth given as a specimen of a projected edition and written as appears by a man of parts and genius years later edmond malone an important shakespearean scholar and friend of johnson s said that johnson s vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more light on his authour than all his predecessors had done and that preface was finest composition in our language adam smith said that preface was most manly piece of criticism that was ever published in any country in 1908 walter raleigh claimed that johnson helped reader to go straight to shakespeare s meaning while philological and antiquarian commentators kill one another in dark raleigh then admitted that he soon falls into habit when he meets with an obscure passage of consulting johnson s note before others t s eliot wrote that no poet can ask more of posterity than to be greatly honoured by great and johnson s words about shakespeare are great honour walter jackson bate in his 1977 biography on johnson wrote edition of shakespeare viewed with historical understanding of what it involved in 1765 could seem a remarkable feat and we are not speaking of just great preface to see it in perspective we have only to remind ourselves what johnson brought to it an assemblage of almost every qualification we should ideally like to have brought to this kind of work with single exception of patience operating in and through these qualities was his own extensive knowledge of human nature and life no shakespearean critic or editor has ever approached him in this respect john wain another of johnson s biographers claimed there is no better statement of reason why shakespeare needs to be edited and what aims an editor can reasonably set himself than johnson s proposal notes references external links
