action of 28 february 1799 was a minor naval engagement of french revolutionary wars fought off mouth of hooghly river in bay of bengal between french frigate forte and royal navy frigate hms sybille forte was an exceptionally large and powerful ship engaged on a commerce raiding operation against british merchant shipping off port of calcutta in british india to eliminate this threat sybille was sent from madras in pursuit acting on information from released prisoners edward cooke captain of sybille was sailing off balasore when distant gunfire alerted him to presence of forte on evening of 28 february french frigate was discovered at anchor in sandbanks at mouth of hooghly with two recently captured british merchant ships for unclear reasons french captain hubert le loup de beaulieu did not properly prepare forte to receive attack from cooke s frigate and he was consequently killed in first raking broadside from british ship crew continued to resist for more than two hours only surrendering when their ship had been reduced to a battered wreck and more than a third of crew killed or wounded british losses by contrast were light although cooke had been struck by grape shot during height of action and suffered a lingering death three months later from his wounds captured merchant ships subsequently escaped under their french prize crews while cooke s executive officer lieutenant lucius hardyman repaired sybille and forte hardyman took both ships into calcutta where forte was commissioned into royal navy under same name although frigate was accidentally wrecked in red sea two years later background in spring of 1796 royal navy enjoyed naval supremacy in east indies french navy presence limited to two frigates loosely blockaded in port louis on ile de france parkinson p 75 in april 1796 reinforcements were sent from rochefort comprising four frigates commanded by contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey parkinson p 98 squadron avoided blockade and arrived at ile de france in july and sailed eastwards during summer intending to raid british trading ports in east indies on 9 september squadron was intercepted and driven off by a british squadron off northeastern coast of sumatra sheltering in batavia over winter clowes p 503 in january sercey sailed once more encountering on 28 january in bali strait a fleet of six east indiamen bound to china from colombo in ensuing bali strait incident british commander managed to deceive sercey into believing that fleet was made up of warships french admiral retreating back to ile de france parkinson p 106 sercey s flagship during these operations was 40 gun frigate forte forte commanded by elderly captain hubert le loup de beaulieu had been built in 1794 based on hull and frame of a ship of line frigate weighed 1 400 tons bm largest purpose built frigate at sea main battery of forte consisted of 28 24 pounder long guns only second frigate ever built after pomone which could manage such a heavy armament james p 326 this was augmented by fourteen 8 pounder long guns on upper deck and eight 36 pounder carronades on quarterdeck totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1 pounder swivel guns uniquely sides of ship were lined with cork matting to prevent splinters while more common precaution had been taken of stringing netting over deck to protect crew from falling debris james p 329 ship was however weakened by an ill disciplined crew and sercey had expressed doubts about ability of aged beaulieu clowes p 520 after sercey returned to ile de france his squadron broke up four ships were sent back to france in 1797 and 1798 as ile de france could no longer supply repairs manpower or provisions in support of sercey parkinson p 121 this dispersal of squadron was encouraged by colonial assembly of ile de france and governor malartic neither of whom were well disposed to directory then ruling france with his remaining crews becoming rebellious sercey sent forte and prudente on a commerce raiding operation during autumn of 1798 during which they achieved some success in bay of bengal parkinson p 123 by time this force returned to ile de france sercey had sailed to batavia leaving instructions for forte and prudente to follow him malartic countermanded this order seizing prudente and selling frigate to a privateer concern and ordering forte to operate independently in bay of bengal in autumn of 1798 sercey was furious but could do nothing to alter malartic s arrangements at start of 1799 bay of bengal was largely undefended british naval commander rear admiral peter rainier had taken most of his ships westwards to red sea to participate in opposition to napoleon bonaparte s campaign in egypt leaving only a single frigate to protect trade shipping in region parkinson p 139 this ship was 40 gun hms sybille a large powerful ship captured from french at battle of mykonos in 1794 clowes p 486 weighing more than 1 000 tons bm and with a maindeck battery of 28 18 pounder long guns supplemented by six 9 pounder long guns and fourteen 32 pounder cannonades sybille was a formidable ship but significantly weaker than massive forte many of sybille s crew had fallen ill while ship had been stationed at calcutta leaving her undermanned to compensate crew had been augmented by a detachment from frigate hms fox and soldiers from scotch brigade henderson p 55 in command was captain edward cooke who had distinguished himself early in war by negotiating surrender of french mediterranean port city of toulon in 1793 this action under threat of execution by republican faction in city led to siege of toulon and destruction of almost half of french mediterranean fleet clowes p edward oxford dictionary of national biography j k

devastating usual raiding season had passed and shipping transiting mouth of hooghly river was unprepared for beaulieu s assault parkinson p 124 in rapid succession forte seized local trading country

major convoy from cape colony escorted only by hms sceptre canton east indiamen endeavour and lord mornington were taken off balasore on 28 february after coming under fire from forte s bow chasers gunfire attracted attention of sybille which was returning to calcutta after transporting lord mornington governor general of india to madras sybille had sailed on 19 february with instructions to search for forte james p 325 on 23 february cooke had encountered a cartel sent to madras by beaulieu and brought ship into balasore on 26 february at 20 30 while sailing to southeast flashes were seen on northeast horizon although this was initially dismissed as lightning it continued until 21 00 convincing cooke that it had another cause turning to northeast he took sybille to investigate james p 327 at 21 30 forte and captured merchant ships were visible from sybille forte brilliantly illuminated in tropical night cooke brought sybille westwards in order to take weather gage before wearing and bearing down on french ship under a light wind from southwest henderson p 58 despite illumination on french ship sybille s sails were clearly identified on forte but beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action he seems to have thought that sails belonged to an approaching east indiaman despite concerns of his officers or that he wished to lure sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in coming engagement at approximately midnight forte slowly moved to lee of sybille firing a small broadside at long range at british ship s bow accompanied by scattered fire from french prize crews on merchant ships apart from damage to jib sibylle remained unharmed advancing silently and in darkness lardas p 67 french fire continued with little effect allowing cooke to bring sybille within of stern of forte at 12 45 and fire a raking broadside followed by a second as british ship pulled alongside french frigate cannon were complemented by musketry from soldiers aboard which swept exposed deck of forte damage to french ship was catastrophic guns were smashed from their carriages and dozens of men killed and more wounded dead including beaulieu and his first lieutenant henderson p 59 despite their losses french survivors returned to remaining guns although most of their first broadside scattered into sea and at least some of their shot was misdirected towards merchant ships french gunners aimed too high however most of their shot tearing through rigging of sybille while british broadsides slammed into hull of forte this problem was partly attributed to french gun quoins which had been three days earlier exacerbated by lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of guns were unmanned clowes p 521 french gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at point blank range james p 330 for next hour and a half frigates poured shot into one another at close range until cooke was struck by grape shot at 01 30 on 1 march replaced by his first lieutenant lucius hardyman for another hour action continued french fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02 30 by which time only four french guns remained operational hardyman hailed to ask whether forte had surrendered but french did not reply and he ordered another broadside a second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair rigging on forte james p 328 concerned that french were attempting to escape hardyman concentrated his fire on masts of forte bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03 00 forte was completely dismasted lardas p 68 with all resistance ended british merchant prisoners on board forte emerged from below decks and hailed sybille requesting a boat be sent across so that british lieutenant nicholas manger could formally take surrender of french ship combatant summary in this table guns refers to all cannon

been beaten in by gunfire as more than 300 shot holes combined to form gaping holes in hull above waterline as well as masts bulkheads had been smashed apart and all deck furniture blasted to splinters 65 of crew had been killed including captain beaulieu and approximately 80 wounded more than a third of crew listed as casualties many of wounded later died from effects of amputation damages to sybille were considerably lighter only six shot had struck hull in entire battle one gun was dismounted but worst damage was to cooke s cabin where a round shot had destroyed most of his furniture in addition most of damage to masts and rigging proved superficial just five crew were killed outright with another 17 wounded latter including cooke british captain had been struck in left arm shot exiting near his spine with additional injuries to chest and right arm james p 333 he eventually died after a long and agonising deterioration at calcutta on 25 may 1799 and was buried under a monument with full military honours a memorial was subsequently placed in westminster abbey in his memory parkinson p 129 in initial aftermath of victory hardyman attempted to lure captured merchant ships close to sybille by raising french tricolor over british ensign lord mornington took bait and closed with british ship however when sybille gave chase prizes fled fatigued british crew unable to effectively pursue after losing their damaged cross jack yard forte had lost its anchors in battle and was consequently lashed to sybille repairs to combatants took two days particularly fitting of jury masts on forte before hardyman was comfortable making journey up hooghly to calcutta for more permanent repairs hardyman was commended for victory promoted to commander and then later post captain forte was subsequently taken into service in royal navy under same name as a 44 gun fifth rate frigate with hardyman in command james p 332 forte continued in service in indian ocean under hardyman until june 1801 when frigate was wrecked on arabian red sea coast near jeddah grocott p 112 nearly five decades after battle admiralty recognised action with clasp sybille 28 february 1799 attached to naval general service medal awarded upon application to all british participants still living in 1847 battle has been considered by british historians as an unusual engagement marked by extremely disciplined fire from sybille product of unusually extensive gunnery training by cooke and complemented by musket fire of soldiers which affected accuracy of french gunners henderson p 60 naval historian william james wrote that action of sibylle sic and forte was gallantly fought on both sides but skilfully fought on one side only weaker side and by due exercise of that skill one which was ultimately successful james p 331 citations references category naval battles of french revolutionary wars category conflicts in 1799 category naval battles involving france category naval
