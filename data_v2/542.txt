handheld video game console market before being marginalized by nintendo s game boy advance retrospective feedback praises potential of wonderswan despite its low sales and its brief time holding its own against nintendo in marketplace history founded in 1950 by yamashina bandai was originally a manufacturer of toy cars and plastic models but became a major player in toy industry through licensing of popular anime characters beginning with in 1963 in 1970s bandai manufactured both lcd games based on television programs and dedicated consoles in 1982 company released intellivision in japan and in 1985 it became one of first third party licensees on family computer however company s greatest success in electronic games however was virtual pet first released in 1996 despite plans for bandai to merge with sega to form sega bandai ltd in 1997 merger was called off suddenly bandai s board of directors decided to oppose merger less than a week after approving it and sega in turn decided to accept bandai s actions at an emergency board meeting later that day bandai president makoto yamashina took responsibility for failing to gain support of his company for merger as a result bandai entered market without outside support engineer gunpei yokoi is known for creating game boy handheld system at nintendo after failure of virtual boy however he left company in 1996 in order to create his own engineering firm koto laboratory it was then that bandai approached yokoi to create wonderswan to compete with game boy yokoi was involved in development of new handheld but died in 1997 in a car accident before it was released wonderswan was officially unveiled in tokyo on october 8 1998 bandai chose name of system to highlight its aesthetics and technical capabilities because swan is

for special two tone editions despite nintendo s release of game boy color five months before bandai remained confident that wonderswan and its monochromatic screen would perform well because original black and white game boy had previously been more successful than its color screen competitors sega game gear and atari lynx on basis of its battery life and quality of its game library with a retail price wonderswan was also cheaper than its competition in 2000 bandai signed an agreement with mattel to bring handheld to north america but ultimately decided against a western release exact reason for this is unknown but crowded handheld video game console market has been suggested as a factor later that year bandai announced which would incorporate a color screen while retaining backward compatibility with original wonderswan it was released on december 9 2000 in japan and was available in pearl blue pearl pink crystal black crystal blue and crystal orange launch was a moderate success with system selling 270 632 units in under a month after its release before wonderswan color could be released however nintendo announced game boy advance which featured superior hardware wonderswan color still retailed at a lower price point at compared to advance at but despite peaking at 8 of handheld market share in japan wonderswan s sales never recovered after game boy advance reached store shelves in march 2001 a redesign of wonderswan color titled was released in japan on july 12 2002 for less than game boy advance once again bandai held a poll on its website to determine casing colors and released system in blue violet wine red crystal blue and crystal black despite its low price and an improved lcd screen swancrystal was unable to compete so bandai announced discontinuation of wonderswan line in 2003 due to low demand and backed out of producing video game hardware altogether in all handheld sold 3 5 million units of which 1 55 million were of original

library thumb right a screenshot of gunpey for original wonderswan gunpey was named for gunpei yokoi developer of system koto laboratories claims that wonderswan sold 10 million game cartridges in all in developing games for wonderswan bandai leveraged assistance of several developers banpresto part owned by bandai at time added support by way of anime licenses and licensed titles while namco and capcom also developed titles for handheld squaresoft contributed remakes of final fantasy final fantasy ii and final fantasy iv which later also came to game boy advance taito contributed well received ports such as space invaders and de go bandai augmented these releases with games of its own including exclusive titles in digimon and gundam franchises to compete with tetris gunpei yokoi developed a puzzle game for system ultimately named gunpey in his honor a sequel known as gunpey ex was a launch title for wonderswan color certain games produced through wonderwitch kit such as judgment have also been noted as excellent titles support for wonderswan has been considered underwhelming although some well known third party developers supported console most publishers continued to exclusively support nintendo s handhelds departure of squaresoft as a developer and its return to nintendo has been cited as a factor in wonderswan s diminishing sales in later years after discontinuation of wonderswan in 2003 several developers ported wonderswan games to game boy advance reception selling 3 5 million units wonderswan only picked up 8 of marketshare in japan and was ultimately outperformed by nintendo s game boy advance due to its brightly colored screen and deep game library game boy advance ensured nintendo would have a near monopoly on handheld console market in japan until release of playstation portable by sony in 2004 retrospective feedback to handheld praises its accomplishments but defines it as a niche device that appeals to only certain gamers writing for usgamer jeremy parish considers wonderswan ultimate expression of gunpei yokoi s design philosophy and notes its modest impact on market but blames bandai for its lack of success stating while wonderswan ultimately will be remembered as a highly localized blip in history of handheld games as a platform it genuinely held its own system s obscurity resulted more from poor timing and bandai s strangely meek strategy not from any inherent flaws in design of machine itself parish also goes on to hypothesize on lack of a wonderswan release in north america stating given how hard it was to find neo geo pocket systems and games at u s retail it s hard to imagine they were clamoring for yet another niche portable from japan luke plunkett from kotaku praised wonderswan s challenge to nintendo stating t tried some pretty unique and interesting things and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed retro gamer s kim wild criticizes some aspects of handheld including its lack of a headphone and ac port as well as its poor control scheme for left handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with headphone adapter connected wild offers some praise for handheld however stating what bandai managed with wonderswan was impressive given competition low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration notes references external
