titled my family with mohanlal in lead nr 8 july 2013 in august 2013 jeethu clarified that film was titled drishyam a thread similar to that of drishyam has been with director since early 1990s he was inspired by a conversation he had overheard about plight of two families involved in a legal battle 24 december 2013 jeethu had penned story of drishyam even before memories 2013 deepa gauri 26 september 2013 he says i started working on subject some two years back but i wanted to stick to planned order and hence postponed project till i finished memories 5 september 2013 script was initially planned to be filmed by another director but since that director could not find a producer jeethu took back script and decided to direct it himself mythily ramachandran 26 december 2013 drishyam contrasts from director s previous films he says different films require different treatment i toiled hard while filming memories as film was full of twists and turns and handling of subject mattered a lot but drishyam is a complete script oriented film that does not require any special effort we shot film sticking completely to script and shooting was completed effortlessly parvathy 19 december 2013 casting jeethu had initially approached mammootty to play lead but he was unable to commit and asked jeethu to proceed with film with another actor according to director mammootty was instrumental in casting actress meena for film director in an interview with new indian express stated that he wrote screenplay with mohanlal in mind and that character was tailor made for mohanlal he

director stated i had two three actors in mind but at last decided to pick shajon i was very clear that i did not want anyone who has played negative characters so far to do role shajon was a total revelation roshan basheer who debuted through plus two 2010 was chosen after conducting a screen test prithviraj was rumored to play a cameo role though this was denied by jeethu asha sarath was later

shown in film which was a major location is situated at near thodupuzha shooting had to be halted for a while as meena fainted on location drishyam was initially planned to be filmed in 52 days though it was completed in 44 days themes a reviewer from hindu noted film takes off as a typical family drama first half of film is intentionally slow paced and shows to audience lighter moments in family of georgekutty this half combines elements of drama and comedy genres audience gets completely absorbed in twist of events that begin to unfold from end of first half second half is more like a thriller and is about how family despite vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop stands its ground even as law takes its course when asked whether this change in narrative style post interval was intentional jeethu replied i really don t understand when people say first half lacked pace a story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig zag away capturing all ups and downs of our lives right from start if you accelerate pace sooner or later story telling will lose its steam when asked whether he had kicked off a new genre in malayalam family thriller a genre which combines elements of a family drama and thriller jeethu replied i still believe it belongs to genre drama not a thriller he also stated in another interview we usually brand a film as a thriller simply because there is some mystery in narrative or story unfolds through an investigation but i don t subscribe to this although there are some twists in tale and some suspense as well drishyam is essentially story of a family film has also been said to be inspired by devotion of suspect x a japanese novel written by keigo ekta kapoor who had purchased hindi movie rights of novel sent a legal notice to makers of film however director clarified after ekta s legal team sent us letter i watched japanese film suspect x which is an adaptation of japanese novel there could be similarities between my film and that japanese film but my film is neither an adaptation nor a copy japanese film is also about a murder cover up and hence allegation similarities are quite common in works of creators and that shouldn t be made into an issue rashomon 1950 was also cited as an inspiration for film film was criticised for use of some sexist dialogues in first half which were playing to a certain new generation audience sowmya rajendran of sify criticised same and stated about one of such scenes in film it is such banter which we often dismiss with a laugh that helps perpetuate rape culture when asked about this director replied i firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives i don t want to elaborate but it also throws an insight into each character featured in sequences yes frankly i was a bit worried how family audience would react to those scenes but then i read out that part of script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval there were also allegations that drishyam might provoke murder additional director general of police claimed that two people accused of murdering a woman from in february 2014 admitted that their methods for disposing of victim s body and mobile phone sim card were influenced by film murder of a young girl in by her father and his mistress was also said to be influenced by drishyam soundtrack
