set since airing grift of magi has received generally mixed to negative reception from critics while reviewing eleventh season of simpsons dvd movie guide s colin jacobson commented that episode feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers those aren t exactly rich insights so grift of magi comes across as a below average episode in his review of dvd christmas with simpsons digitally obsessed critic joel cunningham wrote that episode comes from season 11 well past point when series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor unless you don t think evil toy marketers sentient and gary coleman qualify anyway after school nearly goes bankrupt principal skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use kids to conduct market research there are some good gags but story doesn t hang together very well adam tyner of dvd talk argued that episode has a couple of good gags gary coleman chatting on phone being my favorite but is quickly forgettable brian james of popmatters described coleman s cameo as hysterical in 2004 and meghan of same
