pennsylvania class consisted of two super dreadnought battleships built for united states navy just before first world war ships were named and after american states of same names they constituted united states second battleship design to adhere to all or nothing armor scheme and were newest american capital ships when united states entered first world war s represented a marked increase in united states dreadnought technology and pennsylvania class was intended to continue this with slight increases in ships capabilities including two additional 45 caliber guns and improved underwater protection class was second standard type battleship class to join us navy along with preceding nevada and succeeding and classes in service pennsylvania class saw limited use in first world war as a shortage of oil fuel in united kingdom meant that only coal burning ships of battleship division nine were sent both were sent across atlantic to france after war for paris peace conference of 1919 and were then transferred to pacific fleet before being significantly modernized from 1929 to 1931 for remainder of inter war period ships were used in exercises and fleet problems both pennsylvania and arizona were present during japanese attack on pearl harbor which brought united states into second world war arizona was sunk by a massive magazine explosion and was turned into a memorial after war while pennsylvania in dry dock at time received only minor damage after a refit from october 1942 to february 1943 pennsylvania went on to serve as a shore bombardment ship for most of remainder

class represented here by in 1916 were first american battleship class with triple gun turrets all or nothing armor concept oil fuel and steam turbines with geared cruising turbines albeit latter only in all of these innovations were continued in pennsylvania class photograph courtesy of national archives and records administration preceding nevada class battleships represented a leap forward from previous american battleship technology and from most contemporary foreign designs they were first in world to employ all or nothing armor scheme that characterized every succeeding american battleship devised with knowledge that engagement ranges between battle fleets was growing greater as main battery sizes increased system moved away from previous designs that used heavy medium and light armor in favor of using only heavy armor to protect vital areas on ship new system envisioned that at long ranges ships would be attacked with only armor piercing ap projectiles stoppable only by heavy armor medium or light armor would only serve to detonate shells by removing gun turrets and reducing overall protected length of ship navy s designers were able to devote weight savings to belt as well as extra deck armor to protect against plunging shells friedman design and development 65 66 friedman us battleships 101 02 in issuing desired specifications for design that would become nevada class navy s general board asked for triple gun turrets i e three guns mounted per turret they were very unsatisfied with awkward placement required on classes preceding nevadas which had five and six two gun turrets yet moving back to four two gun turrets of would be a significant loss in firepower although a triple turret was first proposed in american professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for south carolinas it was not even in experimental stage first turret was authorized in 1911 and would not be ready until months after contracts for new ships would be signed with shipbuilders decision to go ahead with turret was a calculated gamble but proved to be a qualified success only issue came with shell interference when center and outside guns were fired simultaneously which was easily solved by delaying firing of center barrel by a small fraction of a second moreover there was a major benefit in weight thanks to accompanying loss of an armored barbette and turret these weight savings were applied to armor protection making all or nothing concept a reality friedman design and development 134 35 friedman us battleships 102 107 111 nevadas were also first american battleships to use exclusively oil fuel which had greater thermal efficiency than firing with coal or coal sprayed with oil cumulative effect of change was measured by navy as a fifty five percent increase in steam production per pound of fuel in a design for an oil fired version of this would give oil fired vessels additional range an important consideration for ships based in pacific but navy s bureau of construction and repair c r pointed out what it saw as unfortunate side effects including a lower center of gravity higher metacentric height and loss of coal bunkers which were employed as part of armor protection within a few years oil tanks below waterline were considered indispensable parts of underwater armor scheme employed in american dreadnoughts

for a new 1913 fiscal year battleship design was sent in june 1911 with recent nevada innovations in mind they desired a ship with a main battery of twelve 14 inch guns in triple turrets a secondary battery of twenty two guns a speed of and armor equivalent to that of nevadas c r s first sketch was unsatisfactory their lengthy design of and actually had less armor than nevadas with a belt friedman us battleships 113 design process was marked by various efforts to meet general board s specifications with only a moderate increase in tonnage over nevada class between january and march 1912 thirteen sketches were prepared for consideration by c r with reciprocating or turbine engines that traded either speed or metacentric height for armor some later designs gave up a half knot of speed to free up about enough to thicken belt from and barbettes to 14 inches choice between double or triple turrets was also still an issue as nevada class had not been completed yet bureau of ordnance was in favor of waiting for test results rather than risking reverting to two gun 14 inch turrets or moving up to two gun 16 inch turrets friedman us battleships 113 15 in march 1912 c r proposed their seventh eighth ninth and tenth designs to general board for approval eighth and ninth designs were ones to give up a half knot of speed while tenth was a design with four triple turrets and lighter than nevada class ships in april general board chose seventh design which satisfied all of their requirements albeit on largest displacement length was fixed at beam at and draft at steam turbines gave design and 21 knots while main armor belt was 13 5 inches tapering to at ends this design was further refined and emerged in a completed state in september delay was partially due to tests on proposed armor which were completed in june 1912 and resulted in significant alterations to pennsylvania class underwater protection friedman us battleships 114 15 specifications pennsylvania

around to 30 000 long tons friedman us battleships 115 16 tillman proposed a maximum battleship in a senate resolution in july 1912 which was adopted unanimously resolved that committee on naval
