season but league had since been absorbed into football league so after a successful voting ballot by other members of league it was placed into football league second division cardiff finished season tied on points with league winners birmingham with 58 of a possible 84 points but finished second due to goal average two sides were both promoted to first division team also reached semifinal of fa cup becoming first welsh side to do so and keeping seven consecutive clean sheets in process before they were eliminated from competition by fellow second division side wolverhampton wanderers 3 1 in a replay at old trafford in welsh cup cardiff were holders entering competition but were eliminated in third round by pontypridd after a fixture clash forced them to field a reserve side in competition during season 29 players were used in all competitions billy hardy featured in more games than any other player being ever present in both league and fa cup making 49 appearances he missed only one senior match for side club s welsh cup defeat forward jimmy gill signed at start of season was club s top scorer he scored 20 goals in all competitions finishing campaign eight goals clear next highest scoring player arthur cashmore club attracted an average attendance of over 28 000 for its first season in football league rising from previous years in southern league home matches against coventry city and bristol city both recorded season high attendances of 42 000 lowest attendances recorded were 20 000 for matches against leicester city and barnsley background and preseason cardiff had spent previous decade playing in southern football league team had entered competition in 1910 after becoming a professional football club in 1919 20 season cardiff finished fourth in first division of southern football league football league a rival competition to southern league at time was looking to expand and ultimately absorbed southern league s first division to form a new football league third division southern league had suffered several blows in years prior with london based sides tottenham hotspur west ham united and fulham all moving into football league cardiff s founder walter bartley wilson along with club s committee set about preparing an application to become one of two sides that would enter football league second division in place of two teams that finished at bottom of division in previous season votes were cast on decision by members of football league with leeds united looking to replace leeds city who had dropped out of football league after eight matches previous year receiving 31 votes cardiff came second with 23 votes beating out their nearest rival relegated side grimsby town by three votes lincoln city received only seven votes and rochdale and chesterfield withdrew their applications cardiff s election meant that they were placed in a higher division than three sides portsmouth watford and crystal palace that had finished above them previous year decision proved controversial particularly at portsmouth who had finished as champions for cardiff manager fred stewart appointed in 1913 remained in charge stewart maintained core of his side from previous season most notable signing made prior to start of campaign being forward jimmy gill who was signed from wednesday for ps750 around ps46 000 in modern day other new signings included herbie evans from local side cardiff corinthians goalkeeper ben davies from middlesbrough ernie gault from everton and laurence abrams from chelsea stewart also decided to allow patrick cassidy and kidder harvey to leave club decision proved surprising to many given two players experience pair alongside billy hardy had formed part of holy three as they were known by fans in southern league but emergence of fred keenor hastened their departure football league second division thumb upright jimmy gill scored twice in cardiff s first game of season and finished campaign as club s top scorer cardiff were handed an away fixture in their first match in football league facing manager fred stewart s former club stockport county considered underdogs against more experienced side cardiff secured a 5 2 victory with two goals from new signing gill and one each from jack evans billy grimshaw and fred keenor performance led times to describe victory as one of best performances of day in football league team s second match was first football league match ever held at ninian park as 25 000 fans witnessed a 0 0 draw with clapton orient first home victory at ground came in team s following match when they recorded a 3 0 victory over stockport in reverse fixture previous season s top goalscorer arthur cashmore opened scoring becoming first player to score a football league goal at ninian park before grimshaw added a brace cardiff suffered its first defeat in football league in reverse fixture against clapton orient on 6 september losing 2 0 side recovered to claim a win and a draw in back to back fixtures against birmingham in their following two matches gill scoring in both games another set of back to back fixtures followed against west ham united with two sides having identical records before matches in keeping with prior form two sides drew both matches first match at ninian park ended 0 0 second resulted in a 1 1 draw with gill maintaining his early season form by scoring his fifth goal of campaign cardiff remained unbeaten throughout rest of october recording consecutive 3 0 victories over fulham and a win and a draw against notts county after victory in first fixture against notts county a match they were widely expected to struggle in cardiff led division after eleven matches however subsequent draw followed by a loss against leicester city on 6 november allowed south shields to overtake them return fixture against leicester was won 2 0 following goals from cashmore and gill in front of a joint season low crowd of 20 000 soon after cardiff secured a 4 2 victory over blackpool at bloomfield road prior to victory cardiff broke club s record transfer fee to sign scottish international fullback jimmy blair from wednesday for ps3 500 blair made his debut for club in match replacing albert barnett and remained first choice throughout remainder of season after a 0 0 draw at home against blackpool blair returned to face his former club wednesday and helped his new side record consecutive 1 0 victories both matches being decided by goals from george west their form prompted times to report that side were playing with great determination to win promotion to first division victories returned cardiff to top of table and their position was further strengthened by a 2 1 victory over bury despite rivals birmingham recording their tenth consecutive victory cardiff defeated coventry city 4 2 on christmas day in a match that recorded a joint season high attendance of 42 000 but suffered a 1 0 defeat in return fixture two days later this slip up allowed bristol city to move into first place on goal average and birmingham to move within one point of pair at end of year cardiff endured a disappointing start to 1921 losing 1 0 to bury on new year s day before drawing 0 0 with promotion rivals bristol city on 15 january with cardiff and bristol drawing birmingham overtook pair to go top cardiff faced bristol city again in their next fixture with goalkeeper herbert kneeshaw missing his first match of season after suffering a cheek injury his replacement ben davies would go on to feature in all of club s remaining fixtures side recorded a 1 0 victory over their severnside rivals with barnett scoring only goal with an attendance of around 42 000 joint largest home crowd of season at ninian park however a defeat to stoke on 5 february saw cardiff lose ground on their promotion rivals and drop to third place a 2 0 win over barnsley with goals from gill and debutant harry nash and a goalless draw with stoke were not enough to stop side slipping to fourth place soon after in side s last fixture in february cardiff defeated nottingham forest 2 1 leaving cardiff bristol city and blackpool tied for second place on 38 points concerned about lack of goals being scored by his side stewart who had already signed nash in an attempt to remedy problem made another new signing in march when forward fred pagnam arrived from first division side arsenal for a fee of ps3 000 pagnam made a goalscoring debut as cardiff defeated barnsley 3 2 however cardiff suffered consecutive defeats for first time during campaign after losing 2 0 against rotherham county and 2 1 against port vale defeats resulted in cardiff falling five points behind leaders birmingham although their prolonged fa cup run had left them with three games in hand two days after losing to vale pagnam helped side return to winning ways by scoring only goal in a win over leeds united on 28 march although match was marred by a broken leg suffered by barnett that ended his season in order to make up their games in hand cardiff played return fixture against leeds following day as pagnam again scored this time alongside keenor in a 2 1 victory these victories were start of a strong run of form as cardiff won six of their following seven matches having defeated leeds cardiff drew 0 0 with port vale they proceeded to win four consecutive matches defeating nottingham forest 3 0 and recording 1 0 wins over south shields twice and rotherham side s form had brought them back into contention for league title and despite picking up only one point from two matches against hull city at end of april cardiff went into final two league fixtures tied on points with league leaders birmingham who led on goal average bristol city were four points behind pair meaning each side needed a point from their remaining two fixtures to guarantee promotion to first division cardiff faced back to back matches against wolverhampton wanderers side that had eliminated cardiff from semi finals of fa cup two months earlier to finish season in first fixture held at ninian park 40 000 spectators witnessed cardiff seal promotion with a 2 0 win gill and pagnam scorers pair were on scoresheet again along with nash to record a 3 1 win in reverse match on 7 may despite winning both fixtures cardiff ultimately finished second to birmingham on goal average title was decided by just 0 024 of a goal keenor later described confusion at end of final match as team waited for news on which side had won league commenting we waited anxiously in

goalless draw at brighton s goldstone ground in replay a single goal from cashmore was enough to see cardiff through to third round a third consecutive away draw followed with cardiff defeating third division southampton 1 0 at dell after a goal from gill club s victory over southampton meant that for first time in its history cardiff had reached fourth round of fa cup team were drawn against first division side chelsea who would be playing their eighth match in competition having been taken to two replays by both reading and plymouth argyle in first and third rounds respectively chelsea s

looked for an equaliser however a number of long shots were defended by wolves who added a third goal soon after as match finished 3 1 45 000 spectators had attended replay yielding gate receipts of
