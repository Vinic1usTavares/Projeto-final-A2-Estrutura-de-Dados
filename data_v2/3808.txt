aggregate sites metacritic and gamerankings scored both pc version and xbox 360 version of game at 86 out of 100 greg mueller from gamespot recommends game for its value but sees it as not an absolutely essential expansion and rates some of later quests as repetitive and uninspired similar comments followed from gamepro reviewer newton who found that it is an impressive expansion which delivers more of what made oblivion great creative quests a huge land to explore and tons of things to do there therefore making this expansion is a solid purchase for anyone who was a fan of core

interesting questing charles onyett from ign rates it as an entirely worthy addition to bethesda s stellar fourth entry in elder scrolls series and as a great excuse to jump back in series expansion
