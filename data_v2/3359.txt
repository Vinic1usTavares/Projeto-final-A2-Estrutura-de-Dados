severe tropical cyclone john was an intense tropical cyclone that rapidly deepened offshore before devastating areas of western australia system was second cyclone and first severe tropical cyclone of active 1999 00 australian region cyclone season cyclone john developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of australia on 9 december 1999 as it moved to west and later south as result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions cyclone was able to rapidly intensify john reached peak intensity on 14 december as a category 5 cyclone on australian cyclone scale highest rating possible cyclone john later began interacting with a mid latitude trough which slightly weakened cyclone prior to making landfall near whim creek early on 15 december increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in cyclone s rapid weakening before it dissipated during next day cyclone john extensively affected areas of western australia but damage was not as bad as expected widespread power outages across pilbara region were caused by john strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across coast as well as tree damage 140 windmills were destroyed by cyclone on coast further inland rainfall associated with cyclone and its remnants brought flooding which flooded 25 houses and caused rivers to overflow system was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage after season name john was retired from australian tropical cyclone naming list meteorological history in early december a monsoon trough north of australia intensified due to a strong northwest cross equatorial surge in south china sea this resulted in formation of a tropical low southwest of timor on 9 december at 0600 utc on 10 december joint typhoon warning center jtwc began to monitor system designating it as 02s as it moved towards west and subsequently southwards improving upper air divergence allowed system to intensify reaching tropical cyclone intensity on evening of 11 december and thus attaining name john at time a tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm pass of system revealed a compact system with a convective rainband tightly surrounding a central cloud filled eye a developed anticyclone positioned over system provided favorable conditions for development due to presence of a subtropical ridge to east over australia cyclone john was forecast to generally move in a south southwestward direction steadily intensifying cyclone attained category 3 cyclone intensity on australian cyclone scale at 1600 utc on 12 december trmm imagery indicated that cyclone had developed a banding eye feature and had good outflow and a symmetric structure cyclone john continued to intensify under favorable atmospheric conditions before reaching its peak intensity as a category 5 cyclone on australian cyclone scale at 0800 utc on 14 december while located northwest of port hedland western australia at peak intensity storm had maximum 10 minute sustained wind speeds of 205 km h 130 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of however after peak intensity dry air began to become wrapped into northwestern quadrant of system moving towards australian coastline radar imagery from dampier western australia showed a strong eyewall associated with john cyclone john began to become elongated along a northwest southeast axis as it neared coast cyclone also began interacting with a mid latitude trough southwest this generated some vertical wind shear which weakened john slightly and caused it to curve towards southeast cyclone john made landfall near whim creek western australia as a category 5 cyclone at 0000 utc on 15 december with a minimum central pressure between 930 940 mbar 27 46 27 46 inhg with maximum 10 minute sustained winds of gusting to entirety of cyclone s eye crossed coast by 0200 utc as storm moved further inland into an area of wind shear and dry air which caused it to rapidly weaken cyclone was last noted by tcwc perth and jtwc on 16 december as it dissipated overland preparations and impact thumb whim creek pub in 2008 which was damaged by cyclone john alt picture of a red pentagonal building prior to cyclone john s landfall hundreds of people were evacuated from homes primarily in karratha where two shelters were set up in point samson 500 people evacuated to shelters in wickham western australia tcwc perth began issuing hourly warnings for potentially affected areas beginning at 1400 utc on 14 december as storm made landfall some residents of whim creek took refuge in a shipping container strong winds from cyclone caused widespread power outages to areas in pilbara at cape lambert winds averaged for five hours with a peak wind gust of karratha suffered minor damage from john primarily in form of wind damage various trees were uprooted by strong winds and some homes suffered minor roof damage palm fronds in karratha were blown off palm trees due to strong winds in whim creek where cyclone had made landfall top floor of a 113 year old pub and hotel was destroyed a temporary roof made up of tarpaulins later collapsed in a flood event following month accessed via lexis nexis on 1 january 2013 140 windmills between whim creek and newman were destroyed by cyclone accessed via lexis nexis on 1 january 2013 offshore 220 cattle aboard a ship died after ship was battered by rough seas associated with cyclone john accessed via lexis nexis on 1 january 2013 production from an oil field off coast of northwest australia were down 38 partly due to being shut down in preparation for cyclone john accessed via lexis nexis on 1 january 2013 rough seas from john also caused a maximum storm surge height of recorded in port hedland by port hedland authority on 15 december further inland cyclone john brought widespread rainfall and flooding in newman western australia of rain was recorded early on 16 december as a result some roads and 25 houses were flooded by rains by evening of that day rainfall total had increased to todd river was flooded after of rain fell as a result of cyclone accessed via lexis nexis on 1 january 2013 accessed via lexis nexis on 1 january 2013 overall john was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage after season had ended name john was retired from australian tropical cyclone naming list see also cyclone orson cyclone joan cyclone george
