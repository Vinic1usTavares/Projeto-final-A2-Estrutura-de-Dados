castles have played an important military economic and social role in great britain and ireland since their introduction following norman invasion of england in 1066 although a small number of castles had been built in england in 1050s normans began to build motte and bailey and ring work castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in england and welsh marches during 12th century normans began to build more castles in stone with characteristic square keep that played both military and political roles royal castles were used to control key towns and economically important forests while baronial castles were used by norman lords to control their widespread estates david i invited anglo norman lords into scotland in early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as galloway new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over south of kingdom following norman invasion of ireland in 1170s under henry ii castles were established there too castles continued to grow in military sophistication and comfort during 12th century leading to a sharp increase in complexity and length of sieges in england while in ireland and wales castle architecture continued to follow that of england after death of alexander iii trend in scotland moved away from construction of larger castles towards use of smaller tower houses tower house style would also be adopted in north of england and ireland in later years in north wales edward i built a sequence of militarily powerful castles after destruction of last welsh polities in 1270s by 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks many royal and baronial castles were left to decline so that by 15th century only a few were maintained for defensive purposes a small number of castles in england and scotland were developed into renaissance era palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid their elaborate architecture such structures were however beyond means of all but royalty and richest of late medieval barons although gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles from late 14th century onwards it became clear during 16th century that provided artillery could be transported and brought to bear on a besieged castle gunpowder weapons could also play an important attack role defences of coastal castles around british isles were improved to deal with this threat but investment in their upkeep once again declined at end of 16th century nevertheless in widespread civil and religious conflicts across british isles during 1640s and 1650s castles played a key role in england modern defences were quickly built alongside existing medieval fortifications and in many cases castles successfully withstood more than one siege in ireland introduction of heavy siege artillery by oliver cromwell in 1649 brought a rapid end to utility of castles in war while in scotland popular tower houses proved unsuitable for defending against civil war artillery although major castles such as edinburgh put up strong resistance at end of war many castles were slighted to prevent future use military use of castles rapidly decreased over subsequent years although some were adapted for use by garrisons in scotland and key border locations for many years to come including during second world war other castles were used as county gaols until parliamentary legislation in 19th closed most of them down for a period in early 18th century castles were shunned in favour of palladian architecture until they re emerged as an important cultural and social feature of england wales and scotland and were frequently improved during 18th and 19th centuries such renovations raised concerns over their protection so that today castles across british isles are safeguarded by legislation primarily used as tourist attractions castles form a key part of national heritage industry historians and archaeologists continue to develop our understanding of british castles while vigorous academic debates in recent years have questioned interpretation of physical and documentary material surrounding their original construction and use norman invasion anglo saxon fortifications english word castle derives from latin word castellum and is used to refer to private fortified residence of a lord or noble presence of castles in britain and ireland dates primarily from norman invasion of 1066 creighton and higham p 6 before arrival of normans anglo saxons had built burhs fortified structures with their origins in 9th century wessex liddiard 2005 p 15 most of these especially in urban areas were large enough to be best described as fortified townships rather than private dwellings and are therefore not usually classed as castles brown 1962 p 18 rural burhs were smaller and usually consisted of a wooden hall with a wall enclosing various domestic buildings along with an entrance tower called a burh which was apparently used for ceremonial purposes liddiard 2005 pp 15 16 although rural burhs were relatively secure their role was primarily ceremonial and they too are not normally classed as castles liddiard 2005 p 17 brown 1962 p 18 there were however a small number of castles which were built in england during 1050s probably by norman knights in service of edward confessor liddiard 2005 p 37 these include hereford clavering richard s castle and possibly harold castle and dover brown 1962 p 22 liddiard 2005 p 37 invasion thumb hallaton castle in leicestershire england showing a well preserved post invasion earth motte l and bailey r william duke of normandy invaded england in 1066 and one of his first actions after landing was to build hastings castle to protect his supply routes brown 1962 p 21 following their victory at battle of hastings normans began three phases of castle building first of these was establishment by new king of a number of royal castles in key strategic locations liddiard 2005 p 18 brown 1962 p 22 this royal castle programme focused on controlling towns and cities of england and associated lines of communication including cambridge huntingdon lincoln norwich nottingham wallingford warwick and york creighton 2005 p 36 liddiard 2005 p 18 brown 1962 p 22 of castles built by william conqueror two thirds were built in towns and cities often those with former anglo saxon mints liddiard 2005 p 18 these urban castles could make use of existing town s walls and fortifications but typically required demolition of local houses to make space for them liddiard 2005 p 19 brown 1962 p 22 this could cause extensive damage and records suggest that in lincoln 166 houses were destroyed with 113 in norwich and 27 in cambridge brown 1962 p 22 pounds 1994 p 208 some of these castles were deliberately built on top of important local buildings such as burhs or halls of local nobles and might be constructed so as to imitate aspects of previous buildings such as gatehouse at castle in exeter which closely resembled previous anglo saxon burh tower this was probably done to demonstrate to local population that they now answered to their new norman rulers liddiard 2005 p 30 second and third waves of castle building were led by major magnates and then by more junior knights on their new estates apportionment of conquered lands by king influenced where these castles were built in a few key locations king gave his followers compact groups of estates including six rapes of sussex and three earldoms of chester shrewsbury and hereford intended to protect line of communication with normandy and welsh border respectively creighton 2005 pp 99 101 in these areas a baron s castles were clustered relatively tightly together but in most of england nobles estates and therefore their castles were more widely dispersed creighton 2005 p 101 as normans pushed on into south wales they advanced up valleys building castles as they went and often using larger castles of neighbouring earldoms as a base pounds 1994 p 17 pettifer 2000 p xiii thumb left folkestone castle in england a norman ringwork castle as a result castle building by norman nobility across england and marches lacked a grand strategic plan reflecting local circumstances such as military factors and layout of existing estates and church lands liddiard 2005 pp 23 24 creighton 2005 p 37 castles were often situated along old roman roads that still formed backbone for travel across country both to control lines of communication and to ensure easy movement between different estates creighton 2005 pp 39 40 many castles were built close to inland river ports and those built on coast were usually located at mouths of rivers or in ports pevensey and portchester being rare exceptions creighton 2005 pp 41 3 some groups of castles were located so as to be mutually reinforcing for example castles of littledean camp glasshouse woods and howle hill camp were intended to act as an integrated defence for area around gloucester and gloucester castle for gloucester city itself while windsor was one of a ring of castles built around london each approximately a day s march apart scott garrett pp 59 60 mackworth young p 6 some regional patterns in castle building can also be seen relatively few castles were built in east anglia compared to west of england or marches this was probably due to relatively settled and prosperous nature of east of england and reflected a shortage of available serfs or unfree labour liddiard 2005 p 25 not all of castles were occupied simultaneously some were built during invasions and then abandoned while other new castles were constructed elsewhere especially along western borders recent estimates suggest that between 500 and 600 castles were occupied at any one time in post conquest period eales 2003 cited liddiard 2005 p 18 architecture thumb stone keep of chepstow castle in wales built in a romanesque style there was a large degree of variation in size and exact shape of castles built in england and wales after invasion pounds 1994 pp 15 17 one popular form was motte and bailey in which earth would be piled up into a mound called a motte to support a wooden tower and a wider enclosed area built alongside it called a bailey stafford castle is a typical example of a post invasion motte castle brown 1962 p 24 another widespread design was ring work in which earth would be built up in a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart folkestone castle is a good example of a norman ring work in this case built on top of a hill although most post invasion castles were usually sited on lower ground liddiard 2005 pp 22 and 24 around 80 per cent of norman castles in this period followed motte and bailey pattern but ring works were particularly popular in certain areas such as south west england and south wales liddiard 2005 p 17 creighton 2005 p 48 one theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow soil areas than larger mottes creighton 2005 p 48 white tower in london and keep of colchester castle were only stone castles to be built in england immediately after conquest both with characteristic square norman keep liddiard 2005 p 34 both these castles were built in romanesque style and were intended to impress as well as provide military protection in wales first wave of norman castles were again made of wood in a mixture of motte and bailey and ringwork designs with exception of stone built chepstow castle pettifer 2000 p xiii chepstow too was heavily influenced by romanesque design reusing numerous materials from nearby venta to produce what historian robert liddiard has termed a play upon images from antiquity liddiard 2005 p 34 turner 2006 p 27 size of these castles varied depending on geography of site decisions of builder and available resources pounds 1994 p 17 analysis of size of mottes has shown some distinctive regional variation east anglia for example saw much larger mottes being built than midlands or london pounds 1994 p 19 while motte and bailey and ring work castles took great effort to build they required relatively few skilled craftsmen allowing them to be raised using forced labour from local estates this in addition to speed with which they could be built a single season made them particularly attractive immediately after conquest pounds 1994 pp 18 and 20 larger earthworks particularly mottes required an exponentially greater quantity of manpower than their smaller equivalents and consequently tended to be either royal or belong to most powerful barons who could muster required construction effort pounds 1994 pp 18 19 despite motte and bailey and ringworks being common designs amongst norman castles each fortification was slightly different some castles were designed with two baileys attached to a single motte and some ring works were built with additional towers added on yet other castles were built as ringworks and later converted to motte and bailey structures 12th century developments in castle design 200px thumb alt a square stone keep dominates picture sat behind a patch of green grass keep has a doorway at ground level with two windows irregularly placed above it norman square keep of goodrich castle in england with original first floor doorway still visible above its later replacement from early 12th century onwards normans began to build new castles in stone and convert existing timber designs brown 1962 p 36 this was initially a slow process picking up speed towards second half of century traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by more crude nature of wooden fortifications limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents brown 1962 p 36 toy 1985 p 54 creighton and higham pp 41 42 some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood such as at hen domen creighton and higham p 41 several early stone keeps had been built after conquest with somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100 and more followed in 12th century until around 100 had been built by 1216 hulme p 213 typically these were four sided designs with corners reinforced by pilaster buttresses toy 1985 p 66 keeps were up to four storeys high with entrance on first storey to prevent door from being easily broken down strength of design typically came from thickness of walls usually made of rag stone as in case of dover castle these walls could be up to thick brown 1962 p 45 larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while smaller versions such as that at goodrich had a single slightly cramped chamber on each floor brown 1962 p 46 thompson 1991 p 65 stone keeps required skilled craftsmen to build them unlike unfree labour or serfs these men had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive pounds 1994 p 20 they were also relatively slow to erect a keep s walls could usually only be raised by a maximum of a year keep at scarborough was typical in taking ten years to build norman stone keeps played both a military and a political role most of keeps were physically extremely robust and while they were not designed as an intended location for final defence of a castle they were often placed near weak points in walls to provide supporting fire hulme p 216 many keeps made compromises to purely military utility liddiard 2005 pp 51 52 norwich castle included elaborate blind arcading on outside of building in a roman style and appears to had a ceremonial entrance route liddiard 2005 p 51 interior of keep at hedingham could have hosted impressive ceremonies and events but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective liddiard 2005 p 53 similarly there has been extensive debate over role of orford castle whose expensive three cornered design most closely echoes imperial byzantine palaces and may have been intended by henry ii to be more symbolic than military in nature liddiard 2005 p 48 another improvement from 12th century onwards was creation of shell keeps involving replacing wooden keep on motte with a circular stone wall brown 1962 p 42 buildings could be built around inside of shell producing a small inner courtyard restormel castle is a classic example of this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while later launceston castle although more ovoid than circular is another good example of design and one of most formidable castles of period brown 1962 p 41 toy 1985 pp 58 59 round castles were unusually popular throughout cornwall and devon brown 1962 p 41 toy 1933 cited creighton 2005 p 49 although circular design held military advantages these only really mattered in 13th century onwards origins of 12th century circular design were circular design of mottes indeed some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes such as that at windsor castle hulme p 222 economy and society thumb shell keep of restormel castle in england english castles during period were divided into those royal castles owned by king and baronial castles controlled by anglo norman lords according to chronicler william of newburgh royal castles formed bones of kingdom liddiard 2003b p 1 a number of royal castles were also designated as shrieval castles forming administrative hub for a particular county for example winchester castle served as centre of hampshire pounds 1994 p 93 these castles formed a base for royal sheriff responsible for enforcing royal justice in relevant shire role of sheriff became stronger and clearer as century progressed pounds 1994 p 95 a number of royal castles were linked to forests and other key resources royal forests in early medieval period were subject to special royal jurisdiction forest law was as historian robert huscroft describes it harsh and arbitrary a matter purely for king s will and forests were expected to supply king with hunting grounds raw materials goods and money huscroft p 97 forests were typically tied to castles both to assist with enforcement of law and to store goods being extracted from local economy peveril castle was linked to peak forest and local lead mining there eales 2006 pp 19 and 21 st briavels was tied to forest of dean and knaresborough rockingham and pickering to their eponymous forests respectively curnow and johnson p 91 rudge p 22 creighton 2005 p 92 in south west where crown oversaw lead mining industry castles such as restormel played an important role running local courts creighton 2005 p 187 baronial castles were of varying size and sophistication some were classed as a caput or key stronghold of a given lord and were usually larger and better fortified than norm and usually held local baronial courts liddiard 2003b p 3 king continued to exercise right to occupy and use any castle in kingdom in response to external threats in those cases he would staff occupied castles with his own men king also retained right to authorise construction of new castles through issuing of licenses to crenellate pounds 1994 p 29 it was possible for bishops to build or control castles such as important devizes castle linked to bishop of salisbury although this practice was challenged on occasion liddiard 2003b p 3 bradbury p 56 58 in 12th century practice of castle guards emerged in england and wales under which lands were assigned to local lords on condition that recipient provided a certain number of knights or sergeants for defence of a named castle brown 1962 pp 151 152 in some cases such as at dover this arrangement became quite sophisticated with particular castle towers being named after particular families owing castle guard duty king 1991 p 19 links between castles and surrounding lands and estates was particularly important during this period many castles both royal and baronial had deer parks or chases attached to them for purposes of hunting creighton 2005 p 29 these usually stretched away from village or borough associated with castle but occasionally a castle was placed in centre of a park such as at sandal anarchy thumb pickering castle in england right and counter castle from years of anarchy upper left civil war broke out in england and raged between 1139 and 1153 forming a turbulent period in which rival factions of king stephen and empress matilda struggled for power bradbury p 68 open battles were relatively rare during war with campaigns instead centred on a sequence of raids and sieges as commanders attempted to gain control over vital castles that controlled territory in rival regions bradbury p 71 siege technology during anarchy centred on basic stone throwing machines such as ballistae and mangonels supported by siege towers and mining combined with blockade and occasionally direct assault bradbury p 73 phase of conflict known as castle war saw both sides attempting to defeat each other through sieges such as stephen s attempts to take wallingford most easterly fortress in matilda s push towards london or geoffrey de mandeville s attempts to seize east anglia by taking cambridge castle bradbury pp 90 91 and 144 145 both sides responded to challenge of conflict by building many new castles sometimes as sets of strategic fortifications in south west matilda s supporters built a range of castles to protect territory usually motte and bailey designs such as those at winchcombe upper slaughter or bampton walker p 15 similarly stephen built a new chain of fen edge castles at burwell rampton caxton and all about six to nine miles 10 15 km apart in order to protect his lands around cambridge creighton 2005 p 59 many of these castles were termed adulterine unauthorised because no formal permission was given for their construction coulson 1994 p 69 contemporary chroniclers saw this as a matter of concern robert of torigny suggested that as many as 1 115 such castles had been built during conflict although this was probably an exaggeration as elsewhere he suggests an alternative figure of 126 coulson 1994 p 69 bradbury p 191 another feature of war was creation of many counter castles bradbury p 28 these had been used in english conflicts for several years before civil war and involved building a basic castle during a siege alongside main target of attack creighton 2005 p 56 typically these would be built in either a ringwork or a motte and bailey design between 200 and 300 yards 180 and 270 metres away from target just beyond range of a bow counter castles could be used to either act as firing platforms for siege weaponry or as bases for controlling region in their own right creighton 2005 p 57 most counter castles were destroyed after their use but in some cases earthworks survived such as counter castles called jew s mount and mount pelham built by stephen in 1141 outside oxford castle mackenzie p 149 gravett and hook p 43 matilda s son henry ii assumed throne at end of war and immediately announced his intention to eliminate adulterine castles that had sprung up during war but it is unclear how successful this effort was bradbury pp 190 191 robert of torigny recorded that 375 were destroyed without giving details behind figure recent studies of selected regions have suggested that fewer castles were probably destroyed than once thought and that many may simply have been abandoned at end of conflict amt p 44 certainly many of new castles were transitory in nature archaeologist oliver creighton observes that 56 per cent of those castles known to have been built during stephen s reign have entirely vanished creighton 2005 p 93 spread of castles in scotland wales and ireland thumb bass of inverurie in scotland a large motte and bailey castle built in mid 12th century castles in scotland emerged as a consequence of centralising of royal authority in 12th century simpson and webster p 225 prior to 1120s there is very little evidence of castles having existed in scotland which had remained less politically centralised than in england with north still ruled by kings of norway tabraham 2005 pp 10 and 22 david i of scotland spent time at court of henry i in south until he became earl of huntingdon and returned to scotland with intention of extending royal power across country and modernising scotland s military technology including introduction of castles carpenter p 182 scottish king encouraged norman and french nobles to settle in scotland introducing a feudal mode of landholding and use of castles as a way of controlling contested lowlands simpson and webster p 225 tabraham 2005 p 11 quasi independent polity of galloway which had resisted rule of david and his predecessors was a particular focus for this colonisation simpson and webster p 231 size of these scottish castles primarily wooden motte and bailey constructions varied considerably from larger designs such as bass of inverurie to smaller castles like balmaclellan tabraham 2005 p 16 as historian lise hull has suggested creation of castles in scotland was less to do with conquest and more to do with establishing a governing system hull p xxiv norman expansion into wales slowed in 12th century but remained an ongoing threat to remaining native rulers in response welsh princes and lords began to build their own castles usually in wood pettifer 2000 p xiv there are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under prince cadwgan ap bleddyn with first documentary evidence of a native welsh castle being at cymmer in 1116 king 1991 p 130 these timber castles including tomen y tomen y faerdre and gaer penrhos were of equivalent quality to norman fortifications in area and it can prove difficult to distinguish builders of some sites from archaeological evidence alone at end of 12th century welsh rulers began to build castles in stone primarily in principality of north wales thumb upright 1 4 left trim castle in ireland built immediately after norman invasion ireland remained ruled by native kings into 12th century largely without use of castles there was a history of irish fortifications called raths a type of ringfort some of which were very heavily defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in usual sense of word mcneill pp 8 9 kings of connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called or from latin and french for castle and there has been considerable academic debate over how far these resembled european castles mcneill pp 10 and 14 citing graham 1988 norman invasion of ireland began between 1166 and 1171 under first richard de clare and then henry ii of england with occupation of southern and eastern ireland by a number of anglo norman barons mcneill p 17 rapid norman success depended on key economic and military advantages with castles enabling them to control newly conquered territories carpenter pp 220 21 new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions many of these were motte and bailey constructions in louth at least 23 of these were built carpenter p 221 it remains uncertain how many ringwork castles were built in ireland by anglo normans mcneill pp 60 61 other castles such as trim and carrickfergus were built in stone as caput centres for major barons mcneill pp 20 28 analysis of these stone castles suggests that building in stone was not simply a military decision indeed several of castles contain serious defensive flaws mcneill pp 76 77 instead designs including their focus on large stone keeps were intended both to increase prestige of baronial owners and to provide adequate space for administrative apparatus of new territories mcneill p 77 unlike in wales indigenous irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during period mcneill pp 74 and 84 13th 14th centuries military developments thumb dover castle in england built to a concentric design castle design in britain continued to change towards end of 12th century king 1991 p 77 after henry ii mottes ceased to be built in most of england although they continued to be erected in wales and along marches pounds 2004 p 21 square keeps remained common across much of england in contrast to circular keeps increasingly prevailing in france in marches however circular keep designs became more popular king 1991 p 82 castles began to take on a more regular enclosed shape ideally quadrilateral or at least polygonal in design especially in more prosperous south flanking towers initially square and latterly curved were introduced along walls and gatehouses began to grow in size and complexity with portcullises being introduced for first time castles such as dover and tower of london were expanded in a concentric design in what cathcart king has labelled early development of scientific fortification king 1991 p 94 developments spread to anglo norman possessions in ireland where this english style of castles dominated throughout 13th century although deteriorating irish economy of 14th century brought this wave of building to an end barry p 218 mcneill p 116 in scotland alexander ii and alexander iii undertook a number of castle building projects in modern style although alexander iii s early death sparked conflict in scotland and english intervention under edward i in 1296 in ensuing wars of scottish independence castle building in scotland altered path turning away from building larger more conventional castles with curtain walls reid p 12 stell p 278 scots instead adopted policy of slighting or deliberately destroying castles captured in scotland from english to prevent their re use in subsequent invasions most of new scottish castles built by nobles were of tower house design few larger castles built in scotland were typically royal castles built by scottish kings stell p 278 reid p 12 tabraham p 67 thumb left a reconstruction of a trebuchet some of these changes were driven by developments in military technology before 1190 mining was used rarely and siege engines of time were largely incapable of damaging thicker castle walls introduction of trebuchet began to change this situation it was able to throw much heavier balls with remarkable accuracy and reconstructed devices have been shown to be able to knock holes in walls purton pp 383 and 386 trebuchets were first recorded in england in 1217 and were probably used year before as well richard i used them in his sieges during third crusade and appears to have started to alter his castle designs to accommodate new technology on his return to europe hulme pp 221 222 trebuchet seems to have encouraged shift towards round and polygonal towers and curved walls hulme pp 218 and 222 purton p 377 in addition to having fewer or no dead zones and being easier to defend against mining these castle designs were also much less easy to attack with trebuchets as curved surfaces could deflect some of force of shot castles saw an increasing use of arrowslits by 13th century especially in england almost certainly linked to introduction of crossbows hulme p 217 these arrow slits were combined with firing positions from tops of towers initially protected by wooden hoarding until stone machicolations were introduced in england in late 13th century king 1991 p 84 crossbow was an important military advance on older short bow and was favoured weapon by time of richard i many crossbows and vast numbers of quarrels were needed to supply royal forces in turn requiring larger scale iron production pounds p 108 in england crossbows were primarily made at tower of london but st briavels castle with local forest of dean available to provide raw materials became national centre for quarrel manufacture pounds p 110 in scotland edinburgh castle became centre for production of bows crossbows and siege engines for king tabraham p 76 thumb right a contemporary sketch of lincoln castle in england at start of 13th century defended by a crossbowman one result of this was that english castle sieges grew in complexity and scale during first barons war from 1215 to 1217 prominent sieges of dover and windsor castle showed ability of more modern designs to withstand attack king john s successful siege of rochester required an elaborate and sophisticated assault reportedly costing around 60 000 marks or ps40 000 turner 2009 pp 192 193 liddiard 2005 p 85 both mark and pound sterling were accountancy terms in this period a mark was worth around two thirds of a pound siege of bedford castle in 1224 required henry iii to bring siege engines engineers crossbow bolts equipment and labourers from across all of england brown 1962 pp 160 103 siege of kenilworth castle in 1266 during second barons war was larger and longer still extensive water defences withstood attack of future edward i despite prince targeting weaker parts of castle walls employing huge siege towers and attempting a night attack using barges brought from chester hull and whitehorne p 32 morris 2010 p 40 pounds p 121 prestwich p 56 costs of siege exhausted revenues of ten english counties liddiard 2005 p 85 sieges in scotland were initially smaller in scale with first recorded such event being 1230 siege of rothesay castle where besieging norwegians were able to break down relatively weak stone walls with axes after only three days stell pp 277 278 when edward i invaded scotland he brought with him siege capabilities which had evolved south of border edinburgh castle fell within three days and roxburgh jedburgh dunbar stirling lanark and dumbarton castles surrendered to king tabraham p 56 subsequent english sieges such as attacks on bothwell and stirling again used considerable resources including giant siege engines and extensive teams of miners and masons tabraham pp 58 59 economy and society thumb a reconstruction of edward i s chambers at tower of london in england a number of royal castles from 12th century onwards formed an essential network of royal storehouses in 13th century for a wide range of goods including food drink weapons armour and raw materials pounds 1994 p 101 castles such as southampton winchester bristol and tower of london were used to import store and distribute royal wines english royal castles also became used as gaols assize of clarendon in 1166 insisted that royal sheriffs establish their own gaols and in coming years county gaols were placed in all shrieval royal castles pounds 1994 p 99 conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common northampton castle appears to have seen some of worst abuses development of baronial castles in england were affected by economic changes during period pounds 1994 pp 147 148 during 13th and 14th centuries average incomes of english barons increased but wealth became concentrated in hands of a smaller number of individuals with a greater discrepancy in incomes at same time costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing pounds 1994 p 148 result was that although there were around 400 castles in england in 1216 number of castles continued to diminish over coming years even wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles slide into disuse and to focus their resources on remaining stock pounds 1994 pp 104 and 149 hulme p 213 castle guard system faded into abeyance in england being replaced by financial rents although it continued in welsh marches well into 13th century and saw some limited use during edward i s occupation of scotland in early 14th century prestwich p 194 thumb thumbtime 9 350px left a reconstruction of holt castle in wales c 1495 castle was built in late 13th century by john de warenne 6th earl of surrey remaining english castles became increasingly comfortable their interiors were often painted and decorated with tapestries which would be transported from castle to castle as nobles travelled around country danziger and gillingham p 18 there were an increasing number of garderobes built inside castles while in wealthier castles floors could be tiled and windows furnished with sussex weald glass allowing introduction of window seats for reading danziger and gillingham pp 18 19 food could be

castles particularly those surrounded by extensive parks or forests such as barnard castle while prime cuts of venison were imported to those castles that lacked hunting grounds such as launceston creighton 2005 p 19 by late 13th century some castles were built within carefully designed landscapes sometimes drawing a distinction between an inner core of a herber a small enclosed garden complete with orchards and small ponds and an outer region with larger ponds and high status buildings such as religious buildings rabbit warrens mills and settlements potentially set within a park creighton

smaller fortifications such as dinas emrys in snowdonia to more substantial castles like deganwy castle and largest castell y bere native welsh castles typically maximised defensive benefits of high mountainous sites often being built in an irregular shape to fit a rocky peak king 1991 p 134 most had deep ditches cut out of rock to protect main castle welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep used as living accommodation for princes and nobility and with distinctive rectangular watch towers along walls king 1991 p 135 in comparison to norman castles gatehouses were much weaker in design with almost no use of portcullises or spiral staircases and stonework of outer walls was also generally inferior to norman built castles king 1991 pp 130 131 very last native welsh castles built in 1260s more closely resemble norman designs in case of dinas bran including a round keep and norman gatehouse defences edward i s castles in wales in 1277 edward i launched a

has described these as amongst finest achievements of medieval military architecture in england and wales castles varied in design but were typically characterised by powerful mural towers along castle walls with multiple over lapping firing points and large and extremely well defended barbicans brown 1962 pp 73 74 castles were intended to be used by king when in region and included extensive high status accommodation brown 1962 p 74 edward also established various new english towns and in several cases new castles were designed to be used alongside fortified town walls as part of an integrated defence historian richard morris has suggested that impression is firmly given of an elite group of men of war long standing comrades in arms of king indulging in an orgy of military

comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor pounds 1994 pp 265 266 bodiam castle built in 1380s possessed a moat towers and gunports but rather than being a genuine

and 1370s and in scottish castles by 1380s cannons were made in various sizes from smaller hand cannons to larger guns firing stone balls of up to king 1991 p 164 medium sized weapons weighing around 20 kg each were more useful for defence of castles although richard ii eventually established 600 pound 272 kilo guns at tower of london and 15 366 pound 6 970 kilo heavy mons meg bombard was installed at edinburgh castle king 1991 p 164 pounds 1994 p 252 early cannons had only a limited range and were unreliable in addition early stone cannonballs were relatively ineffective when fired at stone castle walls king 1991 p 169 as a result early cannon proved most useful for defence particularly against infantry assaults or to fire at crews of enemy trebuchets king 1991 pp 168 9 indeed early cannons could be quite dangerous to their own soldiers james ii of scotland was killed besieging roxburgh castle in 1460 when one of his cannons called lion exploded next to him king 1991 p 170 expense of early cannons meant that they were primarily a weapon deployed by royalty rather than nobility pounds 1994 p 255 cannons in english castles were initially deployed along south coast where channel ports essential for english trade and military operations in europe were increasingly threatened by french raids pounds 1994 p 253 carisbrooke corfe dover portchester and southampton castle

century tower house tower houses were a common feature of british and irish castle building in late medieval period over 3 000 were constructed in ireland around 800 in scotland and over 250 in england emery 1996 p 26 a tower house would typically be a tall square stone built crenelated building scottish and ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn a walled courtyard designed to hold valuable animals securely but not necessarily intended for serious defence toy 1985 p 224 reid p 33 many of gateways in these buildings were guarded with grill like doors made out of metal bars toy 1985 p 198 smaller versions of tower houses in northern england and southern scotland were known as peel towers or pele houses and were built along both sides of border regions toy 1985 p 225 in scotland a number were built in scottish towns reid p 21 it was originally argued that irish tower houses were based on scottish design but pattern of development of such castles in ireland does not support this hypothesis barry p 223 defences of tower houses were primarily aimed to provide protection against smaller raiding parties and were not intended to put up significant opposition to an organised military assault leading historian stuart reid to characterise them as defensible rather than defensive reid pp 12 and 46 gunports for heavier guns were built into some scottish tower houses by 16th century but it was more common to use lighter gunpowder weapons such as muskets to defend scottish tower houses mcneill p 228 reid p 29 unlike scotland irish tower houses were only defended with relatively light handguns and frequently reused older rather than more modern designs to save money mcneill p 228 analysis of construction of tower houses has focused on two key driving forces first is that construction of these castles appears to have been linked to periods of instability and insecurity in areas concerned tabraham p 77 in scotland james iv s forfeiture of lordship of isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across region and over longer term an increased degree of clan warfare while subsequent wars with england in 1540s added to level of insecurity over rest of century whyte and whyte p 76 glendinning macinnes and mackechnie p 6 irish tower houses were built from end of 14th century onward as countryside disintegrated into unstable control of a large number of small lordships and henry vi promoted their construction with financial rewards in a bid to improve security mcneill p 225 barry pp 221 222 and 224 english tower houses were built along frontier with scotland in a dangerous and insecure period pounds 1994 p 287 secondly and paradoxically appears to have been periods of relative prosperity contemporary historian william camden observed of northern english and scots there is not a man amongst them of a better sort that hath not his little tower or pile and many tower houses seem to have been built as much as status symbols as defensive structures duffy p 141 glendinning macinnes and mackechnie p 21 along english scottish borders construction pattern follows relative prosperity of different side english lords built tower houses primarily in early 15th century when northern england was particularly prosperous while their scottish equivalents built them in late 15th and early 16th centuries boom periods in economy of scotland mcneill p 226 in ireland growth of tower houses during 15th century mirrors rise of cattle herding and resulting wealth that this brought to many of lesser lords in ireland further development of gunpowder artillery thumb right ravenscraig castle in scotland showing its curved low profile fortifications designed to resist cannon fire cannons

weapons still remained relatively unreliable toy 1985 p 231 england had lagged behind europe in adapting to this new form of warfare dartmouth and kingswear castles built in 1490s to defend river dart and bayard s cover designed in 1510 to defend dartmouth harbour itself were amongst few english castles designed in continental style during period and even these lagged behind cutting edge of european design harrington 2007 p 9 eltis p 120 harrington 2007 p 9 scottish castles were more advanced in this regard partially as a result of stronger french architectural influences king 1991 p 172 ravenscraig castle in scotland for example was an early attempt in 1460s to deploy a combination of letter box gun ports and low curved stone towers for artillery weapons harrington 2007 p 9 these letter box gun ports common in mainland europe rapidly spread across scotland but were rarely used in england during 15th century scotland also led way in adopting new design for castle ditches as constructed at castle henry viii became concerned with threat of french invasion during 1539 and was familiar with more modern continental designs toy 1985 p 231 harrington 2007 p 15 he responded to threat by building a famous sequence of forts called device forts or henrician castles along south coast of england specifically designed to be equipped with and to defend against gunpowder artillery toy 1985 p 231 lowry p 15 these forts still lacked some of more modern continental features such as angled bastions eltis p 120 each fort had a slightly different design but as a group they shared common features with fortification formed around a number of compact lobes often in a quatrefoil or trefoil shape designed to give guns a 360 degree angle of fire toy 1985 pp 232 233 forts were usually tiered to allow guns to fire over one another and had features such as vents to disperse gunpowder smoke toy 1985 p 232 lowry p 17 it is probable that many of forts were also originally protected by earth bulwarks although these have not survived harrington 2007 p 15 resulting forts have been described by historian christopher duffy as having an air at once sturdy and festive rather like a squashed wedding cake duffy p 4 thumb left st mawes castle in england one of henry viii s device forts these coastal defences marked a shift away from castles which were both military fortifications and domestic buildings towards forts which were garrisoned but not domestic often 1540s are chosen as a transition date for study of castles as a consequence king p 175 subsequent years

guns there were still relatively few guns in ireland however and during nine years war at end of century irish were proved relatively unskilled in siege warfare with artillery used mainly by english lenihan p 352 in both ireland and scotland challenge was how to transport artillery pieces to castle sieges poor state of scottish roads required expensive trains of pack horses which only king could afford and in ireland river network had to be frequently used to transport weapons inland lenihan p 352 reid p 32 in these circumstances older castles could frequently remain viable defensive features

holding prisoners of war during napoleonic wars at end of century and were re equipped in case of a popular uprising during this revolutionary period lowry p 45 in ireland dublin castle was rebuilt following a fire and reaffirmed as centre of british administrative and military power bartlett p 179 and 249 many castles remained in use as county gaols run by gaolers as effectively private businesses frequently this involved gatehouse being maintained as main prison building as at cambridge bridgnorth lancaster newcastle and st briavels pounds 1994 p 100 harding hines ireland and rawlings p 114 curnow and johnson p 95 during 1770s prison reformer john howard conducted his famous survey of prisons and gaols culminating in his 1777 work state of prisons harding hines ireland and rawlings p 114 this documented poor quality of these castle facilities prisoners in norwich castle lived in a dungeon with floor frequently covered by an inch of water oxford was close and offensive worcester was so subject to jail fever that castle surgeon would not enter prison gloucester was wretched in extreme brown 1823 pp 125 128 281 and 419 howard s work caused a shift in public opinion against use of these older castle facilities as gaols social and cultural use thumb wardour castle in england preserved in 18th century as a fashionable ruin by middle of century medieval ruined castles had become fashionable once again they were considered an interesting counterpoint to now conventional palladian classical architecture and a way of giving a degree of medieval allure to their new owners gerrard p 16 creighton 2005 p 85 historian oliver creighton suggests that ideal image of a castle by 1750s included broken soft silhouettes and a decayed rough appearance creighton 2005 p 85 in some cases countryside surrounding existing castles was remodelled to highlight ruins as at castle or at capability brown s reworking of wardour castle alternatively ruins might be repaired and reinforced to present a more suitable appearance as at harewood castle in other cases mottes such as that at groby castle were reused as bases for dramatic follies or alternatively entirely new castle follies could be created either from scratch or by reusing original stonework as occurred during building of conygar tower for which various parts of dunster castle were cannibalised gerrard p 16 creighton 2005 pp 85 86 at same time castles were becoming tourist attractions for first time by 1740s windsor castle had become an early tourist attraction wealthier visitors who could afford to pay castle keeper could enter see curiosities such as castle s narwhal horn and by 1750s buy first guidebooks tite p 110 robinson p 60 first guidebook to kenilworth castle followed in 1777 with many later editions following in coming decades morris p 51 by 1780s and 1790s visitors were beginning to progress as far as chepstow where an attractive female guide escorted tourists around ruins as part of popular wye tour turner 2006 p 25 andrews p 89 in scotland blair castle became a popular attraction on account of its landscaped gardens as did stirling castle with its romantic connections grenier pp 19 and 152 caernarfon in north wales appealed to many visitors especially artists andrews p 131 irish castles proved less popular partially because contemporary tourists regarded country as being somewhat backward and ruins therefore failed to provide necessary romantic contrast with modern life williams 2008 p 37 appreciation of castles developed as century progressed during 1770s and 1780s concept of picturesque ruin was popularised by english clergyman william gilpin gilpin published several works on his journeys through britain expounding concept of correctly picturesque landscape p 60 such a landscape gilpin argued usually required a building such as a castle or other ruin to add consequence to natural picture andrews p 90 paintings in this style usually portrayed castles as indistinct faintly coloured objects in distance in writing picturesque account eschewed detail in favour of bold first impressions on sense andrews pp 78 79 ruins of goodrich particularly appealed to gilpin and his followers conwy was however too well preserved and uninteresting fielding p 62 andrews p 125 by contrast artistic work of antiquarians james bentham and james essex at end of century while stopping short of being genuine archaeology was detailed and precise enough to provide a substantial base of architectural fine detail on medieval castle features and enabled work of architects such as wyatt gerrard p 29 19th century military and governmental use thumb carrickfergus castle in ireland retrofitted with gun ports for coastal defence in early 19th century military utility of remaining castles in britain and ireland continued to diminish some castles became regimental depots including carlisle castle and chester castle carrickfergus castle was re equipped with gunports in order to provide coastal defences at end of napoleonic period lowry p 39 political instability was a major issue during early 19th century and popularity of chartist movement led to proposals to refortify tower of london in event of civil unrest impey and parnell p 81 in ireland dublin castle played an increasing role in ireland as fenian pressures for independence grew during century operation of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised since john howard s work in 1770s and pressure for reform continued to grow in 1850s and 1860s wiener p 108 reform of legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts and in process eliminated purpose of debtor s prisons in castles such as st briavels rajak p 14 efforts were made to conditions in local prisons but without much success and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised british prisons including prisons at castles like york wiener p 108 cooper p 196 fox pp 47 48 compensation was paid to former owners although in cases such as york where facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction this payment was denied mcconville p 505 in short term this led to a 39 per cent reduction in number of prisons in england including some famous castle prisons such as norwich over coming years centralisation and changes in prison design led to closure of most remaining castle prisons bailey p 80 mcconville pp 194 and 197 social and cultural use thumb right edinburgh castle in scotland in middle of 19th century already a popular tourist location by victorian period many castles saw increased visitors by tourists helped by better transport links and growth of railways armouries at tower of london opened for tourists in 1828 with 40 000 visitors in their first year by 1858 numbers had grown to over 100 000 a year gerrard p 31 attractions such as warwick castle received 6 000 visitors during 1825 to 1826 many of them travelling from growing industrial towns in nearby midlands while victorian tourists recorded being charged six pence to wander around ruins of goodrich castle goodrich p 523 hassard p 145 gerrard p 31 spread of railway system across wales and marches strongly influenced flow of tourists to region s castles bruce p 104 in scotland tourist tours became increasingly popular during 19th century usually starting at edinburgh complete with edinburgh castle and then spending up to two weeks further north taking advantage of expanding rail and steamer network grenier pp 69 70 blair castle remained popular but additional castles joined circuit cawdor castle became popular once railway line reached north to fort william grenier p 73 purchasing and reading guidebooks became an increasingly important part of visiting castles by 1820s visitors could buy an early guidebook at goodrich outlining castle s history first guidebook to tower of london was published in 1841 and scottish castle guidebooks became well known for providing long historical accounts of their sites often drawing on plots of romantic novels for details grenier p 152 jones p 290 indeed sir walter scott s historical novels ivanhoe and kenilworth helped to establish popular victorian image of a gothic medieval castle gerrard p 30 scott s novels set in scotland also popularised several northern castles including tantallon which was featured in marmion grenier p 82 histories of ireland began to stress role of castles in rise of protestantism and british values in ireland although tourism remained limited thumb left penrhyn castle in wales an early 19th century recreation of a norman castle one response to this popularity was in commissioning construction of replica castles gerrard p 32 these were particularly popular at beginning of 19th century and again later in victorian period design manuals were published offering details of how to recreate appearance of an original gothic castles in a new build leading to a flurry of work such as eastnor in 1815 fake norman castle of penrhyn between 1827 and 1837 and imitation edwardian castle of goodrich court in 1828 gerrard p 32 harris p 123 later victorians built welsh castell coch in 1880s as a fantasy gothic construction and last such replica castle drogo was built as late as 1911 creighton and higham pp 63 65 another response was to improve existing castles bringing their often chaotic historic features into line with a more integrated architectural aesthetic in a style often termed gothic revivalism jones p 4 there were numerous attempts to restore or rebuild castles so as to produce a consistently gothic style informed by genuine medieval details a movement in which architect anthony salvin was particularly prominent as illustrated by his reworking of alnwick and much of windsor castle a similar trend can be seen at rothesay where william burges renovated older castle to produce a more authentic design heavily influenced by work of french architect eugene viollet le duc north of border this resulted in distinctive style of scots baronial style architecture which took french and traditional medieval scottish features and reinvented them in a baroque style whyte and whyte pp 98 99 style also proved popular in ireland with george jones oliver castle in 1850s for example forming a good example of fashion o dwyer p 26 as with gothic revivalism scots baronial architects frequently improved existing castles floors castle was transformed in 1838 by william playfair who added grand turrets and cupolas west p 116 in a similar way 16th century tower house of lauriston castle was turned into victorian ideal of a rambling medieval house style spread south and famous architect edward blore added a scots baronial touch to his work at windsor robinson p 121 with this pace of change concerns had begun to grow by middle of century about threat to medieval buildings in britain and in 1877 william morris established society for protection of ancient buildings mynors p 8 one result of public pressure was passing of ancient monuments protection act 1882 but provisions of act focused on unoccupied prehistoric structures and medieval buildings such as castles were exempted from it leaving no legal protection gerrard p 30 mynors p 8 20th 21st century 1900 1945 thumb beaumaris castle in wales showing its restored appearance following work in 1920s during first half of century several castles were maintained or brought back into military use during irish war of independence dublin castle remained centre of british administration military and intelligence operations in ireland until transfer of power and castle to irish free state in 1922 cottrell pp 16 20 during second world war tower of london was used to hold and execute suspected spies and was used to briefly detain rudolf hess adolf hitler s deputy in 1941 executions at tower of london historic royal palaces accessed 31 july 2010 impey and parnell p 123 edinburgh castle was used as a prisoner of war facility while windsor castle was stripped of more delicate royal treasures and used to guard british royal family from dangers of blitz tabraham 2004 p 63 shawcross p 487 some coastal castles were used to support naval operations dover castle s medieval fortifications used as basis for defences across dover strait pitreavie castle in scotland was used to support royal navy and carrickfergus castle in ireland was used as a coastal defence base lowry p 45 creighton and higham p 62 reid pp 56 57 some castles such as cambridge and pevensey were brought into local defence plans in case of a german invasion lowry p 23 creighton and higham p 62 a handful of these castles retained a military role after war dover was used as a nuclear war command centre into 1950s while pitreavie was used by nato until turn of 21st century lowry p 45 creighton and higham p 62 reid p 57 strong cultural interest in british castles persisted in 20th century in some cases this had destructive consequences as wealthy collectors bought and removed architectural features and other historical artefacts from castles for their own collections a practice that produced significant official concern gerrard p 76 some of more significant cases included st donat s castle bought by william randolph hearst in 1925 and then decorated with numerous medieval buildings removed from their original sites around britain and case of hornby where many parts of castle were sold off and sent to buyers in united states gerrard pp 76 77 partially as a result of these events increasing legal powers were introduced to protect castles acts of parliament in 1900 and 1910 widened terms of earlier legislation on national monuments to allow inclusion of castles an act of parliament in 1913 introduced preservation orders for first time and these powers were extended in 1931 gerrard p 77 mynors p 9 similarly after end of irish civil war new irish state took early action to extend and strengthen previous british legislation to protect irish national monuments zuelow p 140 around beginning of century there were a number of major restoration projects on british castles before outbreak of first world war work was undertaken at chepstow bodiam caernarfon and after end of war various major state funded restoration projects occurred in 1920s with pembroke caerphilly and goodrich amongst largest of these gerrard p 66 creighton and higham p 64 turner 2006 p 25 this work typically centred on cutting back vegetation encroaching on castle ruins especially ivy and removing damaged or unstable stonework castles such as beaumaris saw their moats cleaned and reflooded creighton and higham p 64 gerrard p 66 some castles such as eilean donan in scotland were substantially rebuilt in inter war years early uk film industry took an interest in castles as potential sets starting with ivanhoe filmed at chepstow castle in 1913 and starring us leading actor king creighton and higham pp 65 66 turner 2006 pp 25 26 1945 21st century thumb durham castle in england declared a unesco world heritage site in 1980s after second world war picturesque ruins of castles became unfashionable conservation preference was to restore castles so as to produce what oliver creighton and robert higham have described as a meticulously cared for fabric neat lawns and a highly regulated visitor friendly environment although reconstruction or reproduction of original appearance of castles was discouraged creighton and higham p 65 as a result stonework and walls of today s castles used as tourist attractions are usually in much better condition than would have been case in medieval period pounds 1994 p 126 preserving broader landscapes of past also rose in importance reflected in decision by unesco world heritage site programme to internationally recognise several british castles including beaumaris caernarfon conwy harlech durham and tower of london as deserving of special international cultural significance in 1980s creighton and higham p 64 single largest group of english castles are now those owned by english heritage created out of former ministry of works in 1983 pettifer 2002 p xxi delafons pp 137 140 national trust increasingly acquired castle properties in england in 1950s and is second largest single owner followed by various english local authorities and finally a small number of private owners pettifer 2002 p xxi royal castles such as tower of london and windsor are owned by occupied royal palaces estate on behalf of nation house of commons public accounts committee p 3 similar organisations exist in scotland where national trust for scotland was established 1931 and in ireland where an taisce was created in 1948 to working alongside irish ministry of works to maintain castles and other sites zuelow pp 142 and 205 some new organisations have emerged in recent years to manage castles such as landmark trust and irish landmark trust which have restored a number of castles in britain and ireland over last few decades castles remain highly popular attractions in 2018 nearly 2 9 million people visited tower of london 2 1 million visited edinburgh castle 466 000 visited leeds castle and 365 000 visited dover castle ireland which for many years had not exploited tourist potential of its castle heritage began to encourage more tourists in 1960s and 1970s and irish castles are now a core part of irish tourist industry zuelow pp 142 146 british and irish castles are today also closely linked to international film industry with tourist visits to castles now often involving not simply a visit to a historic site but also a visit to location of a popular film ryan p 118 thumb left wigmore castle in england preserved in an state following its acquisition by english heritage in 1995 management and handling of britain s historic castles has at times been contentious castles in late 20th and early 21st century are usually considered part of heritage industry in which historic sites and events are commercially presented as visitor attractions gilmour p 82 some academics such as david lowenthal have critiqued way in which these histories are constantly culturally and socially reconstructed and condemned commercial debasement of sites such as tower of london lowenthal 1985 p 278 lowenthal 1996 p 101 cited gilmour p 83 challenge of how to manage these historic properties has often required very practical decisions at one end of spectrum owners and architects have had to deal with practical challenges of repairing smaller decaying castles used as private houses such as that at picton castle where damp proved a considerable problem insall p 52 at other end of scale fire at windsor castle in 1992 opened up a national debate about how burnt out castle wing should be replaced degree to which modern designs should be introduced and who should pay ps37 million costs ps50 2 million in 2009 terms robinson p 145 nicolson p 71 at kenilworth speculative and commercial reconstruction of castle gardens in an elizabethan style led to a vigorous academic debate over interpretation of archaeological and historical evidence greene and moore p 298 trends in conservation have altered and in contrast to prevailing post war approach to conservation recent work at castles such as wigmore acquired by english heritage in 1995 has attempted to minimise degree of intervention to site historiography thumb archaeological investigations in 2009 attempt to identify exact location of ampthill castle earliest histories of british and irish castles were recorded albeit in a somewhat fragmented fashion by john leland in 16th century and by 19th century historical analysis of castles had become popular creighton and higham p 8 victorian historians such as george clark and john parker concluded that british castles had been built for purposes of military defence but believed that their history was pre conquest concluding that mottes across countryside had been built by either romans or celts liddiard 2005 p 3 creighton and p 8 clark 1884 parker 1882 study of castles by historians and archaeologists developed considerably during 20th century early 20th century historian and archaeologist ella armitage published a ground breaking book in 1912 arguing convincingly that british castles were in fact a norman introduction while historian alexander thompson also published in same year charting course of military development of english castles through middle ages liddiard 2005 p 3 armitage 1912 thompson 1912 victoria county history of england began to document country s castles on an unprecedented scale providing an additional resource for historical analysis gerrard p 78 after second world war historical analysis of british castles was dominated by arnold taylor r allen brown and d j cathcart king liddiard 2005 p 5 these academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence as 1940s saw an increasing number of excavations of motte and bailey castles and number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during 1960s gerrard p 109 with an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas a public scandal in 1972 surrounding development of baynard s castle site in london contributed to reforms and a re prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology gerrard p 134 despite this number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984 with archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small scale but fewer large scale sites gerrard p 146 study of british castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role however drawing on evolutionary model of improvements suggested by thompson earlier in century liddiard 2005 pp 5 6 in 1990s a wide reaching reassessment of interpretation of british castles took place a vigorous academic discussion over history and meanings behind bodiam castle began a debate which concluded that many features of castles previously seen as primarily military in nature were in fact constructed for reasons of status and political power liddiard 2005 pp 7 11 as historian robert liddiard has described it older paradigm of norman militarism as driving force behind formation of britain s castles was replaced by a model of peaceable power liddiard 2003b p 9 next twenty years was characterised by an increasing number of major publications on castle studies examining social and political aspects of fortifications as well as their role in historical landscape liddiard 2005 pp 10 11 although not unchallenged this revisionist perspective remains dominant theme in academic
