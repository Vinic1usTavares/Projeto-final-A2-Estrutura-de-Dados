1939 during soviet union s invasion of finland russian efforts were frustrated following destruction of two armored divisions by finnish soldiers on skis conflict caught global attention as outnumbered and outgunned finnish soldiers were able to use difficult local terrain to their advantage severely hampering soviet attacks and embarrassing their military upon seeing effectiveness of these troops charles minot dole president of national ski patrol began to lobby war department of need for a similar unit of troops in united states army trained for fighting in winter and mountain warfare in september 1940 dole was able to present his case to general george marshall u s army chief of staff who agreed with dole s assessment deciding to create a mountain unit for fighting in

become commanding general of 41st look magazine page 4 25 march 1941 army prompted by fears that its standing force would not perform well in event of a winter attack on northeastern coast as well as knowledge that german army already had three mountain warfare divisions approved concept for a division this required an overhaul of u s military doctrine as concept of winter warfare had not been tested in army since 1914 at first planners envisioned ten mountain divisions but personnel shortages revised goal to three eventually 10th mountain division would be only one brought to active duty military leaders continued to express concern of feasibility of a division sized mountain warfare unit until fall of 1941 when they received reports that greek mountain troops had held back superior numbers of unprepared italian troops in albanian mountains during greco italian war italian military had lost a disastrous 25 000 men in campaign because of their lack of preparedness to fight in
