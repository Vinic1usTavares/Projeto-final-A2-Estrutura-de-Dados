pholiota flammans commonly known as yellow pholiota flaming pholiota or flame scalecap is a basidiomycete agaric mushroom of genus pholiota its fruit body is golden yellow in color throughout while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales as it is a saprobic fungus fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on stumps of dead coniferous trees p flammans is distributed throughout europe north america and asia in boreal and temperate regions its edibility has not been clarified taxonomy this species was first recognised in 1783 by german august batsch as agaricus flammans and later sanctioned by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries in his systema mycologicum specific epithet flammans is a latin adjective meaning flaming in 1871 with recognition of pholiota as an independent genus with type species pholiota squarrosa another german paul kummer renamed fungus pholiota flammans lucien quelet a french mycologist proposed another synonym dryophila flammans in 1886 american mycologist william alphonso murrill called species hypodendrum flammans in his 1912 study of pacific coast mushrooms although he did not explain his rationale for transferring species to hypodendrum in organization of rolf singer species is placed in subgenus pholiota section stirps subflammans a grouping of closely related species that also includes p subflammans and p species in stirps subflammans are characterised by having conspicuous erect tufts or scales on cap surface that are easily sloughed off by rain and age in lieu of gelatinous nature of underlying cap cuticle it is commonly known as yellow pholiota flaming pholiota or flame scalecap description pholiota flammans often has a striking appearance cap is initially round then convex and finally flattening with age its surface is bright yellow to orange and covered with triangular scales squamules arranged in concentric rings thumb left below level of ring stem is covered in arranged squamules cap surface is dry matt and felt like and in wet conditions may lose scales cap margin remain curved slightly inwards yellow gills are crowded together attached to stem and have a notch where gill attaches to stem a bright yellow partial veil extending from cap edge to edge is present in immature species as cap expands and flattens with age partial veil tears leaving a faint ring around stem cylindrical straight or curved stem is itself covered in yellow squamules below ring base of stem typically more orange in color than upper portion is firmly attached to dead wood from which fungus arises section of stem above ring bears little or no protuberances flesh is firm full yellow and does not change color when bruised or injured dimensions of fruit body are as follows cap diameter up to stem up to tall and between cm thick as fruit body matures gills darken to cinnamon brown following spore release spore mass is colored brown to rust microscopic features under a light microscope spores are seen to be smooth elliptical to oblong in shape with dimensions of 3 5 by 2 3 um basidia spore bearing cells are 4 spored and have a narrow club shape with dimension of 18 22 by 3 5 4 5 um gill cystidia are seen to stain blue when cotton blue dye and lactate are applied cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100 um thick layer of gelatinous hyphae that are about 2 4 um thick gelatinous hyphae are only present on cap surface not surface of stem these local differences in cell structure explain ease with which scales are sloughed off cap but not stems of fruit bodies macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail edibility pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no distinctive smell and taste mild to slightly bitter opinions are divided as to its edibility however as some authors regard mushroom as inedible while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility similar species right thumb p squarrosa is a lookalike species other members of genus pholiota may be mistaken for pholiota flammans especially pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts at base of deciduous as well as coniferous trees p squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than p flammans p is also similar but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods unlike p flammans it has gelatinous scales on stem as well as cap north american species once described by alexander h smith p kauffmaniana is closely related to p flammans but differs in having a more distinctly viscid cap smith was later to revise his opinion on existence of p kauffmaniana as a unique species he believed that environmental variations in humidity were cause of differences in cap cuticle observed in collected from different north american locales p kauffmaniana is now considered synonymous with p flammans habitat and distribution being saprobic p flammans is found exclusively on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly from summer to autumn it is a fungus with a wide geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions and may be considered common to rare depending upon region in which it occurs it is found throughout europe from british isles to russia and north america southern canada and united states species has also been collected in asia including india
