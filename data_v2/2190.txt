who were regarded untouchables see dalits they were agricultural labourers and singers another description considers nandanar from dalit caste of paraiyar who served as labourers and were drummers as per caste code thumb left nandanar was longing to see icon of nataraja in thillai nataraja temple chidambaram a fresco in temple depicting nataraja nandanar was born in poverty in pulai slums of adanur he was a staunch devotee of god shiva patron god of shaivism he was a leather maker who crafted drums and other musical instruments he also served as a village servant a watchman a labourer as well as town crier who used to beat drums in nandanar s times dalits were not allowed to enter hindu temples so nandanar would stand outside a shiva temple and sing praises of shiva and dance however he harboured a strong urge to pay his respects to icon of shiva at sivalokanathar temple tirupunkur he stood outside temple but a huge stone nandi bull mount of shiva whose sculpture is generally seen in shiva temples facing shiva in garbhagriha sanctum sanctorum blocked his path of vision compassionate shiva ordered nandi to move a little to side and bull complied allowing nayanar to see central icon of shiva unobstructed nandanar cleaned up surroundings of temple and dug a pond which serves as temple tank in honour of shiva he circumambulated shrine and returned to adanur nandanar visited many temples of shiva and served god once he longed to visit thillai nataraja temple of chidambaram which shiva as nataraja lord of dance he used to say everyday that he will go next day to chidambaram but never actually dared to step in holy town where he was prohibited entry thus he came to be known as tiru nalai povar he who will go tomorrow finally nandanar reached boundary of chidambaram but feared to set foot in town he saw smoke of fire sacrifices and heard chants of vedic scriptures thinking about how he can see nataraja s dancing icon nayanar circumambulated town numerous times and finally succumbed to fatigue and slept shiva appeared in his dream and told nandanar to enter temple through a holy fire god also informed brahmin priests of chidambaram to prepare a pyre next day brahmins approached nandanar as per divine order nandanar entered holy fire chanting name of shiva and reappeared in a new purified form he looked like a brahmin sage wearing matted hair characteristic of a shaiva and sacred thread worn by brahmins across his chest his body was smeared with sacred ash gods showered flowers on nayanar from heaven and brahmins cheered with brahmins nandanar went in garbhagriha and saw nataraja nayanar disappeared in image of nataraja and became one with shiva periya puranam version is interpreted as a brahmanical narrative where a particular dalit is granted salvation by transforming into a brahmin superiority of brahmins is reinforced and legitimacy of ban of dalits is not challenged p sampath president of tamil nadu untouchability eradication front tnuef and an office bearer politician from tamil nadu unit of communist party of india marxist known as cpi m calls chidambaram fire trail as brahmin propaganda to conceal truth that nandanar was burnt at stake nandanar charitam thumb k b sundarambal left as nandanar and viswanatha iyer as vediyar in 1935 film nandanar bharati was an ardent devotee of shiva and wrote three operas in honour of various nayanar saints though bharati was himself an upper caste brahmin he was a crusader for rights of dalits while sekkizhar exalts nandanar s devotion to shiva bharati presents grim reality of ostracization that nayanar suffered bharati s nandanar is not a rebel but only a protester nandanar charitam focuses on atrocities that nandanar and dalits as a whole had to suffer at hands of upper castes opera nandanar charitam was embedded with social message that shiva grants emancipation irrespective of caste play starts with term may i come a warning to higher caste people that dalits had to cry out before entering any street so as to not pollute higher caste members nayanar first clashes with his own dalit brethren they oppose his devotion for lord of chidambaram whom they call a brahmin god dalit elders headed by define his duties as a pariah and advise him to not confront caste rules they tell him to worship folk deities of pariah instead of shiva god of brahmanical hinduism dalits also feel that nandanar needs to abide by social norms and give up his taboo idea of entering a temple a villainous brahmin landlord vetiyar vediyar appears in bharati s tale he torments his bonded labourer nandanar and chastises him repeatedly for trying to go beyond caste norms vetiyar sees nandanar s bhakti and desire to enter a temple not only as undesirable and irreligious but also as a serious threat to his social status vetiyar refuses to grant him permission to chidambaram and even resorts to violence after much persuasion brahmin relents on condition that saint do an impossible task of cultivating and harvesting field in one night aided by shiva s attendant ganas saint completes task brahmin realizes piety of nayanar apologizes to him and lets him go bharati retained final confrontation with brahmins of chidambaram and his ritual purification by fire bharati concludes in a poem saying that it is said in epics that lord worshipped by gopalakrishna granted salvation even to untouchables variants thumb upright nandanar depicted as part of nayanars group in stories of higher caste hindus especially brahmins nandanar is a brahmin or god himself somehow trapped in body of an untouchable and whose true form is revealed by fire trial other tales focus on his strict adherence to caste norms his obedience of his brahmin master and his refusal to enter holy temple as an untouchable dalits strongly believe in his piety and portray brahmins as root cause of all misery of nayanar nandanar fits in dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to higher castes they say that nandanar was swallowed by god sashes round nataraja s waist are interpreted as legs of saint who merged into god temple lore of tirupunkur narrates that shiva instructed his son ganesha to aid nandanar in digging temple tank named nandanar tirtha after saint another variant tells that ganesha dug up tank in night so that nandanar can bathe in its sacred waters before seeing shiva in temple in early half of 20th century novel nandan by a iyengar and g iyengar includes reformist brahmin characters that argue nandan s case against their peers nandan also echoes reformist ideas of hindu spiritual leaders like ramanuja and vivekananda and progressive upper caste leaders short story nandan by 1906 1948 places

indira parthasarathy s nandan kathai 1978 builds tale of nandanar referred in work as nandan further introducing two non brahmin upper caste landholders who are as ruthless as bharati s vediyar nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art rather than god he wants to see cosmic dance of nataraja a devadasi called abhirami also appears no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives indira is blunt in reprimanding dalits for not understanding nandanar nandan kathai is a quest for liberation of dalits and women alike unlike earlier narratives indira s tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy vediyar priest vediyar landlord and two non brahmin upper caste landholders hatch a plot to end nandan they make nandanar believe that god harvested crop from field an allusion to miracle of vediyar s impossible task in bharati s work then they persuade him to organize a dance contest between bharatnatyam high caste elites dance and folk dance of dalits finally in climax nandanar agrees to undergo a fire trial reassured by earlier miracle but he and abhirami burn in flames upper castes succeed in sending a warning to dalits how trespassers of caste code longing for salvation would be punished celebration in hindu religion thumb upright nandanar depicted as part of nayanars group with a kamandalu and danda staff in hand

and its connection to walled gate can not be ascertained and thus refused protesters demands nandanar continues to inspire them dalits as a symbol of resistance and a hope of a better future however
