without regaining consciousness investigation initial investigation during an autopsy on snow assistant medical examiner janet miller detected scent of bitter almonds an odor distinctive to cyanide tests verified that snow had died of acute cyanide poisoning investigators examined contents of snow webking household and discovered source of cyanide bottle of excedrin capsules that both snow and webking had used morning of snow s death three capsules out of those that remained in 60 capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities a murder by cyanide was sensational news in washington when another tainted bottle from same lot was found in a grocery store in nearby kent manufacturers of excedrin bristol myers responded to discovery with a heavily publicized recall of all excedrin products in seattle area and a group of drug companies came together to offer a 300 000 reward for capture of person responsible in response to publicity nickell came forward on june 19 she told police that her husband had recently died suddenly after taking pills from a 40 capsule bottle of excedrin with same lot number as one that had killed snow tests by fda confirmed presence of cyanide in her husband s remains and in two excedrin bottles nickell had turned over to police initial suspicions were directed at bristol myers both webking and nickell filed wrongful death lawsuits against company and fda inspected morrisville north carolina plant where tainted lot had been packaged but found no traces of cyanide to explain its presence in washington bottles on june 18 bristol myers recalled all excedrin capsules in us pulling them from store shelves and warning consumers to not use any they may already have bought two days later company announced a recall of all of their non prescription capsule products on june 24 a cyanide contaminated bottle of 3 was found at same store where snow had bought her contaminated excedrin on june 27 washington state put into an effect a 90 day ban on sale of non prescription medication in capsules examination of contaminated bottles by fbi crime lab found that in addition to containing cyanide powder poisoned capsules also contained flecks of an unknown green substance further tests showed that substance was an algaecide used in home aquariums sold under brand name algae destroyer focusing investigation with contamination of excedrin at source having been ruled out investigators began to focus their investigation on end users of product fbi began an investigation into possible product tampering having been source of poison at time excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with mouth of bottle sealed with foil and lid secured to bottle with plastic wrap both webking and nickell were asked to take polygraph examinations webking did so but nickell who had started drinking heavily declined a lawyer representing nickell told reporters that she was too shaken up to be subjected to examination investigators suspicions began to turn to nickell when they discovered that she claimed that two contaminated excedrin bottles that she had turned over to police had been purchased at different times and different locations a total of five bottles had been found to be contaminated in entire country and it was regarded as suspicious that nickell would happen to have acquired two of them purely by chance with investigatory focus turned to nickell detectives uncovered more circumstantial evidence pointing to her as culprit nickell had taken out a total of about 76 vary as to exact amount some cite 71 000 some 75 000 and some 76 000 gregg olsen s bitter almonds provides 76 000 as amount based on actual trial testimony in insurance coverage on her husband s life with an additional payout of 100 000 if his death was accidental she was also known to have even before snow s death repeatedly disputed doctors ruling that her husband had died of natural causes further fbi investigation showed that bruce s purported signatures on at least two of insurance policies in his name had been forged investigators were also able to verify that nickell had purchased algae destroyer from a local fish store it was speculated that algaecide had become mixed with cyanide when nickell used same container to crush both substances without washing it in between uses nickell finally consented to a polygraph examination in november 1986 she failed and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further concrete evidence proving that nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking and despite their relative certainty that nickell had orchestrated poisonings as either an elaborate cover up for an insurance motivated murder of her husband or as a desperate attempt to force her husband s death to be ruled an accident to increase her insurance payout they were unable to build a strong case supporting arrest breaking case in january 1987 hamilton now grown approached police with information her mother nickell had spoken to her repeatedly about wanting bruce dead having grown bored with him after he quit drinking nickell hamilton claimed had even told her that she had tried to poison bruce previously with foxglove hidden in capsules when that failed she had begun library research into other methods and hit upon cyanide hamilton also claimed that nickell had spoken to her about what two of them could do with insurance money if bruce was dead records from auburn public library when subpoenaed showed that nickell had checked out numerous books about poisons including human poisonings from native and cultivated plants and deadly harvest former was marked as overdue in library records indicating that nickell had borrowed but never returned it fbi identified nickell s fingerprints on cyanide related pages of a number of works she had checked out during this period by summer of 1987 even nickell s attorneys acknowledged that she was prime suspect in case arrest and trial on december 9 1987 nickell was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts of product tampering including two which resulted in deaths of bruce and snow and arrested same day she went on trial in april 1988 and was found guilty of all charges on may 9 after five days of jury deliberation nickell s legal team sought a mistrial on grounds of jury tampering and judicial misconduct one of jurors had been a plaintiff in a case involving a pill baked into farm goldfish crackers while it was deemed to be a manufacturing error defense thought that it involved product tampering and therefore should have been disclosed during jury selection however motion was denied nickell was sentenced to two terms of 90 years in prison for deaths of bruce and snow and three 10 year terms for other product tampering charges all sentences were to run concurrently and judge ordered nickell to pay a small fine and forfeit her remaining assets to families of her victims nickell became eligible

jury tampering and judicial misconduct issues was rejected by united states court of appeals for ninth circuit in august 1989 a second appeal beginning in 2001 was filed by nickell s new attorney carl park colbert based on evidence obtained by private detectives al farr and paul ciolino requesting a new trial on basis of new evidence having been discovered that fbi may have withheld documents from defense appeal was denied though nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence nickell claimed that her daughter hamilton lied about her involvement in case in order to reap 300 000 of reward money being offered hamilton eventually collected 250 000 of that money nickell also alleges among other things that evidence actually points to another person as killer and that testimony about various smaller details in case such as store owner who testified about her having purchased algae destroyer was influenced by promises of payment fda regulations after 1982 chicago tylenol murders new fda regulations went into effect which made it a federal crime rather than just a state or local crime to tamper with consumer products local and state authorities are not however prevented from also filing charges in such cases under this law nickell s crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case as well as a state murder case and she was not convicted of murder but of product tampering that caused death possibility of state charges for actual murders of bruce and snow continues to exist in media seattle author gregg olsen wrote about nickell case in his 1993 book bitter
