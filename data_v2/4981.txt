siege of thessalonica between 1422 and 1430 saw ottoman empire under sultan murad ii capture city of thessalonica which remained in ottoman hands for next five centuries until it became part of kingdom of greece in 1912 thessalonica had already been under ottoman control from 1387 to 1403 before returning to byzantine rule in aftermath of battle of ankara in 1422 after byzantines supported mustafa celebi as a rival pretender against him murad attacked thessalonica unable to provide manpower or resources for city s defense its ruler andronikos palaiologos handed it over to republic of venice in september 1423 venetians attempted to persuade sultan to recognize their possession but failed as murad considered city his by right and venetians to be interlopers this impasse led to an ottoman blockade of thessalonica which occasionally flared up with direct attacks on city at same time conflict was mostly fought as a series of raids by both sides against other s territories in balkans and aegean islands venetians repeatedly tried to apply pressure by blocking passage of dardanelles at gallipoli with little success blockade quickly reduced inhabitants to near starvation and led many to flee city restrictions placed on them by siege inability of venice to properly supply and guard city violations of their customary rights and rampant profiteering by venetian officials led to formation of a pro surrender party within city which gained strength among inhabitants city s metropolitan bishop symeon encouraged his flock to resist however by 1426 with venice s inability to secure peace on its own terms evident a majority of local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid pillage that would accompany a forcible conquest venice s efforts to find allies against ottomans also failed other regional potentates either pursued their own course were themselves antagonistic to venetians or were defeated by ottomans after years of inconclusive exchanges two sides prepared for a final confrontation in 1429 in march venice formally declared war on ottomans but even then conservative mercantile aristocracy running republic were uninterested in raising an army sufficient to protect thessalonica let alone to force sultan to seek terms in early 1430 murad was able to concentrate his forces against thessalonica taking it by storm on 29 march 1430 privations of siege and subsequent sack reduced city to a shadow of its former self from perhaps as many as 40 000 inhabitants to and necessitated large scale resettlement in following years venice concluded a peace treaty with sultan in july recognizing new status quo over next few decades antagonism between venice and ottomans morphed into a rivalry over control of albania background thumb right 300px map

powers of region notably declining byzantine empire were weak and divided allowing a rapid turkish expansion across region conducted both by ottomans themselves and by semi independent turkish ghazi warrior bands in 1369 ottomans were able to capture adrianople third most important city of byzantine empire after its capital constantinople and thessalonica thessalonica ruled by byzantine prince and future emperor manuel ii palaiologos itself surrendered in 1387 after a lengthy siege 1383 1387 along with cities of christopolis and chrysopolis initially surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of poll tax following death of emperor john v palaiologos in 1391 however manuel ii escaped ottoman custody and went to constantinople where he was crowned emperor succeeding his father this angered sultan bayezid i who laid waste to remaining byzantine territories and then turned on chrysopolis which was captured by storm and largely destroyed thessalonica submitted again to ottoman rule at this time possibly after a brief period of resistance but was treated more leniently although city was brought under full ottoman control christian population and church retained most of their possessions and city retained its institutions thessalonica remained in ottoman hands until 1403 when emperor manuel ii sided with bayezid s eldest son suleyman in ottoman succession struggle that broke out following crushing defeat of ottomans and capture of bayezid at battle of ankara against turco mongol conqueror timur in 1402 in exchange for his support by treaty of gallipoli byzantine emperor secured return of thessalonica part of its hinterland chalcidice peninsula and coastal region between rivers strymon and pineios despite restoration of byzantine rule relations between thessalonica and constantinople remained troubled with thessalonica s local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges which according to modern scholars amounted to virtual autonomy this was part of a wider phenomenon attested for several cities during last century of byzantine history as central authority weakened and centrifugal tendencies manifested themselves in thessalonica s case a tendency to pursue increased independence from imperial capital had been evident at least since zealot movement of mid 14th century and had been reinforced by manuel ii s autonomous regime in 1382 1387 thus after they returned to byzantine control thessalonica and surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to john vii palaiologos after his death in 1408 he was succeeded by manuel s third son despot andronikos palaiologos who was supervised by demetrios until 1415 during this time thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity as turks were preoccupied with their own civil war although it was attacked by rival ottoman pretenders in 1412 by musa celebi and 1416 during uprising of mustafa celebi against mehmed i once ottoman civil war ended turkish pressure on city built up again just as during 1383 1387 siege this led to a sharp division of opinion within city between factions supporting resistance if necessary with western european latin help and those urging submission to ottomans first ottoman attacks and handover of city to venice thumb right alt miniature showing two parents and their three

of byzantine state laid siege unsuccessfully to constantinople from 10 june to 6 september 1422 in june 1422 bey son of evrenos assisted by various ottoman marcher lords of balkans besieged thessalonica as well and ravaged its suburbs and western portion of chalcidice according to city s metropolitan bishop symeon in office 1416 17 1429 both he and despot andronikos sent repeated pleas for aid to constantinople but imperial government was short of resources and preoccupied with its own problems eventually a single unnamed commander was sent to city but he brought neither men nor money with him this commander proposed setting up a common fund of citizens to support defence but this proposal met with vehement opposition particularly from wealthy aristocrats who would naturally have borne brunt of cost common people likewise proved unwilling to contribute when news spread that ottomans had offered a peaceful settlement provided that despot andronikos left city commoners even rioted in favour of an accommodation with ottomans at that point a group of aristocrats persuaded despot to seek assistance of republic of venice an initiative probably taken without consulting constantinople in spring 1423 via venetian colony of negroponte he informed venetians of his intention to hand over city to them when he informed venetians they were appalled only conditions andronikos attached to his offer were that property customs and privileges of city s inhabitants their right to trade and come and go freely and position of city s orthodox church be respected and that venice pledge to defend city against ottomans 16th century chronicler pseudo sphrantzes claims that andronikos sold city for 50 000 ducats and this statement was often accepted by scholars until mid 20th century this is not mentioned in any other source nor is it found in original documents pertaining to affair as shown by scholars konstantinos mertzios and paul lemerle on other hand venetian envoys appointed to oversee handover were authorized to provide a sum of 20 000 40 000 aspers from revenue of city as a yearly subsidy to andronikos should he request it offer arrived in venice at an opportune time election of francesco foscari on 15 april 1423 as doge of venice had placed a proponent of a more aggressive and unyielding stance against ottoman expansionism at head of republic but majority of great council of venice was still dominated by more cautious tendencies of merchant nobility that ruled republic and they feared disruption to trade that open war with ottomans would bring since fourth crusade venetians had consciously adopted a policy of gradually acquiring outposts fortresses and islands from collapsing byzantine empire providing bases that secured venice s valuable trading links with east for some time venice had viewed thessalonica as a possible expansion target especially as constantinople seemed to be on verge of falling to turks thus in 1419 venice re established a consulate in city headed by a local greek george and after his death in 1422 by his brother demetrios at a session of great council on 7 july andronikos offer was accepted council sent notices to venetian colonies in aegean sea negroponte nauplia tinos and mykonos and vassal duke of naxos to prepare ships to take possession of city while republic s bailo at constantinople was instructed to secure assent of emperor manuel a week later santo venier and niccolo giorgio were named plenipotentiary envoys and tasked with going to greece and if despot andronikos were still willing taking over city and arranging for its defence by hiring mercenaries giorgio was then to go before sultan inform him of venice s acquisition of city and justify it as an expedient to prevent city from being captured by other christians who might have been hostile to sultan envoys were also to arrange for peace both between sultan and republic and between sultan and emperor manuel emperor manuel evidently gave his assent to proposal for on 14 september 1423 six venetian galleys accompanied by one byzantine galley entered harbour of thessalonica venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours for thessalonians venetian rule meant not only security from turks some 5 000 ottoman troops were besieging city but more immediately a secure flow of supplies nevertheless large segments of population continued to support seeking of a settlement with ottomans writings of metropolitan symeon record that a number of inhabitants fled at this time to ottomans this sentiment even included some members of nobility contemporary byzantine historian doukas records that soon after taking over city venetians imprisoned four leading aristocrats led by a certain for their association with ottomans four men were exiled first to crete and then to venice itself and padua only after fall of thessalonica in 1430 were two survivors released contemporary venetian morosini

and imprisoned by murad ottomans refused to accept handover considering venetian presence illegal on account of their previous right to city through conquest ottoman attitude was summed up by reply allegedly given by murad to venetian ambassadors seeking peace as recorded by doukas when news of giorgio s arrest arrived in venice great council decided to replace both him and venier first two choices for replacement jacopo trevisan and fantino michiel refused but in may 1424 bernardo loredan was named duke governor of city with jacopo dandolo as captain military commander for a two year term in meantime venier was instructed to secure release of giorgio and recognition from sultan of venetian control over thessalonica surrounding villages and fort of mount chortiatis in exchange he was to offer an annual tribute of 1 000 to 2 000 ducats and to distribute annuities to sultan s chief courtiers same instructions were given to new captain general of fleet pietro loredan who sailed for thessalonica if he found city under siege loredan was to attack gallipoli where he had scored a major victory in 1416 hinder passage of ottoman troops over dardanelles and if practicable to try and stir up opposition to sultan among neighbouring rulers to emphasize fact that venice did not desire war loredan was instructed to inform local turkish commanders that his actions were only as a consequence of imprisonment of giorgio and siege of thessalonica which they had acquired legally this set pattern for six year conflict between ottomans and venice over control of thessalonica while ottomans blockaded and attacked thessalonica from land trying to starve it into surrender republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute to back up their diplomatic efforts venetians tried to put pressure on sultan by stirring up trouble along ottomans periphery sponsoring efforts for an anti ottoman crusade and sending their fleet to attack gallipoli ottomans likewise tried to distract venice by launching raids of their own on venetian possessions in aegean venetians had a possible and willing ally in person of junayd ruler of turkish aydinid principality in central western anatolia junayd was a capable and energetic ruler who tried to form a broad anti ottoman alliance with another turkish principality karamanids of central anatolia and to renew ottoman civil war by sending another ottoman prince ismail to rumelia ottoman ruled part of balkans in course of this conflict murad allied himself with venice s rival republic of genoa to blockade coasts of junayd s domain and prevent ismail from setting sail junayd was finally subdued in spring 1425 depriving venice of his assistance in february 1424 murad concluded a peace with byzantines who returned almost all lands they had gained in 1403 and reduced to constantinople and its environs became tributary vassals to ottomans once more efforts at a crusade meanwhile faltered on persistent rivalry of venice and king of hungary sigismund protagonist of failed anti ottoman crusade of nicopolis in 1396 over possession of dalmatia both venice and hungary attempted to exploit momentary ottoman weakness and resulting turmoil in balkans to expand their territories venice in dalmatia and albania sigismund in bosnia serbia and wallachia venice seized zara split and other dalmatian cities from hungary between 1412 and 1420 this policy brought republic into conflict with despot of serbia stefan lazarevic between 1420 and 1423 forcing latter to seek aid of ottomans emperors manuel ii and john viii along with king of poland wladyslaw ii jagiello tried to effect a reconciliation between venice and sigismund but in vain it was only in 1425 when murad ii freed from threats to his anatolian possessions went on counter offensive that venice itself recognized necessity of an alliance with sigismund nevertheless despite additional pressure for a rapprochement from savoy and florence sigismund refused this dispute allowed ottomans to bring serbia and bosnia back into vassalage and after murad stopped sigismund s advance at siege of golubac in 1428 a truce was arranged between two powers diplomatic and military events 1425 in meantime despite activities of loredan around gallipoli situation in thessalonica was so dire by october 1424 that great council had to authorize dispatch to city of between 150 and 200 soldiers as well as supplies and money on 13 january 1425 venetians decided to equip 25 galleys an unusually large and expensive undertaking for next year fantino michiel was appointed captain general fleet sailed in april and was tasked both with settling affairs in venetian colonies and with reassuring thessalonians of venetian support michiel was also instructed to make contact with sultan and pledge considerable sums to grand vizier ibrahim pasha and other members of ottoman court in order to gain a sympathetic hearing republic proposed to restore salt pans that sultan had previously controlled as well as tribute of 100 000 aspers that despot andronikos had paid venetians refused however to allow turks in city to be tried by their own kadi as had been case under andronikos and insisted on reinstatement of customs posts at city gates michiel was further tasked with securing release of venetian citizens taken during an ottoman raid into morea previous march and re confirming previous peace treaty of 1419 including if possible restitution of marquisate of bodonitsa to its ruler niccolo iii zorzi in july 1425 ten venetian galleys under michiel undertook an expedition east along shores of macedonia venetians found abandoned by its ottoman garrison but full of provisions which they loaded onto their ships after setting fire to town and five other forts in vicinity fleet moved onto christopolis venetians found castle held by a 400 strong force of ottoman under command of ismail bey first attempt to land led by alvise loredan was repulsed and only after all ships mustered their forces were venetians able to overcome ottoman resistance in a four hour long battle 41 turks were killed including ismail bey and 30 taken prisoner after strengthening site with a stone wall and earthworks and leaving a garrison of 80 foot soldiers and 50 crossbowmen to hold it fleet departed turks soon returned with a larger force of 10 000 12 000 men and after about twenty days and despite losing around 800 men ottomans stormed castle unable to escape half venetians were killed and rest taken prisoner on 21 july manuel ii died and john viii formally became emperor in response murad who was deeply hostile towards john launched his forces on raids around thessalonica and zetouni lamia in central greece at same time greeks of thessalonica sent an embassy to great council to complain of violations of their rights by duke and captain among other things they insisted that venetians fortify kassandreia on western chalcidice to protect kassandra peninsula from ottoman raids in response michiel occupied fort of kassandreia which he refortified and strengthened by construction of two smaller forts in area he then captured platamon castle on opposite side of thermaic gulf by storm after setting fire to its main bailey when ottoman garrison refused to surrender platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after for it is not mentioned again following michiel s request great council sent 200 men from padua to man thessalonica and forts of kassandreia and authorized captain general to maintain four galleys in area from his letters to great council it appears that michiel was simultaneously engaged in negotiations with ottomans as part of which he offered 20 000 aspers a year to ottoman governor of thessaly turahan bey and to grand vizier at same time according to codex morosini a pretender claiming to be mustafa celebi arrived in thessalonica and gathered a growing following of turks who considered him to be true son of sultan bayezid pseudo mustafa launched raids against murad s forces from city but after both mustafa and venetian captain were almost captured during one of these actions on 3 september great council issued instructions to stop such raids and keep gates of city shut diplomatic and military events 1426 1427 thumb right alt profile

michiel came near to a settlement with ottoman governor at gallipoli whereby republic would keep thessalonica in exchange for 100 000 aspers a year right of disputes between turks in city to be settled by their own kadi and free and untaxed movement of merchants to and from city negotiations foundered again however as ottomans insisted on their control of kassandra and chortiatis which they intended as springboards for eventual conquest of city at same time ottomans launched a mayor attack on city with reportedly 30 000 men but presence of five venetian galleys in city possibly armed with small cannons helped defenders repel attack according to report of loredan and dandolo to great council 700 crossbowmen manned walls and over 2 000 turks were killed before assault failed on 6 may a new duke and captain for city were elected paolo trevisan and paolo orio in july 1426 new venetian captain general andrea mocenigo was instructed to resume negotiations but concede to ottomans possession of kassandra and chortiatis on other hand peace settlement should be comprehensive including latin lords of aegean who were venetian citizens and clients failing that mocenigo was to attack gallipoli in august despot of serbia stefan lazarevic offered his services as mediator on 28 november mocenigo managed to receive murad s agreement to a peace treaty on broad lines of agreement proposed by michiel except that venice would pay an annual tribute of 150 000 aspers and increased annuities for senior members of ottoman court and would surrender chortiatis despite republic s desire to conclude a peace treaty months and years dragged on without an agreement benedetto emo appointed ambassador to sultan in july 1427 with express purpose of ratifying treaty was replaced in august 1428 by jacopo dandolo dandolo was instructed if necessary to offer a further increase of tribute to 300 000 aspers and a total sum of gifts from 10 000 15 000 ducats and a further 2 000 ducats as annuities further sums could be offered in exchange for possession of environs of thessalonica kassandra and salt works dandolo did not have any more success than his predecessor sultan demanded of him surrender of thessalonica and when dandolo replied that he did not have authority to do this sultan had him thrown in prison where he was left to die diplomatic and military events 1428 1429 throughout confrontation over thessalonica ottomans launched constant raids against venetian possessions in albania in early spring 1428 ottoman fleet launched a major raid against venetian possessions in greece 40 to 65 vessels raided island of euboea and took about 700 venetian citizens prisoner before going on to raid environs of two venetian outposts of modon and coron in southwestern morea when news arrived in venice on 22 april even though previous year s guard fleet under guido da canal was still abroad a guard fleet of 15 galleys was authorized to hunt ottoman raiders under andrea mocenigo in event new fleet did not sail until september after canal s fleet was defeated at gallipoli by a coalition of ottoman and christian ships ottoman naval threat became particularly acute at this time due to defection of duke of naxos giovanni ii crispo although a venetian citizen and vassal of republic mounting ottoman pressure on his possessions had forced great council to authorize him to enter into a separate peace treaty with ottomans which crispo duly did as a result crispo was forced to effectively assist turks in their own raids and ceased signalling venetians in euboea of impending ottoman raids via beacons in early march 1429 an ottoman fleet even appeared before thessalonica and captured two venetian vessels according to venetian senator andrea suriano venice spent on average 60 000 ducats per year in this seemingly fruitless conflict but venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources fully to thessalonica its proximity to centre of ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in long term while at same time closer to home venice was pursuing a conflict with duchy of milan over control of northern italy republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on ottomans but now it had little choice dandolo s imprisonment increasing ottoman naval threat with open assistance of genoese colonies at chios and lesbos in conjunction with end of their war with hungary made clear to venetians that sultan was preparing to settle question of thessalonica by force as a result on 29 march 1429 great council voted an official declaration of war against sultan and ordered more ships to be activated to join fleet on 11 may pretender mustafa appeared before great council and was given a gift of 150 ducats for his services on 4 june a new duke and captain were elected for thessalonica paolo contarini and andrea donato after first three pairs chosen all declined post despite fine attached to refusal a clear indication of unwillingness of venetian nobles to undertake this unprofitable and perilous task on 1 july mocenigo attacked ottoman ships at gallipoli but although he led his flagship to break through palisade protecting ottoman anchorage other venetian vessels did not follow forcing mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties even at this point venice would not commit its full force to conflict when suriano as a proponent of hawkish faction proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against ottomans in january 1430 proposal was voted down even though it was rather modest and clearly inadequate to force sultan to come to terms instead great council instructed new captain general silvestro morosini to seek mediation of byzantine emperor for a settlement on lines of previous agreements aware of their own weakness venetians tried to form alliances with other regional rulers who feared ottoman expansionism taking advantage of ottomans preoccupation with siege of golubac ibrahim ii of karaman had managed to gain control of area of hamid and in august 1429 through mediation of king janus of cyprus venetians approached ibrahim for an alliance against murad rather than resulting in a military alliance however prospect of a venetian cypriot karamanid league served to bring ottomans closer with other great muslim power of eastern mediterranean mamluks of egypt and initiate a period where two states made common cause against latin presence in area venetians also tried to influence murad towards a peace with threat posed by ambitions of timur s son shahrukh especially after latter s defeat of kara in september 1429 brought him within striking distance of ottomans anatolian domains contemporary rumour ascribed to him not only a desire to restore his father s dominance over region but to cross ottoman territories into rumelia and return to azerbaijan via northern shore of black sea in event shahrukh retired to winter in azerbaijan whereupon murad ordered his general hamza bey to lead his forces from anatolia to europe in february 1430 and sent him against thessalonica thessalonica under venetian rule thumb alt full length miniature of a standing orthodox priest dressed in red and black holding a book and his episcopal staff metropolitan symeon of thessalonica miniature from an 18th century codex inside thessalonica siege led to much suffering and populace quickly became dissatisfied with their new masters by winter of 1426 1427 conditions in besieged city approached point of famine thessalonians were forced to subsist on bread alone and even that proved problematic authorities were forced to request more shipments of wheat from venice when supplies ran dangerously low conditions of extreme poverty death and destitution made greek population more and more restless and even those who had formerly welcomed venetians began to waver lack of food even jeopardized city s defences since many of mercenary guards on walls paid by venice with wheat instead of cash defected to turks when their rations were late this situation became progressively worse and by time of final ottoman attack in 1430 many soldiers had no weapons because they had sold them for food privations of siege led to an exodus of city s population as citizens with ability to leave sold their possessions and fled to constantinople other venetian controlled greek territories or to turks from a population variously reported at between 20 000 25 000 or even as many as 40 000 by contemporary italian sources it is estimated that only 10 000 13 000 were left by 1429 30 venetian authorities tried to put a stop to this by prohibiting inhabitants from leaving city outlawing all sales mortgages and transfers of property both movable and immovable and destroying houses and other property even trees of people who had left city they hoped that destruction would serve a deterrent to those who remained behind coupled with several instances of arbitrariness speculation and profiteering on behalf of venetian authorities these measures helped to further alienate thessalonians by april 1425 a byzantine church official who had had his family flee city wrote of enslavement of city by venetians and similar sentiments about venetian tyranny are echoed in all contemporary byzantine sources in their embassy in july 1425 thessalonians submitted a list of 21 complaints and demands including fixed rations of corn for poor and lowering of tax dues and suspension of arrears and debt related punishments for duration of siege since closing of gates meant that people could no longer access their fields which were furthermore devastated by turks in a session on 23 july 1425 great council acceded to many of their demands and requested that its officials respect customs and rights of citizens and work together with local council of twelve nobles in governance of city whatever venetian efforts to secure peace thessalonians were well aware in words of byzantinist donald nicol that murad was playing for time and he was never going to be reconciled to venetian occupation of thessalonica as historian apostolos put it prevailing view quickly became that since thessalonica was bound sooner or later to fall into turkish hands it would be preferable to surrender peacefully there and then and so avoid sufferings which would ensue if turks had to take city by force as conditions inside city worsened pro surrender current gained ground among thessalonians this is evidenced from writings of metropolitan symeon who recounts that during one attack in 1425 or 1426 many citizens including some of those guarding walls fled to ottomans symeon played an important role as a spokesman and leader of city s populace during siege an ardently hesychast and anti latin prelate who had opposed handover of city to roman catholic venetians fearing their corrupting influence metropolitan tried to strengthen his flock s orthodox identity against both latin venetians and muslim turks as well as awaken their will to resist he organized that paraded city s icon of hodegetria and delivered sermons about city s successful delivery from previous sieges through intervention of her patron demetrius of thessalonica as a result he emerged as leading proponent of resistance and despite his anti latin animus venetians considered him a most loyal servant of republic his death in september 1429 contributed to increasing demoralisation of city s populace who considered it an omen of city s fall in summer 1429 thessalonians sent a second embassy to venice to complain about restrictions placed on entry and exit from city continued violations of their rights extortion by venetian authorities poor supply situation neglect of repairing city s fortifications and lack of military stores and venetian mercenaries who were in contact with turks outside walls on 14 july great council gave mostly reassuring answers to a list of 31 demands but increasing dissatisfaction by greek population with venetian rule was evident eyewitness john anagnostes reports that by winter of 1429 majority of population had come to favour a surrender to turks sultan murad was aware of situation inside walls and twice sent christian officers in his service into city to incite a rebellion against venetians however as anagnostes writes population was by that time so reduced in number and divided among itself that no common cause could be made furthermore thessalonians were afraid of venetians as they had recruited a special force of guards and given them authority to kill anyone advocating a surrender fall of city a squadron of three galleys under antonio diedo arrived to reinforce city on 17 march 1430 but to little avail a muster of city s available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only a half or a third of and they were deficient in both armament and morale news of murad s approach at head of an army rumoured to number 190 000 men caused widespread terror among populace sultan appeared before city on sunday 26 march shortly after noon probably informed of discontent inside walls by greek defectors sultan appears to have expected mere appearance of his army to force city to surrender or to signal an uprising of populace against venetian garrison in this vein he sent christian officers to walls to call upon inhabitants to surrender but they were driven off by arrows from walls before they had chance to complete their speeches sultan then began preparations to take city by storm which lasted for three days on 28th murad sent another offer of surrender but this too was rejected on same night a subaltern officer entered city to inform venetian commanders that turks had prepared six ships at vardar river for use against venetian galleys in harbour which had been left defenceless since all available forces were concentrated in manning city wall fearing that their retreat would be cut off venetian commanders ordered diedo and his men to withdraw from wall to man ships and harbour defences they did not however notify population and around midnight christians from ottoman camp approached walls and announced that final assault would take place next day from land and sea news spread throughout city and panicked populace who spent night in terrified vigil in churches panic spread further when diedo s withdrawal to harbour became known in absence of other information thessalonians believed that venetians were preparing to abandon them and flee as a result a number of defenders simply abandoned their positions on walls and returned to their homes at dawn on 29 march 1430 ottomans launched their attack under command of sinan pasha beylerbey military governor of rumelia main weight of attack fell on less well maintained eastern section of walls between and site of later heptapyrgion fortress where sultan himself led attack ottomans brought siege engines ladders and planks forward and used them to undermine walls ottoman archery proved crucial for their shots were able to pin down defenders and hit many who tried to peer over battlements as a result much of defenders return fire was blind and they began slowly abandoning their positions finally at fourth hour ottoman troops broke through at multiple points along wall according to anagnostes first ottomans climbed wall in eastern section which had been left almost defenceless as civilian population was being massacred venetians fled to harbour as best as they could one in his mantle other in his undershirt in words of report to great council many managed to escape to diedo s ships and thence to negroponte others were less fortunate venetians lost over 270 men from galley crews alone a number of senior officials including son of duke paolo contarini and leonardo captain of one of galleys also fell details on siege were provided by a letter sent by venetians of negroponte to venice on 2 april after refugees from fall of city arrived there and eyewitness account of john anagnostes on their return to venice two venetian commanders of thessalonica faced charges of negligence and were imprisoned they were most likely acquitted however for by 1432 both were once again active in republic s politics thumb right alt photo of a stone slab with arabic lettering and a sultan s tughra
