1773 both a depiction of a historical moment and an allegory for surrounding period of polish history painting is one of matejko s most famous works and an iconic picture of an emotional protest historical context tadeusz rejtan was a deputy in sejm parliament of polish lithuanian commonwealth in 1773 infamously known as partition sejm sejm convened to review demands of commonwealth s three neighbours russian empire prussia and austria in order to legalize their territorial demands known as first partition of poland sejm operated under duress with immediate threat of foreign forces present in commonwealth and with a significant number of deputies either bribed or threatened by foreign diplomats three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order through military intervention in civil war war of bar confederation in fact all three were interested in territorial gains on 21 april that year rejtan in a dramatic gesture at sejm is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway blocking way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop other members from leaving chamber where debate was being held leaving chamber would signify an end to discussion and acceptance of motion under discussion i e to accept foreign territorial demands scene description painting portrays this scene although as usual with matejko s work it sacrifices some historical reality for more dramatic presentation it serves as an allegory for all three partitions of poland 1772 1793 1795 and portrays a

significance matejko began work on this painting in august 1864 and finished it in november 1866 it was one of many paintings portraying key historical moments in history of poland that he would create over his life matejko however did not simply illustrate history he intended his paintings to have powerful educational and emotional values work caused a scandal in contemporary still partitioned poland it was discussed even before its unveiling it offended a number of society figures many tracing direct lineage to major magnate families whose members are portrayed in painting as traitors to polish cause there were a number of critical reviews of work in contemporary press matejko received anonymous threats and some aristocrats are said to have considered buying painting only to destroy it some accused him of defeatism pessimism exploiting public sentiment over a historical scandal for contemporary publicity it was thus criticized by notable artists such as jozef ignacy kraszewski and cyprian norwid in paris a french polish aristocrat count alexandre joseph colonna walewski campaigned against including it in an exhibition painting however quickly garnered supporters who in turn reproduced modified copies of it replacing historical figures with major contemporary critics responding to public outcry matejko painted a response a painting titled judgement on matejko na 1867 in which he portrayed his execution by some of his most vocal critics serious art critics had less emotional but also mixed opinions of work it was received less favourably by jozef and stanislaw tarnowski but praised by painters henryk siemiradzki and artur comments of wojciech korneli are interpreted by different authors as either praise or critique in paris displayed at exposition universelle 1867 painting received a gold medal while in poland painting s context and message was clearly understood work displayed in paris proved to be too obscure for audience there with few understanding complex historical context some french critics interpreted it as a painting of a gambling hall it is said however to have been well understood by russian visitors to french gallery some of whom are said to have been interested in acquiring painting which was commended by poles as they bought real ones might as well buy painted ones too eventually however painting was acquired by emperor franz joseph i of austria for 50 000 franks it was shown at a gallery in vienna and eventually ended up at thanks to efforts of minister juliusz twardowski it was purchased by government of second polish republic in 1920 as part of wawel royal castle national art collection it has been on a public display in royal castle in warsaw since 1931 with exception of period of world war ii when it was briefly looted by nazis painting is usually interpreted as criticism of russian interference in polish political affairs and collaboration of treasonous polish aristocrats by end of world war i it was already seen as a priceless artifact of polish culture painting was positively interpreted in communist poland as a symbol of critique of polish nobility blamed for their selfishness leading to partitions more recently painting has been interpreted as symbol of solitary protest and a moral justification of dissent even when such a protest is known to be futile ignored by most it has also been described as an iconic picture of an emotional protest and a symbol of desperate patriotic protest in 1980s painting inspired a protest song by jacek over time painting has become famous in
