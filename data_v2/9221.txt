battle of bautzen or battle of april 1945 was one of last battles of eastern front during world war ii it was fought on extreme southern flank of spremberg torgau offensive seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of polish second army under elements of soviet 52nd army and 5th guards army on one side and elements of german army group center in form of remnants of 4th panzer and 17th armies on other battle took place during ivan konev s 1st ukrainian front s push toward berlin which was part of larger soviet berlin offensive battle was fought in town of bautzen and rural areas to northeast situated primarily along bautzen niesky line major combat began on 21 april 1945 and continued until 26 april although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 april polish second army under karol swierczewski suffered heavy losses but with aid of soviet reinforcements prevented german forces from breaking through to their rear after battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won battle remain contradictory because war was almost over and battle had no strategic impact on ongoing battle of berlin german historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects german operation successfully recaptured bautzen and its surroundings which were held until end of war background in last months of world war ii polish second army under general karol swierczewski took part in soviet drive on berlin part of marshal ivan konev s 1st ukrainian front poles operated in centre of front flanked on right by 5th guards army and on left by 7th mechanized corps opposing these forces was 4th panzer army under general fritz hubert graser of field marshal ferdinand schorner s army group center on 17 april polish second army breached german defenses on rivers weisser schops and neisse their pursuit of retreating german forces toward dresden threatened to cut off additional forces in muskauer forst region on 18 and 19 april elements of second army 8th infantry division and 1st armored corps engaged germans in south and pushed them back while remaining units 5th 7th 9th and 10th infantry divisions drove on to dresden gaining bridgeheads on river spree north of bautzen and destroying german forces in muskauer forst following day soviet units of 7th mechanized corps captured parts of bautzen and secured line south of niesky taking weissenberg and trapping several german formations swierczewski decided to prioritize taking of dresden over securing his southern flank deviating from plan he was given by konev meanwhile schorner was concentrating his units gorlitz group in gorlitz and reichenbach region and planned to launch a counteroffensive at southern flank of polish army his aim was to stop 1st front s advance and break through to berlin to relieve trapped 9th army germans were pinning their hopes on idea that soviets might be fended off long enough for city to be surrendered to western allies concentration of schorner s units went unnoticed by soviet and polish reconnaissance prelude opposing forces german forces were composed of elements of 4th panzer army and commanded by headquarters for grossdeutschland and 57th armored corps for battle germans had two armored divisions 20th and hermann goring two mechanized divisions brandenburg and hermann goring 2 an infantry division 17th as well as an infantry division battle group remnants of 545th volksgrenadier division this force counted some 50 000 soldiers 300 tanks and 600 guns supply train of 10th ss panzer division was also present near bautzen polish second army consisted of five infantry divisions 5th 7th 8th 9th and 10th 1st armored corps and smaller units about 84 000 90 000 men and 500 tanks many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat incorporated from recently retaken polish territories quality of officer corps has also been questioned one of major problems facing people s army was lack of a qualified cadre a 1944 estimate showed that army had one officer for each 1 200 soldiers many of officers in polish army were soviet officers of polish descent overall german units were less numerous than polish forces their equipment worn and supplies inferior polish sources describe germans as more experienced however german sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of hitlerjugend and volkssturm units battle thumb berlin operation alt berlin operation thumb berlin operation alt berlin operation thumb map of battle of bautzen 1 alt map of battle of

corps pushing towards dresden and polish units which were securing muskauer forst region 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near neisse and 5th infantry division and 16th tank brigade were in transit in between those two groups polish units were stretched over a line of germans took opportunity to push into this gap battle started on 21 april in west 20th panzer division started its drive on bautzen while in east 17th infantry division advanced on niesky and weissenberg freeing trapped german troops on its way germans drove between polish second army and soviet 52nd army around bautzen some north east of dresden and west of gorlitz sweeping soviet units of 48th rifle corps and driving towards spremberg major general m k commander of 52nd army s 254th rifle division of 73rd rifle corps was mortally wounded around bautzen at first polish general swierczewski continued with his attempt to take dresden which contributed to growing chaos in polish forces as many communication lines were cut germans succeeded in linking up with remnants of their forces in muskauer forst and throwing local polish and soviet forces into chaos polish second army lost cohesion and split into four groups several units of polish second army found themselves surrounded in particular polish 5th infantry division and 16th tank brigade were struck in rear suffering severe losses headquarters of 5th division defended only by sapper and training battalions came under attack command group managed to break through to 16th tank brigade but that unit itself was almost annihilated at losing over 90 percent of its personnel out of 1 300 soldiers only about 100 survived commanding general of polish 5th infantry division aleksander was killed in village of today a part of bautzen between 196 and 300 captured german members of volkssturm were locked in a barn which was set on fire by retreating polish or soviet troops by 23 april german breakthrough reached schwarzer schops river in east and lohsa oppitz and in west main body of german force was located in forested region around lohsa germans continued their push toward konigswartha and polish retreat eventually swierczewski halted his force s advance on dresden and ordered it to pull back and secure breach on 22 april he ordered 1st armored corps to change direction retreat from dresden and support centre 8th infantry division was also recalled however 9th remained near dresden for a while swierczewski was out of communication with his superiors including marshal konev konev also sent his chief of staff general ivan petrov and his chief of operations general vladimir ivanovich kostylev to look at situation petrov managed to re establish communications and left kostylev in charge swierczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence to stabilize situation konev ordered eight divisions from ukrainian front to reinforce polish positions soviet 14th and 95th guards rifle divisions as well as 4th guards tank corps were ordered to attack toward kamenz konigswartha and sdier to stop germans from advancing further north 2nd air army was also assigned to this theater meanwhile german advance to southeast of bautzen was successful soviet 294th rifle division was encircled at weissenberg by brandenburg division in its subsequent breakout on 24 april large parts of 294th division were destroyed at same time at bautzen 20th panzer division was able to make contact with trapped units in town from south then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into bautzen coordinating with trapped troops he was able to break into town a hastily assembled polish counterattack was not successful and most of bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody house to house combat several remaining pockets of resistance in town were cleared during next days outside town german advance stalled as their troops were running low on fuel supplies recapture of bautzen was one of last successful german tactical victories on eastern front by 25 april polish units were able to stabilize a defense on line kamenz kuckau north bautzen spree heideanger on that day hitler congratulated schorner on his victory polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward sdier heideanger 7th and 10th polish infantry divisions slowly advanced with 10th reaching north of with soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to konigswartha 9th division found itself alone at spearhead of abandoned polish push towards dresden it received orders to retreat on 26 april attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with main forces it was intercepted by germans and sustained heavy losses units were moving with insufficient security on assumption that line of retreat was safe at same time germans captured polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes coordination between units was also lacking 26th infantry regiment from 9th division took very heavy casualties 75 percent in valley of death around kuckau and crostwitz a polish military hospital convoy from same division was ambushed near with most of its personnel and wounded executed about 300 casualties there was only one survivor chaplain jan division commander colonel aleksander laski was taken captive as a result of these losses 9th division ceased to be an effective force remaining personnel were merged into soviet 19th guards rifle division according to some sources 26 april marks end of this battle although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 april other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 april and that german advance was only completely halted by 28 april by end of month polish second army and soviet forces had repelled german attack forming a line toward kamenz and was preparing to launch an offensive toward prague aftermath thumb upright monument to polish soldiers in crostwitz both sides suffered heavy casualties polish casualties were particularly severe in a relatively short time polish second army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles about 200 total official estimates claimed about 18 000 casualties including almost 5 000 dead some other estimates give polish casualties as up to 25 000 according to polish historian zbigniew wawer this was most bloody battle that polish army had been involved in since battle of bzura in 1939 german casualties were significant but less than polish and soviet ones contemporary polish sources estimated german losses at 6 500 personnel which is now seen as an inflated estimate german forces failed in their objective of breaking through 1st ukrainian front and coming to aid of berlin they managed however to inflict very serious casualties on local polish and soviet units and stopped polish drive on dresden it was still in german hands at time of german capitulation on may 9 successful recapture of bautzen weissenberg and surroundings is called one of last successful german armored counterattacks of war bautzen and surroundings stayed in german hands until germany s capitulation although battle had no strategic impact on battle raging in berlin it allowed most of participating german units as well as numerous refugees from east to escape to west surrendering to western allies historiography thumb left 220px general karol swierczewski alt general karol swierczewski despite heavy polish casualties or according to one historian possibly because of them battle has been largely neglected in polish historiography during period of people s republic of poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle however since fall of communism modern polish historians have been much more critical of swierczewski s command blaming his drive on dresden for near destruction of polish force swierczewski s lack of competence according to some sources included commanding battle while drunk he was briefly relieved of command by marshal konev but due to backing of soviet high command most likely nkvd he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up and after war was hailed as a hero actions of other polish officers have also been questioned such as 9th infantry division commander s decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort in modern poland battle s outcome is seen as a victory if a very costly one for polish and soviet troops as noted by historians such as wawer and komorowski despite heavy casualties polish soviet frontline was not seriously breached and thus german offensive was a failure notes a wawer incorrectly identifies this formation as 5th guards tank army which was near baltic coast at time and subordinated to 2nd belorussian front correctly identifies formation as 5th guards army b wawer and assert that 2nd ss panzer division was also present in battle this is an incorrect assertion as 2nd ss division fought in hungary and austria from january 1945 until end of war 21st panzer division has also been mentioned in connection with this battle but 21st had already moved north as part of reinforcements provided by 4th panzer army to 9th army by time battle of bautzen had begun both 21st panzer division and 10th ss panzer division minus its supply train were committed to support 9th army and both were encircled in pocket assessments of polish historian german general von and polish historian all support order of battle not including 21st and 10th ss
