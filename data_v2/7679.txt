thumb variegated golden frog baroni in ranomafana national park of madagascar a frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short bodied tailless amphibians composing order anura literally without tail in ancient greek oldest fossil proto frog appeared in early triassic of madagascar but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to permian 265 million years ago frogs are widely distributed ranging from tropics to subarctic regions but greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforests there are over 6 300 recorded species accounting for around 88 of extant amphibian species they are also one of five most diverse vertebrate orders warty frog species tend to be called toads but distinction between frogs and toads is informal not from taxonomy or evolutionary history an adult frog has a stout body protruding eyes anteriorly attached tongue limbs folded underneath and no tail except in tailed frogs frogs have glandular skin with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic their skin varies in colour from well camouflaged dappled brown grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land some species are adapted for living underground or in trees frogs typically lay their eggs in water eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills they have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous omnivorous or planktivorous diets life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults a few species deposit eggs on land or bypass tadpole stage adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass they are an important food source for predators and part of food web dynamics of many of world s ecosystems skin is semi permeable making them susceptible to dehydration so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations particularly in their breeding season and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates to fend off predators and to generally survive frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature symbolism and religion they are also seen as environmental with declines in frog populations often viewed as early warning signs of environmental damage frog populations have declined significantly since 1950s more than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over 120 are believed to have become extinct since 1980s number of malformations among frogs is on rise and an emerging fungal disease chytridiomycosis has spread around world conservation biologists are working to understand causes of these problems and to resolve them etymology and taxonomy use of common names frog and toad has no taxonomic justification from a classification perspective all members of order anura are frogs but only members of family bufonidae are considered true toads use of term frog in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi aquatic and have smooth moist skins term toad generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry warty skins there are numerous exceptions to this rule european fire bellied toad bombina bombina has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas panamanian golden frog atelopus zeteki is in toad family bufonidae and has a smooth skin etymology origin of order

keratinous beaks and denticles thumb alt panamanian golden frog panamanian golden frog atelopus zeteki frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders which includes four families of primitive frogs which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs and neobatrachia by far largest group which contains remaining families of modern frogs including most common species throughout world neobatrachia suborder is further divided into two superfamilies hyloidea and this classification is based on such morphological features as number of vertebrae structure of pectoral girdle and morphology of tadpoles while this classification is largely accepted relationships among families of frogs are still debated some species of anurans hybridize readily for instance edible frog pelophylax esculentus is a hybrid between pool frog p and marsh frog p ridibundus fire bellied toads bombina bombina and b variegata are similar in forming hybrids these are less fertile than their parents giving rise to a hybrid zone where hybrids are prevalent evolution origins and evolutionary relationships between three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated a molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and divergence of three groups took place in paleozoic or early mesozoic before breakup of supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from lobe finned fishes this would help account for relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from period before groups split another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about same time concluded that first appeared about 330 million years ago and that temnospondyl origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories seemed to have originated in africa india salamanders in east asia and caecilians in tropical pangaea other researchers while agreeing with main thrust of this study questioned choice of calibration points used to synchronise data they proposed that date of diversification should be placed in permian rather less than 300 million years ago a date in better agreement with palaeontological data a further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological as well as molecular data came to conclusion that lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within rather than within temnospondyli study postulated that lissamphibia originated no earlier than late carboniferous some 290 to 305 million years ago split between anura and caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago rather later than most molecular studies suggest with caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago thumb left a fossilized frog from czech republic possibly gigas in 2008 gerobatrachus hottoni a temnospondyl with many frog and salamander like characteristics was discovered in texas it dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link a stem close to common ancestor of frogs and salamanders consistent with widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other forming a clade called batrachia than they are to caecilians however others have suggested that gerobatrachus hottoni was only a temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians latin to jump is name of total group that includes modern frogs in order anura as well as their close fossil relatives proto frogs or stem frogs common features possessed by these proto frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae modern frogs have eight or 9 a long and forward sloping ilium in pelvis presence of a frontoparietal bone and a lower jaw without teeth earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are triadobatrachus from early triassic period of madagascar about 250 million years ago and from early triassic of poland about same age as triadobatrachus skull of triadobatrachus is frog like being broad with large eye sockets but fossil has features diverging from modern frogs these include a longer body with more vertebrae tail has separate vertebrae unlike fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs tibia and fibula bones are also separate making it probable that triadobatrachus was not an efficient leaper earliest known true frogs that fall into anuran lineage proper all lived in early jurassic period one such early frog species prosalirus bitis was discovered in 1995 in kayenta formation of arizona and dates back to early jurassic epoch 199 6 to 175 million years ago making prosalirus somewhat more recent than triadobatrachus like latter prosalirus did not have greatly enlarged legs but had typical three pronged pelvic structure of modern frogs unlike triadobatrachus prosalirus had already lost nearly all of its tail and was well adapted for jumping another early jurassic frog is herbsti which is known only from dorsal and ventral impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be from snout to vent from middle jurassic is slightly younger about 155 170 million years old main evolutionary changes in this species involved shortening of body and loss of tail evolution of modern anura likely was complete by jurassic period since then evolutionary changes in chromosome numbers have taken place about 20 times faster in mammals than in frogs which means speciation is occurring more rapidly in mammals according to genetic studies families hyloidea microhylidae and clade natatanura comprising about 88 of living frogs diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago soon after cretaceous paleogene extinction event associated with chicxulub impactor all origins of e g in hyloidea and natatanura follow from that time and resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards frog fossils have been found on all continents except antarctica but biogeographic evidence suggests they also inhabited antarctica in an earlier era when climate was warmer frog classification a cladogram showing relationships of different families of frogs in clade anura can be seen in table above this diagram in form of a tree shows how each frog family is related to other families with each node representing a point of common ancestry it is based on frost et al 2006 et al 2009 and pyron and wiens 2011 morphology and physiology thumb upright alt skeleton of frog skeleton of pelophylax esculentus showing bones of head vertebral column ribs pectoral and pelvic girdles and limbs frogs have no tail except as larvae and most have long hind legs elongated ankle bones webbed toes no claws large eyes and a smooth or warty skin they have short vertebral columns with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones urostyle or coccyx like other amphibians oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins this unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to air respiring through their skins ribs are generally absent so lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them for skin to serve as a respiratory organ it must remain moist this makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in environment some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in water film and be passed into their bloodstream this may be one of causes of worldwide decline in frog populations frogs range in size from recently discovered of papua new guinea to goliath frog goliath of cameroon skin hangs loosely on body because of lack of loose connective tissue frogs have three eyelid membranes one is transparent to protect eyes underwater and two vary from translucent to opaque they have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and in some species is covered by skin true toads completely lack teeth but most frogs have them specifically pedicellate teeth in which crown is separated from root by fibrous tissue these are on edge of upper jaw and teeth are also on roof of their mouths no teeth are in lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole teeth are mainly used to grip prey and keep it in place until swallowed a process assisted by retracting eyes into head african bullfrog which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs has cone shaped bony projections called processes at front of lower jaw which function like teeth thumb left a bullfrog skeleton showing elongated limb bones and extra joints red marks indicate bones which have been substantially elongated in frogs and joints which have become mobile blue indicates joints and bones which have not been modified or only somewhat elongated feet and legs structure of feet and legs varies greatly among frog species depending in part on whether they live primarily on ground in water in trees or in burrows frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators and numerous adaptations help them to do so most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were with much of musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose tibia fibula and tarsals have been fused into a single strong bone as have radius and ulna in fore limbs which must absorb impact on landing metatarsals have become elongated to add to leg length and allow frogs to push against ground for a longer period on take off illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with sacrum which in specialist jumpers such as ranids and functions as an additional limb joint to further power leaps tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside pelvis this enables force to be transferred from legs to body during a leap thumb alt webbed foot webbed hind foot of common frog rana temporaria thumb tyler s tree frog litoria has large toe pads and webbed feet muscular system has been similarly modified hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition one muscle to flex knee a different muscle to extend it as is seen in most other limbed animals however in modern frogs almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to action of jumping with only a few small muscles remaining to bring limb back to starting position and maintain posture muscles have also been greatly enlarged with main leg muscles accounting for over 17 of total mass of frogs many frogs have webbed feet and degree of webbing is directly proportional to amount of time species spends in water completely aquatic african dwarf frog hymenochirus sp has fully webbed toes whereas those of white s tree frog litoria caerulea an arboreal species are only a quarter or half webbed exceptions include flying frogs in hylidae and rhacophoridae which also have fully webbed toes used in gliding arboreal frogs have pads located on ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces these are not suction pads surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands when frog applies pressure cells adhere to irregularities on surface and grip is maintained through surface tension this allows frog to climb on smooth surfaces but system does not function efficiently when pads are excessively wet in many arboreal frogs a small intercalary structure on each toe increases surface area touching substrate furthermore many arboreal frogs have hip joints that allow both hopping and walking some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes this allows frogs to parachute or make a controlled glide from one position in canopy to another ground dwelling frogs generally lack adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs most have smaller toe pads if any and little webbing some burrowing frogs such as couch s spadefoot scaphiopus couchii have a flap like toe extension on hind feet a keratinised tubercle often referred to as a spade that helps them to burrow sometimes during tadpole stage one of developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph in some cases full leg still grows but in others it does not although frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs occasionally a parasitic flatworm ribeiroia ondatrae digs into rear of a tadpole causing a rearrangement of limb bud cells and frog develops one or more extra legs thumb left northern leopard frog rana pipiens moulting and eating its skin skin a frog s skin is protective has a respiratory function can absorb water and helps control body temperature it has many glands particularly on head and back which often exude distasteful and toxic substances granular glands secretion is often sticky and helps keep skin moist protects against entry of moulds and bacteria and make animal slippery and more able to escape from predators skin is shed every few weeks it usually splits down middle of back and across belly and frog pulls its arms and legs free sloughed skin is then worked towards head where it is quickly eaten being cold blooded frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature to warm up they can move into sun or onto a warm surface if they overheat they can move into shade or adopt a stance that exposes minimum area of skin to air this posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves frog squatting close to substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body colour of a frog s skin is used for thermoregulation in cool damp conditions colour will be darker than on a hot dry day grey foam nest tree frog is even able to turn white to minimize chance of overheating many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through skin especially around pelvic area but permeability of a frog s skin can also result in water loss glands located all over body exude mucus which helps keep skin moist and reduces evaporation some glands on hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue like substance on adhesive discs of feet some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin and several south american species coat their skin with a waxy secretion other frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water conserving position some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours this reduces amount of skin exposed to air or a dry surface and thus reduces water loss woodhouse s toad bufo if given access to water after confinement in a dry location sits in shallows to rehydrate male hairy frog robustus has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs giving it a bristly appearance they contain blood vessels and are thought to increase area of skin available for respiration some species have bony plates embedded in their skin a trait that appears to have evolved independently several times in certain other species skin at top of head is compacted and connective tissue of dermis is co ossified with bones of skull camouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frogs most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal during day they seek out a position where they can blend into background and remain undetected some frogs have ability to change colour but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours for example white s tree frog litoria caerulea varies between pale green and dull brown according to temperature and pacific tree frog pseudacris regilla has green and brown morphs plain or spotted and changes colour depending on time of year and general background colour features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground dwelling frogs for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage certain frogs change colour between night and day as light and moisture stimulate pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract some are even able to control their skin texture respiration and circulation skin of a frog is permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide as well as to water there are blood vessels near surface of skin and when a frog is underwater oxygen diffuses directly into blood when not submerged a frog breathes by a process known as buccal pumping its lungs are similar to those of humans but chest muscles are not involved in respiration and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out instead it puffs out its throat and draws air in through nostrils which in many species can then be closed by valves when floor of mouth is compressed air is forced into lungs fully aquatic bornean flat headed frog is first frog known to lack lungs entirely frogs have three chambered hearts a feature they share with lizards oxygenated blood from lungs and de oxygenated blood from respiring tissues enter heart through separate atria when these chambers contract two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to appropriate vessel aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes mixing of two types of blood these features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible some species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water titicaca water frog is one such species and has wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange it normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on lake bed to increase flow of water around it thumb right alt dissected frog anatomical model of a dissected frog 1 right atrium 2 lungs 3 aorta 4 egg mass 5 colon 6 left atrium 7 ventricle 8 stomach 9 liver 10 gallbladder 11 small intestine 12 cloaca digestion and excretion frogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed these teeth are very weak and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey instead frog uses its sticky cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey tongue normally lies coiled in mouth free at back and attached to mandible at front it can be shot out and retracted at great speed some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands eyes assist in swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in skull and help push food down throat food then moves through oesophagus into stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up it then proceeds to small intestine duodenum and where most digestion occurs pancreatic juice from pancreas and bile produced by liver and stored in gallbladder are secreted into small intestine where fluids digest food and nutrients are absorbed food residue passes into large intestine where excess water is removed and wastes are passed out through cloaca although adapted to terrestrial life frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively when they are on land much water is lost by evaporation from skin excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from blood frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from kidney tubules nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea a less toxic product by most terrestrial adults a few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete even less toxic uric acid urine passes along paired ureters to urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into cloaca all bodily wastes exit body through cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent reproductive system in male frog two testes are attached to kidneys and semen passes into kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts it then travels on through ureters which are consequently known as ducts there is no penis and sperm is ejected from cloaca directly onto eggs as female lays them ovaries of female frog are beside kidneys and eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through cloaca to exterior when frogs mate male climbs on back of female and wraps his fore limbs round her body either behind front legs or just in front of hind legs this position is called amplexus and may be held for several days male frog has certain hormone dependent secondary sexual characteristics these include development of special pads on his thumbs in breeding season to give him a firm hold grip of male frog during amplexus stimulates female to release eggs usually wrapped in jelly as spawn in many species male is smaller and slimmer than female males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks particularly in breeding season and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify sound nervous system frogs have a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain spinal cord and nerves many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans it consists of two olfactory lobes two cerebral hemispheres a pineal body two optic lobes a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata muscular coordination and posture are controlled by cerebellum and medulla oblongata regulates respiration digestion and other automatic functions relative size of cerebrum in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from outside directly to brain and ten pairs of spinal nerves which pass information from extremities to brain through spinal cord by contrast all amniotes mammals birds and reptiles have twelve pairs of cranial nerves thumb left close up of frog s head showing eye nostril mouth and tympanum sight eyes of most frogs are located on either side of head near top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges they provide binocular vision over a field of 100deg to front and a total visual field of almost 360deg they may be only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from water each eye has upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection especially when frog is swimming members of aquatic family pipidae have eyes located at top of head a position better suited for detecting prey in water above irises come in a range of colours and pupils in a range of shapes common toad bufo bufo has golden irises and horizontal slit like pupils red eyed tree frog agalychnis callidryas has vertical slit pupils poison dart frog has dark irises fire bellied toad bombina spp has triangular pupils and tomato frog spp has circular ones irises of southern toad terrestris are patterned so as to blend in with surrounding camouflaged skin distant vision of a frog is better than its near vision calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but closer an object is less well it is seen when a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as tongue is extended although it was formerly debated more recent research has shown that frogs can see in colour even in very low light hearing thumb surface rendering of head of frog atelopus franciscus with ear parts highlighted frogs can hear both in air and below water they do not have external ears eardrums tympanic membranes are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind eye size and distance apart of eardrums is related to frequency and wavelength at which frog calls in some species such as bullfrog size of tympanum indicates sex of frog males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females eyes and tympani are much same size a noise causes tympanum to vibrate and sound is transmitted to middle and inner ear middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation in inner ear auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of cochlea basilar papilla and amphibian papilla former detects high frequencies and latter low frequencies because cochlea is short frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds this arrangement enables detection of territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics in some species that inhabit arid regions sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state a frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located source of sound by sight call thumb a male microcephalus displaying its vocal sac during its call thumb advertisement call of male atelopus franciscus call or croak of a frog is unique to its species frogs create this sound by passing air through larynx in throat in most calling frogs sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs membranes of skin under throat or on corner of mouth that distend during amplification of call some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away additionally some species have been found to use man made structures such as drain pipes for artificial amplification of their call frogs in genera heleioporus and lack vocal sacs but can still produce a loud call their buccal cavity is enlarged and dome shaped acting as a resonance chamber that amplifies sound species of frog that lack vocal sacs and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy flowing water they need to use an alternative means to communicate coastal tailed frog lives in mountain streams in north america and does not vocalize main reason for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites females of many frog species such as common tree frog polypedates reply to male calls which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency attributes that stand out in a crowd rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring a different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male this is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of body tree frogs and some non aquatic species have a rain call that they make on basis of humidity cues prior to a shower many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males all of these calls are emitted with mouth of frog closed a distress call emitted by some frogs when they are in danger is produced with mouth open resulting in a higher pitched call it is typically used when frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or attacker so that it releases frog left thumb distinctive low jug o rum sound of banded bullfrog many species of frog have deep calls croak of american bullfrog rana is sometimes written as jug o rum pacific tree frog pseudacris regilla produces onomatopoeic often heard in films other renderings of frog calls into speech include koax koax call of marsh frog pelophylax ridibundus in frogs an ancient greek comic drama by aristophanes torpor during extreme conditions some frogs enter a state of torpor and remain inactive for months in colder regions many species of frog hibernate in winter those that live on land such as american toad bufo americanus dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant others less proficient at digging find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves aquatic species such as american bullfrog rana catesbeiana normally sink to bottom of pond where they lie semi immersed in mud but still able to access oxygen dissolved in water their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves some frogs can even survive being frozen ice crystals form under skin and in body cavity but essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose an apparently lifeless frozen frog can resume respiration and heart beat can restart when conditions warm up at other extreme striped burrowing frog cyclorana regularly during hot dry season in australia surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of year it burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin researchers at university of queensland have found that during aestivation metabolism of frog is altered and operational efficiency of mitochondria is increased this means that limited amount of energy available to comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner this survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold blooded and have no need to generate heat other research showed that to provide these energy requirements muscles atrophy but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees celsius locomotion different species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including jumping running walking swimming burrowing climbing and gliding thumb left rainforest rocket frog jumping jumping frogs are generally recognized as exceptional jumpers and relative to their size best jumpers of all vertebrates striped rocket frog litoria can leap over a distance that is more than fifty times its body

decreases indian skipper frog euphlyctis cyanophlyctis has ability to leap out of water from a position floating on surface tiny northern cricket frog can skitter across surface of a pond with a series of short rapid jumps slow motion photography shows that muscles have passive flexibility they are first stretched while frog is still in crouched position then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch frog into air fore legs are folded against chest and hind legs remain in extended streamlined position for duration of jump in some extremely capable jumpers such as cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis and northern leopard frog rana pipiens peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which muscle is theoretically capable of producing when muscles contract energy is first transferred into stretched tendon which is wrapped around ankle bone then muscles stretch again at same time as tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond limits of muscle powered acceleration a similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers walking and running thumb right walking on a level surface frogs in families bufonidae and microhylidae have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump when they try to move rapidly they speed up rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait great plains narrow mouthed toad has been described as having a gait that is a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length in an experiment fowler s toad bufo was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds by measuring toad s uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high intensity activity red legged running frog maculata has short slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping it can move fast by using a running gait in which two hind legs are used alternately slow motion photography shows unlike a horse that can trot or gallop frog s gait remained similar at slow medium and fast speeds this species can also climb trees and shrubs and does so at night to catch insects indian skipper frog euphlyctis cyanophlyctis has broad feet and can run across surface of water for several metres yards swimming thumb alt common toad swimming common toad bufo bufo swimming frogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong webbing between toes of hind feet increases area of foot and helps propel frog powerfully through water members of family pipidae are wholly aquatic and show most marked specialization they have inflexible vertebral columns flattened streamlined bodies lateral line systems and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when tail is moved from side to side burrowing some frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground they tend to have rounded bodies short limbs small heads with bulging eyes and hind feet adapted for excavation an extreme example of this is purple frog nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis from southern india which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground it emerges briefly during monsoon to mate and breed

and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside burrow eggs partially develop there but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall tadpoles then swim out into open water and rapidly complete their development madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter one of these green burrowing frog marmorata has a flattened head with a short snout and well developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation it also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes it breeds in temporary pools that form after rains climbing thumb alt frog climbing burmeister s leaf frog thumb group of glass frogs tree frogs live high in canopy where they scramble around on branches twigs and leaves sometimes never coming down to earth true tree frogs belong to family hylidae but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit a case of convergent evolution these include glass frogs bush frogs some of narrow mouthed frogs microhylidae and shrub frogs rhacophoridae most tree frogs are under in length with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on tips surface of toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat topped hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus these toe pads moistened by mucus provide grip on any wet or dry surface including glass forces involved include boundary friction of toe pad epidermis on surface and also surface tension and viscosity tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto blade of a windswept reed some members of subfamily have opposable toes on their feet reticulated leaf frog has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet this allows it to grasp stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat gliding during evolutionary history of frogs several different groups have independently taken to air some frogs in tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to forest floor typical of them is wallace s flying frog rhacophorus nigropalmatus from malaysia and borneo it has large feet with fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and digits fully webbed flaps of skin occur on lateral margins of limbs and across tail region with digits splayed limbs outstretched and these flaps spread it can glide considerable distances but is unable to undertake powered flight it can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to between trees life history thumb left life cycle of green frog rana like other amphibians life cycle of a frog normally starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills commonly known as a tadpole after further growth during which it develops limbs and lungs tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged after this it is able to leave water as a miniature air breathing frog reproduction two main types of reproduction occur in frogs prolonged breeding and explosive breeding in former adopted by majority of species adult frogs at certain times of year assemble at a pond lake or stream to breed many frogs return to bodies of water in which they developed as larvae this often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals in explosive breeders mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area in these frogs mating and spawning take place promptly and speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of ephemeral pools before they dry up among prolonged breeders males usually arrive at breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned this means that males outnumber females at water s edge and defend territories from which they expel other males they advertise their presence by calling often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs larger stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories females select their mates at least partly on basis of depth of their voice in some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call they may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory calling is an energy sapping activity sometimes two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite thumb male and female common toads bufo bufo in amplexus in explosive breeders first male that finds a suitable breeding location such as a temporary pool calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on pool explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away spadefoot toads scaphiopus spp of north america fall into this category mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction in some years suitable conditions may not occur and frogs may go for two or more years without breeding some female new mexico spadefoot toads spea only spawn half of available eggs at a time perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later at breeding site male mounts female and grips her tightly round body typically amplexus takes place in water female releases her eggs and male covers them with sperm fertilization is external in many species such as great plains toad bufo male restrains eggs with his back feet holding them in place for about three minutes members of west african genus are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous larvaepartus eleutherodactylus and members of tanzanian genus are only frogs known to be ovoviviparous in these species fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs except l larvaepartus which give birth to tadpoles life cycle eggs frogspawn left thumb frogspawn frogs embryos are typically surrounded by several layers of gelatinous material when several eggs are clumped together they are collectively known as frogspawn jelly provides support and protection while allowing passage of oxygen carbon dioxide and ammonia it absorbs moisture and swells on contact with water after fertilization innermost portion to allow free movement of developing embryo in certain species such as northern red legged frog rana aurora and wood frog rana sylvatica symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in gelatinous material it is thought that these may benefit developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis most eggs are black or dark brown and this has advantage of absorbing warmth from sun which insulating capsule retains interior of globular egg clusters of wood frog rana sylvatica has been found to be up to 6 degc 11 degf warmer than surrounding water and this speeds up development of larvae shape and size of egg mass is characteristic of species ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas produce long cylindrical strings tiny yellow striped pygmy eleutherodactylus limbatus lays eggs singly burying them in moist soil smoky jungle frog leptodactylus makes a nest of foam in a hollow eggs hatch when nest is flooded or tadpoles may complete their development in foam if flooding does not occur red eyed treefrog agalychnis callidryas deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch larvae fall into water below larvae developing in eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes and will hatch early to avoid being eaten in general length of egg stage depends on species and environmental conditions aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by developing larvae tadpoles thumb frogspawn development larvae that emerge from eggs known as tadpoles or occasionally typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails as a general rule free living larvae are fully aquatic but at least one species has tadpoles which live among wet rocks tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons lateral line systems gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming from early in its development a gill pouch covers tadpole s gills and front legs lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ some species go through metamorphosis while still inside egg and hatch directly into small frogs tadpoles lack true teeth but jaws in most species have two elongated parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak but number of rows can vary and exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification in pipidae with exception of hymenochirus tadpoles have paired anterior barbels which make them resemble small catfish their tails are stiffened by a notochord but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at base which forms urostyle during metamorphosis this has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles because transformation into frogs happens very fast tail is made of soft tissue only as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by tail tadpoles are typically herbivorous feeding mostly on algae including diatoms filtered from water through gills some species are carnivorous at tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis is one of a number of species in which tadpoles can be cannibalistic tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by others so late developers may have better long term survival prospects tadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish newts predatory diving beetles and birds such as kingfishers some tadpoles including those of cane toad bufo marinus are poisonous tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in spring metamorphosis at end of tadpole stage a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into adult form this metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours and is initiated by production of hormone thyroxine this causes different tissues to develop in different ways principal changes that take place include development of lungs and disappearance of gills and gill pouch making front legs visible lower jaw transforms into big mandible of carnivorous adult and long spiral gut of herbivorous tadpole is replaced by typical short gut of a predator nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision and for new methods of locomotion and feeding eyes are repositioned higher up on head and eyelids and associated glands are formed eardrum middle ear and inner ear are developed skin becomes thicker and tougher lateral line system is lost and skin glands are developed final stage is disappearance of tail but this takes place rather later tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in limbs frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis at this time tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established adults thumb a xenopus laevis after metamorphosis after metamorphosis young adults may disperse into terrestrial habitats or continue to live in water almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults preying on invertebrates including arthropods worms snails and slugs a few of larger ones may eat other frogs small mammals and fish some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast moving prey while others push food into their mouths with their hands a few species also eat plant matter tree frog truncata is partly herbivorous its diet including a large proportion of fruit leptodactylus has been found to eat plants and folivory occurs in euphlyctis with plants constituting 79 5 of its diet by volume adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators northern leopard frog rana pipiens is eaten by herons hawks fish large salamanders snakes raccoons skunks mink bullfrogs and other animals thumb left alt a trophic pyramid showing frogs as primary predators frogs are primary predators and an important part of food web being cold blooded they make efficient use of food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes while rest is transformed into biomass they are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates most of which feed on plants by reducing herbivory they play a part in increasing growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem little is known about longevity of frogs and toads in wild but some can live for many years is a method of examining bones to determine age using this method ages of mountain yellow legged frogs rana were studied phalanges of toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter oldest frogs had ten bands so their age was believed to be 14 years including four year tadpole stage captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years an age achieved by a european common toad bufo bufo cane toad bufo marinus has been known to survive 24 years in captivity and american bullfrog rana catesbeiana 14 years frogs from temperate climates hibernate during winter and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time including wood frog rana sylvatica parental care thumb male common midwife toad with eggs alytes obstetricans thumb pouched frog assa darlingtoni although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs up to an estimated 20 of amphibian species may care for their young in some way evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily by size of water body in which they breed those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies some frog species started to lay their eggs on land once this happened desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care in small pools predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes variable that constrains their survival certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata water filled leaf axils or small woody cavities as sites for depositing a few tadpoles while these smaller rearing sites are free from competition they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance frog species that changed from use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs female strawberry poison dart frog oophaga pumilio lays her eggs on forest floor male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist when they hatch female moves tadpoles on her back to a water holding bromeliad or other similar water body depositing just one in each location she visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in continuing to do this until young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis granular poison frog oophaga looks after its tadpoles in a similar way many other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs tiny male stands guard over his egg cluster laid under a stone or log when eggs hatch he transports tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool where he partially immerses himself in water and one or more tadpoles drop off he then moves on to another pool male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carries eggs around with him attached to his hind legs he keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters after three to six weeks he travels to a pond and eggs hatch into tadpoles frog builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation foam is made from proteins and lectins and seems to have antimicrobial properties several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft eggs are laid in centre followed by alternate layers of foam and eggs finishing with a foam capping some frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies both male and female pouched frogs assa darlingtoni guard their eggs which are laid on ground when eggs hatch male lubricates his body with jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in egg mass tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs female gastric brooding frog sp from australia now probably extinct swallows her fertilized eggs which then develop inside her stomach she ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid tadpoles rely on yolks of eggs for nourishment after six or seven weeks they are ready for metamorphosis mother regurgitates tiny frogs which hop away from her mouth female darwin s frog darwinii from chile lays up to 40 eggs on ground where they are guarded by male when tadpoles are about to hatch they are engulfed by male which carries them around inside his much enlarged vocal sac here they are immersed in a frothy viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from yolks of eggs they remain in sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis after which they move into male s mouth and emerge defence thumb mildly toxic imitator thumb strawberry poison dart frog contains numerous alkaloids which deter predators at first sight frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size slow movement thin skin and lack of defensive structures such as spines claws or teeth many use camouflage to avoid detection skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings some can make prodigious leaps often into water that help them to evade potential attackers while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called to make them unpalatable to potential predators most toads and some frogs have large poison glands parotoid glands located on sides of their heads behind eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies these glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous if noxious effect is immediate predator may cease its action and frog may escape if effect develops more slowly predator may learn to avoid that species in future poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours an adaptive strategy known as aposematism poison dart frogs in family do this they are typically red orange or yellow often with contrasting black markings on their bodies is not poisonous but mimics appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators other species such as european fire bellied toad bombina bombina have their warning colour underneath they flash this when attacked adopting a pose that exposes vivid colouring on their bellies thumb left a common toad adopting a defensive stance some frogs such as poison dart frogs are especially toxic native peoples of south america extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting although few species are toxic enough to be used for this purpose at least two non poisonous frog species in tropical america eleutherodactylus and lineatus mimic colouration of dart poison frogs for self protection some frogs obtain poisons from ants and other arthropods they eat others such as australian corroboree frogs pseudophryne corroboree and pseudophryne can synthesize alkaloids themselves chemicals involved may be irritants hallucinogens nerve poisons or many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons but other creatures including humans who handle frogs may be severely affected some frogs use bluff or deception european common toad bufo bufo adopts a characteristic stance when attacked inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered bullfrog rana catesbeiana crouches down with eyes closed and head tipped forward when threatened this places parotoid glands in most effective position other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and most vulnerable parts of its body are protected another tactic used by some frogs is to scream sudden loud noise tending to startle predator gray tree frog hyla versicolor makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels shrew although toads are avoided by many predators common garter snake regularly feeds on them strategy employed by juvenile american toads bufo americanus on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile this is usually successful with snake passing by and toad remaining undetected if it is encountered by snake s head however toad hops away before crouching defensively distribution thumb golden toad bufo periglenes last seen in 1989 frogs live on all continents except antarctica but they are not present on certain islands especially those far away from continental land masses many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory such as stretches of sea mountain ridges deserts forest clearance road construction or other man made barriers usually a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions such as europe some frogs inhabit arid areas such as deserts and rely on specific adaptations to survive members of australian genus cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods once it rains they emerge find a temporary pool and breed egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs so breeding can be completed before pond dries up some frog species are adapted to a cold environment wood frog rana sylvatica whose habitat extends into arctic circle buries itself in ground during winter although much of its body freezes during this time it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs which protects them from damage conservation in 2006 of 4 035 species of amphibians that depend on water during some lifecycle stage 1 356 33 6 were considered to be threatened this is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1 427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status frog populations have declined dramatically since 1950s more than one third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since 1980s among these species are gastric brooding frogs of australia and golden toad of costa rica latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited pristine monteverde cloud forest reserve and its population crashed in 1987 along with about 20 other frog species in area this could not be linked directly to human activities such as deforestation and was outside range of normal fluctuations in population size elsewhere habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline as are pollutants climate change increased uvb radiation and introduction of non native predators and competitors a canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss emerging infectious diseases including chytridiomycosis and ranavirus are also devastating populations many environmental scientists believe amphibians including frogs are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate positions in food chains their permeable skins and typically biphasic lives aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults it appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by decline while those with direct development are most resistant left thumb deformed mink frog with an extra left leg frog mutations and genetic defects have increased since 1990s these often include missing legs or extra legs various causes have been identified or hypothesized including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting spawn on surface of ponds chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers and parasites such as trematode ribeiroia ondatrae probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors environmental factors contributing to rates of disease and vulnerability to attack by parasites malformations impair mobility and individuals may not survive to adulthood an increase in number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase likelihood of parasitism of other frogs because trematode s complex lifecycle includes ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds in a few cases captive breeding programs have been established and have largely been successful world association of zoos and aquariums named 2008 as year of frog in order to draw attention to conservation issues faced by them cane toad bufo marinus is a very adaptable species native to south and central america in 1930s it was introduced into puerto rico and later various other islands in pacific and caribbean region as a biological pest control agent in 1935 3000 toads were liberated in sugar cane fields of queensland australia in an attempt to control cane beetles such as dermolepida albohirtum larvae of which damage and kill canes initial results in many of these countries were positive but it later became apparent that toads upset ecological balance in their new environments they bred freely competed with native frog species ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates had few predators in their adopted habitats and poisoned pets carnivorous birds and mammals in many of these countries they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them uses culinary thumb french cuisses de grenouille frog legs are

largest exporter of frog meat exporting more than 5 000 tonnes of frog meat each year mostly to france belgium and luxembourg originally they were supplied from local wild populations but overexploitation led to a diminution in supply this resulted in development of frog farming and a global trade in frogs main importing countries are france belgium luxembourg and united states while chief exporting nations are indonesia and china annual global trade in american bullfrog rana catesbeiana mostly farmed in china varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes mountain chicken frog so called as it tastes of chicken is now endangered in part due to human consumption and was a major food choice of dominicans coon possum partridges prairie hen and frogs were among fare mark twain recorded as part of american cuisine scientific research frogs are used for dissections in high school and university anatomy classes often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance contrasts among biological systems this practice is declining due to animal welfare concerns and digital frogs are now available for virtual dissection frogs have served as experimental animals throughout history of science eighteenth century biologist luigi galvani discovered link between electricity and nervous system by studying frogs in 1852 h f stannius used a frog s heart in a procedure called a stannius ligature to demonstrate ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates african clawed frog or xenopus laevis was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in first half of 20th century a sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs a discovery made by english zoologist lancelot hogben this is because a hormone human chorionic gonadotropin is present in substantial quantities in urine of women during pregnancy in 1952 robert briggs and thomas j king cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer this same technique was later used to create dolly sheep and their experiment was first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of embryology although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed biologists continue to use xenopus as a model organism in developmental biology because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate they are readily obtainable and can easily be kept in laboratory xenopus laevis is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative xenopus tropicalis which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than one to two years for x laevis thus facilitating faster studies across generations genomes of xenopus laevis x tropicalis rana catesbeiana rhinella marina and have been sequenced and deposited in ncbi genome database pharmaceutical because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse they have raised interest of biochemists as a natural pharmacy alkaloid a painkiller 200 times more potent than morphine is made by some species of poison dart frogs although it can also cause death by lung paralysis other chemicals isolated from skins of frogs may offer resistance to hiv infection dart poisons are under active investigation for their potential as therapeutic drugs it has long been suspected that pre columbian mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by cane toad as a hallucinogen but more likely they used substances secreted by colorado river toad bufo these contain bufotenin 5 meo dmt a psychoactive compound that has been used in modern times as a recreational drug typically skin secretions are dried and then smoked illicit drug use by licking skin of a toad has been reported in media but this may be an urban myth thumb left golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis from skin of golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis are traditionally used by native to poison darts they use for hunting tip of projectile is rubbed over back of frog and dart is launched from a combination of two alkaloid toxins and is so powerful one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22 000 mice two other species poison dart frog phyllobates and black legged dart frog phyllobates bicolor are also used for this purpose these are less toxic and less abundant than golden poison frog they are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise quantity of poison that can be transferred to dart cultural beliefs thumb right moche frog sculpture frogs feature prominently in folklore fairy tales and popular culture they tend to be portrayed as benign ugly and clumsy but with hidden talents examples include michigan j frog frog prince and kermit frog warner brothers cartoon one froggy evening features michigan j frog that
