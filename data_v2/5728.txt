carnotaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived in south america during late cretaceous period between about 72 and 69 9 million years ago only species is carnotaurus sastrei known from a single well preserved skeleton it is one of best understood theropods from southern hemisphere skeleton found in 1984 was uncovered in chubut province of argentina from rocks of la colonia formation carnotaurus is a derived member of abelisauridae a group of large theropods that occupied large niche in southern landmasses of gondwana during late cretaceous phylogenetic relations of carnotaurus are uncertain it might have been closer to either majungasaurus or aucasaurus carnotaurus was a lightly built bipedal predator measuring in length and weighing at least as a theropod carnotaurus was highly specialized and distinctive it had thick horns above eyes a feature unseen in all other carnivorous dinosaurs and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck carnotaurus was further characterized by small vestigial forelimbs and long slender hindlimbs skeleton is preserved with extensive skin impressions showing a mosaic of small non overlapping scales approximately 5 mm in diameter mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined sides of animal and there are no hints of feathers distinctive horns and muscular neck may have been used in fighting conspecifics according to separate studies rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows by slow pushes with upper sides of their skulls or by ramming each other head on using their horns as shock absorbers feeding habits of carnotaurus remain unclear some studies suggest animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of fastest large theropods description thumb left alt size comparison of carnotaurus scale diagram comparing carnotaurus to a human carnotaurus was a large but lightly built predator only known individual was about in length making carnotaurus one of largest abelisaurids while ekrixinatosaurus and possibly abelisaurus highly incomplete would have been similar or larger in size a 2016 study found that only at was longer than carnotaurus which was estimated at its mass is estimated to have been and in separate studies that used different estimation methods carnotaurus was a highly specialized theropod as seen especially in characteristics of skull vertebrae and forelimbs pelvis and hindlimbs on other hand remained relatively conservative resembling those of more basal ceratosaurus both pelvis and hindlimb bones were long and slender left thigh bone of individual measures 103 cm in length but shows an average diameter of only 11 cm skull thumb upright alt cast of skull skull cast dinosaur discovery museum wisconsin skull measuring in length was proportionally shorter and deeper than in any other large carnivorous dinosaur snout was moderately broad not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like ceratosaurus and jaws were curved upwards as in other abelisaurids facial bones especially nasal bones were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes in life a wrinkled and possibly keratinous skin would have covered these bones a prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above eyes these horns formed by frontal bones were thick and cone shaped but somewhat vertically flattened in cross section and measured in length in life they would probably have formed bony cores of much longer keratinous horns proportionally small eyes were situated in upper part of keyhole shaped orbita eye sockets upper part was slightly rotated forward probably permitting some degree of binocular vision teeth were long and slender as opposed to usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids on each side of upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth while lower jaws were equipped with fifteen dentary teeth per side in contrast to robust looking skull lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed with dentary foremost jaw bone connected to hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points lower jaw was found with hyoid bones in position they would be in if animal was alive these slender bones supporting tongue musculature and several other muscles are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily vertebrae thumb left alt three views of caudal ribs on vertebrae sixth tail vertebra of holotype in a side b front and c top views with arrows indicating highly modified caudal ribs vertebral column consisted of ten cervical neck twelve dorsal six fused sacral and an unknown number of caudal tail vertebrae neck was nearly straight rather than having s curve seen in other theropods and also unusually wide especially towards its base top of neck s spinal column featured a double row of enlarged upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses creating a smooth trough on top of neck vertebrae these processes were highest points of spine towering above unusually low spinous processes epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature a similar double row was also present in tail formed there by highly modified caudal ribs in front view protruding upwards in a v shape their inner sides creating a smooth flat top surface of front tail vertebrae end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook shaped expansion that connected to caudal rib of preceding vertebra forelimbs thumb alt drawing of hand bones bones of hand as interpreted by ruiz and colleagues 2011 forelimbs were proportionally shorter than in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs including tyrannosaurus forearm was only a quarter size of upper arm there were no in hand so that metacarpals articulated directly with forearm hand showed four basic digits though apparently only middle two of these ended in finger bones while fourth consisted of a single splint like metacarpal that may have represented an external spur fingers themselves were fused and immobile and may have lacked claws carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs and in having fourth splint like metacarpal as longest bone in hand a 2009 study suggests that arms were vestigial in abelisaurids because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today s emus and kiwis which also have vestigial forelimbs skin thumb left alt illustration restoration carnotaurus was first theropod dinosaur discovered with a significant number of fossil skin impressions these impressions found beneath skeleton s right side come from different body parts including lower jaw front of neck shoulder girdle and rib cage largest patch of skin corresponds to anterior part of tail originally right side of skull also was covered with large patches of skin this was not recognized when skull was prepared and these patches were accidentally destroyed still surface texture of much of right side of skull is very different from that of left side and probably shows some features of scalation pattern of head skin was built up of a mosaic of polygonal non overlapping scales measuring approximately in diameter this mosaic was divided by thin parallel grooves scalation was similar across different body parts with exception of head which apparently showed a different irregular pattern of scales there is no evidence of feathers uniquely for theropods there were osteoderms knob like skin bones running along sides of neck back and tail in irregular rows each bump showed a low ridge and measured in diameter they were set apart from each other and became larger towards animal s top bumps probably represent clusters of condensed scutes similar to those seen on soft frill running along body midline in hadrosaurid duck billed dinosaurs stephen czerkas 1997 suggested that these structures may have protected animal s sides while fighting members of same species conspecifics and other theropods arguing that similar structures can be found on neck of modern iguana where they provide limited protection in combat classification thumb alt restored skeleton restored cast of holotype museu de ciencias da puc mina thumb upright forelimb bones carnotaurus is one of best understood genera of abelisauridae a family of large theropods restricted to ancient southern supercontinent gondwana abelisaurids were dominant predators in late cretaceous of gondwana replacing carcharodontosaurids and occupying ecological niche filled by tyrannosaurids in northern continents several notable traits that evolved within this family including shortening of skull and arms as well as peculiarities in cervical and caudal vertebrae were more pronounced in carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid though relationships within abelisauridae are debated carnotaurus is consistently shown to be one of most derived members of family by analyses its nearest relative might have been either aucasaurus or majungasaurus this ambiguity is largely due to incompleteness of aucasaurus skull material a recent review suggests that carnotaurus was not closely related to either aucasaurus or majungasaurus and instead proposed as its sister taxon carnotaurus is eponymous for two subgroups of abelisauridae carnotaurinae and carnotaurini paleontologists do not universally accept these groups carnotaurinae was defined to include all derived abelisaurids with exclusion of abelisaurus which is considered a basal member in most studies however a 2008 review suggested that abelisaurus was a derived abelisaurid instead carnotaurini was proposed to name clade formed by carnotaurus and aucasaurus only those paleontologists who consider aucasaurus as nearest relative of carnotaurus use this group below is a cladogram published by canale and colleagues in 2009 discovery thumb illustration of known material of carnotaurus only skeleton holotype ch 894 was unearthed in 1984 by an expedition led by argentinian paleontologist jose bonaparte this expedition also recovered peculiar spiny sauropod amargasaurus it was eighth expedition within project named jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial vertebrates of south america which started in 1976 and was sponsored by national geographic society skeleton is well preserved and articulated still connected together with only posterior two thirds of tail much of lower leg and hind feet being destroyed by weathering during fossilization skull and especially muzzle were crushed laterally while premaxilla were pushed upwards onto nasal bones as a result upward curvature of upper jaw is artificially exaggerated in holotype skeleton belonged to an adult individual as indicated by fused sutures in braincase it was found lying on its right side showing a typical death pose with neck bent back over torso unusually it is preserved with extensive skin impressions in view of significance of these impressions a second expedition was started to original excavation site leading to recovery of several additional skin patches thumb left skin impressions from tail skeleton was collected on a farm named sastre near bajada moreno in department of chubut province argentina because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion a very hard kind of rock preparation was complicated and progressed slowly in 1985 bonaparte published a note presenting carnotaurus sastrei as a new genus and species and briefly describing skull and lower jaw generic name carnotaurus means meat eating bull an allusion to animal s bull like horns specific name sastrei honors angel sastre owner of ranch where skeleton was found a comprehensive description of whole skeleton followed in 1990 after abelisaurus carnotaurus was second member of family abelisauridae that was discovered for years it was by far best understood member of its family and also best understood theropod from southern hemisphere it was not until 21st century that similar well preserved abelisaurids were described including aucasaurus majungasaurus and allowing scientists to re evaluate certain aspects of anatomy of carnotaurus holotype skeleton is displayed in argentine museum of natural sciences bernardino rivadavia replicas can be seen in this and other museums around world sculptors stephen and sylvia czerkas manufactured a life sized sculpture of carnotaurus that was previously on display at natural history museum of los angeles county this sculpture ordered by museum during mid 1980s is probably first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin age and paleoecology thumb carnotaurus in environment originally rocks in which carnotaurus was found were assigned to upper part of formation which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old albian or cenomanian stage later they were realized to pertain to much younger la colonia formation dating 72 to 69 9 million years ago late cretaceous lower maastrichtian stage thus carnotaurus was latest south american abelisaurid known by late cretaceous south america was already isolated from both africa and north america la colonia formation is exposed over southern slope of north patagonian massif most vertebrate fossils including carnotaurus come from formation s middle section called middle facies association this part likely represents deposits of an environment of estuaries tidal flats or coastal plains climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods most common vertebrates collected include lungfish turtles crocodiles plesiosaurs dinosaurs lizards snakes and mammals some of snakes that have been found belong to families and such as turtles are represented by at least five taxa four from and one from among marine reptiles is plesiosaur of family mammals are represented by which was considered first record of a south american and possibly of in 2011 discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from la colonia formation was announced paleobiology function of horns thumb left alt side of skull skull in multiple views with details of skin structures inferred and right frontal horn carnotaurus is only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on frontal bone use of these horns is not entirely clear several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics in display or in killing prey greg paul 1988 proposed that horns were butting weapons and that small orbita would have minimized possibility of hurting eyes while fighting gerardo mazzetta and colleagues 1998 suggested that carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams they calculated that neck musculature was strong enough to absorb force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5 7 m s each fernando novas 2009 interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with head he suggested that shortness of skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing moment of inertia while muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows he also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by head and neck other studies suggest that rivaling carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows but pushed slowly against each other with upper sides of their skulls thus horns may have been a device for distribution of compression forces without damage to brain this is supported by flattened upper sides of horns strongly fused bones of top of skull and inability of skull to survive rapid head blows gerardo mazzetta and colleagues 1998 propose that horns might also have been used to injure or kill small prey though horn cores are blunt they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering however this would be only reported example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals jaw function and diet thumb alt drawing of a carnotaurus head restoration of head showing soft tissues inferred from osteological morphology of skull analysis of jaw structure of carnotaurus by mazzetta and colleagues 1998 2004 2009 suggests that animal was capable of quick bites but not strong ones quick bites are more important than strong bites when capturing small prey as shown by studies of modern day crocodiles these researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility kinesis within skull and especially lower jaw somewhat similar to modern snakes elasticity of jaw would have allowed carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole in addition front part of lower jaw was hinged and thus able to move up and down when pressed downwards teeth would have projected forward allowing carnotaurus to spike small prey items when teeth were curved upwards now backward projecting teeth would have hindered caught prey from escaping mazzetta and colleagues also found that skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs this interpretation was questioned by francois therrien and colleagues 2005 who found that biting force of carnotaurus was twice that of american alligator which may have strongest bite of any living tetrapod these researchers also noted analogies with modern komodo dragons flexural strength of lower jaw decreases towards tip linearly indicating that jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey as a consequence according to this study carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals possibly by ambush robert bakker 1998 found that carnotaurus mainly fed upon very large prey especially sauropods as he noted several adaptations of skull short snout relatively small teeth and strong back of skull occiput had independently evolved in allosaurus these features suggest that upper jaw was used like a serrated club to inflict wounds big sauropods would have been weakened by repeated attacks locomotion thumb left alt cross section of tail muscles cross section through tail of carnotaurus showing enlarged caudofemoralis muscle and v shaped caudal ribs mazzetta and colleagues 1998 1999 presumed that carnotaurus was a swift runner arguing that thigh bone was adapted to withstand high bending moments while running ability of an animal s leg to withstand those forces limits its top speed running adaptations of carnotaurus would have been better than those of a human although not nearly as good as those of an ostrich scientists calculate that carnotaurus had a top speed of up to per hour in dinosaurs most important locomotor muscle was located in tail this muscle called caudofemoralis attaches to fourth trochanter a prominent ridge on thigh bone and pulls thigh bone backwards when contracted scott persons and phil currie 2011 note that in tail vertebrae of carnotaurus caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally t shaped but were angled against vertical axis of vertebrae forming a v this would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger than in any other theropod muscle mass was calculated at per leg therefore carnotaurus could have been one of fastest large theropods while caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged epaxial muscles situated above caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller these muscles called and muscle were responsible for tail movement and stability to maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking vertebrae with each other and with pelvis stiffening tail as a consequence ability to make tight turns would have been diminished because hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously unlike in other theropods see also timeline of ceratosaur research notes references external links bite of carnotaurus at universidad
