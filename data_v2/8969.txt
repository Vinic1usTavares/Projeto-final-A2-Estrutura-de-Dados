joseph s tomb yosef qabr yusuf is a funerary monument located at eastern entrance to valley that separates mounts gerizim and ebal 300 metres northwest of jacob s well it lies on outskirts of west bank city of nablus near tell balata site of in late bronze age and later biblical shechem one biblical tradition identifies general area of shechem as resting place of biblical patriarch joseph and his two sons ephraim and manasseh multiple locations over years have been viewed as legendary burial place of joseph joseph s tomb has been venerated throughout ages by samaritans for whom it is second holiest site by jews by christians and by muslims some of whom view it as location of a local medieval sheik yusef al venerated by members of every religious community in palestine few tombs on earth command veneration of so many races and men of diverse creeds as that of joseph samaritan and jew moslem and christian alike revere it and honour it with their visits post biblical records regarding location of joseph s tomb somewhere around this area date from beginning of 4th century ad present structure a small rectangular room with a cenotaph dates from 1868 and is devoid of any trace of ancient building materials der uber und um ein der heute als gilt ist ganz modern und enthalt nicht einmal alte while some scholars such as kenneth kitchen and james k affirm essential historicity of biblical account of joseph others such as donald b redford argue that story itself has no basis in fact there is no archaeological evidence establishing tomb as joseph s problem is that no archaeological evidence specifically makes them historical so we refer to them as relic sites and modern scholarship has yet to determine whether or not present cenotaph is to be identified with ancient biblical gravesite whether today s cenotaph and its site are identical with ancient one can presently not be decided lack of jewish or christian sources prior to 5th century that mention tomb indicates that prior to 4th century it was a samaritan site samaritan sources tell of struggles between samaritans and christians who wished to remove joseph s bones at key points in its long history a site thought to be joseph s tomb in this area witnessed intense sectarian conflict samaritans and christians disputing access and title to site in early byzantine period often engaged in violent clashes after israel captured west bank in 1967 muslims were prohibited from worship at shrine and it was gradually turned into a jewish prayer room interreligious friction and conflict from competing jewish and muslim claims over tomb became frequent though it fell under jurisdiction of palestinian national authority pna following signing of oslo accords it remained under idf guard with muslims prohibited from praying there at beginning of al aqsa intifada in 2000 just after being handed over to pna it was looted and razed by rioting palestinians following reoccupation of nablus during israel s operation defensive shield in 2002 jewish groups returned there intermittently between 2009 and 2010 structure was refurbished with a new cupola installed and visits by jewish worshippers have resumed early traditions biblical source and early religious traditions torah provides four details regarding traditions surrounding joseph s remains account in genesis relates that before his death he had his brothers swear they would carry his bones out of egypt to canaan he is then said to have been embalmed then placed in a coffin in egypt in exodus we are told that moses fulfilled pledge by taking joseph s bones with him when he left egypt in joshua joseph s bones are said to have been brought from egypt by children of israel notes a variant tradition recorded in so called small genesis jubilees 46 7 which states however that israelites brought out from egypt bones of jacob s sons except those of joseph and interred in shechem bones of joseph which children of israel brought up out of egypt were buried in shechem in a parcel of land jacob bought from sons of father of shechem for a hundred pieces of silver see also bible does not identify a specific site in shechem where his bones were laid to rest genesis rabba a jewish text written c 400 450 ce states that a burial site in shechem is one of three for which nations of world cannot ridicule israel and say you have stolen them it having been purchased by jacob rav bar simeon said this is one of three passages on basis of which nations of world cannot ridicule israel saying you have stolen property others being cave at hebron and site of temple jerusalem genesis rabba 79 7 rabbis also suggest that joseph instructed his brothers to bury him in shechem since it was from there he was taken and sold into slavery other jewish sources have him buried either in safed or according to an aggadic tradition have him interred at hebron according to his own wishes ambiguity is reflected in islamic tradition which points to nablus as being authentic site though some early islamic geographers identified cave of patriarchs in hebron as housing his tomb tomb of joseph is in plot of ground lying outside solomon s enclosure haram it stands opposite tomb of jacob and is near that of his forefathers abraham and isaac now ibrahim ibn ahmad al khalanji states that he was requested by one of caliph al s women al by name who was at holy city to proceed to place where according to tradition joseph was buried and having discovered sepulchre to erect over it a building so al khalanji set forth with workmen and they found place where according to tradition joseph was buried namely outside enclosure of solomon and opposite tomb of jacob and they bought field from its owner and began to lay it bare in very place indicated by tradition they came on a huge rock and this by order of al khalanji was broken into they tore off a portion and says al khalanji i being with workmen in trench when they raised up fragment lo here lay body of joseph peace be upon him beautiful and glorious to look on as he is always represented to have been now first there arose from place an odour of musk i caused workmen to set it down into its place against fragment of rock to be as it has been before and afterwards mujir ad din continues they built over this place dome which can be seen there to this day in proof that tradition is a true one and that patriarch is buried beneath general site is called al qala ah castle qur an itself does not mention details of joseph s burial ali of herat 1119 yaqut 1229 and ibn battuta 1369 all conserve both nablus and hebron traditions later muslim chroniclers also mention a third site purporting to be authentic tomb near beit ijza hebron tradition is also reflected in some medieval christian sources such as account by ce 1102 who says that bones of joseph were buried more humbly than rest as it were at extremity of castle modern scholarship on narrative of joseph s bones though traditional biblical date for narrative of joseph s life and death places him in egypt in middle of twelfth dynasty roughly comparable to hyksos invasion of egypt contemporary scholarship no longer accepts such a remote dating figure of joseph itself is often taken to be a personification of a tribe rather than an historic person joseph ist ein according to bible joseph was embalmed and buried in a coffin in egypt after having his people swear to carry his bones away genesis 50 24 26 later midrash identify his first entombment in a royal mausoleum or as cast into nile

is reading defended by josephus s editor benedikt niese this is often emended to en in hebron reading conserved by inferior manuscripts which are influenced by septuagint regarding his burial in canaan from joshua it is evident that portion joseph received was an allotment near shechem not town itself majority of contemporary scholars believe historicity of events in joseph story cannot be demonstrated majority of current scholars believe that historicity of egyptian sojourn exodus and wilderness wandering that bible remembers cannot be demonstrated by historical methods in conclusion it is question for evidence principally that forms historical probability this evidence is not found in narratives like joseph story in wake of scholars like hermann gunkel hugo gressmann and gerhard von rad who identified story of joseph as primarily a literary composition departure from historical approach which sought for exact period when joseph rose to power was mainly caused by recognition of gunkel gressmann von rad and others that joseph story is a literary composition a novella von rad even stated that joseph story has no historical political concern whatsoever also a cult tendency is lacking and we even miss a salvation historical and theological orientation joseph story with its clearly didactic tendency belongs to ancient wisdom school it is now widely considered to belong to genre of romance joseph s myth has basic affinities with romance or novella as has long been realized joseph story is in fact a novella or short story joseph story as marchen novelle as a novella it is read as reworking legends and myths many of them especially motifs of his reburial in canaan associated with egyptian god osiris though some compare burial of his bones at shechem with disposal of dionysus s bones at delphi die erzahlung aber dass die lade mit dem des joseph sie lange in aegypten war beim von den israeliten und nach gebracht worden sei kann als dass der cultus eines toten in einer lade gottes der eigentlich in aegypten zu hause war von den israeliten worden ist dieser gott is osiris joseph s double burial and his first resting place in nile shares several motifs extant in egyptian osiris myth reworked legends and folklore were probably inserted into developing textual tradition of bible between 8th and 6th centuries bce most scholars writes there are no compelling linguistic or historical reasons to date story later than ninth to eighth century of first millennium b c e place its composition in a genre that flourished in persian period of exile a romance of ancient genre of romantic religious novellae that revived in hellenistic world first great example in israelite literature is joseph romance old peasant stories of patriarchs and joshua heroes of holy places at bethel hebron beersheba and shechem had doubtless long been collected in cycles and may before persian times have been connected with some or all of other elements in narrative myths about beginning of world flood and so on joseph romance nomads tales of moses and stories about conquest of country these components are clear how they were put together is hazy but most scholars would agree that jerusalem priests of persian period were final editors who gave material substantially its present form and rewrote many stories to serve their own purposes usually as legal precedents several episodes in narrative and plot motifs themselves find some parallel in saite persian or ptolemaic egypt it is sheer weight of evidence and not argument from silence that leads to conclusion that seventh century b c is terminus a quo for egyptian background to joseph story if we assign third quarter of fifth century b c e as terminus ante quem we are left with a span of two and one half centuries comprising in terms of egyptian history saite and early persian periods biblical joseph story was a novella created sometime during seventh or sixth century b c end of judean monarchy or exile camel carrying gum balm and myrrh in joseph story reveals an obvious familiarity with main products of lucrative arabian trade that flourished under supervision of assyrian empire in eighth seventh centuries bce a seventh century bce background is also evident in some of peculiar egyptian names mentioned in joseph story for schenke tradition of joseph s burial at shechem can only be understood as a secondary historical interpretation woven around a more ancient canaanite shrine in that area die tradition von grab bei kann also nur als deutung eines heiligen werden wright has indeed argued that patriarch joseph was not an israelite hero who became but an egyptian divinity who was schenke s hypothesis hans martin schenke starting from an analysis of in which jesus encounters a samaritan woman at town made an extensive analysis of ancient sources together with an examination of site curiosity of gospel text for scholars lies in mention of an otherwise unattested town in field and failure of text to refer to joseph s tomb despite mentioning field jacob allotted to joseph and jacob s well in schenke s view from beginning of hellenistic period down to 1st century ce when author of john s gospel was presumably writing grave commemorating joseph stood by jacob s well this grave was shifted together with sacred tree and jacob s field sometime between that

off way from jacob s well she saw tombs of twelve patriarchs citing jerome opera omnia migne vol 1 p 889 atque inde a jacob duodecim jerome himself together with byzantine monk george syncellus who had lived many years in palestine wrote that all twelve patriarchs joseph included were buried at sychem duodecim autem non sunt in sed in sychem epistle 57 10 both theodosius i and theodosius ii ordered a search for joseph s bones much to utter dismay of samaritan community an imperial commission was dispatched to retrieve bones of patriarchs around 415 and on failing to obtain them at hebron sought to at least secure joseph s bones from shechem no gravestone marked exact site possibly because samaritans had removed one to avoid christian interference officials had to excavate general area where graves abound and on finding an intact marble sepulchre beneath an empty coffin concluded that it must contain joseph s bones and sent sarcophagus to byzantium where it was incorporated into hagia sophia jerome reports that apparently christians had intended to remove joseph s bones to their city but a column of fire rose skyward from tomb scaring them away samaritans subsequently covered tomb with earth rendering it inaccessible in days of high priest eleazar christians came and laid waste to field of joseph s tomb they said that they wanted to take remains of joseph patriarch away they would excavate by day but during night ground would revert to its previous state so they seized some samaritans and made them go and dig sad and weeping seized men did not have their heart in their work when friday came towards evening they arrived at entrance to cave and kept on appealing to god for help saying this is night time and we are no longer able to do any work until sabbath is over a sign appeared in sky thunder with gusty winds and fire erupted from mouth of cave to heavens there was fire on mount gerizim a pillar of cloud returned to mountain this was what was written about in holy torah these miracles were a witness to mighty desires of gentiles to own joseph then christians came and put up a building over grave which samaritans then demolished they then took seven people from among them and executed them so they then seized high priest eleazar and leaders of and hanged them christian pilgrim and archdeacon theodosius 518 520 in his de situ terrae sanctae mentions that close to jacob s well are remains of joseph holy madaba mosaic map 6th century designates a site somewhat problematically with legend joseph s to tou ioseph where usual adjective holy hagios accompanying mentions of saints and their shrines is lacking crusader and medieval sources generally are according to hans martin schenke highly misleading regarding exactly where tomb was situated he concluded that in middle ages as earlier various groups jews samaritans christians and muslims at different periods identified different things in different places all as joseph s tomb sometimes balata with its spring seems indicated as in following two examples which identify tomb not as a structure but as something by a spring and under a tree it was evidently a site for muslim pilgrimage at that time in 1173 persian traveller al paid homage at tomb and wrote there is also near nablus spring of al khudr elias and field of yusuf as sadik joseph further joseph is buried at foot of tree at this place around year 1225 yaqut al hamawi wrote there is here a spring called ain al khudr yusuf joseph as sadik peace be on him was buried here and his tomb is well known lying under tree information is contained also in ibn abd al haqq s abridgement of yaqut al hamawi s book entitled al fi asma al wa al compiled several decades later as did benjamin of tudela who wrote that samaritans in nablus were in possession of it william of malmesbury describes it as overlaid with white marble next to mausolea of his brothers menachem ben peretz of hebron 1215 writes that in shechem he saw tomb of joseph son of jacob with two marble pillars next to it one at its head and another at its foot and a low stone wall surrounding it 1322 places tombstone of joseph 450 meters

debatable as to whether any of these reports refer to currently recognised location samuel ben samson 1210 appears to place tomb at shiloh corrects original shiloh to sichem shechem emending text by presuming a lacuna to read and from shiloh to shechem mandeville 1322 locates it nigh beside nablus as does maundrell 1697 but indications are vague maundrell describes his sepulchre as located in a small mosque just by nablus which does not fit present location although koran does not mention details of joseph s burial islamic tradition points to nablus as being authentic site however some early islamic geographers identified cave of patriarchs in hebron as housing his tomb while ali of herat 1119 yaqut 1229 and ibn battuta 1369 all report hebron traditions they also mention existence of a tomb of joseph at nablus later muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be authentic tomb near beit ijza 19th century accounts william cooke taylor 1838 describes biblical parcel of ground jacob gave to joseph as situated on plain of and identifies tomb as an oriental weli structure at entrance to valley of nablus to right near base of mt ebal sarcophagus he suggests lies underneath or somewhere else in vicinity of this plain and comments present monument is a place of resort not only for jews and christians but mohammedans and samaritans all of whom concur in belief that it stands on spot where patriarch was buried in 1839 jewish traveller loewe based his identification of tomb as near jacob s well by a topographical argument scripture he argued calls place neither an emek valley nor a plain but a portion of field and concluded in whole of palestine there is not such another plot to be found a dead level without least hollow or swelling in a circuit of two hours in 1839 it was recorded that jews frequently visited tomb and that many inscriptions in hebrew were visible on walls site was kept very neat and in good repair by bounty of jews who visited

in year 5509 am john wilson 1847 writes that tomb lies about two or three hundred yards to north of jacob s well across valley he describes it as a small solid erection in form of a wagon roof over what is supposed to be patriarch s grave with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities sometimes called tombs of ephraim and manasseh and middle of an enclosure without a covering many visitors names in hebrew and samaritan characters are written on walls of this enclosure one of inscriptions is said to intimate tomb s repair by a jew from egypt elijah son of meir around 1749 wilson adds that jews of nablus take upon themselves duty of keeping tomb in order they applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request these hebrew and samaritan inscriptions were still visible on white plastered walls as late as 1980 as were small lamps in an internal recess probably donated by jews during 18th and 19th centuries thumb 180px jewish

century described their impressions of site in travelogues john ross browne 1853 writes we also visited reputed site of joseph s tomb a rude stone building covers pretended sepulcher but best authorities deny that there was any evidence that joseph was buried here howard crosby also visited site during 1851 he designated it so called tomb of joseph describing it as a plain white santon s tomb or wely such as is everywhere seen in mohammedan countries excepting that this one is roofless and consequently lacks usual white dome in interior a vine grows from a corner and spreads upon a trellis over tomb forming a pleasant bower louis felicien joseph de and edouard de warren 1853 describe it as a small weli i e chapel said to be tomb of joseph noting it was just to east of what arabs called bir yakub jacob s well hackett noted in 1857 that tomb is placed diagonally to walls instead of parallel and found walls of interior covered with names of pilgrims representing almost every land and language though hebrew character was most prominent one thomson noted in 1883 that entire building is fast crumbling to ruin presenting a most melancholy spectacle being exposed to weather it has no pall or votive offering of any kind nor any marks of respect such as are seen at sepulchres of most insignificant muslim saints during late 19th century sources report jewish custom of burning small articles such as gold lace shawls or handkerchiefs in two low pillars at either end of tomb this was done in memory of patriarch who sleeps beneath tomb stands in a little yard close to mosque at end of a fine row of olive and fig trees and enclosed by a low stone wall two low pillars stand at head and foot of tomb their tops hollowed out and blackened by fire jews making a practice of burning small articles such as gold lace shawls or handkerchiefs in these saucer like cups in memory of patriarch who sleeps beneath most curious point to notice is however existence of two short pillars one at head other at foot of tomb having shallow cup shaped hollows at their tops these hollows are blackened by fire for jews have custom of burning sacrifices on them small articles such as handkerchiefs gold lace or shawls being consumed whether this practice is also observed by samaritans is doubtful jews still burn shawls and other stuffs at grave of joseph in shechem detailed survey

not in line with walls of courtyard which have a bearing of 202deg nor is it in middle of enclosure being nearest to west wall two short plastered pedestals with shallow cup shaped hollows at their tops stand at head and foot of tomb hollows are blackened by fire due to jewish custom of burning offerings of shawls silks or gold lace on pillar altars both jews and samaritans burn oil lamps and incense in pillar cavity conder also questions fact that tomb points north to south inconsistent with muslim tombs north of mecca this fact did not however diminish muslim veneration of shrine tomb points approximately north and south thus being at right angles to direction of moslem tombs north of mecca how mohammedans explain this disregard of orientation in so respected a prophet as our lord joseph i have never heard perhaps rule is held to be only established since time of mohammed veneration in which shrine is held by moslem peasantry is at all events not diminished by this fact

exclusively muslim tomb in vicinity about a quarter of a mile up valley on slope of mt gerizim he is not able to conclude which of tombs is that of biblical joseph but cites arthur penrhyn stanley 1856 that at muslim tomb a later joseph is also commemorated at sanctuary stanley himself writes that little mosque on gerizim s north eastern slopes is known by various names including allon moreh oak of allon aharon moreh ark of moreh and sheykh al saint of pillar which he suggests commemorate biblical traditions stanley also quotes buckingham who mentions that samaritans maintain that alternative tomb belongs to a certain rabbi joseph of nablus john mills 1864 writes that claims of tomb belonging to rabbi joseph of nablus are unfounded structure being called by samaritans pillar in commemoration of pillar set up by joshua mills rather identifies supposed rabbi s tomb with a mosque named after a muslim saint sheikh el amud saint of pillar but further claims that association is only a modern invention of mohammedans a book published in 1894 also questions existence of a tomb to rabbi joseph of nablus calling it a mohammedan legend imposed upon inquisitive travellers by
