commander james bond rn code number 007 is a fictional character created by british journalist and novelist ian fleming in 1952 character appeared in a series of twelve novels and two short story collections written by fleming and a number of continuation novels and spin off works after fleming s death in 1964 there have been twenty seven films in total produced between 1962 and 2020 fleming portrayed bond as a tall athletic handsome secret agent in his thirties or forties he has several vices including drinking smoking gambling automobiles and womanising he is an exceptional marksman and skilled in unarmed combat skiing swimming and golf while bond kills without hesitation or regret he usually kills only when carrying out orders while acting in self defence and occasionally as revenge american actor barry nelson was first to portray bond on screen in a 1954 television adaptation casino royale in 1961 eon productions began work on dr no an adaptation of novel of same name result was a film that spawned a series of twenty four films produced by eon productions and two independent films after considering likes of refined english actors such as cary grant and david niven producers cast sean connery as bond in film fleming was appalled at selection of uncouth 31 year old scottish actor considering him antithesis of his character however connery s physical prowess and sexual magnetism became closely identified with character with fleming ultimately changing his view on connery and incorporating aspects of his portrayal into books seven actors in total have portrayed bond in film following connery s portrayal david niven george lazenby roger moore timothy dalton pierce brosnan and daniel craig have assumed role these screen versions have retained many traits from fleming s depiction although some of bond s less fashionable attitudes have been dropped such as racism homophobia retaining services of a maid and in more recent films smoking despite playing same character there have been notable differences among portrayals daniel craig is incumbent bond in long running eon series and played part for a fourth time in latest film spectre released in october 2015 fleming s literary characterisation a secret service agent james bond was a composite based on a number of commandos author ian fleming had known during his service in naval intelligence division during world war ii to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes fleming appropriated his character s name from eponymous american ornithologist bond s code number 007 comes from one of british naval intelligence s key achievements of world war i breaking of german diplomatic code one of german documents cracked and read by british was zimmermann telegram which was coded and which was one of factors that led to us entering war subsequently if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified fleming later told a journalist when i was at admiralty all top secret signals had double 0 prefix and i decided to borrow it for bond although james bond is in his mid to late thirties he does not age in fleming s stories fleming biographer andrew lycett noted that within first few pages of casino royale ian had introduced most of bond s idiosyncrasies and trademarks which included his looks his bentley and his smoking and drinking habits bond s penchant for alcohol runs throughout series of books and he smokes up to 70 cigarettes a day fleming decided to underplay bond s character observing exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure on another occasion he reinforced his point when i wrote first one in 1953 i wanted bond to be an extremely dull uninteresting man to whom things happened i wanted him to be a blunt instrument films sean connery 1962 1967 1971 and 1983 sean connery was first actor to portray bond in film in dr no 1962 an amateur bodybuilder he had come to attention of bond film producers after several appearances in british films from late 1950s at a muscular 6 2 connery was initially met with disapproval from fleming who believed he was an overgrown stuntman lacking finesse and elegance to play james bond he envisaged a suave actor such as david niven playing role producer albert r broccoli known to all as cubby disagreed with fleming s view later commenting that i wanted a ballsy guy put a bit of veneer over that tough scottish hide and you ve got fleming s bond instead of all poofs we had applying for job eon s choice of connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal an appeal that would later be echoed by honor blackman who said after appearing with connery in goldfinger he was exceedingly handsome virile and sexy and that really was tenor of what script was always trying to display after connery was chosen director terence young took actor to his tailor and hairdresser and introduced him to high life restaurants casinos and women of london in words of bond writer raymond benson young educated actor in ways of being dapper witty and above all cool in connery s interpretation of character differed considerably from fleming s being more promiscuous and cold blooded than literary version connery described bond as a complete senses highly tuned awake to everything quite amoral i particularly like him because he thrives on conflict academic james chapman observed that for dr no connery s interpretation of character although not complete showed actor should be credited with having established a new style of performance a british screen hero in manner of an american leading man in his second film from russia with love connery looked less nervous and edgy he gave a relaxed wry performance of subtle wit and style pfeiffer and worrall noted that connery personified james bond with such perfection that even ian fleming admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in part academic jeremy black agreed and declared that connery made role his own and created bond audience for cinema black also observed that connery gave character a spare pared down character with inner bleakness along with style connery played bond with right mix of cool charisma violence and arrogance against which all others are judged raymond benson perceived that connery embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about character benson also noted that bond was witty but contains an assured toughness that epitomises machismo male roger moore agreed with black and benson commenting that sean was bond he created bond he embodied bond and because of sean bond became an instantly recognisable character world over he was rough tough mean and witty he was a bloody good 007 however despite his charm and virility connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery christopher bray says of him that in his single minded laconic mocking self sufficient vanity connery s bond was epitome of sixties consumer culture thumb left connery in amsterdam in july 1971 filming diamonds are forever interviewed by oriana fallaci in 1965 connery identified where he had altered character for films saying i said to producers that character had one defect there was no humor about him to get him accepted they d have to let me play him tongue in cheek so people could laugh they agreed and there you are today bond is accepted to such an extent that even philosophers take trouble to analyze him even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him and even while they re laughing at him people take him terribly seriously connery went on to add that bond is important this invincible superman that every man would like to copy that every woman would like to conquer this dream we all have of survival and then one can t help liking him after pressures of five films in six years connery left role after 1967 film you only live twice saying it became a terrible pressure like living in a goldfish bowl that was part of reason i wanted to be finished with bond also i had become completely identified with it and it became very wearing and very boring after a hiatus of one film on her majesty s secret service in which george lazenby played bond connery returned to role for diamonds are forever after david picker head of united artists made it clear that connery was to be enticed back to role and that money was no object when approached about resuming role of bond connery demanded and received a fee of ps1 25 million ps million in pounds 12 5 of gross profits and as a further enticement united artists offered to back two films of his choice his performance received mixed reviews with raymond benson considering that connery looks weary and bored he is overweight slow moving and doesn t seem to be trying to create a credible character despite that benson considers that connery still radiates more screen presence than roger moore or george lazenby on other hand pauline kael said connery s james bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish and he s better this way in early 1980s producer jack schwartzman moved ahead with a non eon bond film following controversy over 1961 novel thunderball and subsequent long legal battle result was never say never again connery accepted an offer to play bond once more asking for and receiving a fee of 3 million million in dollars a percentage of profits as well as casting director and script approval script has several references to bond s advancing years playing on connery being 52 at time of filming david robinson reviewing film for times considered that connery is back looking hardly a day older or thicker and still outclassing every other exponent of role in goodnatured throwaway with which he all sex and violence on way in 2003 bond as

image of character in 1965 producer charles feldman signed niven to play sir james bond for casino royale a film not made by eon productions connery and peter sellers had both turned down role niven was 56 when he played bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won victoria cross at siege of mafeking had a daughter by his lover spy mata hari played claude debussy on piano ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses concept of bond is that once niven s bond retired his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep legend alive james chapman notes that implication was that other bond was that played by connery chapman considered concept of an elderly bond interesting with bond referring to connery s bond as a sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses in line with literary bond niven s character drives a vintage bentley rather than aston martin favoured by connery bond scholar steven jay rubin thought niven perfectly cast as retired bond and saw him as a throw back to hell for leather adventure heroes of character which paralleled niven s own life and career barnes and hearn describe this as a perfectly fair interpretation given way niven approached role while raymond benson thinks casting niven was intelligent jeremy black questioned use of niven in role observing that he did not seem to be a killer and did not have disconcerting edge that connery had david niven as james bond in year film salary millions 1967 casino royale non eon film unknown george lazenby 1969 thumb left george lazenby at november 2008 big apple con in manhattan alt grey haired man in red check shirt sitting at a table on which his hands are resting with departure of connery after you only live twice broccoli and director peter r hunt chose australian george lazenby to play role of bond he first came to their attention after seeing him in a fry s chocolate cream advertisement lazenby dressed part by sporting several sartorial bond elements such as a rolex submariner wristwatch and a savile row suit ordered but uncollected by connery and going to connery s barber at dorchester hotel lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler who was acting as stunt coordinator in face impressing broccoli with his ability to display aggression lazenby never signed a contract with negotiations dragging on during production and he was subsequently convinced by his agent ronan o that secret agent would be archaic in liberated 1970s as a result he left role before release of on her majesty s secret service in 1969 for his performance as bond lazenby was nominated for golden globe award for new star of year actor at 27th golden globe awards critical opinion was split about lazenby he has been considered to have been worst bond and has variously been described as laconic and humourless a little stiff and annoying and smug derek malcolm of guardian was dismissive of lazenby s performance saying that he is not a good actor and though i never thought sean connery was all that stylish either there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache new york times critic ah weiler also weighed in against lazenby saying that lazenby if not a spurious bond is merely a casual pleasant satisfactory replacement pauline kael called lazenby quite a dull fellow in her otherwise positive review in new yorker however peter r hunt director of on her majesty s secret service stated that lazenby should have undertaken more films in role saying he would have made a very credible bond and been very good indeed smith and lavington consider that lazenby had chosen to play bond same way as sean connery had with perhaps more humility and humanity they went on to say that lazenby s inexperience rarely shows in film and that he invariably rises to occasion alexander walker in london evening standard said that truth is that george lazenby is almost as good a james bond as man referred to in his film as other fellow lazenby s voice is more suave than sexy sinister and he could pass for other fellow s twin on shady side of casino bond is now definitely all set for seventies judith crist of new york magazine commented that this time around there s less suavity and a no nonsense muscularity and maleness to role via handsome mr lazenby feminist film critic molly haskell wrote an approving review in village voice lazenby seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini more at ease as a genealogist than reading or playing playboy and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part time playmates james chapman considers that lazenby looks part of bond identifying his athleticism and arrogant swagger which convey snobbery of character chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in bond feeling exhausted and falling in love as opposed to heroic superman of connery brian fairbanks noted that ohmss gives us a james bond capable of vulnerability a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak lazenby is that man and his performance is superb ben macintyre also observed that of all bonds lazenby s characterisation was closest to that of fleming s original character george lazenby as james bond in year film salary millions 1969 on her majesty s secret service 0 1 roger moore 1972 1985 thumb roger moore in 1973 photographed by allan warren after diamonds are forever broccoli and saltzman tried to convince sean connery to return as bond but he declined after considering jeremy brett michael billington and julian glover two producers finally turned to roger moore who they had previously discussed for on her majesty s secret service but who had been unavailable and he was ultimately cast to play bond in live and let die at time moore was an established television actor known for his performances as simon templar in saint and lord brett sinclair in in both of which he played a charming debonair international playboy when playing bond moore tried not to imitate either connery or his previous roles and screenwriter tom mankiewicz fitted screenplay around moore s persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light hearted feel to bond an approach that led raymond benson to describe moore s bond as a rather smarmy eyebrow raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt film writer andrew spicer considered roger moore most elegant and mannerly of bonds with voice and style of an english debonair country gentleman benson agreed stating that moore was too nice and well mannered to be a james bond of any real substance while doug pratt said that writers worked out an amenable personality for roger moore and found a breezy balance between comedy and action to make moore s character appear tougher a smith wesson 44 magnum which at time was associated with macho image of clint eastwood character dirty harry was chosen for moore to use in live and let die rather than bond s usual choice of walther ppk spicer says roger moore re created bond as an old style debonair hero more polished and sophisticated than connery s incarnation using mocking he had perfected in his role as simon templar moore s humour was a throwaway and certainly in later films verged on self parody it was an essential strand in increasingly tongue in cheek direction of series which became more light hearted knowing and playfully intertextual chapman noted that moore was most comedic of bonds with a more light hearted approach to playing character with a mocking wit and innuendo additionally moore s one liners were delivered in a way to suggest that violence inherent in films was a joke as opposed to connery s which was used to mitigate violence moore explained his approach to humour by saying to me bond situations are so ridiculous i mean this man is supposed to be a spy and yet everybody knows he s a spy it s outrageous so you have to treat humour outrageously as well pauline kael was a fairly vocal critic of moore s dismissing him as an iceberg in man with golden gun in reviewing for your eyes only she wrote roger moore is bond again and his idea of bond s imperturbable cool is same as playing dead reviewing moonraker she wrote roger moore is dutiful and passive as bond his clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension only in spy who loved me one of kael s favourite bond films did she praise him describing him as self effacing moore gets chance to look emotion that suits him and makes him more likable a number of moore s personal preferences were transferred into his characterisation of bond his taste for cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits were assigned to character moore s use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to cigarette smoking connery lazenby and dalton by time of moore s fifth film for your eyes only released in 1981 his characterisation had come to represent an old fashioned character in contrast to fashionability connery had brought to role in 1960s in 1985 moore appeared in his seventh and final film a view to a kill he was 57 he appeared alongside co star tanya roberts who was 30 critics focused on moore s age washington post said moore isn t just long in tooth he s got tusks and what looks like an eye job has given him pie eyed blankness of a zombie he s not believable anymore in action sequences even less so in romantic scenes when he was cast for film moore recalled that he felt a bit long in tooth and in december 2007 admitted that he was only about four hundred years too old for part like connery moore appeared as bond in seven films by time he retired in 1985 he was oldest actor to play 007 in eon series and his bond films had earned over at box office roger moore as james bond in year film

actor to play bond took place that saw a number of actors including sam neill pierce brosnan and timothy dalton audition for role in 1986 bond co producer michael g wilson director john glen dana and barbara broccoli were impressed with sam neill and very much wanted to use him although bond producer albert r broccoli was not sold on actor dalton and brosnan were both considered by eon but after brosnan was eventually ruled out by his remington steele contract dalton was appointed in august 1986 on a salary of 5 2 million when he was either 24 or 25 years old dalton had discussed playing bond with broccoli but decided he was too young to accept role thinking bond should be played between 35 and 40 years old in preparing for role dalton a green eyed dark haired slender 6 2 1 m 88 cm classically trained shakespearean actor was keen to portray character as accurately as possible reading up extensively on books before his role in living daylights 1987 thumb 190px left timothy dalton played bond twice in 1987 and 1989 dalton s bond was a serious one dark cold emotional stern ruthless showing little humour and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence dalton s interpretation of character came from his desire to see a darker bond one that was less of a womaniser tougher and closer to darker character ian fleming wrote about james chapman also considered dalton closer to fleming s bond than previous actors writing that dalton was clearly less comfortable with witty asides and one liners so he becomes something closer to bond of books who rarely develops a sense of humour when reviewing licence to kill iain johnstone of sunday times disagreed declaring that any vestiges of gentleman spy by ian fleming have now gone he went on to say that this character is remarkably close both in deed and action to eponymous hero of new batman film not all viewers were taken with dalton jay scott of globe and mail was entirely dismissive new bond has been widely described in feature stories as a throwback to ian fleming original studying fleming novels dalton was pleased to discover that bond was a human being he says and that may be true if fleming original lacked charm sex appeal and wit timothy dalton s bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity and eschews promiscuity harry you get feeling that on his off nights he might curl up with reader s digest and catch an episode of moonlighting he d try to memorize jokes before nodding off under influence of british reviews of living daylights have been laudatory perhaps because this bond is most british of all if british is to be understood as a synonym for reserved raymond benson noted that dalton purposely played bond as a ruthless and serious man with very little of wit displayed by connery lazenby or moore and considered him most accurate and literal interpretation of role ever seen on screen his character also reflected a degree of moral ambiguity in licence to kill for instance he becomes a rogue agent while dalton himself saw character as a man not a superhuman a man who is beset with moral confusions and and uncertainties and who is often very frightened and nervous and tense smith and lavington observed that during dalton s portrayal in licence to kill bond appeared self absorbed reckless brutal prone to nervous laughter and probably insane or at least seriously disturbed in light of licence to kill one academic martin willis referred to dalton s bond as a muscular vigilante steven jay rubin noted that dalton s films had a hard edged reality and some unflinching violent episodes that were better suited to dalton s more realistic approach to character rubin considered dalton s portrayal fleming s bond suffering bond in contrast to previous incarnations of character smith and lavington identified dalton s humour as brooding rather than flippant combined with his heavy smoking they considered him an effective leading man although bond screenwriter richard maibaum called sean connery best bond he considered dalton best actor of four he worked with tom mankiewicz agreed with this view praising dalton s androgynous facets my life as a mankiewicz an insider s journey through hollywood with robert crane publisher university press of kentucky 2012 his predecessor roger moore also felt that dalton was best actor to play bond director john glen also felt that dalton was best actor that portrayed bond and that he was ahead of his time noting comparisons between daniel craig s incarnation to that of dalton s dalton s films did not perform as well at box office as most of previous films commentators such as screen international considered bond series had run its course in age of series such as indiana jones and lethal weapon edward p comentale observed that dalton for all his occasional flat northern vowels was probably too much stage actor to be convincing as an action hero in age of willis schwarzenegger and stallone after just two films living daylights and licence to kill litigation ensued over licensing of bond catalogue delaying what would have been dalton s third film by several years his six year contract expired in 1993 and he left series in 1994 timothy dalton as james bond in year film salary millions 1987 3 0 1989 licence to kill 5 0 pierce

was 4 million which rose to 16 5 million for his fourth and final outing die another day brosnan had first met broccoli on set of for your eyes only when brosnan s wife cassandra harris was appearing in film as countess von schlaf and couple lunched with broccoli during filming brosnan went on to play a criminal turned private investigator in remington steele in 1980s where he captured some of traits of previous bonds in playing role like moore he exemplified a high degree of suavity elegance charm and wit but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of connery s bond both successfully combine character s englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing andrew spicer says that brosnan s frame carries armani look with its refined understated englishness to perfection his lithe sinuous athleticism is well suited to fast paced action and state of art gadgetry that retains series core appeal james chapman also considered brosnan s appearance striking saying actor had old fashioned darkly handsome matinee idol looks with brosnan bond writers knew that because of changes in public attitudes he could not be as overtly sexual and dominant over women as connery s bond and was denounced by m in goldeneye as a sexist misogynist dinosaur a relic of cold war brosnan was seen by many as quintessential james bond in appearance and manner displaying an air of coolness elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy if not purely as an assassin john g stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as brosnan and connery could be a secret agent saying when sean connery or pierce brosnan enters a room everyone notices thus it is ridiculous to suppose that james bond looking like that could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds brosnan s bond was introduced in goldeneye james chapman argues that film works his portrayal of bond into history of others in series through post credits sequence use of previously seen in goldfinger and thunderball thus immediately evoking memory of sean connery brosnan s characterisation of bond was seen by jeremy black as being closer to fleming novels than moore yet he is also lighter and less intense than dalton black also commented that shift in character in first three films reflected changing social opinions with bond not smoking brosnan was clear he wanted to change bond s smoking habit saying i don t give a damn about everyone s perception of character i think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn t smoke although he did smoke a cuban cigar in die another day brosnan continued with use of humour prevalent with other portrayals and provided a mix of action and danger threaded through with right amount of wit and humour smith and lavington saw humour largely as puns that were flippant but not crass after four films in role brosnan stated he wished to do one final bond film although plans were made for a film to be released in 2004 negotiations stalled and brosnan announced his intention to leave in july 2004 pierce brosnan as james bond in year film salary millions 1995 goldeneye 4 0 1997

campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott film in protest craig unlike previous actors was not considered by protesters to fit tall dark

after release of film many of whom believed he was first actor to truly nail fleming s character in book todd mccarthy reviewing film for variety considered that craig comes closer to author s original conception of this exceptionally long lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early sean connery and he went on to say that craig once and for all claims character as his own while steven spielberg called craig perfect 21st century bond paul arendt writing for bbc agreed observing that daniel craig is not a good bond he s a great bond specifically he is 007 as conceived by ian fleming a professional killing machine a charming cold hearted patriot with a taste for luxury craig is first actor to really nail 007 s defining characteristic he s an absolute swine james chapman commented on realism and violence in film noting that bond is seen to seriously bleed for first time in series chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make casino royale notable in series in
