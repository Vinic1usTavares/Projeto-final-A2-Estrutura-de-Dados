earthen dwellings in central highlands and largely plant based construction along coasts with intermediary zones making use of both material types architecture of madagascar is unique in africa bearing strong resemblance to construction norms and methods of southern borneo from which earliest inhabitants of madagascar are believed to have immigrated throughout madagascar and kalimantan region of borneo most traditional houses follow a rectangular rather than round form and feature a steeply sloped peaked roof supported by a central pillar differences in predominant traditional construction materials used serve as basis for much of diversity in malagasy architecture locally available plant materials were earliest materials used and remain most common among traditional communities in intermediary zones between central highlands and humid coastal areas hybrid variations have developed that use cob and sticks wood construction once common across island declined as a growing human population destroyed greater swaths of virgin rainforest for slash and burn agriculture and zebu cattle pasture zafimaniry communities of central highland montane forests are only malagasy ethnic group who have preserved island s original wooden architectural traditions their craft was added to unesco list of intangible cultural heritage in 2003 as wood became scarce over time wooden houses became privilege of noble class in certain communities as exemplified by homes of merina nobility in 19th century kingdom of madagascar use of stone as a building material was traditionally limited to construction of tombs a significant feature of cultural landscape in madagascar due to prominent position occupied by ancestors in malagasy cosmology island has produced several distinct traditions in tomb architecture among mahafaly of southwest coast top of tombs may be stacked with skulls of sacrificed zebu and spiked with aloalo decoratively carved tomb posts while among merina aristocrats historically constructed a small wooden house on top of tomb to symbolize their andriana status and provide an earthly space to house their ancestors spirits traditional styles of architecture in madagascar have been impacted over past two hundred years by increasing influence of european styles a shift toward brick construction in highlands began during reign of queen ranavalona ii 1868 1883 based on models introduced by missionaries of london missionary society and contacts with other foreigners foreign influence further expanded following collapse of monarchy and french colonization of island in 1896 modernization over past several decades has increasingly led to abandonment of certain traditional norms related to external orientation and internal layout of houses and use of certain customary building materials particularly in highlands among those with means foreign construction materials and techniques namely imported concrete glass and wrought iron features have gained in popularity to detriment of traditional practices origins thumb alt a large wooden house on high piles with a steeply sloping gabled roof this house in south kalimantan bears many of iconic construction features brought from borneo to madagascar two thousand years ago wood plank walls piles to raise house from ground and a steeply sloping roof topped with crossed gable beams to form roof horns architecture of madagascar is unique in africa bearing strong resemblance to architecture of southern borneo from which earliest inhabitants of madagascar are believed to have emigrated traditional construction in this part of borneo also known as south kalimantan is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on piles roof which is supported by a central pillar is steeply sloped gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved central highlands of madagascar are populated by merina peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their kalimantan ancestors here traditional wooden houses of aristocracy feature a central pillar andry supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns trano in southeast of madagascar actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to gable peak throughout madagascar houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in kalimantan central pillars are widespread and in all but a handful of regions traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation regardless of whether feature is suited to local conditions certain cosmological and symbolic elements are common across indonesian and malagasy architecture as well central house pillar is sacred in kalimantan and madagascar alike and in both places upon constructing a new house this pillar was often traditionally anointed with blood features of building or its dimensions length size and particularly height are often symbolically indicative of status of its occupants or importance of its purpose on both islands likewise both madagascar and borneo have a tradition of partially above ground tomb construction and inhabitants of both islands practice carving of decorative wooden funerary posts called aloalo in western madagascar and in kajang dialect of borneo plant based construction 200px thumb left alt photograph of a small one room rectangular thatch hut with peaked roof most traditional coastal style houses with thatched roofing of ravinala on low piles in sambava dwellings made of plant material are common in coastal regions and were once commonly used throughout highlands as well types of plants available in a given locality determine building material and style of construction vast majority of homes made of plant material are rectangular low one story houses with a peaked roof and are often built on low stilts these architectural features are nearly identical to those found in parts of indonesia materials used for construction include reeds near rivers rushes in southwest around toliara endemic succulents as fencing in south wood in south and among zafimaniry and formerly common in highlands bamboo especially in eastern rain forests papyrus formerly in highlands around lake grasses ubiquitous palms ubiquitous but prevalent in west around mahajanga and raffia especially in north and northeast for much of length of eastern coast of madagascar bordering indian ocean architecture is highly uniform nearly all traditional homes in this region are built on low stilts and are roofed with thatch made of fronds of traveler s palm ravinala

this same plant typically after pounding it flat to make wide planks for floors and roofing or narrow strips for walls these strips are affixed vertically to frame raffia plant is often used in same way in place of traveler s palm in north when bamboo is used in place of ravinala long pounded sheets are often woven together to create walls with a checker like pattern these traditional homes have no chimney their floor is covered in a woven mat with stones heaped in one corner where wood fires can be burnt to cook food smoke that accumulates blackens ceiling and interior walls over time doorways of these homes were traditionally left open or could be shut by a woven screen held closed with a leather strap today entryway is frequently hung with a fabric curtain variations on this basic template can be found in all coastal regions using locally available material largest of traditional coastal houses are found in southeast among tanala and peoples where homes can reach 18 long 9 wide and 15 high elsewhere along coast homes are much smaller averaging 10 long 8 wide and 9 high wood based construction 200px thumb left alt small one room rectangular house with walls made of twigs packed with earth lateral branches form walls of traditional wooden mahafaly houses in southwest of madagascar it is believed that wood construction was formerly common in many parts of madagascar but it has all but disappeared due to deforestation this is especially true in highlands where until recently wood had been a building material reserved for aristocratic class due to its increasing rarity leaving lower classes to construct in other locally available materials such as reeds and grasses sticks and branches are occasionally used where available creating sporadic villages of wood typically within proximity to forest reserves while wooden architectural tradition among aristocracy of merina has died out at least two ethnic groups can be said to have a continuing tradition of plank wood architecture zafimaniry in central highlands and antandroy in far south each of these three traditions is described below merina aristocratic tradition among merina of central highlands people of southeastern manambondro region and several other ethnic groups deforestation rendered wood a valuable construction material only to be used by aristocrats indeed its traditional association with royal andriana class led king andrianampoinimerina 1787 1810 to issue a royal edict forbidding construction in stone brick or earth within limits of antananarivo and codifying a tradition in which only houses of nobles were constructed from wood while those of peasants were made from local plant materials this tradition historically existed among a number of ethnic groups in madagascar particularly along eastern coast where preservation of rainforests continues to facilitate access to wood for construction thumb alt large wooden house with a steeply peaked roof sixty feet high made of thatch besakana a structure in rova palace complex is representative of traditional wooden aristocratic dwellings of highlands of madagascar note long tandrotrano extending past roofline traditional peasants houses throughout imerina featured a thick central pillar andry that supported roof beam and a smaller upright beam at each corner extending into ground to stabilize structure unlike most coastal houses highland homes have never been raised on stilts but have always sat flush to ground to south of central pillar in area designated for sleeping and cooking wooden or bamboo planks were occasionally installed for flooring or woven mats were laid on packed earth floor which extended north past pillar traditionally bed of head of family was in southeast corner of house northern area was distinguished by hearth delineated by three oblong stones set vertically into ground houses and tombs were aligned on a north south axis with entrance on west face north portion of house was reserved for males and guests while south was for women children and those of inferior rank northeast corner was sacred reserved for prayer and offerings of tribute to ancestors houses of nobles were constructed according to these same cultural norms with several additions they were distinguishable from outside by their walls made of upright wooden planks and long wooden horns tandrotrano formed by crossing of roof beams at each end of roof peak length of tandrotrano was indicative of rank longer length higher status of noble family that lived within interior of building was also somewhat modified often featuring three central pillars rather than one and occasionally a wooden platform bed raised high off ground after andrianampoinimerina s edicts regarding construction materials in capital were revoked in late 1860s wooden construction was all but abandoned in imerina and older wooden houses were rapidly replaced with new brick homes inspired by lms missionaries british style dwellings tandrotrano horns were gradually replaced by a simple decorative finial installed at two ends of roof peak other architectural norms such as north south orientation central pillar and interior layout of homes were abandoned and presence of finials on roof peaks is no longer indicative of a particular social class classic examples of highland wooden architecture of aristocratic class were preserved in buildings of rova compound of antananarivo destroyed in a fire in 1995 but under reconstruction and walled compound at ambohimanga location of wooden palaces of king andrianampoinimerina and queen ranavalona i ambohimanga arguably most culturally significant remaining example of wooden architecture of highlands aristocracy was named a unesco

with a peaked roof overhanging eaves and wooden windows and doors many of same standards found in aristocratic architectural traditions of imerina are present in zafimaniry structures including central wooden pillar supporting roof beam exclusive use of a tongue and groove joining technique and orientation of building features such as windows doors and interior layout zafimaniry houses are often elaborately decorated with carved symmetrical abstract patterns that are rich in complex spiritual and mythological symbolism architecture of houses found in this region are considered to be representative of architectural style that predominated throughout highlands prior to deforestation and as such they represent last vestiges of a historic tradition and a significant element of malagasy cultural heritage for this reason woodcrafting knowledge of zafimaniry was added in 2003 to unesco list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity antandroy traditions by contrast antandroy inhabit madagascar spiny thickets an extremely dry and hot region in south of madagascar where unique forms of drought resistant plants have evolved and thrived their homes are traditionally square not rectangular raised on low stilts topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame these homes traditionally had no windows and featured three wooden doors front door was women s entrance door at rear of house was for children and third door was used by men fences are often constructed around antandroy houses using prickly pear cactus or lengths of indigenous succulents from surrounding spiny forests earth based construction 200px thumb alt tall opening through a wall of stacked rough cut stones with an enormous stone disk leaning against it to right town gates in highlands were traditionally protected by stone disks vavahady and shaded by fig trees in central highlands power struggles between merina and vazimba principalities and later amongst merina principalities over centuries inspired development of fortified town in imerina central region of highlands of madagascar first of these ancient imerina capital of alasora was fortified by 16th century king andriamanelo who surrounded town with thick cob walls made from mud and dry rice stalks gathered from nearby paddies and deep trenches hadivory to protect dwellings inside entryway through town wall was protected by an enormous stone disk vavahady five feet in diameter or more shaded by fig trees symbolic of royalty town gate was opened by laboriously rolling vavahady away from entryway each morning and back into place again in evening a task that required a team of men to accomplish it this fortified town model was adopted throughout imerina and is well represented at historic village of ambohimanga foreign influences 200px thumb left alt multi story brick house with peaked tile roof and decorative arches along length of second floor balcony brick house with arches and dormers inspired by queen s palace in antananarivo protestant missionary james cameron of london missionary society is believed to have been first in madagascar to demonstrate how local cob building material could be used to create sun dried bricks in 1826 in 1831 jean laborde introduced brick roof tiles that soon began replacing rice stalk thatch in antananarivo and surrounding areas and disseminated technique of using a kiln to bake bricks foreigners were responsible for several architectural innovations that blended traditions of highlands architecture with european sensibilities in 1819 louis gros designed for radama i in rova complex introducing wraparound veranda supported by exterior columns jean laborde designed queen s palace in rova built 1839 1841 using this same model on an even grander scale by enlarging building and adding a third story veranda new wooden buildings constructed by gros and laborde transformed tandrotrano of traditional aristocratic merina homes into a decoratively carved post affixed at each end of gable peak local innovations thumb 200px alt two story brick house with peaked roof and simple second floor covered veranda supported by four equidistant pillars typical brick houses with columns and west facing veranda near antananarivo in 1867 restrictions were relaxed on aristocracy s use of stone and brick as building materials before all restrictions on construction were abolished in 1869 by queen ranavalona ii who had already commissioned jean laborde in 1860 to encase exterior of her wooden palace at rova in stone building took its final form in 1872 after james cameron added stone towers to each corner of palace queen converted to christianity in 1869 and that same year london missionary society commissioned james cameron to construct a private home for its missionaries he drew his inspiration from work of gros and laborde to develop a multi story wooden house with veranda and columns this model exploded in popularity throughout antananarivo and surrounding areas as an architectural style for aristocracy who had to that point continued to inhabit simple homes similar to wooden palace of andrianampoinimerina at ambohimanga these newly favored brick houses often featured shortened tandrotrano and elaborately carved verandas these homes can naturally range in color from deep red to almost white depending on characteristics of earth used in its construction 200px thumb left alt two story rectangular brick building with peaked roof and no balcony or supporting columns trano gasy in rural areas simplified brick houses retain two stories but may lose veranda and obscure supporting columns over time and particularly with colonization of madagascar by french these earthen houses known as trano gasy malagasy house underwent constant evolution simplest form of earthen house is one or more stories tall rectangular and features a thatched roof with slightly overhanging eaves to direct rain away from foundation and thereby prevent its erosion wealthier families replace thatch with clay roofing tiles and construct a veranda on west face of building supported by four slender equidistant columns this design is even more effective at protecting building s foundations from eroding effects of rainfall further expansion often entails enclosure of western veranda in wood and construction of an open veranda on eastern face of building and so forth leading to wrap around verandas connection of two separate buildings with a covered passage incorporation of french wrought iron grills or glass panels into verandas application of painted concrete over brick surface and other innovations in suburban and rural zones ground floor of trano gasy is often reserved as a pen for livestock while family inhabits upper floors entrance typically faces west kitchen is often to south while family sleeps in northern part of building this configuration is consistent with that seen in traditional zafimaniry houses and reflects traditional cosmology mixed cob construction on eastern side of madagascar there is virtually no zone of transition between earthen houses of highlands and dwellings made of plant materials common to coastal regions in vast and sparsely populated expanses between highlands and western coastal areas however inhabitants utilize locally available materials to construct dwellings that bear features of both regions most often houses are small one room and only one story high constructed of a skeleton of horizontally arranged sticks affixed to wooden house frame as pictured in preceding section on wooden construction but unlike coastal homes where this stick skeleton would serve as a base for affixing plant material to form walls earthen cob may be packed into framework instead roof is thatched to complete dwelling these intermediary houses are also often distinguished by presence of shortened highlands style wooden columns on western face to support elongated eave of peaked roof much as they support verandas of larger homes of imerina floor is typically packed dirt and may be covered with woven mats of grasses or raffia tomb construction according to traditional beliefs of many malagasy ethnic groups one attains status of ancestor after death it is often believed that ancestors continue to watch over and shape events on earth and can intervene on behalf of or interfere with living as a consequence ancestors are to be revered prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common as well as observation of local fady taboos ancestors may have established in life gestures of respect such as throwing first of a new bottle of rum into northeast corner of room to share it with ancestors are practiced throughout island most visible emblem of respect due to ancestors is construction of elaborate family tombs that dot countryside in much of madagascar earliest burial practices traditionally majority of malagasy ethnic groups did not construct solid tombs for their dead rather bodies of deceased were left in a designated natural area to decompose among bara people of southern arid plains for instance tombs may be built into natural features such as rock outcroppings or hillsides by placing bodies within and partially or entirely sealing space with stacked stones or zebu skulls alternately among tanala deceased may be placed in coffins made from hollowed out logs and left in caves or a sacred grove of trees sometimes covered over by wooden planks held down by small piles of stones it is said vazimba earliest inhabitants of madagascar submerged their dead in waters of a designated bog river lake or estuary which was thereby considered sacred for that purpose practice also existed among earliest merina who submerged their dead chiefs in canoes into highland bogs or other designated waters where tombs were built minor variation in form and placement from one ethnic group to next is overshadowed by common features structure is partially or fully subterranean typically rectangular in design and made of stone that is either stacked loosely or cemented with masonry among merina and betsileo some early stone tombs and burial sites were indicated by upright unmarked standing stones islamic origins of tomb construction earliest known rectangular stone tombs on madagascar were most likely built by arab settlers around 14th century in northwestern part of island similar models emerged later among western i e sakalava mahafaly and highlands i e merina betsileo peoples first using unhewn stones and heaped or packed earth before transitioning toward masonry in highlands transition to masonry was preceded by construction of tombs from massive stone slabs collectively hauled by community members to tomb site late 18th century merina king andrianampoinimerina is said to have encouraged construction of such tombs observing a house is for a lifetime but a tomb is for eternity highlands traditions in highlands of imerina above ground entrances of ancient tombs were originally marked by standing stones and walls were formed of loosely stacked flat stones examples of these ancient tombs can be found at some of twelve sacred hills of imerina where a body was not able to be retrieved for burial as in times of war a tall unmarked standing stone or male stone was sometimes traditionally erected in memory of deceased andrianampoinimerina promoted more elaborate and costly tomb construction as a worthy expense for honoring one s ancestors he also declared that highest merina andriana noble sub castes would enjoy privilege of constructing a small house on top of a tomb to distinguish them from tombs of lower castes two highest andriana sub castes and built tomb houses called trano masina sacred house while tomb houses of andriamasinavalona were called trano manara cold house these houses were identical to standard wooden nobles houses except for fact that they had no windows and no hearth while lamba wrapped remains were laid to rest on stone slabs in tomb below deceased s valuable possessions such as gold and silver coins elegant silk decorative objects and more were placed in trano masina or trano manara which was often decorated much like a regular room with comfortable furniture and refreshments such as rum and water for deceased s spirit to enjoy trano masina of king radama i which burned with other structures in 1995 fire at rova palace compound in antananarivo was said to be richest known today tombs may be constructed using traditional methods and materials or incorporate modern innovations such as concrete inside superimposed slabs of stone or concrete line walls bodies of ancestors of an individual family are wrapped in silk shrouds and laid to sleep on these slabs among merina betsileo and remains are periodically removed for a celebration in honor of ancestors wherein remains are re wrapped in fresh shrouds amid extravagant communal festivities before being once again laid to rest in tomb significant expense associated with tomb construction funerals and reburial ceremonies honors ancestors even as it counters emergence of unequal wealth distribution in traditional communities 200px thumb alt low rectangular tomb carved and painted with geometric shapes mahafaly tomb with traditional painted decoration southern and western traditions tombs found in southwest of madagascar are among most striking and distinctive like those in highlands they are generally rectangular and partially subterranean modern tombs may incorporate concrete in addition to or in place of traditional stone they are distinguished from highlands tombs by their elaborate decoration images may be painted on exterior of tomb recalling events in an ancestor s life roof of tomb may be stacked with horns of zebu sacrificed in ancestor s honor at their funeral and numerous aloalo wooden funerary posts carved with symbolic patterns or images representing events in life of deceased may be planted on top tombs of mahafaly people are especially famed for this type of construction among sakalava of western coast aloalo may be topped with erotic carvings evocative of cycle of birth life and death modern architecture foreign architectural influences having arisen through increased european contact over course of 19th century intensified dramatically with advent of french colonization in 1896 over past several decades increasing availability of relatively inexpensive modern construction materials imported from china and elsewhere has further reinforced a growing trend in urban areas away from traditional architectural styles in favor of more durable but generic structures using industrially produced materials such as concrete and sheet metal certain modern innovations may be more highly esteemed than others in manambondro region for instance corrugated sheet metal roofing was typically least expensive and prestigious and most common addition to a traditional house replacement of locally sourced wood frames with factory milled lumber was next most common house modification followed by laying of a concrete foundation houses built entirely of concrete with glass windows and imported decorative balcony railings and window bars implied great wealth and highest social status although low income levels have served to preserve traditional construction among majority of population of madagascar due to prestige associated with modern architectural innovations traditional construction is often abandoned as income increases a limited number of recently constructed homes in antananarivo attempt to blend malagasy architectural traditions with comforts of modern house construction these hybrids resemble traditional brick highlands houses from exterior but use modern materials and construction techniques to efficiently incorporate electricity plumbing air conditioning and current kitchen features in a fully contemporary interior this innovation is exemplified in recent residential development at tana water front in district of downtown antananarivo notes external links woodcrafting knowledge of
