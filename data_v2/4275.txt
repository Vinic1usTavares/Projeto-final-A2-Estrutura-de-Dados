47 ursae majoris c abbreviated 47 uma c formally named taphao kaew thai astronomical society taphao thong taphao kaew first thai names is an extrasolar planet approximately 46 light years from earth in constellation of ursa major planet was discovered located in a long period around star 47 ursae majoris its orbit lasts 6 55 years and planet has a mass at least 0 540 times that of jupiter name in july 2014 international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars nameexoworlds an iau worldwide contest to name exoplanets and their host stars iau org 9 july 2014 process involved public nomination and voting for new names nameexoworlds process in december 2015 iau announced winning name was taphao kaew for this planet final results of nameexoworlds public vote released international astronomical union 15 december 2015 winning name was submitted by thai astronomical society of thailand was one of two sisters associated with a thai folk tale nameexoworlds approved names discovery thumb left orbits of 47 ursae majoris system planets 47 uma c is middle planet like many known extrasolar planets 47 ursae majoris c was discovered by detecting changes in its star s radial velocity caused by planet s gravity this was done by measuring doppler shift of star s spectrum at time of discovery in 2001 47 ursae majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet designated 47 ursae majoris b further measurements of radial velocity revealed another periodicity in data unaccounted for by first planet this periodicity could be explained by assuming that a second planet designated 47 ursae majoris c existed in system with an orbital period close to 7 years observations of photosphere of 47 ursae majoris suggested that periodicity could not be explained by stellar activity making planet interpretation more likely planet was announced in 2002 further measurements of 47 ursae majoris failed to detect planet calling its existence into question furthermore it was noted that data used to determine its existence left planet s parameters almost unconstrained a more recent study with datasets spanning over 6 900 days came to conclusion that while existence of a second planet in system is likely periods around 2 500 days have high false alarm probabilities and gave a best fit period of 7 586 days almost 21 years in 2010 a study was published that determined that there are three giant planets orbiting 47 ursae majoris including one at 2 391 days that corresponds well with original claims for 47 ursae majoris c physical characteristics since 47 ursae majoris c was detected indirectly properties such as its radius composition and temperature are unknown based on its high mass planet is likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface see also 47 ursae majoris in fiction footnotes references external links category 47 ursae majoris category exoplanets discovered in 2001 category giant planets category exoplanets detected by radial velocity category exoplanets with proper names
