via link up or by players holding one end of console each with one player using buttons and other d pad development in 1990 founders of codemasters david and richard darling were at consumer electronics show in las vegas and were impressed with popularity of nintendo entertainment system in usa they wanted to develop games for system but did not have a licence from nintendo in october 1989 programmer andrew graham developed a prototype california buggy boys which was showcased with multiple consoles networked prototype featured buggies similar to those in power drift and intention was to develop something that would be popular in united states codemasters then obtained a licensing deal with galoob who wanted them to develop a game based on their micro machines toys california buggy boys was used as a base and galoob sent toys to codemasters who wanted a good selection for game development team did not have access to official nintendo documents and their knowledge of nes s hardware came from reverse engineering they decided to have recognisable household environments and tables were a favourite although nes s limited graphics capabilities meant there was some repetition artist paul perrot converted california buggy boys graphics using deluxe paint and a cross compiler according to graham team tried to keep tracks short as they were considered more enjoyable graham stated that artificial intelligence ai is basic by modern standards and that it was difficult to replicate multiplayer experience in single player mode ai consisted of invisible arrows which directed computer controlled vehicles graham stated that split screen was not viable on nes and that single screen system was something that he was eager to try he further stated that he was very happy with multiplayer mode saying it is best part of game and made single player mode boring in comparison he was very pleased when richard darling stated that micro machines is best game they had ever made there was another multiplayer mode in development but did not make it this would have involved playing over a network this was shown at consumer electronics show micro machines was completed in september 1990 game did not go through quality assurance and as a result a major bug that caused game to crash was discovered near completion bug occurred when player tried to reverse on first race and escaped notice because none of testers thought to do so as they thought it was so easy it was determined that just one binary bit was wrong and a device that functioned like a miniature game genie was installed on cartridges to correct it as by time bug was discovered there were plenty of rom chips containing bugged version micro machines was released for nes by camerica in 1991 nintendo wanted development halted because codemasters did not have a licence from them and sued galoob over sales of game genie courts ruled in galoob s favour nintendo appealed but ruling was upheld but legal issues meant that sales of nes version were not as good as hoped after release of nes version ports for mega drive game gear master system game boy super nintendo entertainment system snes cd i and pc were developed mega drive team improved handling giving it an on rails feel and most of graphics merely required redrawing this involved adding colour or simply recreating them based on originals rotations were added to vehicle sprites for smoother movement according to artist brian hartley main considerations were colour schemes and it was decided to keep game with a cartoon style he stated it led to a fun use of colour as design decisions were made during development for nes version mega drive team simply had to convert game for mega drive hardware galoob s only input was to ensure their logos were correct mega drive version was originally due for release in january 1993 but legal issues with sega over game being unlicensed delayed release until july cd i version was coded by ashley hogg he stated that there were problems that only occurred on this console and cd rs were expensive game gear team were originally against on rails handling of mega drive version and wanted to revert to nes drifting game gear version was created by ashley routledge and dave saunders who adjusted mega drive graphics to game gear s smaller screen it was produced alongside mega drive version and programmed from scratch to run at 60 frames per second fps main problem was keeping as much detail as possible on game gear s inferior storage and memory capabilities much of art had to be redrawn with fewer colours at lower resolutions biggest problem was screen size which made it difficult to take corners at high speeds team tweaked camera movement so vehicle was positioned further back so players were able to see track ahead according to how fast vehicle is travelling another thing considered important was lack of options screens as it was felt players should be able to simply play game graham was at centre of development across platforms and had no problem with game gear version having vehicle behaviour similar to nes version routledge and saunders came up with method of multiplayer on same device multiplayer via link up was difficult to implement with problems such as game losing sync game gear version was released in 1993 master system cd i snes and pc versions in 1994 and game boy version in 1995 amiga version was released in september 1993 micro machines was followed by a sequel micro machines 2 turbo tournament in 1994 and a remake titled and released by
