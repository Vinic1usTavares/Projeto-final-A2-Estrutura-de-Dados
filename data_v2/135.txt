s evolution as an artist and also commended her talent and performance writing besides her sensual dancing unique voice and great energy you can tell from images on dvd she is a very professional artist who takes her job very seriously he concluded by calling audio cd of live from paris a compilation that covers in a good way her musical spectrum and dvd fantastic due to high quality of sound and video he also commented that live album offers a good overview of shakira s musical career stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic complimented energy of audio cd and shakira s versatility commenting she leans heavily on glitzy electro dance crossovers but finds room for quieter moments whether it s a stripped down cover of metallica s nothing else matters or her own gypsy keeping momentum running throughout a lengthy set then bringing down house with waka waka he however found video versions much more impressive opining that they give a greater indication of size of spectacle and emphasize shakira s intense charisma adam markovitz from entertainment weekly gave live album a mixed review he praised visual show shakira put up but was critical of her vocals saying she writhes and dry humps through her catalog like world s highest paid strip aerobics instructor showing off plenty of skin but sadly not much musicianship he also felt that shakira s performance was too sexual
