evening of 1 october ship accidentally rammed french fishing schooner croisine off newfoundland while latter was returning home to st malo with a full load of cod fishing boat passed down liner s port side and its masts destroyed some of liner s lifeboats on that side captain ernest davidson who was also commodore of convoy ordered convoy to continue while otranto stopped to rescue 37 survivors derelict croisine was now a menace to navigation and davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening liner caught back up with convoy by daybreak following day first death from influenza pandemic occurred and soldier was buried at sea only one other flu death aboard otranto is recorded but others may have occurred before she met her end scott pp 37 47 54 57 62 65 convoy encountered a strong storm on 4 october that got even stronger over next several days by morning of 6 october it was assessed as a force 11 storm on beaufort scale with mountainous seas storm forced british destroyers that were to rendezvous with them back into port on 5 october and last american escort departed at 06 00 weather prevented accurate navigation and convoy was forced to proceed by dead reckoning ship s officers were uncertain if they were off northern coast of ireland or western coast of scotland when dawn broke it revealed a rocky coastline to their east just ahead of convoy most of ships correctly thought this was scottish coast and turned south but otrantos officer of watch thought that it was irish coast and turned north another liner turned troopship was only about a half mile 0 80 km to otrantos north and turns placed them on a collision course both ships attempted to avoid collision but their efforts cancelled out and kashmir rammed otranto on port side amidships a few miles off rocky coast of islay scott pp 62 67 75 impact punched a hole some deep and wide in otranto from below waterline up to boat deck hole was right at bulkhead between fore and aft boiler rooms and both instantly flooded killing most of crewmen in those spaces when engine room flooded shortly afterwards otranto lost all electrical power and began to drift towards cliffs of islay water pressure caused other bulkheads to collapse quickly flooding other spaces below waterline and giving ship a massive list to starboard impact also damaged many of remaining lifeboats on that side crew attempted to use collision mats to cover hole in ship s side but it proved to be too large bow was crushed by impact although she was able to steam off when a wave forced two ships apart soon after collision scott pp 73 77 high winds and heavy seas prevented launching of any lifeboats and davidson had decided not to abandon ship just yet in faint hope that some passengers and crewmen might be able to swim ashore once ship got closer about a half hour after collision british destroyer appeared after searching for convoy during night despite davidson s order to stand clear mounseys captain lieutenant francis craven positioned his ship on otrantos lee side to allow men aboard liner to jump aboard several times two ships struck and destroyer s hull was holed her bridge smashed two of three boiler rooms flooded and many hull frames were broken by force of impacts nonetheless craven kept his small ship close and was able to rescue 300 american troops 266 officers and crewmen from otranto one ymca morale officer and 30 french fishermen although many more men had been washed from decks or crushed between two ships despite weight of rescued men and damage sustained during rescue mounsey was able to reach belfast safely although she was too badly damaged to return to her own home port against storm scott pp 85 100 about three hours after collision a large wave dropped otranto onto old women s reef about three quarters of a mile 1 2 km offshore near entrance to bay missing a sandy beach just north of reef action of enormous waves quickly broke ship in half and then ripped her bottom out of roughly 489 men aboard after mounsey departed only 21 17 of these were american were able to successfully swim ashore although two of these including one american later died of their injuries islanders were able to rescue some of these men by pulling them up coastal cliffs or from rocks just offshore by following morning liner had been completely demolished by heavy seas and coastline was strewn with wreckage and hundreds of bodies in piles up to deep a total of 316 americans were found and buried on islay and nearby island of muck scott pp 103 22 aftermath best estimate of casualty toll from disaster is a total of 470 men 12 officers and 84 crewmen from otranto 1 officer and 357 american enlisted men and 6 french fishermen after war most of american bodies were reinterred at brookwood american cemetery and memorial in surrey england or repatriated to united states and a stone tower was built on mull of oa by american red cross to commemorate men lost aboard otranto and which was sunk by a german u boat nearby scott pp 121 22 139 40 142 149 remains of wreck were later salvaged by keith jessop scott pp 155 57 lieutenant craven was awarded distinguished
