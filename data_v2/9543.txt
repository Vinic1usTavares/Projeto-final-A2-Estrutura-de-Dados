a vitamin is an organic molecule or related set of molecules that is an essential micronutrient that an organism needs in small quantities for proper functioning of its metabolism essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in organism either at all or not in sufficient quantities and therefore must be obtained through diet vitamin c can be synthesized by some species but not by others it is not a vitamin in first instance but is in second term vitamin does not include three other groups of essential nutrients minerals essential fatty acids and essential amino acids most vitamins are not single molecules but groups of related molecules called vitamers for example vitamin e consists of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols thirteen vitamins required by human metabolism are vitamin a as all trans retinol all trans esters as well as all trans beta carotene and other provitamin a carotenoids vitamin b1 thiamine vitamin b2 riboflavin vitamin b3 niacin vitamin b5 pantothenic acid vitamin b6 pyridoxine vitamin b7 biotin vitamin b9 folic acid or folate vitamin b12 cobalamins vitamin c ascorbic acid vitamin d vitamin e tocopherols and tocotrienols and vitamin k quinones vitamins have diverse biochemical functions vitamin a acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation vitamin d provides a hormone like function regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs b complex vitamins function as enzyme coenzymes or precursors for them vitamins c and e function as antioxidants both deficient and excess intake of a vitamin can potentially cause clinically significant illness although excess intake of water soluble vitamins is less likely to do so before 1935 only source of vitamins was from food if intake of vitamins was lacking result was vitamin deficiency and consequent deficiency diseases then commercially produced tablets of yeast extract vitamin b complex and semi synthetic vitamin c became available this was followed in 1950s by mass production and marketing of vitamin supplements including to prevent vitamin deficiencies in general population governments mandated addition of vitamins to staple foods such as flour or milk referred to as food fortification to prevent deficiencies recommendations for folic acid supplementation during pregnancy reduced risk of infant neural tube defects although reducing incidence of vitamin deficiencies clearly has benefits supplementation is thought to be of little value for healthy people who are consuming a vitamin adequate diet term vitamin is derived from word vitamine coined in

from diet but some are acquired by other means for example microorganisms in gut flora produce vitamin k and biotin and one form of vitamin d is synthesized in skin cells when they are exposed to a certain wavelength of ultraviolet light present in sunlight humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume for example vitamin a is synthesized from beta carotene and niacin is synthesized from amino acid tryptophan food fortification initiative lists countries which have mandatory fortification programs for vitamins folic acid niacin vitamin a and vitamins b1 b2 and b12 deficient intake body s stores for different vitamins vary widely vitamins a d and b12 are stored in significant amounts mainly in liver and an adult s diet may be deficient in vitamins a and d for many months and b12 in some cases for years before developing a deficiency condition however vitamin b3 niacin and niacinamide is not stored in significant amounts so stores may last only a couple of weeks for vitamin c first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin c deprivation in humans have varied widely from a month to more than six months depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores deficiencies of vitamins are classified as either primary or secondary a primary deficiency occurs when an organism does not get enough of vitamin in its food a secondary deficiency may be due to an underlying disorder that prevents or limits absorption or use of vitamin due to a lifestyle factor such as smoking excessive alcohol consumption or use of medications that interfere with absorption or use of vitamin people who eat a varied diet are unlikely to develop a severe primary vitamin deficiency but may be consuming less than recommended amounts a national food and supplement survey conducted in us over 2003 2006 reported that over 90 of individuals who did not consume vitamin supplements were found to have inadequate levels of some of essential vitamins notably vitamins d and e well researched human vitamin deficiencies involve thiamine beriberi niacin pellagra vitamin c scurvy folate neural tube defects and vitamin d rickets in much of developed world these deficiencies are rare due to an adequate supply of food and addition of vitamins to common foods in addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders excess intake some vitamins have documented acute or chronic toxicity at larger intakes which is referred to as european union and governments of several countries have established tolerable upper intake levels uls for those vitamins which have documented toxicity see table likelihood of consuming too much of

help with night blindness an illness now known to be caused by a vitamin a deficiency advancement of ocean voyages during renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships crews in 1747 scottish surgeon james lind discovered that citrus foods helped prevent scurvy a particularly deadly disease in which collagen is not properly formed causing poor wound healing bleeding of gums severe pain and death jack 1997 past present and future of vitamins in 1753 lind published his treatise on scurvy which recommended using lemons and limes to avoid scurvy which was adopted by british royal navy this led to nickname limey for british sailors lind s discovery however was not widely accepted by individuals in royal navy s arctic expeditions in 19th century where it was widely believed that scurvy could be prevented by practicing good hygiene regular exercise and maintaining morale of crew while on board rather than by a diet of fresh food as a result arctic expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy and other deficiency diseases in early 20th century when robert falcon scott made his two expeditions to antarctic prevailing medical theory at time was that scurvy was caused by tainted canned food during late 18th and early 19th centuries use of deprivation studies allowed scientists to isolate and identify a number of vitamins lipid from fish oil was used to cure rickets in rats and fat soluble nutrient was called a thus first vitamin bioactivity ever isolated which cured rickets was initially called vitamin a however bioactivity of this compound is now called vitamin d in 1881 russian medical doctor studied effects of scurvy at university of tartu he fed mice an artificial mixture of all separate constituents of milk known at that time namely proteins fats carbohydrates and salts mice that received only individual constituents died while mice fed by milk itself developed normally he made a conclusion that a natural food such as milk must therefore contain besides these known principal ingredients small quantities of unknown substances essential to life however his conclusions were rejected by his advisor gustav von bunge a similar result by cornelius appeared in a dutch medical journal in 1905 but it was not widely reported in east asia where polished white rice was common staple food of middle class beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin b1 was endemic in 1884 takaki a british trained medical doctor of imperial japanese navy observed that beriberi was endemic among low ranking crew who often ate nothing but rice but not among officers who consumed a western style diet with support of japanese navy he experimented using crews of two battleships one crew was fed only white rice while other was fed a diet of meat fish barley rice and beans group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with beriberi and 25 deaths while latter group had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths this convinced takaki and japanese navy that diet was cause of beriberi but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it that diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by christiaan eijkman who in 1897 discovered that feeding unpolished rice instead of polished variety to chickens helped to prevent a kind of polyneuritis that was equivalent of beriberi following year frederick hopkins postulated that some foods contained accessory factors in addition to proteins carbohydrates fats etc that are necessary for functions of human body hopkins and eijkman were awarded nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1929 for their discoveries thumb jack drummond s single paragraph article in 1920 which provided structure and nomenclature used today for vitamins in 1910 first vitamin complex was isolated by japanese scientist suzuki who succeeded in extracting a water soluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it acid later he published this discovery in a japanese scientific journal when article was translated into german translation failed to state that it was a newly discovered nutrient a claim made in original japanese article and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity in 1912 polish born biochemist casimir funk working in london isolated same complex of micronutrients and proposed complex be named vitamine it was later to be known as vitamin b3 niacin though he described it as anti beri beri factor which would today be called thiamine or vitamin b1 funk proposed hypothesis that other diseases such as rickets pellagra coeliac disease and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins max a friend and reader of biochemistry at bristol university reportedly suggested vitamine name from vital amine funk c and dubin h e 1922 vitamines baltimore williams and wilkins company name soon became synonymous with hopkins accessory factors and by time it was shown that not all vitamins are amines word was already ubiquitous in 1920 jack cecil drummond proposed that final e be dropped to deemphasize amine reference after researchers began to suspect that not all vitamines in particular vitamin a have an amine component in 1930 paul karrer elucidated correct structure for beta carotene main precursor of vitamin a and identified other carotenoids karrer and norman haworth confirmed albert szent gyorgyi s discovery of ascorbic acid and made significant contributions to chemistry of flavins which led to identification of for their investigations on carotenoids flavins and vitamins a and b2 they both received nobel prize in chemistry in 1937 in 1931 albert szent gyorgyi and a fellow researcher joseph svirbely suspected that hexuronic acid was actually vitamin c and gave a sample to charles glen king who proved its anti scorbutic activity in his long established guinea pig scorbutic assay in 1937 szent gyorgyi was awarded nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his discovery in 1943 edward adelbert and henrik dam were awarded nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discovery of vitamin k and its chemical structure in 1967 george wald was awarded nobel prize along with ragnar granit and hartline for his discovery that vitamin a could participate directly in a physiological process in 1938 richard kuhn was awarded nobel prize in chemistry for his work on carotenoids and vitamins specifically b2 and b6 history of promotional marketing once discovered vitamins were actively promoted in articles and advertisements in mccall s good housekeeping and other media outlets marketers enthusiastically promoted cod liver oil a source of vitamin d as bottled sunshine and bananas as a natural vitality food they promoted foods such as yeast cakes a source of b vitamins on basis of scientifically determined nutritional value rather than taste or appearance world war ii researchers focused on need to ensure adequate nutrition especially in processed foods robert w yoder is credited with first using term in 1942 to describe appeal of relying on nutritional supplements rather than on obtaining vitamins from a varied diet of foods continuing preoccupation with a healthy lifestyle has led to an obsessive consumption of additives beneficial effects of which are questionable etymology term vitamin was derived from vitamine a compound word coined in 1912 by polish biochemist casimir funk when working at lister institute of preventive medicine name is from vital and amine meaning amine of life because it was suggested in 1912 that organic micronutrient food factors that prevent beriberi and perhaps other similar dietary deficiency diseases might be chemical amines this was true of thiamine but after it was found that other such micronutrients were not amines word was shortened to vitamin in english see also vitamin deficiency hypervitaminosis
