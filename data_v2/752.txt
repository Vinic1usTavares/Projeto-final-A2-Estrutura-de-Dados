general sir duncan alexander cameron 20 may 1808 8 june 1888 was a british army officer who fought in crimean war and during part of new zealand wars he was later a governor of royal military college sandhurst born into a family with a military tradition he joined british army in 1825 commissioned into 42nd regiment of foot he had risen to rank of lieutenant colonel by 1854 and was a battalion commander he served in crimean war and fought in battle of alma afterwards he assumed command of highland brigade and led it through battle of balaclava and siege of sevastopol he finished war as a temporary major general and received several honours for his service he then held a series of educational and advisory posts with british army before becoming commander in chief scotland in 1860 following year cameron was appointed commander of british forces in new zealand which was dealing with ongoing new zealand wars at time colonial government was engaged in a conflict with maori in taranaki region however by time cameron arrived in taranaki a truce had been arranged two years later he suppressed a further outbreak of fighting in area and then led invasion of waikato to deal with king movement a maori resistance that threatened british sovereignty in country he commanded a series of mostly successful engagements with kingites followers of king movement but none were decisive by march 1864 he had advanced in waikato heartland and had pushed kingites into king country at gate pa in april 1864 his forces suffered a major defeat by this stage cameron was becoming disillusioned with conduct of war against his wishes in early 1865 he commanded a campaign against maori in southern taranaki coming under political pressure to wage a war he felt was inappropriate he tendered his resignation and left new zealand in august 1865 in 1868 cameron was made a lieutenant general and was appointed as governor of royal military college at sandhurst he remained in this post until 1875 at which time he retired from military service with rank of general and as a knight grand cross of order of bath he died in 1888 at age of 80 early life born on 20 may 1808 duncan cameron was a son of sir john cameron and lady cameron his mother was from guernsey and was niece of admiral james saumarez his father who retired with rank of lieutenant general was an officer in british army who was serving in peninsular war and was of scottish descent a younger brother john cameron went on to become a lieutenant general in british army serving in royal engineers duncan cameron most likely was educated at eton college as was his father before him military career cameron followed his father into british army joining 42nd regiment of foot in april 1825 he was promoted lieutenant following year to captain in 1833 to major in 1839 and lieutenant colonel in 1843 at which time he was commanding a battalion of regiment on malta on entry of united kingdom into crimean war in 1854 42nd regiment was transferred to turkey as part of highland brigade 1st division with cameron still a battalion commander he was soon promoted to colonel and commanded his battalion during battle of alma in september 1854 shortly afterwards he was appointed commander of highland brigade and led it through subsequent battle of balaclava and siege of sevastopol receiving a promotion to temporary major general in november 1855 he was recipient of several awards as a result of his service in crimea appointed a companion of order of bath he was also made an officer of legion of honour and received order of medjidie third class in 1858 after war in crimea cameron became involved in education of british army personnel he was appointed to council for army education in 1857 as its vice president and carried out reforms of both royal military college and staff college at sandhurst in 1859 he served on royal commission on defence of united kingdom whose recommendations prompted a huge programme of fortification for british naval dockyards same year his rank of major general was made substantive in 1860 he was appointed commander in chief scotland a position which saw him in command of all british forces in scotland by this stage of his career cameron was well regarded by his contemporaries new zealand in january 1861 cameron was appointed commander of british forces in new zealand which at time was engaged in first taranaki war war had broken out previous year over disputed land sales between local maori and settlers in taranaki region cameron s appointment was at behest of war office which was dissatisfied with performance of incumbent major general thomas pratt whose conduct of fighting in taranaki had been subject of much criticism receiving a temporary promotion to lieutenant general cameron arrived in new zealand in march 1861 and proceeded to town of new plymouth where he informed pratt that he was being replaced however although cameron was keen to deal with maori threat in taranaki governor of new zealand sir thomas gore browne had negotiated a truce to end war north island maori were now becoming increasingly reluctant to sell land and rise of king movement in waikato was considered to be a challenge to british sovereignty and colonial government kingites followers of king movement had even supported taranaki maori during war browne supported by cameron began preparing for an invasion of waikato cameron believed that 2 500 infantry would be sufficient with a further 1 000 men to secure lines of communication however in may 1861 browne s current term as governor ended and rather than extending it colonial office in london replaced him with sir george grey thumb cameron s house near drury auckland with staff tents to left grey put an immediate halt to planned invasion considering existing resources inadequate this was a major disappointment to cameron who was eager to exercise his command and he soon submitted his resignation it was declined and grey encouraged cameron to stay in his post with prospect of leading an invasion at a later date in meantime cameron directed main efforts of british forces in continued construction of what is now known as great south road from drury south of auckland to mangatawhiri stream a tributary of waikato river that defined northern kingite border this work had commenced during early stages of preparing for proposed invasion of waikato war in taranaki after cessation of hostilities in taranaki there was an ongoing dispute over a block of land at waitara but by april 1863 grey was preparing to return it to taranaki maori not knowing of grey s plans following month local maori ambushed british troops at nearby killing nine soldiers in retaliation on 4 june 1863 cameron led a force of 870 troops on a successful assault on a party of about 50 maori still occupying contested tataraimaka block beside river killing 24 this fresh outbreak of fighting in taranaki known as second taranaki war gave grey leverage with colonial office as he used it as justification for a request for an increase in number of british soldiers in country in meantime he proceeded with return of waitara to maori calming tensions in taranaki cameron and his forces quickly returned to auckland where despite his attack on tataraimaka block being a minor action it was portrayed as a major success grey now decided to proceed with an invasion of waikato to eliminate kingite threat invasion of waikato cameron as a result of his experience in crimea was conscious of importance of sound logistics to support a military campaign his preparations for invasion included organisation of a transport corps and a telegraph line steamers were purchased to form a flotilla that would allow cameron s forces to be supplied via waikato river on 10 july 1863 he established his headquarters at queen s redoubt near what is now invasion began on 12 july 1863 when british forces numbering 380 men crossed mangatawhiri stream and established a redoubt on opposite bank five days later cameron leading a party of 550 men attacked maori warriors entrenching at koheroa further south of mangatawhiri stream advancing british soldiers faltered in face of gunfire from maori and cameron had to personally rally and urge his men forward maori which british claimed numbered about 300 but in actual fact were around 150 men retreated and escaped leaving 15 dead hailed as a great victory british falsely claimed 150 maori had been killed in attack for loss of 12 british soldiers killed or wounded cameron was recommended for victoria cross for his role in attack although it was declined however on same day as assault carried out at koheroa a maori party attacked a british convoy moving along great south road killing several men and capturing a number of carts carrying supplies further raids and ambushes were carried out by kingites behind british lines for next several weeks and cameron concerned about threat posed to his supply lines decided it was not possible to continue his advance into waikato instead he had to divert much of his forces into establishment of a series of outposts along his lines of communication he did attempt an attack on a camp used by raiding parties but his approach was detected and he and his men had to withdraw it was not until late october that cameron could resume his advance his initial invasion army of around 4 000 men had more than doubled with reinforcements from overseas even though nearly 6 000 men were still occupied in defending his lines of communication cameron was able to mobilise an attack force of nearly 2 000 against his next objective meremere he had also received barges and armoured gunboats hms avon and pioneer and this facilitated movement of his force along waikato river at meremere kingites occupied a pa surrounded on three sides by swamp while fourth side overlooked waikato river and thus it was a barricade to further advance south using his river flotilla on 31 october 1863 cameron landed 600 troops to rear of meremere with orders to entrench themselves flotilla returned to cameron s advanced base camp for a further 600 men to reinforce those already entrenching he intended to land to front of meremere with remainder of his force however kingites numbering between 1 100 to 1 500 maori detected arrival of british and simply abandoned pa at meremere next day and slipped away through swamp british were able to simply walk in and seize pa officially capture of meremere was a success but in actual fact cameron saw it as a poor reward for enforced delay it had caused his advance into waikato thumb a depiction of battle of rangiriri 20 november 1863 a pen sketch by charles heaphy kingites had established a pa at rangiriri overlooking waikato river and upstream from meremere defensive position included not only pa forming central redoubt but also trenches and ramparts extending to river and to nearby lake waikare about 500 maori were present at rangiriri although this was insufficient for a proper defence however pa was well engineered a fact conceded by cameron after resulting battle of rangiriri on afternoon of 20 november cameron attacked front of maori position with a force of 900 men on 20 november while 320 men of 40th regiment of foot supplemented by 200 british navy personnel landed to rear to prevent any retreat attack was preceded with an artillery bombardment from cannon of gunboats and three 6 pound armstrong guns and while defences on riverside of central pa was captured central redoubt and ramparts to east extending to lake waikare were still held by maori cameron ordered further assaults later in day but these were all beaten off and british had to dig in for evening during night king leader of king movement wiremu and mortally wounded chief te along with 200 warriors were able to escape to east at dawn next day remainder of garrison surrendered to become prisoners it was later claimed that white flag hoisted to mark surrender of garrison was in fact intended to simply open negotiations but british soldiers moved into pa and demanded weapons of maori although a victory for cameron who was later made a knight of order of bath for his success his forces had incurred losses of 130 men killed or wounded while maori suffered around 35 killed with 180 others made prisoner some colonists saw this as a poor reward for rangiriri cameron now led his force further into waikato heartland seizing small town at confluence of waikato and waipa rivers that was capital of king on 8 december and raising british flag there taking of town was unchallenged it had been abandoned while tentative terms for an end to war were offered to and subsequently rejected by grey cameron proceeded down waipa river aiming for valuable farming land around te awamutu by late january 1864 he sighted maori fortifications at paterangi these included four pa realising that these would be difficult to seize without significant risk to his force he decided to bypass fortifications and draw out its garrison into more favourable terrain for british he mounted a nighttime march with 1 200 soldiers on 20 february getting past paterangi defences undetected and moving into a largely unoccupied te awamutu at 7 00 am next day beyond town away was settlement of rangiaowhia cameron opted to advance against this settlement as well it was lightly defended with many women and children present and 24 maori were killed or wounded and another 33 taken prisoner however commander of colonial defence forces colonel marmaduke nixon was shot and later died of his wounds british then withdrew to te awamutu on 22 february maori garrison at paterangi moved out with at least 700 heading for rangiaowhia reaching an old pa site at on road to rangiaowhia maori began entrenching themselves here supported with two 6 pound armstrong guns cameron decided to attack before they could complete their defences his attack was a success with at least 30 possibly even up to 70 or 80 killed out of around 400 for loss of just two british soldiers paterangi was occupied by british to deny it to maori cameron was later criticised for rangiaowhia attack it was not a fighting pa and kingites considered action contrary to established conduct of warfare there were also accusations that one or more whare to which some had fled during rangiaowhia attack had been set on fire with them inside and that one man attempting to surrender was shot following day cameron led his troops in sacking of nearby village of kihikihi home of maniapoto a prominent maori chief in king movement like rangiaowhia kihikihi was productive farmland for kingites and its loss to maori was significant in early march cameron went to auckland to consult with grey and government for next steps in campaign and it was decided to continue with strategy of depriving kingites of supplies to this end cameron moved most of his army towards maungatautari leaving a garrison for redoubts being built at kihikihi rangiaowhia and te awamutu where a strike force of 900 men under colonel robert carey was also based in meantime maniapoto started construction of a pa at orakau which was from kihikihi pa with its garrison of around 300 maori including around 250 warriors had yet to be completed when british forces attacked on 31 march having detected its presence previous day initial assaults mounted by carey s strike force were repelled but were able to surround pa this prevented maori reinforcements newly arrived from maungatautari from entering pa carey realising an opportunity to inflict a serious blow to kingites was possible requested reinforcements from cameron who dispatched 370 soldiers to orakau now under bombardment while a sap was dug by engineers in order to breach pa defences cameron arrived at battle site in morning of 2 april with more reinforcements carey was preparing for a further frontal assault but cameron put a halt to this and issued terms to defenders of pa this was declined despite an invitation from cameron impressed with resiliency of defenders to send out 50 odd women and children present by now defenders lacked food water and ammunition and that afternoon proceeded with a breakout from southeast corner of pa british lines at this point were thinly held by 40th regiment and majority of maori were able to escape into surrounding swamp they were hotly pursued by british soldiers as well as local militia and numerous maori were killed wounded or taken prisoner in total around 80 to 150 maori were killed at orakau for loss of only 16 british soldiers with a further 53 wounded however while most media of time reported battle of orakau as a victory for british as did kingites cameron saw it as a missed opportunity to inflict a decisive victory in waikato cameron now returned to maungatautari where maori had established a defence line of several pa he moved his forces up to face te tiki o te pa it was strongly built and defended cameron understood this and chose to simply wait out defenders rather than engage in a frontal attack having exhausted their supplies it was abandoned by maori within a few days on 5 april cameron had intended to move to winter quarters following his move against maungatautari due to expected difficulty in maintaining supply lines over winter months accordingly he withdrew his main force back to auckland leaving garrisons in place to secure key gains of campaign kingites were now south of river which became a boundary between what became known as king country and territory captured by british it would transpire that there would be no further fighting in waikato tauranga campaign a local tribe ngai te rangi had begun construction of gate pa close to camp te papa set up by british at tauranga camp was established earlier in year as a means of preventing reinforcements travelling from east cape to join up with waikato maori and had already been subject to raids by tribe camp commandant requested reinforcements so that an attack could be mounted cameron now back in auckland with bulk of his army realised that with te papa being close to a harbour he was readily able to transport enough manpower and artillery to allow a sufficient concentration for a decisive battle seizing his opportunity he arrived at te papa on 21 april 1864 and his attack force followed a few days later thumb left cameron with a group of soldiers of colonial defence force on morning of 29 april 1864 prior to attack on gate pa cameron is standing at right leaning against centre of wheel of gun carriage on 27 april cameron mounted a reconnaissance of gate pa and determined that it was formed of two redoubts garrisoned by about 235 warriors he moved up his attacking force of about 1 700 men plus a large artillery train which started bombarding walls of maori position and pa was surrounded by afternoon of 29 april with a major breach in walls he had already sent 730 men of 68th regiment of foot behind pa to cut off any retreat he then ordered 300 men of 43rd regiment of foot and marines of royal navy to exploit breach but attempt to do so was beaten back with attacking soldiers engaged in a full scale retreat on seeing attacking force fleeing battle cameron attempted to rally them but was unable to do so and retreated to his tent to brood thumb right a depiction of british attack at gate pa 29 april 1864 although pa was abandoned overnight garrison was able to slip away practically unmolested with losses of over 100 killed and wounded battle of gate pa was a major defeat for cameron already criticised for his overly cautious approach to campaign in waikato cameron s conduct of battle came under question he struggled to explain poor performance of troops making attack but noted losses among officers may have affected rank and file in actual fact attackers had been deceived by a lack of defensive fire from pa and once drawn in were set upon by well concealed warriors cameron met with grey on 12 may and shortly afterwards decided to cease offensive engagements in tauranga he returned to auckland with bulk of his forces citing unfavourable weather as an excuse he left local commander lieutenant colonel h greer with instructions to maintain a defensive posture while grey stunned at outcome of battle negotiated terms with ngai te rangi for an end to hostilities in area within a few weeks greer while conducting defensive patrols in accordance with cameron s directives inflicted a defeat on a large force of maori attempting to establish defensive positions at te ranga from te papa majority of ngai te rangi tribe surrendered shortly afterwards on relatively favourable terms thus ending fighting in tauranga this prompted colonial government to urge cameron to resume his offensive operations but he declined to do so disillusioned about prospects of a successful outcome to a military campaign although british did not destroy king movement defeats at te ranga and orakau effectively ended fighting in waikato and tribes there would eventually cede their land to colonial government return to taranaki as tauranga campaign wound down fighting flared up again in taranaki and in wanganui both grey and colonial government considering this a further attempt at maori independence wanted to suppress this latest outbreak at this time british were beginning process of withdrawing from new zealand transferring responsibility for country s internal security to its own military this added impetus to colonial government s need to take action in taranaki while british soldiers were still available with reservations cameron agreed to mount a campaign in wanganui however he saw this conflict as unnecessary and nothing more than a desire by colonial government for more maori land and believed that british soldiers should not be used to achieve this furthermore he considered that he would need at least two years to achieve success and reinforcements for his existing army would be required he commenced campaign on 24 january 1865 moving with 1 200 soldiers from wanganui northward across southern taranaki to here his force resisted attacks from a large force of over 400 maori warriors after two days having killed 14 soldiers for loss of 23 warriors maori withdrew they moved to a robust pa at weraroa expecting cameron to come after them despite urging from grey to do so he refused fully aware of futility of frontal attacks on pa instead he moved further north leaving a garrison and a series of redoubts facing weraroa pa on 13 march he encountered a force of 200 warriors from ngati tribe and soundly beat them on open ground at te ngaio at end of march he reached river and halted his advance there from wanganui by now relations between cameron and grey had broken down over former s refusal to attack weraroa pa there were already tensions between two as a result of cameron s reports to war office often being at odds with grey s own sometimes deliberately misleading communications to london cameron s campaign was heavily criticised by colonists as being slow but this opinion lacked awareness of need to ensure security of his lines of communication along his advance even maori were contemptuous apparently giving him nickname lame seagull for pace of his advance cameron having already resigned his command on 7 february 1865 left for auckland in april and departed country on 1 august 1865 later life thumb right cameron s funerary monument at brompton cemetery london after his return to england cameron continued to hold his honorary position as regimental colonel of his old unit 42nd regiment of foot to which he had been appointed in 1863 only relinquishing it in 1881 when regiment merged with 73rd regiment of foot to form black watch he then became regimental colonel of 1st battalion of black watch up until his death in 1868 his temporary rank of lieutenant general was made substantive and he was appointed commissioner to enquire into present state of military education in this country same year he was appointed as governor of royal military college at sandhurst on 10 september 1873 he married louisa flora fourth daughter of andrew maclean deputy inspector general of royal military college as governor at sandhurst cameron attempted various reforms until 1875 at which time he retired from british army two years previously he had been promoted to full general and was appointed a knight grand cross of order of bath in his later years he had to deal with published criticism of his conduct of campaigns in new zealand however these would typically downplay fighting qualities and tactics of kingites he was also involved in defending himself from a particularly aggrieved dispute with a relative of an officer killed at battle of rangiriri in his final years his health deteriorated and he died at in kent on 7 june 1888 survived only by his wife as couple had no children he was buried at brompton cemetery in london chapel of royal military academy includes a memorial to cameron which reads in memory of general sir duncan cameron g c b colonel of black watch died 8 june 1888 aged 80
