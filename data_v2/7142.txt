state route 9 sr 9 is a long state highway traversing three counties snohomish skagit and whatcom in u s state of washington highway extends north from an interchange with in vicinity of woodinville north through snohomish lake stevens arlington sedro woolley and nooksack to become bc 11 at canada us border in sumas three other roadways are briefly concurrent with route in arlington in sedro woolley and near deming a spur route in sumas serves trucks traveling into british columbia before sr 9 was created several other roads used route of current highway first was a roadway extending from current southern terminus to snohomish established by 1895 and another road between arlington and sedro woolley by 1911 current sr 542 concurrency was first established in 1925 when a branch of from bellingham to mount baker was added to state highway system these roads were combined and several other roads were added to create secondary state highway 1a ssh 1a which originally ran from woodinville to blaine in 1937 a branch of ssh 1a connected mainline to canada us border in sumas but was later included into ssh 1a when blaine to sumas segment was deleted in 1953 a highway renumbering in 1964 introduced sign routes that would be co signed with existing system until 1970 one of which would replace ssh 1a sr 9 ssh 1a sr 9 extended south to woodinville until 1965 when it was shortened to later sr 522 which wasn t complete yet sr 9 was not complete between lake stevens and arlington until after 1966 between 2004 and 2009 nine complete construction projects arranged by washington state department of transportation wsdot have improved roadway projects ranged from expanding current weigh station at soper hill road intersection in 2005 to realigning highway between nooksack and sumas in 2006 to eliminate 90 degree turns wsdot is also widening sr 9 in snohomish county from 2 lanes to a four lane divided highway between 2009 and 2013 wsdot plans to complete six other projects in snohomish county to improve corridor from sr 522 to bryant some projects include adding a roundabout at realignments south of snohomish and addition of web cameras route description

fredonia during 1964 highway renumbering a new system of highways sign routes was introduced and was co signed with existing primary and secondary state highways ssh 1a became sr 9 but ssh 1a was still signed until 1970 in 1965 ssh 1a sr 9 was shortened from woodinville to in grace which was not complete yet by 1966 highway was not complete between lake stevens and arlington and in 1970 sr 202 became since 2004 washington state department of transportation wsdot has completed nine construction projects on sr 9 lake stevens weigh station located on west side of highway at hill road

repaved between snohomish and lake stevens and also guardrails and turn lanes were added in 2006 on november 22 2006 wsdot opened a new alignment of sr 9 between nooksack to sumas that bypassed three 90 degree turns a roundabout was added to intersection east of mount vernon in summer 2007 between sr 522 and highway was widened from a 2 lane road to a four lane divided highway in 2008 a curve on roadway north of arlington was straightened in late 2008 and turn lanes were added to two intersections near bryant future developments between 1980 and 2000 population of snohomish county grew by 80 percent resulting in increased congestion on two lane sr 9 accidents have increased from an average of 325 collisions per year in 1990s to 450 collisions per year between 2000 and 2007 since late 2005 wsdot has been improving corridor with six projects located between and skagit county line that are scheduled to be completed by 2013 south of snohomish wsdot is improving highway in multiple ways including new intersections and alignments new web cameras and new turn lanes between and clearview 2 lane road is being widened to a four lane divided highway starting in 2011 intersection south of arlington was scheduled to be rebuilt as a roundabout in 2011 roundabout option was chosen over a traffic signal in early october 2009 a route development plan is currently being designed for highway between sr 522 and road north of arlington during a project to widen sr 9 in lake stevens a left turn lane to lake stevens road was removed and residents located on road have protested intersection of sr 9 and sr 204 in lake stevens is planned to be replaced with a series of roundabouts to be complete by 2023 major intersections spur intersections references external links highways of washington
