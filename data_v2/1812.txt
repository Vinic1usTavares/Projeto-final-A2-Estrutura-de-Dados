for good steinman later reused melody with new lyrics by michael kunze for die unstillbare gier a song in tanz der vampire productions and for confession of a vampire in ill fated us version dance of vampires music and lyrics objects in rear view mirror may appear closer than they are is a three part narrative centred upon seasons summer winter and spring according to allmusic it draws its inspiration from singer s often tragic childhood lyrics portray a man who has overcome tragedies in his life yet still feels haunted by their memory bbc co uk also says that song about a melancholy middle aged man reminiscing about his youth is in many ways uncomfortably close to home dealing as it does with episodes uncannily similar to events in his own life steinman says that it was hardest song to write and get across it s a very passionate song it s really i think maybe most passionate one on record i mean i m really proud of it because that s really one that goes over top in sense that it s got images it has religious imagery of resurrection it s got images of fertility and rebirth it has really very good sexual images images of cars which i always like allmusic says music takes concept of a power ballad to epic heights verses build from somber softness to piercing heights of drama before giving way to a chorus that releases tension with a meditative melodic figure that underlines hypnotically repeated title in a soothing fashion first verse is set in summer when skies were pure and fields were green vocalist describes his close friendship with his best friend who dies prematurely in a crash lyrics do not make clear what kind of crash although music video uses a flying accident although kenny has died vocalist reveals how his memory lives on each verse concludes by declaring that preceding events were long ago and far away recalling use of same line in first bat out of hell s famous paradise by dashboard light he compares his life to a highway and his soul to a car this leads on to a repetition of title second verse is darker in tone season is winter when dreams would freeze and sun has descended lyrics document a physically abusive dangerous and drunk father reflecting meat loaf s real life youth like first verse memories of past still affect present again title is repeated several times softly at first building into a more dramatic intensity allmusic says it starts with gentle piano and synthesizer licks that are built up with power chords to enhance their drama and weaving stirring choir styled backing vocals into chorus that keep its repetition fresh by giving it new layers an instrumental piano and guitar section bridges second and third verses choir styled wordless background vocals were arranged by todd rundgren guitar is gradually given more emphasis in mix as band plays melody of verse concluding with instrumental of opening line of verse third verse describes a beauty living on edge of town and a seemingly intense sexual relationship however their relationship ends conforming to structure of song and its title her memory is still present after title line is repeated twelve times with growing volume and intensity vocalist quietly repeats first four lines of above music video michael bay directed music video for propaganda films he had previously directed videos for album s prior two singles i d do anything for love but i won t do that and rock and roll dreams come through allen daviau served as cinematographer music video has overlapping features so that it looks like that actors are ghost like

patrick letting them sit in his airplane a little older kenny takes plane for a ride his father runs outside just in time to see kenny lose control of aircraft crash and killed they said he crashed and burned firefighters extinguish fire from wreckage and an ambulance takes away body thumb meat loaf and will estes in music video showing some of style of cinematography in second section of song protagonist will estes sees ghost of plane fly over graveyard at kenny s funeral with lyrics relating to winter freeze no leaves on trees in this verse some of mise en scene is minimal it shows his father as a family man during day but an abusive alcoholic all time line he hit me again and again and again is accompanied by a baseball scene rather than visually depicting violence of hit that autobiographical elements suggest he runs away trying to regain his freedom i had to run away alone my life became my own he then meets an older woman who teaches him everything about mystery and muscle of love a risque sequence of them engaging in sexual activity in back of a car matches lyrics she used her body just like a bandage she used my body just like a wound at end of video whenever
