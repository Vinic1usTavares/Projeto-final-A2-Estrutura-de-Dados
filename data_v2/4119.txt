wilhelm later william steinitz may 17 1836 august 12 1900 was an austrian and later american chess master and first undisputed world chess champion from 1886 to 1894 he was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician when discussing chess history from 1850s onwards commentators have debated whether steinitz could be effectively considered champion from an earlier time perhaps as early as 1866 steinitz lost his title to emanuel lasker in 1894 and lost a rematch in 1896 97 statistical rating systems give steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions mainly because he took several long breaks from competitive play however an analysis based on one of these rating systems shows that he was one of most dominant players in history of game steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years from 1862 to 1894 although steinitz became world number one by winning in all out attacking style that was common in 1860s he unveiled in 1873 a new style of play and demonstrated that it was superior to previous style his new style was controversial and some even branded it as cowardly but many of steinitz s games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of old school steinitz was also a prolific writer on chess and defended his new ideas vigorously debate was so bitter and sometimes abusive that it became known as ink war steinitz was target of anti semitic abuse and moved to united states in 1883 to escape this by early 1890s steinitz s approach was widely accepted and next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him most notably his successor as world champion emanuel lasker as a result of ink war traditional accounts of steinitz s character depict him as ill tempered and aggressive but more recent research shows that he had long and friendly relationships with some players and chess organizations most notably from 1888 to 1889 he co operated with american chess congress in a project to define rules governing conduct of future world championships steinitz was unskilled at managing money and lived in poverty all his life early life steinitz was born on may 17 1836 in jewish ghetto of prague now capital of czech republic then in bohemia a part of austrian empire youngest of a tailor s thirteen sons to survive he learned to play chess at age 12 he began playing serious chess in his twenties after leaving prague in 1857 to study mathematics in vienna at vienna polytechnic steinitz spent two years at university world chess championship by i a horowitz macmillan new york 1973 p 19 library of congress card catalog number 72 80175 chess career through 1881 steinitz improved rapidly in chess during late 1850s progressing from third place in 1859 vienna city championship to first in 1861 with a score of 30 31 during this period he was nicknamed austrian morphy this achievement meant that he had become strongest player in austria horowitz p 20 international debut thumb left upright 0 90 steinitz in 1866 steinitz was then sent to represent austria in london 1862 chess tournament he placed sixth but his win over augustus mongredien was awarded tournament s brilliancy prize he immediately challenged fifth placed contestant strong veteran italian master serafino dubois to a match which steinitz won five wins one draw three losses this encouraged him to turn professional and he took up residence in london in 1862 63 steinitz scored a crushing win in a match with joseph henry blackburne who went on to be one of world s top ten for 20 years but who had only started playing chess two years earlier steinitz then beat some leading uk players in matches frederic deacon and augustus mongredien in 1863 and valentine green in 1864 this charge up rankings had a price in march 1863 steinitz apologized in a letter to ignac kolisch for not repaying a loan because while steinitz had been beating blackburne daniel harrwitz had taken over all of steinitz s clients at london chess club who had provided steinitz s main source of income match against anderssen thumb right 250px adolf anderssen was recognized as world s top player until 1866 when steinitz won a match against him these successes established steinitz as one of world s top players and he was able to arrange a match in 1866 in london against adolf anderssen who was regarded as world s strongest active player because he had won 1851 and 1862 london international tournaments and his one superior paul morphy had retired from competitive chess steinitz won with eight wins and six losses there were no draws but it was a hard fight after 12 games scores were level at 6 6 then steinitz won last two games world chess championship by i a horowitz 1973 macmillan new york pp 23 24 library of congress catalog card number 72 80175 as a result of this match victory steinitz was generally regarded as world s best player prize money for this match was ps100 to winner steinitz and ps20 for loser anderssen winner s prize was a large sum by standards of times equivalent to about ps57 500 in 2007 s money conversion based on average incomes which are most appropriate measure for a few weeks hard work if we use average prices for conversion result is about ps6 500 continued match play success steinitz won every serious match he played from 1862 until 1892 sometimes by wide margins in years following his victory over anderssen he beat henry bird in 1866 seven wins five losses five draws he comfortably beat johannes zukertort in 1872 seven wins four draws one loss zukertort had proved himself one of elite by beating anderssen by a large margin in 1871 gradually improves tournament results it took longer for steinitz to reach top in tournament play in next few years he took third place at paris 1867 behind ignatz kolisch and simon winawer and second place at dundee 1867 gustav neumann won and baden baden 1870 chess tournament behind anderssen but ahead of blackburne louis paulsen and other strong players his first victory in a strong tournament was london 1872 ahead of blackburne and zukertort and first tournament in which steinitz finished ahead of anderssen was vienna 1873 when anderssen was 55 years old changes style introduces positional school all of steinitz s successes up to 1872 were achieved in attack at all costs romantic style exemplified by anderssen but in vienna 1873 chess tournament steinitz unveiled a new positional style of play which was to become basis of modern chess he tied for first place with blackburne ahead of anderssen samuel rosenthal paulsen and henry bird and won play off against blackburne steinitz made a shaky start but won his last 14 games in main tournament including 2 0 results over paulsen anderssen and blackburne plus two play off games this was start of a 25 game winning streak in serious competition hiatus from competitive chess between 1873 and 1882 steinitz played no tournaments and only one match a 7 0 win against blackburne in 1876 his other games during this period were in simultaneous and blindfold exhibitions which contributed an important part of a professional chess player s income in those days for example in 1887 blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two simultaneous exhibitions and a blindfold exhibition hosted by teesside chess association this was equivalent to about ps4 800 at 2007 based on average incomes chess journalist instead steinitz concentrated on his work as a chess journalist notably for field which was britain s leading sports magazine from 1873 to 1882 steinitz was a regular chess columnist for field see for example he wrote commentaries on in collaboration with his opponent and on some of steinitz s commentaries aroused heated debates notably from zukertort and leopold hoffer in chess monthly which they founded in 1879 this ink war escalated sharply in 1881 when steinitz mercilessly criticized hoffer s annotations of games in 1881 berlin congress won by blackburne ahead of zukertort steinitz was eager to settle analytical debates by a second match against zukertort whose unwillingness to play provoked scornful comments from steinitz in mid 1882 james mason a consistently strong player challenged steinitz to a match and accused steinitz of cowardice when steinitz insisted issue with zukertort should be settled first steinitz responded by inviting mason to name a sufficiently high stake for a match at least ps150 per player equivalent to about ps73 000 in 2007 s average incomes for conversion but mason was unwilling to stake more than ps100 mason later agreed to play a match with zukertort for a stake of ps100 per player but soon postponed that match circumstances having arisen that make it highly inconvenient for me to proceed rivalry with zukertort thumb right upright 0 85 steinitz s rival and bitter enemy johannes zukertort lost matches to him in 1872 and 1886 second match made steinitz undisputed world champion steinitz s long lay off caused some commentators to suggest that zukertort who had scored some notable tournament victories should be regarded as world chess champion comeback success steinitz returned to serious competitive chess in vienna 1882 chess tournament which has been described as strongest chess tournament of all time at that point despite a shaky start he took equal first place with szymon winawer ahead of james mason zukertort george henry mackenzie blackburne berthold englisch paulsen and mikhail chigorin and drew play off match visits us steinitz visited us mainly philadelphia area from december 1882 to may 1883 he was given an enthusiastic reception steinitz played several exhibitions many casual games and a match for stakes of ps50 with a wealthy amateur he also won three more serious matches with two new world professionals alexander sellman steinitz won both and cuban champion celso golmayo zupide match with golmayo was abandoned when steinitz was leading eight wins one

zukertort who made a brilliant start faded at end but finished three points ahead steinitz finished 2 1 2 points ahead of third placed competitor blackburne mark weeks chess pages zukertort s victory again led some commentators to suggest that zukertort should be regarded as world chess champion while others said issue could only be resolved by a match between steinitz and zukertort settles in united states in 1883 shortly after london tournament steinitz decided to leave england and moved to new york where he lived for rest of his life this did not end ink war his enemies persuaded some of american press to publish anti steinitz articles and in 1885 steinitz founded international chess magazine which he edited until 1895 in his magazine he chronicled lengthy negotiations for a match with zukertort he also managed to find supporters in other sections of american press including turf field and farm and st louis globe democrat both of which reported steinitz s offer to forgo all fees expenses or share in stake and make match a benefit performance solely for mr zukertort s pecuniary profit world championship match eventually it was agreed that in 1886 steinitz and zukertort would play a match in new york st louis and new orleans and that victor would be player who first won 10 games at steinitz s insistence contract said it would be for championship of world after five games played in new york zukertort led by 4 1 but in end steinitz won decisively by 12 1 2 7 1 2 ten wins five draws five losses collapse by zukertort who won only one of last 15 games has been described as perhaps most thoroughgoing reversal of fortune in history of world championship play horowitz p 30 though not yet officially an american citizen steinitz wanted united states flag to be placed next to him during match he became a us citizen on november 23 1888 having resided for five years in new york and changed his first name from wilhelm to william in 1887 american chess congress started work on drawing up regulations for future conduct of world championship contests steinitz actively supported this endeavor as he thought he was becoming too old to remain world champion he wrote in his own magazine i know i am not fit to be champion and i am not likely to bear that title for ever defeats chigorin in 1888 havana chess club offered to sponsor a match between steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent steinitz nominated russian mikhail chigorin on condition that invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him there is some doubt about whether this was intended to be a match for world championship both steinitz s letters and publicity material just before match conspicuously avoided phrase proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games and steinitz had said that fixed length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because first player to take lead could then play for draws and steinitz was at same time supporting american chess congress s world championship project based on whatever status of match it was played in havana in january to february 1889 and won by steinitz ten wins one draw six losses new york 1889 tournament american chess congress s final proposal was that winner of a tournament to be held in new york in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for time being but must be prepared to face a challenge from second or third placed competitor within a month steinitz wrote that he would not play in tournament and would not challenge winner unless second and third placed competitors failed to do so tournament was duly played but outcome was not quite as planned mikhail chigorin and max weiss tied for first place their play off resulted in four draws and weiss then wanted to get back to his work for rothschild bank conceding title to chigorin however third prize winner isidor gunsberg was prepared to play for title match was played in new york in 1890 and ended in a 10 1 2 8 1 2 victory for steinitz american chess congress s experiment was not repeated and steinitz s last three matches were private arrangements between players wins rematch against chigorin in 1891 saint petersburg chess society and havana chess club offered to organize another steinitz chigorin match for world championship steinitz played against chigorin in havana in 1892 and won narrowly ten wins

lasker thumb right emanuel lasker right playing steinitz for world chess championship new york 1894 around this time steinitz publicly spoke of retiring but changed his mind when emanuel lasker 32 years younger and comparatively untested at top level challenged him lasker had been earlier that year refused a non title challenge by fellow german dr siegbert tarrasch who was at time world s most dominant tournament player world chess championship by i a horowitz new york macmillan 1973 p 41 initially lasker wanted to play for 5 000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of 3 000 a side but steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when lasker found it difficult to raise money and final figure was 2 000 each which was less than for some of steinitz s earlier matches final combined stake of 4 000 would be worth about 114 000 at 2016 incomes for adjustment factor as outcome depended on a few months hard work by players if prices are used for conversion result is about 114 000 see however lasker later published an analysis showing that winning player got 1 600 and losing player 600 out of 4 000 as backers who had bet on winner got rest although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on steinitz s part steinitz may have desperately needed money match was played in 1894 at venues in new york philadelphia and montreal quebec canada 32 year age difference between combatants was largest in history of world championship play and remains so today world chess championship by i a horowitz macmillan new york 1973 p 42 steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt so it came as a shock when lasker won first game steinitz responded by winning second and was able to maintain balance until sixth however lasker won all games from seventh to 11th and steinitz asked for a one week rest when match resumed steinitz looked in better shape and won 13th and 14th games lasker struck back in 15th and 16th and steinitz was unable to compensate for his losses in middle of match hence lasker won with ten wins five losses and four draws some commentators thought steinitz s habit of playing experimental moves in serious competition was a major factor in his downfall increased tournament activity after losing title steinitz played in tournaments more frequently than he had previously he won at new york 1894 and was fifth at hastings 1895 winning first brilliancy prize for his game with curt von bardeleben at saint petersburg 1895 a super strong four player multi round robin event with lasker chigorin and pillsbury he took second place behind lasker later his results began to decline 6th in nuremberg 1896 5th in cologne 1898 10th in london 1899 in early 1896 steinitz defeated russian emanuel schiffers in a match winning 6 games drawing 1

likewise reuben fine in however there is no evidence that he claimed title for himself in 1866 although in 1880s he claimed to have been champion since his win over anderssen see extracts from contemporary documents at 1882 quote from steinitz two years before morphy s death might be interpreted as claiming that he was champion from 1866 but 1888 extract is his first absolutely unambiguous claim to have been champion since 1866 it has been suggested that steinitz could not make such a claim while paul morphy was alive morphy had defeated anderssen by a far wider margin 8 3 in 1858 but retired from chess competition soon after he returned to us in 1859 and died in 1884 1886 steinitz vs zukertort match was first that was explicitly described as being for world championship steinitz insisted that contract should specify this see citation of chess monthly from january 1886 at but howard staunton and paul morphy had been unofficially described as world chess champion around middle

dedicated a pamphlet to memory of his first wife and their daughter also available in 2 parts at and in february 1897 new york times prematurely reported his death in a new york mental asylum key passage is also quoted at some authors claim that he contracted syphilis see last sentence which may have been a cause of mental breakdowns he suffered in his last years in months prior to his death he spent some time in institutions as a result of his failing mental health his chess activities had not yielded any great financial rewards and he died a pauper in manhattan state hospital wards island on august 12 1900 of a heart attack steinitz is buried in cemetery of evergreens in brooklyn new york his second wife and their two young children were still alive at his death assessment thumb right upright 1 0 plaque in honor of wilhelm steinitz in prague s josefov district book of hastings 1895 chess tournament written collectively by players described steinitz as follows mr steinitz stands high as a theoretician and as a writer he has a powerful pen and when he chooses can use expressive english he evidently strives to be fair to friends and foes alike but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect possessed of a fine intellect and extremely fond of game he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations people and business alike chess is his very life and soul one thing for which he lives influence on game steinitz s play up to and including 1872 was similar to that of his contemporaries sharp aggressive and full of sacrificial play this was style in which he became world number one by beating adolf anderssen in 1866 and confirmed his position by beating zukertort in 1872 and winning 1872 london international tournament zukertort had claimed rank of number two by beating anderssen in 1871 in 1873 however steinitz s play suddenly changed giving priority to what is now called positional elements in chess pawn structure space outposts for knights advantage of two bishops etc although steinitz often accepted unnecessarily difficult defensive positions in order to demonstrate superiority of his theories he also showed that his methods could provide a platform for crushing attacks several examples of steinitz testing his theories in top class play notable games section contains two examples of positional play leading to powerful attacks johannes zukertort vs wilhelm steinitz 9th game of their 1886 world championship match and 4th game of his 1892 match against mikhail chigorin steinitz s successor as world champion emanuel lasker summed up new style as in beginning of game ignore search for combinations abstain from violent moves aim for small advantages accumulate them and only after having attained these ends search for combination and then with all power of will and intellect because then combination must exist however deeply hidden although steinitz s play changed abruptly he said he had been thinking along such lines for some years some of games which i saw paulsen play during london congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to modification of my own opinions which has since developed and i began to recognize that chess genius is not confined to more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after original balance of power and position has been overthrown but that it also requires exercise of still more extraordinary powers though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at proper time in one s own favor during his nine year layoff from tournament play 1873 1882 and later in his career steinitz used his chess writings to present his theories while in uk he wrote for field in 1885 after moving to new york he founded international chess magazine of which he was chief editor and in 1889 he edited book of great new york 1889 tournament won by mikhail chigorin and max weiss in which he did not compete as tournament was designed to produce his successor as world champion many other writers found his new approach incomprehensible boring or even cowardly for example adolf anderssen said kolisch is a highwayman and points pistol at your breast steinitz is a pick pocket he steals a pawn and wins a game with it but when he contested first world championship match in 1886 against johannes zukertort it became evident that steinitz was playing on another level although zukertort was at least steinitz s equal in spectacular attacking play steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply by use of positional principles for example in 9th game of steinitz vs zukertort 1886 by time of his match in 1890 91 against gunsberg some commentators showed an understanding of and appreciation for steinitz s theories see individual game reports by 3 us journals linked to in shortly before 1894 match with emanuel lasker even new york times which had earlier published attacks on his play and character paid tribute to his playing record importance of his theories and his sportsmanship in agreeing to most difficult match of his career despite his previous intention of retiring note this article implies that final combined stake was us 4 500 but lasker s financial analysis says it was 4 000 by end of his career steinitz was more highly esteemed as a theoretician than as a player comments about him in book of hastings 1895 chess tournament focus on his theories and writings and emanuel lasker was more explicit he was a thinker worthy of a seat in halls of a university a player as world believed he was he was not his studious temperament made that impossible and thus he was conquered by a player also at as a result of his play and writings steinitz along with paul morphy is considered by many chess commentators to be founder of modern chess see e g siegbert tarrasch wrote he has learned of game only as much as a second class player rest he has done from his own means whole of modern conduct of game or at least by far greatest part of it is his work lasker who took championship from steinitz wrote i who vanquished him must see to it that his great achievement his theories should find justice and i must avenge wrongs he suffered vladimir kramnik emphasizes steinitz s importance as a pioneer in field of chess theory steinitz was first to realise that chess despite being a complicated game obeys some common principles but as often happens first time is just a try i can t say he was founder of a chess theory he was an experimenter and pointed out that chess obeys laws that should be considered writings steinitz was main chess correspondent of field in london from 1873 to 1882 and used this to present his ideas about chess strategy in 1885 he founded international chess magazine in new york and edited it until 1891 in addition to game commentaries and blow by blow accounts of negotiations leading to his 1886 match with johann zukertort and of american chess congress s world championship project he wrote a long series of articles about paul morphy who had died in 1884 reviewed at he wrote book of 1889 new york tournament in which he annotated all 432 of games and in 1889 he published a textbook modern chess instructor available as part of cd collection steinitz also allegedly wrote a pamphlet entitled capital labor and charity while confined at river crest sanitarium new york in new york during final months of his life playing strength and style statistical rating systems are unkind to steinitz warriors of mind gives him a ranking of 47th below several obscure soviet grandmasters see summary list at chessmetrics places him only 15th on its all time list chessmetrics penalizes players who play infrequently opportunities for competitive chess were infrequent in steinitz s best years and steinitz had a few long absences from competitive play 1873 1876 1876 1882 1883 1886 1886 1889 however in 2005 chessmetrics author jeff sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing strength of world number one players using data provided by chessmetrics and found that steinitz was further ahead of his contemporaries in 1870s than bobby fischer was in his peak period 1970 1972 that steinitz had third highest total number of years as world s top player behind emanuel lasker and garry kasparov and that steinitz placed 7th in a comparison of how long players were ranked in world s top three part iv gives links to all 3 earlier parts between his victory over anderssen 1866 and his loss to emanuel lasker 1894 steinitz won all his normal matches sometimes by wide margins and his worst tournament performance in that 28 year period was third place in paris 1867 he also lost two handicap matches and a match by telegraph in 1890 against mikhail chigorin where chigorin was allowed to choose openings in both games and won both review of a book edited by sid pickard initially steinitz played in all out attacking style of contemporaries like anderssen and then changed to positional style with which he dominated competitive chess in 1870s and 1880s max euwe wrote steinitz aimed at positions with clear cut features to which his theory was best applicable however he retained his capacity for brilliant attacks right to end of his career for example in 1895 hastings tournament when he was 59 he beat von bardeleben in a spectacular game in which in closing stages steinitz deliberately exposed all his pieces to attack simultaneously except his king of course his most significant weaknesses were his habits of playing experimental moves and getting into unnecessarily difficult defensive positions in top class competitive games personality right thumb steinitz traditional accounts of steinitz describe him as having a sharp tongue and violent temper perhaps partly because of his short stature barely five feet and congenital lameness he admitted that like duke of parma i always hold sword in one hand and olive branch in other and under severe provocation he could become abusive in published articles he was aware of his own tendencies and said early in his career nothing would induce me to take charge of a chess column because i should be so fair in dispensing blame as well as praise that i should be sure to give offence and make enemies when he embarked on chess journalism his brutally frank review of wormald s chess openings in 1875 proved him right on both counts and extracts at winter concludes his commentary with if instances can be identified of steinitz being wrong in his denunciation of wormald we should like to be informed his personal correspondence his own articles and some third party articles however show that he had long and friendly relationships with many people and groups in chess world including ignac kolisch one of his earliest sponsors mikhail chigorin harry nelson pillsbury bernhard horwitz amos burn and cuban and russian chess communities he even co operated with american chess congress in its project to regulate future contests for world title that he had earned steinitz strove to be objective in his writings about chess competitions and games for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by henry edward bird whom he considered no friend of his and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies for example he described zukertort s win over blackburne in london 1883 tournament where steinitz finished second behind zukertort as one of most brilliant games on record and blackburne s win over schwarz in berlin 1881 with words white s design especially from 21st move in combination with brilliant finish belongs to finest efforts of chess genius in modern match play zukertort s win is at blackburne s win is at he could poke fun at some of his own rhetoric for example i remarked that i would rather die in america than live in england i added that i would rather lose a match in america than win one in england but after having carefully considered subject in all its bearings i have come to conclusion that i neither mean to die yet nor to lose match at a joint simultaneous display in russia around time of 1895 96 saint petersburg tournament emanuel lasker and steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act although he had a strong sense of honour about repaying debts steinitz was poor at managing his finances he let a competitor poach many of his clients in 1862 63 offered to play 1886 world title match against johannes zukertort for free and died in poverty in 1900 leaving his widow to survive by running a small shop competitive record tournament results sources date location place score notes 1859 vienna championship 3rd behind carl hamppe
