shoots scaramanga several times killing him at last characters and themes central character of novel is james bond in man with golden gun he appears with a different personality from previous stories and is robot like according to author of continuation bond novels raymond benson benson also felt that bond s character had not been developed any further than in previous books academic jeremy black noted that when given two opportunities to kill scaramanga in cold blood he cannot bring himself to do it first time this happens bond sits in a car behind scaramanga method of killing would be to shoot him in back of head and this is compared to technique used by both kgb and nazis according to black bond has to rise above actions and act more suitably for a british fictional hero once mission is completed bond is offered kcmg but he refuses honour and reflects on his own name a quiet dull anonymous name which had been fleming s aim when he first named character benson also points out that touches of humour displayed by bond in previous novels disappeared and he appeared in book as cold and emotionless for first time in bond canon m s full name of admiral sir miles messervy kcmg was finally revealed despite being target of failed assassination attempt not only does m not press charges against bond he sends him out on further missions according to benson main adversary of novel francisco scaramanga is more a henchman than a major adversary and a second rate crook who happens to have gotten lucky with his shooting comentale watt and willman note that scaramanga had same character profile as herr von hammerstein former gestapo officer who is chief of counterintelligence for cuban secret service in for your eyes only there are two main themes in novel first involves scaramanga providing rastafarians with drugs in return for fires in sugar plantations a return of theme used in of drugs being used for political purposes to undermine west this was part of a wider conspiracy by scaramanga and his kgb connection hendricks to destabilise region by a campaign of industrial sabotage against companies based in jamaica including reynolds metal kaiser bauxite and jeremy black notes that independent inquiry at end of novel conducted in bond s hospital bedroom was undertaken by jamaican judiciary and cia and mi6 were recorded as acting under closest liaison and direction of jamaican cid bond and leiter are also awarded jamaican police medal for services to independent state of jamaica black observes that this was new world of a non colonial independent

bond novels including man with golden gun ian fleming wrote man with golden gun at his goldeneye estate in jamaica in january and february 1964 completing it by beginning of march his health affected him badly during writing process and he dropped from his usual rate of two thousand words a morning to a little over an hour s worth of work a day as with his previous novels fleming used events from his past as elements in his novel whilst at kitzbuhel in 1930s fleming s car a standard tourer had been struck by a train at a level crossing and he had been dragged fifty yards down track from that time on he had associated trains with death which led to their use as a plot device not just in man with golden gun but also in diamonds are forever and from russia with love as well as using events from his past fleming also used names of individuals he knew for some of his characters editor of london magazine alan ross had provided fleming with details about effects of electroshock therapy that bond went through and by way of thanks novel s sis station chief in jamaica commander ross was named after him similarly fleming used name of secretary of royal st george s golf club mark nicholson for cia representative at hotel tony hugill sugar planter mentioned in novel was named after a member of fleming s 30 au unit who managed tate lyle plantations in west indies after war and book s main villain francisco scaramanga was named after george scaramanga an etonian contemporary of fleming s pair are said to have fought at school effects of two eon productions bond films released prior to writing of novel dr no and from russia with love were reflected in novel through increased number of gadgets used one of these was poison gun used in scene of attempted assassination of m idea was taken from story of bohdan stashynsky who defected from eastern bloc to west in 1961 stashynsky was put on trial for murder of ukrainian nationalist leaders lev and stepan bandera and stated that he had used a poison spray gun to do it fleming returned to britain with a completed first draft of manuscript in march 1964 and wrote to copy editor of all his novels william plomer saying it needed a lot of re writing as time went on fleming became increasingly unhappy with book and thought about re working it in spring of 1965 but was persuaded against it by plomer who considered novel viable for publication five months after returning from jamaica on morning of 12 august 1964 fleming died of a heart attack his obituary in times noted that he had completed and was revising a new novel man with golden gun despite william plomer s original thought about state of manuscript editors jonathan cape were concerned enough about story to pass manuscript to kingsley amis to read on holiday paying him ps35 15 shillings for his thoughts and advice although amis subsequent suggestions were not used by cape cape had taken step because they thought novel was thin and feeble raymond benson has noted that thinness comes from a lack of rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in fleming s work but which are missing from man with golden gun benson suggests that these details were normally worked into second draft by fleming but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion man with golden gun was published posthumously eight months after its author s death release and reception man with golden gun was published in uk on 1 april 1965 by jonathan cape was 221 pages long and cost eighteen shillings cover artist richard chopping undertook cover design again and was paid 300 guineas for artwork man with golden gun was published in us in august 1965 was 183 pages long and cost 4 50 even before us edition was published man with golden gun was ninth place on best seller lists with 80 000 pre orders for hardback version reviews critics did not praise man with golden gun although much of criticism was muted fleming biographer henry chandler noted that novel received polite and rather sad reviews recognizing that book had effectively been left half finished and as such did not represent fleming at top of his game kingsley amis wrote in new statesman that book was a sadly empty tale empty of interests and effects that for better or worse ian fleming made his own meanwhile critic for times wrote that novel would doubtless be followed with close attention by keen eyed admirers of many bond maurice richardson writing in observer lamented that perhaps ian fleming was very tired when he wrote it perhaps he left it unrevised fact remains that this posthumous bond is a sadly sub standard job his praise for novel was muted admitting it isn t of course by any means totally unreadable but it s depressingly far from best bond writing in observers sister paper guardian christopher wordsworth noted that since goldfinger 007 has been toiling hopelessly in wake of zeitgeist prior to this novel wordsworth writes distance between live and let die ian fleming s second and best and you only live twice his last and worst is a long iron down sandwich fairway man with golden gun however sinks to level of a farrago william trevor writing in listener was dismissive of work thinking that bond continues to behave with so little originality that neither templar nor drummond marlowe nor nick charles would have paused to waste a pellet on him he continued saying that this present work is once again a fantasy for grown up children neither as clever nor exciting as early thrillers of edgar wallace or boys adventure stories of fifty years ago trevor did admit that for those who like to escape to bondsville old boom town hasn t changed a scrap critic for time was damning saying that it may have been just as well that fleming died when everybody still thought he could do no wrong meanwhile critic for newsweek said that james bond should have had a better exit sadly it ends not with a bang but a whimper world will be a vastly more lacklustre and complicated place with 007 gone associated press wrote that bond and fleming were fun they entertained sometimes mildly often grandly but always consistently life will be less interesting without them in his review for new york times charles poore wrote that man with golden gun was a gory glittering saga poore noted that gee starts early and never flags and that despite passing of fleming james bond spirit soars on critic for books and bookmen lamented fact that bond has gone out like a lamb even girls are below par while villain seems like a refuge from a seedy western but we ll miss our james d a n jones writing in new york review of books thought man with golden gun was an innocuous run of mill adventure story of 1911 vintage anthony lejeune writing in national review thought that it is undeniably slight but like everything fleming wrote intensely readable in a sense fleming s job was finished he had irrevocably transformed genre in which he worked lejeune went on to say that in highbrow novels sex and violence are treated gloomily in fleming s stories they are presented cheerfully with full enjoyment adaptations newspaper
