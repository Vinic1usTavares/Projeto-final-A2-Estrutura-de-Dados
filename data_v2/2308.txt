both are equally aware of other s intentions inglis suggests with specific reference to third verse message behind verses recurring lines i do i do and should someone be looking at me has invited conflicting interpretations leng suggests that in first of these lines harrison might be restating his marriage vow and that second line is an early example of singer viewing his life as a battle with
