thumb of minutes of lord gambier s court martial 1809 court martial of james lord gambier was a notorious british naval legal case during summer of 1809 in which admiral lord gambier requested a court martial to examine his behaviour during battle of basque roads in april of same year noted for acrimony and corruption of proceedings it has been described as one of ugliest episodes in internal history of royal navy mostert p 572 gambier was royal navy commander of channel fleet during later napoleonic wars primarily tasked with blockade of french atlantic fleet in brest in february 1809 french fleet tried to break out into atlantic and was chased into anchorage of basque roads near charente river on 11 april a major attack was launched on anchored fleet by fireships and over several days french fleet was driven ashore and battered by an inshore squadron commanded by maverick officer lord cochrane gambier stationed just offshore with main fleet refused to support cochrane and as a result although damaged most of french fleet eventually escaped to safety on his return to britain cochrane used his position as a radical member of parliament to attempt to block an effort to officially thank gambier for victory placing him in direct opposition to prime minister lord portland s administration and first lord of admiralty lord mulgrave mulgrave warned gambier of cochrane s position who responded by demanding a public examination of his conduct via a court martial convened at portsmouth on 26 july 1809 members of court were deliberately chosen by mulgrave to favour gambier and over next eight days a series of witnesses were called who largely discredited cochrane with misleading evidence when cochrane was called to give evidence he was subject to aggressive questioning lost his temper and was officially reprimanded at conclusion of court martial members of court unanimously found in gambier s favour and despite cochrane s best efforts parliament voted thanks to gambier gambier was restored to command and served in navy until his death in 1833 despite popular support cochrane s resistance had alienated much of naval and political establishment in britain and not long afterwards he was implicated in great stock exchange fraud of 1814 convicted and publicly humiliated he was dismissed from royal navy although he was later pardoned and reinstated in 1832 historians have subsequently sided with cochrane with even french emperor napoleon describing gambier as a fool background in february 1809 french atlantic fleet based at brest was ordered to sail to caribbean since outbreak of napoleonic wars in 1803 french navy had suffered a series of defeats and british were now threatening to invade caribbean island of martinique woodman p 263 fleet under contre amiral jean baptiste willaumez sailed on 22 february but was unable to escape british pursuit and four days later anchored in sheltered position of basque roads at mouth of charente river later retreating into more sheltered aix roads nearby under batteries of fortified ile d aix a fleet from british channel fleet commanded by admiral lord gambier had followed willaumez to harbour and there enacted a close blockade james p 98 gambier was an unpopular officer whose reputation rested on being first captain to break french line at glorious first of june in 1794 in hms defence cordingly p 179 since then he had spent most of his career as an administrator at admiralty earning title baron gambier for his command of fleet at bombardment of copenhagen in 1807 a strict methodist gambier was nicknamed dismal jimmy by his men adkins p 270 while gambier debated what action to take willaumez was censured for his failure to escape british fleet and was replaced by contre amiral zacharie allemand who strengthened fleet s defences and awaited a british attack clowes p 259 in britain first lord of admiralty lord mulgrave called on one of nation s most popular maverick young naval officers for a solution captain lord cochrane cochrane had operated off charente and knew area well but he was also a controversial choice for operation placing him in command would mean by passing a number of more senior officers inevitably causing offense while his status as a radical member of parliament for westminster made him an outspoken opponent of prime minister lord portland harvey p 110 cochrane initially refused offer but was later directly ordered to prepare and lead operation sailing to join gambier in his ship frigate hms imperieuse woodman p 267 cochrane arrived on 3 april his orders causing a storm of controversy among officers of fleet several of whom had been passed over by cochrane s appointment rear admiral eliab harvey was so furious that he directly accused gambier of incompetence and was sent back to britain to face a court martial for insubordination mostert p 569 gambier expressed his misgivings about attack but could not ignore a direct instruction from mulgrave and so allowed cochrane to proceed with operation adkins p 272 battle of basque roads thumb right and hopkins at sea or a slave out of time charles williams 1809 nmm a satirical print depicting gambier and cochrane during battle of basque roads gambier is shown reading bible ignoring cochrane s request to pursue french fleet cochrane fitted out 24 fireships and explosion vessels from fleet transports and on night of 11 april led them into roads accompanied by a squadron of small vessels and bomb vessel hms aetna fireships failed to ignite any of french warships but their presence caused panic among french crews who cut their anchor cables and drifted onto rocks and shoals of anchorage james p 111 when morning came cochrane found that almost entire french fleet was at his mercy and signalled to gambier suggesting that if he would lead british fleet into roads they could destroy entire french force cordingly p 194 gambier did not respond and eventually in frustration cochrane led his own small force directly into combat with french battle fleet unable to leave his subordinate unsupported gambier sent a small squadron of ships of line to reinforce cochrane and on 12 april three french ships of line and a large storeship were battered into surrender and then set on fire as damaged beyond repair cordingly p 200 gambier then ordered reinforcements to withdraw leaving cochrane again unsupported against rest of main french fleet which was gradually dragging itself off shoals and into relative safety of charente river despite a letter from gambier suggesting he withdraw cochrane renewed his attack on 13 april but was unable to cause any significant damage to french ships as they threw stores and guns overboard to facilitate their escape clowes p 267 on morning of 14 april gambier directly ordered cochrane to retire turning command of operation over to captain george wolfe cochrane reluctantly complied and on 15 april sailed back to britain with dispatches james p 121 wolfe renewed attacks on remaining stranded ships of french fleet over next week but with little effect frigate indienne stuck since 11 april was later burned by her own crew but one by one rest of ships escaped until on 29 april last ship of line regulus was withdrawn into river clowes p 268 battle concluded gambier sailed his fleet back to britain engagement was a victory for british with five french ships destroyed and several others badly damaged but there was much discontent in britain both among navy and public that a larger victory had been lost through over caution cochrane was himself a leading voice in this discontent and very shortly provoked anger of admiralty cochrane p 245 thanks thumb lord cochrane peter edward 1807 gac although gambier s dispatch issued after action stated that i cannot speak in sufficient terms of admiration and applause of vigorous and gallant attack made by lord cochrane harvey p 131 it also however contained many prevarications and inaccuracies for example he attributed command of initial attack to captain john woolridge who had commanded biggest fireship not to cochrane who had planned orchestrated and led assault in person he also claimed to have ordered an attack by whole fleet on beleaguered french force at daylight on morning of 12 april but was frustrated by adverse winds which was simply untrue he had sent in a small squadron several hours after cochrane s signal suggesting an attack by which time several of french ships had already escaped he concluded by praising both rear admiral robert stopford or captain sir harry neale neither of whom took part in fighting stating that handsome and earnest manner in which both these meritorious officers had volunteered their services and that had not their lordships fixed upon cochrane to conduct enterprize i have full confidence that result of their efforts would have been highly credible to them he later produced a second dispatch that under instruction from mulgrave failed to mention cochrane at all cochrane was already a popular and flamboyant figure in british public life with a long history of outspoken military and political activity he was lauded as hero of action and awarded membership of prestigious order of bath on 26 april almost immediately after his return cochrane p 244 but concern was already being expressed both within navy and in press about failure of fleet to secure a greater victory over a vulnerable and panicked french force an editorial in times attacked gambier for hesitation cordingly p 209 government seeking to capitalise on victory proposed a vote of thanks to lord gambier in houses of parliament harvey p 134 cochrane was incensed and visited lord mulgrave to warn him in no uncertain terms that if such thanks were proposed cochrane would in his position as member of parliament lead a faction to oppose it he made no direct reference to gambier s conduct but instead criticised notion of giving thanks for only a partial victory rendered incomplete by inaction of fleet he described vote as public misrepresentation cochrane p 245 mulgrave was furious replying that such a course will not only prove injurious to government but highly detrimental to yourself by raising up against you a host of enemies harvey p 134 cochrane was unmoved and refused to back down when mulgrave first threatened him with government s displeasure and then offered him a frigate squadron and infantry regiment of his own to conduct operations against french as he wished without oversight should he drop complaint mostert p 573 gambier demands a court martial thumb right lord gambier william beechey 1809 nmm mulgrave immediately notified gambier of cochrane s intentions and admiral aware that his competence and bravery were being called directly into question demanded a court martial to investigate his conduct cordingly p 210 gambier focused court martial on himself rather than his subordinate as that greatly restricted cochrane s ability to argue against him as a witness cochrane could only respond to questions from court at court s convenience while gambier as defendant was present throughout free to provide lengthy written statements in his own defence and to personally cross examine all witnesses harvey p 138 when cochrane was asked in advance of trial to provide written specifics of his accusations against gambier he refused on grounds that it would be insubordinate leaving court martial to set terms of charges these were that admiral lord gambier on 12th day of said month of april enemy s ships being then on shore and signal having been made that they could be destroyed did for a considerable time neglect or delay taking effectual measures for destroying them this narrow and specific charge was now focus of court james p 125 mulgrave and gambier then contrived to pack court with gambier s supporters court martial was scheduled for portsmouth thus ensuring that president was admiral sir roger curtis an old friend of gambier who had served with him at glorious first of june deputy was admiral sir william young who had a long history of antagonism with cochrane who had publicly accused admiral some years earlier of cheating him out of some prize money cordingly p 211 rest of panel comprised vice admirals sir john thomas duckworth an ally of gambier sir henry edwyn stanhope billy douglas and george campbell rear admiral john sutton whom cochrane had previously accused of incompetence harvey p 139 and captains john irwin robert hall edward stirling dickson and richard dalling dunn cochrane p 249 judge advocate who oversaw proceedings was moses greetham and prosecutor a mr bicknell gurney p 1 by stacking court with senior officers cochrane s opponents had ensured that those called to give evidence whose careers relied on recommendations from men like those in room would not be free to express their honest opinions without risking their future advancement cordingly p 213 they also ensured that witnesses were sympathetic to gambier captain frederick maitland of hms emerald who had fought alongside cochrane in basque roads and publicly supported his account of events was sent on an extended cruise off irish coast and consequently not called as a witness clowes p 269 while captain francis austen another supporter who had not been at basque roads was omitted from witness lists lists provided to court by gambier list cochrane separately from flag officers and post captains directly under gambier s command cochrane s name appears with list of junior and warrant officers summoned as witnesses gurney p vii it was also ensured that charts of action placed before court were prepared by senior warrant officers thomas stokes and edward fairfax of gambier s flagship hms caledonia fairfax had seen action in initial night attack but neither officer had spent significant time in aix roads or made their own soundings their plans were based on captured french charts harvey p 145 stokes even noted that it cannot be expected that from opportunities i had of sounding in this place i could accurately point out distance between sands cochrane was not permitted to see charts until 1850s and then only by special permission of duke of somerset these charts were revealed to greatly exaggerate navigational hazards and defences of basque roads including rendering channel as half its actual width and most particularly depicting a large and dangerous shoal blocking entrance to anchorage that did not exist cochrane ii p 13 court martial of lord gambier court martial was convened on 26 july 1809 aboard hms gladiator a hulk anchored in portsmouth harbour charge was read to lord gambier and each member of panel issued with a packet of documents comprising correspondence between gambier and secretary to admiralty w w pole and both of gambier s reports of battle a second packet of documents was also issued which included additional correspondence and a report on defences of basque roads from april 1807 by commodore richard goodwin keats explaining his decision not to attack a french squadron anchored there at that time james p 100 day one first witnesses were thomas stokes master of hms caledonia who had drafted maps presented to court and lieutenant richard of caledonia called to attest to flagship s log book gurney p 24 they were followed by john spurling master of hms imperieuse who was closely questioned on his ability to reliably document signals in midst of battle he acknowledged that he had been unable to retain a complete record court then called samuel raven master of hms caesar and john thompson master s mate of hms beagle to attest to accuracy of their logbooks gurney p 29 it was at this point that lord cochrane was called to stand cochrane was closely questioned for rest of day and much of following morning first exchanges focusing on whether it was appropriate for cochrane to make use of written recollections of day in his evidence and then progressing to geography of anchorage gurney p 34 cochrane insisted that entrance was wide and deep enough for at least six ships to pass safely but was denied permission to present his own charts to court gurney p 35 he repeatedly requested opportunity to read his prepared narrative of battle to court but was denied his ability to speak limited to answering court s questions gurney p 37 eventually curtis intervened supported by young to note that i never in all my experience knew document of a witness permitted to be received when he was present himself to be examined cochrane was then closely questioned on a series of signals he made at midday on 12 april in these signals he sent a series of warnings that french ships were beginning to refloat followed by signal at 13 45 ship is in distress and requires to be assisted immediately indicating that imperieuse was under fire he had in fact deliberately allowed imperieuse to drift within range of french ships in an effort to provoke a reaction from gambier harvey p 126 this discussion deteriorated into an extended argument about propriety of cochrane s use of notes with particular interventions from young and stanhope gurney p 41 at close of first day cochrane asserted that gambier s great mistake was not that he failed to attack on afternoon of 12 april but that he failed to attack in morning when french were most vulnerable proceedings were them held over until morning gurney p 43 day two cochrane was recalled on morning of 27 july and immediately accused gambier of failing to support his operation reiterating his signals sent on morning of battle half fleet could destroy enemy and frigates alone can destroy enemy cochrane accused gambier of unnecessary delay gurney p 45 he mentioned his assumption that gambier paused so that crews could eat lunch stating i could not in any other way account for a proceeding that thus enabled helpless french ships to endeavour their escape harvey p 142 under close questioning however cochrane lost his temper refusing to directly answer questions put to him and instead giving lengthy answers that reflected poorly on gambier s conduct eventually court was cleared for a 20 minute discussion following which cochrane was severely admonished by curtis to answer only those questions put to him gurney p 48 cochrane did not fully comply with these instructions and was further admonished for recounting conversations with other officers regarding gambier s conduct which court ruled inappropriate hearsay gurney p 50 cochrane then read out a letter sent to him by gambier on morning of 13 april when much of french fleet was still exposed which urged him to withdraw lest he tarnish victory by attempting impossibilities harvey p 128 in an attachment gambier permitted cochrane one further attack on french but wrote i do not think you will succeed and i am anxious that you should come to me as i wish to send you to england as soon as possible gurney p 52 as his evidence concluded cochrane became irate once more challenging court that i have felt that if i had answered yes or no to all questions which have been put to me i ought to be hung harvey p 143 there followed a series of exchanges regarding reliability of cochrane s charts threat from fort on ile d aix and nature of signals issued on night of 12 april before cochrane withdrew cordingly p 212 court then called rear admiral robert stopford who had led hms caesar into aix roads on night of 12 april stopford fully supported gambier s case and took full responsibility for withdrawing squadron sent to reinforce cochrane on 12 april during following morning citing dangers of anchorage on which his own ship had grounded in night gurney p 70 bicknell then announced that prosecution case was complete but curtis overruled him noting that panel had further questions court was then adjourned for evening day three at start of 28 july cochrane was briefly called again to answer questions about his charts and discrepancies between them and those supplied to court gurney p 75 he was followed by stopford who was further questioned about movements of ships sent to reinforce cochrane on 12 april gambier was invited to question witness and took opportunity to discuss bravery of a number of volunteers from stopford s flagship who served on fireships two of whom were killed gurney p 78 curtis then called command of fireship operation into question asking whether every fire ship was conducted with equal ability and resolution toward enemy gurney p 79 sutton then questioned stopford on width of entrance to aix roads and threat from batteries of ile d aix stopford s answer contradicting that of cochrane gurney p 82 court briefly recalled john spurling who was questioned on depth of anchorage whether imperieuse had grounded during operation and strength of batteries on ile d aix gurney p 83 he was followed by captain george wolfe of hms aigle who had assumed command from cochrane on 14 april when asked whether gambier was to blame for any failings during battle he replied i have no recollection of any thing of kind gurney p 87 court then called captain john tremayne rodd of hms indefatigable who had joined attack on 12 april rodd also supported gambier and further noted that his ship had almost become grounded in enemy anchorage and that he had no recollection of cochrane urging him to disobey orders and continue attack after being instructed to withdraw something cochrane had reported after battle gurney p 91 with that case was adjourned it sat briefly on saturday 29 july and was then adjourned until monday 31 july gurney p 104 day five day was reserved for gambier s testimony admiral as defendant was permitted to provide a full written statement to court read by moses greetham cochrane petitioned court to be allowed to remain for testimony cochrane p 255 but curtis dismissed him with comment i have never heard of such a thing in my life gurney p 105 gambier s testimony ran to 34 pages and started by stating his indignation at having to answer loose and indirect accusations of an officer so much his inferior in rank gurney p 107 and accused cochrane of attempting to exalt his own reputation at expense of mine gurney p 108 he justified his conduct by saying however highly courage is to be viewed in an officer it is always incomplete in its consequences without equal exercise of judgement and discretion gurney p 110 gambier s lengthy account of his plans for operation and his conduct during it match that described in his dispatches although in greater detail cochrane barely features except where gambier s describes his proposals for a general attack on stranded french fleet as preposterous and impractical gurney p 125 gambier notes that his chief concern was that should a ship have been severely damaged in narrow waterway it would have been impossible to retrieve it consequence of which could scarcely have been less than their utter destruction gurney p 127 and warned that if impression arising out of this inquiry should prove less favourable to lord cochrane his lordship must be sensible that as instigator of this court martial he will himself be instigator of this change of sentiment gurney p 131 there followed brief testimony from john dyer an admiralty clerk john spurling again and then john wilkinson secretary to lord gambier to attest to accuracy of some of documents presented to court gurney p 139 there was then a close examination by gambier of edward fairfax master of fleet and drafter of charts presented to court followed by recalled thomas stokes both officers testified as to accuracy of their charts and corroborated gambier s evidence of disposition of anchorage and of french fleet harvey p 145 gambier then called captain john bligh of hms valiant who led reinforcements on 12 april bligh described his ships as in a perilous situation and testified that they were in danger of being wrecked gurney p 155 court was then adjourned once more day six bligh was called again on morning of 1 august testifying that he had overheard cochrane stating that if gambier had led fleet into anchorage on 12 april three of four british ships might have been lost gurney p 157 thomas stokes was recalled to attest to relative positions of french and british ships on charts before gambier called captain john poo beresford captain of hms theseus which entered anchorage on evening of 12 april but was not heavily engaged beresford described cochrane s signals on day of battle as very improper and impossible gurney p 164 and reiterated gambier s concern that he may have suffered heavy losses had he attacked aix roads with his fleet harvey p 148 beresford was followed by captain alexander robert kerr of hms revenge who had been heavily engaged in battle and who had first served under gambier 28 years earlier kerr was clear in his support for gambier averring that if as cochrane desired had ships gone in sooner they would have been crippled by french counter fire gurney p 168 samuel raven was recalled and cross examined as to locations of stranded french ships in aix roads followed by captain stair douglas of hms bellona who stated of gambier that i do not know of any neglect whatever in his conduct gurney p 172 douglas was followed by captain william godfrey whose bomb vessel hms aetna was engaged throughout battle and who also supported gambier s narrative after which lt hockings was once more called to give testimony on signals during battle then corroborated by signal s mate on caledonia samuel sparshott gurney p 176 edward fairfax was briefly recalled to discuss night attack on 11 april and then rodd was briefly recalled gurney p 178 gambier then recalled his secretary john wilkinson and questioned him as to cochrane s conduct during his brief conference with gambier on 14 april this evidence was halted by curtis who gently admonished gambier for asking directly whether cochrane had discussed admiral s conduct or misconduct with any officers on board caledonia curtis raised doubts entertained as to strict propriety of this it is commenting on conduct of officers whose conduct is not called into question and i think it might be attended with very unpleasant consequences gurney p 179 gambier then offered to rest his case but curtis suggested that he wait until following day before deciding whether to conclude gurney p 181 day seven on 2 august stopford and hockings were briefly called to clarify portions of their testimony gambier then reopened his case having decided overnight to call more captains of fleet to testify gurney p 184 sir harry neale gambier s flag captain was called first and recounted cochrane s distrust of official neptune francois maps used by fleet in planning action he was followed by captain lucius hardyman whose frigate hms unicorn had been heavily engaged in aix roads on 12 april hardyman supported gambier s case stating i do not know of any neglect or unnecessary delay in attack on french force gurney p 189 captain george francis seymour of frigate hms pallas heavily engaged during battle was then called seymour was first officer other than cochrane to offer criticism of gambier s conduct stating that reinforcements could have been sent into aix roads at 11 00 on 12 april some three hours earlier than time of their eventual deployment harvey p 141 he was challenged in this assertion by admiral young if i understood intent of that observation it was advanced as an instance of either neglect misconduct or inattention in commander in chief seymour refused to answer and was further questioned as to his meaning by curtis before his evidence was brought abruptly to a close gurney p 196 captain francis newcombe of brig hms beagle was next called and complained about cochrane s conduct latter having fired shot in direction of his vessels during battle as a means of encouraging him to engage enemy more closely gurney p 201 he did however agree with seymour that reinforcements might have been sent in earlier although he countered by noting that they would have been under considerable fire from fort on ile d aix hockings was briefly called again followed by kerr stopford and wolfe court then briefly called captain pulteney malcolm of hms donegal who stated that an attack before noon would have been highly dangerous court was then adjourned gurney p 208 day eight last day of evidence 3 august first saw kerr recalled to correct some minor points before malcolm retook stand malcolm then testified that although an attack before noon would have been hazardous in his opinion an attack on main french fleet should have been made regardless of hazards and that there was some unnecessary delay albeit small in gambier s order to dispatch reinforcements he also suggested that ships of line might have been sent in earlier had they removed large quantities of stores they carried to reduce their draught although acknowledged that since fleet s transports had been used as fireships in initial attack this may have meant throwing stores overboard gurney p 213 court then called captain george of hms resolution captain henry lidgbird ball of hms gibraltar and captain james newman of hms hero none of whom were engaged in action and all of whom testified in gambier s favour gurney p 218 final witness was captain william broughton of hms illustrious who had reconnoitred ile d aix on 1 april he gave an extensive report on state of island s fortifications broughton then gave evidence which agreed with that of seymour noting that he believed that an earlier attack on french fleet between 11 00 and 12 00 on 12 april might have achieved better results and he noted that there was no shoal blocking entrance to roads as depicting in charts presented to court harvey p 140 kerr and bligh were each briefly called in once more and then court adjourned a final time with verdict expected on following morning gurney p 227 verdict on morning of ninth day 4 august gambier made his final summation and court ruled against an application from cochrane to present further evidence court was then cleared for deliberations reconvening at 13 00 verdict was then read by moses greetham concluding that following verdict curtis ceremonially returned gambier s sword surrendered to court at start of proceedings at which gambier thanked him and panel for obliging manner in which you have conveyed to me their sentiments gurney p 232 aftermath gambier s exoneration was reported in much of british press who had followed trial closely particularly in times cordingly p 214 and broad public support for cochrane remained strong harvey p 149 effect in navy however was quite opposite admiral james bowen wrote it will be a lesson to restless and inexperienced young officers not to hazard a mischievous opinion and lord collingwood a patron of cochrane hoped that verdict would free him of bad influences cordingly p 215 cochrane was to all intents and purposes officially disgraced he later wrote that effect was that from this time forward i never trod deck of a british ship of war at sea as her commander till thirty nine years afterwards cochrane p 258 in january 1810 vote of official thanks to gambier went ahead in parliament passing with 161 votes to 39 cochrane leading radical faction in opposition and succeeding in getting minutes of court martial produced in parliament cochrane p 259 separate votes of thanks to officers and seamen of fleet both passed unanimously james p 128 congratulations were sent to gambier on his legal defence and subsequent victory from allies such as william wilberforce of church missionary society and hannah more of blue stockings society gambier retained command of channel fleet until 1811 when he returned to shore service he died in 1833 as a knight grand cross of order of bath and an admiral of fleet tracy p 150 effect on cochrane was profound one biographer has written that this trial deeply embittered cochrane whose natural boldness and insubordination was to be transformed into a streak of and even quixotic eccentricity it was turning point of his life harvey p 149 he was ordered to return to service with mediterranean fleet but refused becoming a constant irritant to admiralty in parliament in 1813 he was called for service in war of 1812 but shortly thereafter was implicated in great stock exchange fraud of 1814 he was tried convicted and disgraced in his later career he found success serving in chilean navy brazilian navy and as commander in chief of greek navy during greek war of independence he was finally reinstated to royal navy in 1832 after a pardon from king william iv and served until his death in 1860 tracy p 79 entire affair has been heavily criticised by british historians william james noted in 1827 that we cannot refrain from observing that several of members particularly president sir roger curtis and admiral young evinced a strong bias in favour of accused james p 125 he further notes that much of gambier s evidence accepted at trial without comment was inaccurate james p 126 in 1900 william laird clowes agreed noting that gambier was fortunate in verdict clowes p 269 more recent historians have been more pronounced in their opinions richard woodman noted in 2001 that cochrane was browbeaten and forbidden to ask questions and called gambier stupid woodman p 273 perhaps most unexpected opinion came from emperor napoleon who years later told an english correspondent that cochrane could not only have destroyed french ships but he might and would have taken them out had your admiral supported him as he ought to have done french admiral was a fool but yours was just
