log from sea of cortez is an english language book written by american author john steinbeck and published in 1951 it details a six week march 11 april 20 marine specimen collecting boat expedition he made in 1940 at various sites in gulf of california also known as sea of cortez with his friend marine biologist ed ricketts it is regarded as one of steinbeck s most important works of non fiction chiefly because of involvement of ricketts who shaped steinbeck s thinking and provided prototype for many of pivotal characters in his fiction and insights it gives into philosophies of two men log from sea of cortez is narrative portion of an unsuccessful earlier work sea of cortez a leisurely journal of travel and research which was published by steinbeck and ricketts shortly after their return from gulf of california and combined journals of collecting expedition reworked by steinbeck with ricketts species catalogue after ricketts death in 1948 steinbeck dropped species catalogue from earlier work and republished it with a eulogy to his friend added as a foreword journey background steinbeck met ricketts in 1930 through a shared interest in marine biology ricketts made a modest living as a professional biologist by preparing and selling specimens of intertidal fauna to laboratories and universities from his small lab in cannery row and steinbeck spent many hours at lab in ricketts company ricketts was inspiration for boozy good hearted character of doc who appeared in novels set in and around monterey and elements of his personality are mirrored by many other important characters in steinbeck s novels both steinbeck and ricketts had achieved some measure of security and recognition in their professions by 1939 steinbeck had capitalized on his first successful novel tortilla flat with publication of grapes of wrath and ricketts had published between pacific tides which became definitive handbook for study of intertidal fauna of pacific coast of coterminous united states steinbeck was exhausted and looking for a new start ricketts was looking for a new challenge two men had long thought of producing a book together and in a change of pace for both of them they began work on a handbook of common intertidal species of san francisco bay area book came to nothing but it spurred them into making a trip to sea of cortez initially they planned a motoring trip to mexico city as a break from their work on handbook but as time went on they became more interested in a collecting trip around gulf of california ricketts noted in his journal a specimen collecting expedition along pacific coast and down into mexico provided them with a chance to relax and for steinbeck a chance for a brief escape from controversy mounting over grapes of wrath ricketts suffering as a result of breakup of his long term relationship with a married woman in monterey was glad to get away too they planned to collect specimens from rock and tide pools and shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them to build up a picture of macro level ecosystem in gulf preserved specimens of fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return early in 1940 steinbeck and ricketts hired a monterey bay sardine fishing boat western flyer with a four man crew and spent six weeks travelling coast of gulf of california collecting biological specimens along with ricketts and four crew members mentioned in book steinbeck was accompanied by his wife carol steinbeck hoped that trip would help rescue their failing marriage but it seems to have had opposite effect marriage ended soon after they returned steinbeck s lawyer and friend toby street was also on board as far as san diego account of expedition right thumb route around gulf of california taken by western flyer western flyer is a purse seiner that was crewed by tony berry captain tex travis engineer and two able seamen sparky enea and tiny colletto stocked with supplies collecting equipment and a small library boat put out to sea on afternoon of march 11 1940 they started in a leisurely fashion down pacific coast fishing as they went they refueled at san diego and on march 17 passed point san lazaro and made their way down pacific side of baja california peninsula they put in at cabo san lucas on tip of peninsula where they were greeted by mexican officials and began collecting specimens collecting team was initially planned to consist of steinbeck and ricketts alone but carol and eventually enea and colletto joined them allowing for a much more efficient collection at each stop battles with their outboard motor referred to pseudonymously as hansen sea cow which would feature as a humorous thread throughout journal began immediately and continued next day when they moved further round coast to el reef making for isla espiritu santo they faced strong winds and rather than attempting to land at island they anchored at pescadero on mainland on march 20 they returned to island and spent day collecting a visit from some natives of la paz that evening coupled with exhaustion of their supplies of beer encouraged them to make for town next morning they spent three days collecting with assistance of locals and enjoyed hospitality of la paz in writing about town steinbeck briefly recounts story that he would later rewrite as pearl on march 23 they moved on to san jose island where sea cow again let them down they wanted it to bring boat close to cayo islet but they ended up rowing boat with outboard still attached after it failed to start next day easter sunday they continued on to marcial reef after collecting specimens there they sailed to puerto escondido where they met some holidaying mexicans who invited them on a hunting trip they accepted wanting to see interior of peninsula and enjoyed two days in company of mexicans eating drinking and listening to unintelligible dirty jokes in spanish due to relaxed attitudes of their hosts no actual hunting took place which pleased steinbeck right thumb sally lightfoot crabs were common on shores of gulf but difficult to catch tiny declared war on them after slipping while trying to catch a specimen puerto escondido proved to be a rich collecting ground and after nine days in gulf they had to scale back their collecting ambitions owing to lack of space for specimens it had already become clear that there were certain species that were ubiquitous in region some species of crabs sea anemones limpets barnacles and sea cucumbers were found at every stop and sun star sea urchin incisa and of genus were common leaving puerto escondido they continued up coast to loreto where they restocked their supplies they then visited coronado islands concepcion bay and san lucas cove collecting specimens at each stop work was exhausting steinbeck wrote in his letters that he had little time for sleep because collecting and preparation took so long in cramped quarters of boat all equipment had to be set up and stowed each time boat moved to a new anchorage which made work of cataloguing and processing specimens doubly arduous making their way to san carlos bay they bypassed town of santa rosalia and entered sparsely populated upper gulf stopping at san francisquito bay on april 1 they made for bahia de los angeles which was to be last stop on peninsula before they crossed to mainland coast on april 2 they rounded isla angel de la guarda and anchored in puerto refugio for night next morning they made for tiburon island on eastern side of gulf they collected specimens at red point bluff keeping an eye out for seri a local tribe who they had heard were rumored to be cannibals thumb right puerto san carlos although crew were eager to get to guaymas as soon as possible it was too far for a single day s journey so next day they put in at puerto san carlos where they collected early next morning they made short run to guaymas they left guaymas on morning of april 8 and only an hour out encountered a japanese fishing fleet dredging bottom although initially wary crew of one of boats welcomed steinbeck and ricketts on board and allowed them to select some specimens from catch though to annoyance of crew of western flyer ricketts and steinbeck forgot to get any fish to eat taking leave of fleet they made for estero de la luna a huge estuary where ricketts and steinbeck became lost in fog while out on a collecting expedition after sea cow once again refused to run although spooked by episode they were able to navigate back to western flyer once fog cleared continuing down to lagoon they stopped to collect along shores and then recrossed gulf by night putting in at san gabriel bay for a last collection before making for home on afternoon of april 12 they secured all equipment and laid in a course for san diego collecting trip had been very successful they catalogued over 500 species of fauna of shores of gulf john steinbeck contemporary reviews p 207 recorded a species of brittle star marginatus last recorded nearly 100 years earlier and discovered about 50 new species three species of sea anemone they discovered were named for them by dr at lund university s department of zoology in sweden and book sea of cortez year after their return from trip steinbeck and ricketts published sea of cortez a leisurely journal of travel and research in which steinbeck combined daily journals of trip with ricketts annotated specimen list title sea of cortez was preferred to gulf of california as a better sounding and a more exciting name it was assumed by many that steinbeck had kept a journal during trip and that book was merely an amalgamation of his log and ricketts taxonomic list but two authors revealed that journal was ricketts although steinbeck had added to it during journey he had done real work of editing it after they returned log was based on what ricketts called verbatim transcript an account of trip he had compiled from various notes he kept during trip much of final narrative was little changed from ricketts notes steinbeck shifted from first person singular to first person plural and gave some of ricketts drier prose a poetic twist but many of scenes remained almost unchanged from daily journal suggestion by steinbeck s editor pascal covici that title page should state that steinbeck was author and add that appendices were by ricketts met with blunt opposition from steinbeck i not only disapprove of your plan i forbid it steinbeck also drew upon journal of tony berry mostly to confirm dates and times book is a travelogue and biological record but also reveals two men s philosophies it dwells on place of humans in environment interconnection between single organisms and larger ecosystem and themes of leaving and returning home a number of ecological concerns rare in 1940 are voiced such as an imagined but horrific vision of long term damage that japanese bottom fishing trawlers are doing to sea bed although written as if it were journal kept by steinbeck during voyage book is to some extent a work of fiction journals are not steinbeck s and his wife who had accompanied him on trip is not mentioned though at one point steinbeck slips and mentions matter of food for seven people since returning home is a theme throughout narrative inclusion of his wife a symbol of home would have dissipated effect steinbeck and ricketts are never mentioned by name but are amalgamated into first person we who narrate log right thumb original edition of sea of cortez a leisurely journal of travel and research a version of ricketts philosophical work essay on non teleological thinking which to some extent expressed both authors outlooks was included as easter sunday chapter although steinbeck altered original ricketts expressed his satisfaction with result becoming known as easter sunday sermon it explores gap between methods of science and faith and common ground they share and it expounds on holistic approach both men took to ecology steinbeck enjoyed writing book it was a challenge to apply his novel writing skills to a scientific subject however he doubted from an early stage that book would sell well he considered it would be a good read but not for take a book to bed public as he progressed further he began to see that book would have very limited appeal but equally he was convinced that it was a good book and best work he had done he was happy that it took his writing in a new direction and would confound attempts of critics to him and with a slightly masochistic joy he looked forward to their rage and contempt in that he was proved incorrect reviews were mixed but largely favorable focusing on his affirmation of humankind s place in wider environment and picking up on excitement steinbeck and ricketts felt for their subject john steinbeck contemporary reviews pp 201 13 most felt that even though there were moments when steinbeck was at his best blending of philosophy travelogue and biological recording made for an uneven read those critics who looked beyond narrative portion were impressed by ricketts catalogue marine biologist joel w writing in san francisco chronicle predicted it would be indispensable for students of marine invertebrates of gulf of california john steinbeck contemporary reviews p 208 steinbeck was right about lack of popular appeal however unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant book struggled to find an audience few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten country s entry into war and plummeting book sales also had an effect ricketts share of revenues from sales did not even provide him with money to pay back steinbeck for financing journey reissue ricketts was killed in 1948 when a train collided with his car while he was crossing rail tracks ricketts death severely hurt steinbeck he was part of my brain for 18 years although steinbeck had moved to new york city shortly after journey and two men had not seen as much of each other in following years they had corresponded by mail and had been planning a further expedition this time northwards to aleutian islands in 1951 steinbeck republished narrative portion of sea of cortez as log from sea of cortez dropping ricketts species list and adding a preface entitled about ed ricketts a biography of his friend pascal covici had always regarded ricketts as a hanger on and had been keen to deny his authorship of original book he pushed steinbeck to get ricketts son ed jr to sign over copyright to narrative portion of book so that reissued version could credit steinbeck alone covici suggested a 15 20 share of royalties as a recompense but ed jr knowing that narrative was largely ricketts own insisted on 25 with copyright secured ricketts name was dropped from cover though title page acknowledged that book was narrative portion of sea of cortez by john steinbeck and e f ricketts and throughout his life steinbeck insisted on referring to work as a collaboration republished narrative is unchanged from original published in sea of cortez republished version enjoyed greater success than original although by time of his death in 1968 steinbeck s reputation was at an all time low owing to his mediocre output during last decades of his life and his support for american involvement in vietnam his books have slowly regained their popularity log from sea of cortez became an important work within his oeuvre not only as an interesting travelogue and work of non fiction but for its first hand account of ed ricketts man whose thinking had so much influence on course of steinbeck s writing and on whom he had based so many of his pivotal characters whereas earlier critics mostly assumed that mr ricketts contributed some of biology and mr steinbeck all of prose clifton books new yorker 6 december 1941 taken from john steinbeck contemporary reviews p 204 publication of ricketts rediscovered original notes in 2003 has revealed how closely steinbeck followed ricketts journal this has forced a re evaluation of how far it is fair to attribute authorship of narrative portion of sea of cortez to steinbeck and has caused critics to view removal of ricketts name from cover as reflecting badly on steinbeck travels with charley in search of america another non fiction travelogue which steinbeck wrote in 1962 is seen as a more rounded view of author late in life but log from sea of cortez is regarded as showing direct influence of ed ricketts and his philosophies on steinbeck and provides clues to underlying rationales for some events in his novels in particular about ed ricketts reveals how closely he was tied to characters in steinbeck s novels parts are taken almost verbatim from descriptions of doc in cannery row book is also important for seeing something of ed ricketts himself it was only example of his philosophical writings published in his lifetime essay on non teleological thinking was part of a trilogy of philosophical essays he had written before trip and which with steinbeck s help he continued to try to have published until his death as a travelogue it captures a lost world even as they were making trip a new hotel was being built in la paz steinbeck bemoaned coming of tourism today cabo san lucas is home to luxury hotels and houses of american rock stars and many of small villages have become suburbs of larger towns of gulf but people still visit attempting to capture something of spirit of leisurely journey steinbeck and ricketts took around sea of cortez notes a sparky enea and tiny colletto later featured in a scene in steinbeck s cannery row sparky enea and tiny colletti had made up a quarrel and were helping jimmy to celebrate his birthday b dates in this section are taken from log from sea of cortez though there is some doubt as to accuracy of dates chapter 25 of book is headed april 22 and sandwiched between two chapters for april 3 and april 5 western flyer returned to monterey on 20 april c timing of release of book did nothing to help sales it was published in first week of december attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 and subsequent entry of united states into world war ii focused attention of american people elsewhere d republished narrative section even refers to expunged
