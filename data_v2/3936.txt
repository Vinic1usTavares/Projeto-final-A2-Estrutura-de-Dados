boeing sikorsky rah 66 comanche was a stealth armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter designed for united states army following decades of development during 2004 rah 66 program was canceled prior to mass production commencing by which point nearly us 7 billion had been already spent on program during early 1980s u s army started to formulate requirements for replacement of its helicopters then in service which resulted in launch of light helicopter experimental lhx program nearly a decade later following refinement of requirements evaluation of submissions and rebranding of programme as light helicopter lx program during april 1991 army announced selection of boeing sikorsky team s design as contest winner shortly after which a contract for construction of prototypes was awarded comanche was to incorporate several advanced elements such as stealth technologies and a number of previously untried design features operationally it was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role where it was intended to designate targets for ah 64 apache it was also armed with one rotary cannon and could carry missiles and rockets in internal bays and optionally on stub wings for light attack duties a pair of rah 66 prototypes were constructed and underwent flight testing between 1996 and 2004 on 1 june 2000 program entered its 3 1 billion engineering and manufacturing development emd phase however during 2002 comanche program underwent heavy restructuring number of comanches that were to be purchased was cut to 650 at time projected total cost for full production of comanche in such numbers stood at 26 9 billion as early as late 1990s government accountability office gao had reported that it had serious doubts about program observing that comanche would consume almost two thirds of whole aviation budget by fiscal year 2008 multiple government agencies had acted to cut number of comanches on order but as a consequence of heavy reductions to numbers to be procured unit costs soared on 23 february 2004 u s army announced termination of comanche program stating they had determined that rah 66 would require numerous upgrades to be viable on battlefield and that service would instead direct bulk of its rotary systems funds to renovating its existing attack utility and reconnaissance helicopters army also announced new plans to accelerate development of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs which could also perform scouting role intended for comanche but with less risk since program cancellation both of prototypes have been placed on public display development origins and lhx during 1982 u s army initiated light helicopter experimental lhx program with aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft including uh 1 ah 1 oh 6 and oh 58 helicopters it was a further six years until in 1988 a formal request for proposal rfp was issued to various manufacturers in time which requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter eden 2004 p 138 frawley 2007 p 50 in october 1988 army announced two teams these being boeing sikorsky and bell mcdonnell douglas received contracts to further develop their concepts harding 1997 pp 75 76 during 1990s program s name was changed from lhx to simply light helicopter lh in april 1991 army awarded boeing sikorsky team a 2 8 billion contract to complete six prototypes later that month helicopter received its official designation of rah 66 comanche during november 1993 assembly of first prototype commenced at sikorsky s facility in stratford connecticut and at boeing s manufacturing plant in philadelphia pennsylvania later all of rotorcraft s sub assemblies were transferred to former location where final assembly occurred in december 1994 department of defense reduced number of planned prototypes to two as services shifted budgets to pay for increased troop salaries on 25 may 1995 first comanche prototype was formally rolled out at sikorsky s production facility after which it was transferred to west palm beach florida to commence flight testing activities eden 2004 p 139 on 4 january 1996 prototype comanche flown by test pilots bob and rus stiles performed its 39 minute maiden flight first flight had been originally planned to take place during august 1995 but had been delayed by a number of structural and software problems that had been encountered on 30 march 1999 second prototype conducted its first flight before joining flight test program shortly thereafter prototype testing thumb an rah 66 comanche flying in formation with an ah 64 apache part of comanche s planned role was to designate targets for apache flight test program was conducted using pair of prototypes produced which had been assigned serial numbers 94 0327 and 95 0001 following a demonstration of its ability to meet certain key criteria on 1 june 2000 rah 66 entered 3 1 billion engineering and manufacturing development emd phase of program flight international 2000 p 6 through early 2000s u s army maintained its plans for intended purchase of over 1 200 comanches which were to fill both scout helicopter and light attack roles as late as 2003 it was being anticipated that deliveries of operational rah 66s would commence as scheduled during 2006 lopez 2000 p 29 however program was not problem free during late 2000 it was revealed that an effort to reduce comanche s empty weight by approximately or 2 1 per cent in order to conform with its established target weight had been initiated first comanche prototype serial 94 0327 completed 318 flights over 387 hours before reaching end of its testing career during january 2002 second prototype serial 95 0001 had accumulated 103 5 flight hours and 93 sorties by may 2001 during late 2001 and early 2002 testing with second rah 66 was halted while aircraft underwent extensive modifications received both mission equipment and more powerful t800 801 engines on 23 may 2002 second prototype re commenced flight testing with additional equipment fitted accordingly expanded test programme involved new aspects such as testing of armaments and night vision systems these test flights continued into 2003 during testing comanche was recorded as having attained a cruise speed of as well as having achieved a dash speed of perhaps one of its more atypical capabilities was demonstrated ability to perform a 180deg turn in under five seconds during 2002 comanche program underwent heavy restructuring consequently planned number of comanches to be purchased was decreased to 650 rotorcraft at time projected total cost for full production of comanche in such numbers stood at 26 9 billion originally emd phase was to last for six years with five comanches to be constructed for testing regime during 2003 production on third rah 66 which was to be first emd helicopter was started subsequently eight rah 66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes jackson 2007 initial production rah 66s were to be completed in a block i configuration that included majority of rotorcraft s planned weapons and sensors from 16th comanche onwards deliveries would have been made to block ii standard with all of planned capabilities cancellation on 23 february 2004 u s army announced that they had decided to terminate all work on comanche program at time it was stated that army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for rah 66 to be capable of surviving on battlefield in face of current anti aircraft threats however army had instead decided to re direct bulk of its funding for rotary development toward renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack utility and reconnaissance aircraft specifically army also had plans to reuse funds allocated to comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs which could also perform scouting role intended for vehicle at time of its termination comanche program had reportedly spent us 6 9 billion contract termination fees involved were estimated to total us 450 680 million for main program partners sikorsky and boeing subsequently army decided to pursue development of another battlefield scout helicopter under armed reconnaissance helicopter program this resulted in another rotorcraft designated as bell arh 70 being selected and developed with intention to replace oh 58d in place of comanche however on 16 october 2008 department of defense notified congress and bell that it was canceling program reportedly due to cost overruns on its development a multitude of reasons contributed to ultimate cancellation of rah 66 program according to aviation author james williams efforts to speed up program via elimination of risk mitigation measures and stream of continuous adjustments to account for annual budget cuts to rotorcraft resulted in formation of a negative cycle that functioned to greatly extend rotorcraft s development schedule over course of comanche s development multiple government agencies had acted to cut number of helicopters that were intended to be ordered one particularly common basis for such was that cold war had ended and thus such quantities were unnecessary a phenomenon known as peace dividend however significant reductions in volume directly resulted in rapid climbs in projections of comanche s unit cost in turn this stimulated and gave validity to critics of program such as army acquisition executive james ambrose who had prominently declared that army would not receive any aircraft costing a dollar over 7 5 million williams 2005 p 342 as early as 1995 it is claimed by williams that comanche had been facing complete cancellation as a choice between which defense development programs were to be scrapped williams 2005 p 343 during mid 1999 comanche was subject to substantial governmental scrutiny government accountability office gao reported that it had serious doubts about program and noted that comanche would consume almost two thirds of whole aviation budget by fiscal year 2008 in addition wartime experiences such as from kosovo war had led to some senior figures within army to place a greater emphasis on use of unmanned platforms for conducting many of same roles for which comanche was being developed to perform williams 2005 p 346 by 2000 williams postulates that primary reason for retaining program was out of concern for state of helicopter industry sikorsky s production and employment figures were at their lowest for decades and contract was considered critical williams 2005 pp 346 347 author fred brooks criticized program s requirement for comanche to be capable of ferrying itself across atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project s design phase and of their costly repercussions brooks 2010 pp 39 41 williams observes that comanche s weight requirements were unachievable and claimed that this was due to poor management in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of rotorcraft s final weight there were concerns that when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations comanche s engines would be incapable of lifting total weight of helicopter additionally it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince army that program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize existence of insurmountable technical problems prized elements of program such as certain software capabilities and its integration failed to foster confidence with army overseers several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky while anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of aviation budget by comanche alone for a number of years was considered to be extreme according to williams it was concluded that army s aviation budget would be better spent on delivery of less risky and more critical needs williams 2005 p 349 in a report published during 2008 gao recorded that an army spokesperson had stated that program s costs could no longer be justified government accountability office 2008 p 10 author cindy williams stated of comanche rationale for cutting comanche is twofold first doctrinal niche that comanche occupies is unnecessary in near term and probably not viable in longer term secondly as with all rotary wing aircraft comanche is a voracious consumer of strategic airlift williams 2001 p 169 manufacturing team sikorsky and boeing have attributed factors that were outside of their control such as budget cuts requirement creep and a protracted development period to have caused problems with program rather than dysfunctionality on their part under comanche program each company was responsible for construction of different elements of rotorcraft since termination both companies have decided to team up again to produce a jointly developed prototype designated as sb 1 defiant for army s future vertical lift programme sikorsky boeing confident sb 1 defiant won t be next comanche flightglobal com 22 october 2013 archived on 22 july 2014 design thumb rah 66 prototype in 1997 comanche was intended to be an advanced armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter comanche was specifically tailored to role of armed scout to replace u s army s oh 58d kiowa warrior which is an upgraded version of a vietnam war era observation helicopter it was both smaller and lighter than ah 64 apache attack helicopter that it had been intended to accompany rah 66 was powered by a pair of t800 turboshaft engines each capable of generating up to 1 563 hp 1 165 kw of power rah 66 s fuselage was long and composed of composite materials it was designed to be capable of fitting more readily onto transport ships enabling comanche to be more rapidly deployed to flash points and other rapidly developing situations bonds miller 2002 pp 81 82 however in event of strategic transport assets not being available helicopter s ferry range of would have allowed it to fly itself to battlefields overseas on its own as intended it would have functioned as a stealth helicopter incorporating a number of different techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross section rcs along with other areas of visibility and detectability bonds miller 2002 p 81 exterior surfaces of rah 66 were faceted and covered with both radar absorbent material ram coatings and infrared paint as a result of these combined measures comanche s rcs was stated to be 360 times smaller than that of ah 64 apache acoustic signature of helicopter was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters this reduction had been partially achieved through adoption of an all composite five blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly as intended comanche was to be equipped with sophisticated avionics including navigation and detection systems which would have enabled operations at night and in inclement weather its primary mission was scouting using its advanced sensors in particular locating and designating targets for attack helicopters such as ah 64 apache to strike crawford 2003 p 88 comanche was furnished with a digital fly by wire flight control system each of two crew members were to be provided with a pair of lcd multi functional displays in addition to helmet integrated display and sight system for light attack role rah 66 was to be furnished with various armaments it was equipped with a single chin mounted 20 mm three barrel rotary cannon which could be pointed rearwards and retracted under a faring when not in use to decrease helicopter s radar cross section in addition rah 66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six agm 114 hellfire air to ground missiles or up to twelve aim 92 stinger air to air missiles which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons beyond storing munitions internally comanche could also mount external stub wings to carry up to eight hellfire missiles or sixteen stinger missiles however operations performing with armaments mounted externally would reduce of effectiveness of comanche s stealth
