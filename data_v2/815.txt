cinematic fast paced you win or you die thrusts plot forward while hinting at painful moments looming for fans times reviewer james poniewozik called you win or you die most thrilling and thematically rich hour to date aol tv s maureen ryan found it an excellent outing that saw stakes raised in satisfying and suspenseful ways and hitfix s alan sepinwall called it a terrific episode and commended how it turned spotlight on characters who are villains in ned stark s version of story poniewozik continued we knew this would be a significant episode if for no other reason than that it contains scene alluded to in episode s title that gives series its name a sentiment sepinwall agreed with myles mcnutt writing for cultural learnings also considered you win or you die a climactic moment in series ign s matt fowler noted that this was episode that saw ned stark unfortunately thwarted by his own honorable intentions but that his stubborn nobility is what makes ned such a great character final showdown with lannisters seizing control from eddard was much discussed with many commentators criticizing ned s ingenuity and his actions during episode in atlantic scott meslow wrote that eddard could never win game of thrones because he is dedicated to playing by rules in his opinion one can t afford to play fair when only outcomes are win or die mcnutt felt that climax at episode s end was really well handled by both cast and director dan minahan as well as final confrontation between eddard and cersei other scenes were praised by critics introduction of charles dance as lord tywin lannister was considered a beauty by emily vanderwerff from a v club who admired how a single scene depicted not only relationship between tywin and jaime but also all dynamics of lannister clan she also praised work of nikolaj coster waldau in scene commenting that despite having few lines he transmitted that jaime is cowed by his father very well maureen ryan agreed with that sentiment and also lauded natalia tena s short appearance david sims a second reviewer for a v club highlighted work of mark addy in his final scene extending praise to rest of his work on series critics agreed that scenes with dothraki were strong with storyline having improved significantly since first episodes poniewozik stated that this was first week for me that dothraki scenes were not just absorbing but felt like characters were as well imagined as those in westeros and mcnutt felt episode finally allows khal drogo to become an actual character drogo s rant vowing to give his unborn son iron throne led to compliments about jason momoa s intensity and emilia clarke s calm and loving facial expressions however scene where littlefinger exposes his motivations while hiring two whores for his brothel was largely criticized as an example of show s perceived abuse of conversations with prostitutes as an expository device a situation for which myles mcnutt coined term sexposition aidan gillen s acting was consistently praised and comparison between littlefinger s actions and faking an orgasm was considered apt but many agreed with meslow s statement that it was annoyingly overshadowed by series most gratuitous sex scene to date among other criticisms were scene s excessive length repetition of dramatic approach and assumption that viewers were not going to pay attention when presented with a long exposition that did not include sex references external links you win or you die at hbo category 2011 american television episodes category game of thrones season 1 episodes category in
