royal sovereign class was a group of eight pre dreadnought battleships built for royal navy in 1890s ships spent their careers in mediterranean home and channel fleets sometimes as flagships although several were mobilised for service with flying squadron in 1896 when tensions with german empire were high following jameson raid in south africa three ships were assigned to international squadron formed when greek christians rebelled against ottoman empire s rule in crete in 1897 1898 by about 1905 1907 they were considered obsolete and were reduced to reserve ships began to be sold off for scrap beginning in 1911 although was sunk as a target ship during gunnery trials in 1913 was fitted with first anti torpedo bulges to evaluate underwater protection schemes in 1911 before being scuttled as a blockship a few months after start of first world war in august 1914 only survived to see active service in war during which she bombarded belgian coastline renamed redoubtable in 1915

1906 by late 1880s pressure on government to modernise and expand royal navy was building a war scare with russia in 1885 during incident failure of blockading fleet to contain raiding ships in port

ships of royal sovereign class were centrepiece act also formalised two power standard whereby royal navy sought to be as large as next two major naval powers combined brown pp 115 17 preliminary work on what would become royal sovereigns began in 1888 and board of admiralty directed director of naval construction sir william white to design an improved and enlarged version of these ships were equipped with gun turrets weight of which dictated that they be low freeboard ships to reduce their topweight white however argued strenuously for a high freeboard design to improve new ships ability to fight and steam in heavy weather this meant that armament could only be mounted in lighter less heavily armoured barbettes after much discussion board came around to white s view and design resembled an enlarged version of earlier although one of eight ships was built as a low freeboard turret ship in deference to first sea lord admiral sir arthur hood who had strongly argued for type

ships fitted with barbettes had a freeboard of about 90 of modern guidelines provided by addition of a complete extra deck which improved their performance in heavy seas brown p 124 to reduce their topweight white gave them a significant amount of tumblehome hoods freeboard however was only which meant that she was very wet and lost speed rapidly as wave height increased she was last british battleship with heavy old style turrets and all future british battleships were of a high freeboard design and had their main armament in barbettes although adoption of armoured rotating gunhouses over barbettes gradually led to them being called turrets as well brown p 124 burt p 101 thumb left low freeboard hood equipped with turrets another issue with hood was that stability of a ship is largely due to freeboard at high rolling angles so she had to be given a larger metacentric height vertical distance between and centre of gravity below it of around instead of of rest of royal sovereigns to make her roll less in rough seas this had effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7 compared to her sister ship which in turn made her gunnery less accurate white had purposely selected a high metacentric height to minimise rolling and he did not think that bilge keels were needed when experienced heavy rolling during a heavy storm in december 1893 which earned class nickname rolling her sister was fitted with bilge keels while still fitting out and conclusively demonstrated their effectiveness during comparative trials brown pp 124 25 burt pp 72 73 75 thumb

six qf guns of trafalgar class these guns were intended to destroy unarmoured structure of their opponents and they were widely spaced on two decks so that a single hit would not disable more than one four of guns were situated on main deck and were only usable in calm weather because they were so close to ships waterline while remaining guns were above them on upper deck together with their ammunition supply of 200 rounds per gun guns weighed about and were one of reasons for large increase in displacement over earlier ships brown p 123 burt pp 73 77 78 guns fired their shells to a range

completion in mid 1903 and was reduced to reserve in early 1905 four years later she became receiving ship at queenstown ireland hood was used in development of anti torpedo bulges in 1911 1913 and

torpedo bulges fitted in early 1915 first ship to be fitted with them operationally burt pp 87 90 later that year ship was renamed redoubtable to release her name for use by new battleship and was
