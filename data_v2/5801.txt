82 sfx described boom town as a format breaking episode reviewer acknowledged that it certainly misfires on some levels and leaves various elements underdeveloped but praised moral dilemma including dinner scene however conclusion with margaret being reverted to an egg was seen as a little too handy and provides doctor with a moral get out clause and rose and mickey subplot was called weak due to lack of evidence he and rose were ever close arnold t blumburg of now playing gave episode a grade of b writing that it sacrifices a bit of plot and logic for a good exploration of characters and plot threads he praised dialogue and murray gold s score digital spy s dek hogan was more negative feeling that it really didn t work calling bringing back margaret a poor idea and he criticised pace for dragging too much in 2013 patrick mulkern of radio times particularly praised badland and dinner scene though he described whole episode as a peculiar short story a low cal filler sandwiched between dramatic juggernauts of steven moffat s doctor who debut and russell t davies s dazzling finale a v club reviewer alasdair wilkins gave episode a grade of b noting that it required more suspension of belief than usual he felt that plot was included out of necessity while episode was more focused on character moments and that this did not work as well as father s day because margaret s fate was less clearly motivated on other hand wilkins called rose and mickey s subplot most effectively handled part of boom town in who is doctor a guide to revived series author robert smith called episode highly entertaining and thoughtful despite not being well plotted with an unsatisfying deus ex machina ending he praised character material and comedy burk and smith pp 48 50 his coauthor graeme burk was less enthusiastic describing it as nothing more than a fun romp he felt that there were many good scenes but no real story and pointed out how moral dilemma did not matter because decision does
