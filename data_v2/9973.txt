volvariella bombycina commonly known as silky sheath silky rosegill silver silk straw mushroom or tree mushroom is a species of edible mushroom in family pluteaceae it is an uncommon but widespread species having been reported from asia australia caribbean europe and north america fruit body mushroom begins developing in a thin egg like sac this ruptures and stem expands quickly leaving sac at base of stem as a volva cap which can attain a diameter of up to is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs on underside of cap are closely spaced gills free from attachment to stem and initially white before turning pink as spores mature mushroom grows singly or in clusters often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples v bombycina contains compounds with antibacterial properties taxonomy species was first described in 1774 by german naturalist jacob christian schaffer as agaricus throughout its taxonomical history it has been shuffled to several genera including pluteus by elias fries in 1836 volvaria paul kummer 1871 and volvariopsis william alphonso murrill 1911 rolf singer placed it in its current genus volvariella in 1951 other names that have been applied to species include jean baptiste lamarck s amanita and august johann georg karl batsch s agaricus both published in 1783 but these are illegitimate names as schaffer s earlier 1774 name has priority in 1949 murrill described variety flaviceps from collections made growing on magnolia wood in gainesville florida although he originally described it as a new species volvaria flaviceps robert shaffer considered it a variety of v bombycina variety microspora was first described in 1953 was later 1961 named by r w g dennis variety palmicola was originally described as a distinct species volvaria palmicola by belgian mycologist maurice in 1928 and later as a variety of v bombycina by same author in 1937 root for generic name volvariella as well as volvaria and volvariopsis genera in which species had been formerly placed derives from latin volva meaning wrapper or a covering specific epithet bombycina derives from latin root or silky common names for mushroom include silky sheath silky rosegill silver silk straw mushroom or tree mushroom description fruit bodies of volvariella bombycina are initially egg shaped when still enclosed in universal veil as they expand caps later becoming bell shaped or convex and finally nearly flattened in age attaining a diameter of dry cap surface is covered with silky threads its color is white to yellowish becoming more pale approaching margin flesh is thin soft and white and has an odor resembling raw potatoes gills are crowded close together free from attachment to stem and initially white before turning pinkish as spores mature stem measures long by thick and is typically tapered upward or thickened below it is white with a smooth surface and is often slightly curved universal veil is membranous often areolate cracked into irregularly shaped blocks or scaly and forms a long saclike volva that wraps around base of stem it is white to yellowish or dingy brown and often divided into lobes thumb right variety flaviceps has a yellow cap variety v bombycina var flaviceps is distinguished from main form by its smaller bright yellow caps up to in diameter and its dirty white scaly volva murrill also noted that it developed a peculiar sickening odor during drying v bombycina var microspora has smaller spores 6 7 5 by 4 5 mm a yellow cap and a blotched brown volva v bombycina var palmicola also has a yellow cap and small spores 5 9 7 5 by 4 3 5 4 mm but can be distinguished from previous varieties by its distantly spaced gills mushrooms produce a spore print with a color ranging from pinkish to salmon spores are elliptical smooth and measure 6 5 10 by 4 5 6 5 mm basidia spore bearing cells are club shaped four spored and measure 19 43 by 6 11 mm pleurocystidia cystidia that occur on gill face are usually spindle shaped but have a widely variable morphology they are abundant in hymenium and have dimensions of 26 122 by 8 57 mm cheilocystidia on gill edge are similar in morphology and abundance some may feature knobs held at end of slender projections up to 20 mm long dimensions are in range of 26 and 144 mm long by 8 46 mm wide clamp connections are absent from hyphae of v bombycina fruit bodies can be readily grown in laboratory culture similar species combination of a silky white cap white stem pink gills pink spore print and growth on wood is characteristic of this species and make identification of volvariella bombycina in field relatively easy some pluteus species have a general similar appearance and also produce pinkish to pinkish brown spore prints but they lack a volva amanita species grow on ground and make white spore prints v pusilla has a small cap measuring in diameter with silky fibers and short lines visible at cap edge when moist it grows in soil in gardens and greenhouses and on lawns v has a medium size white cap that is in diameter with silky to scaly fibers and lacks short lines at cap edge when moist it grows on ground in woods v has a bluish gray cap while v can be distinguished from v bombycina by its smooth cap that is sticky when damp and a white volva edibility fruit bodies are edible and usually considered of good quality they have been called excellent tasty with a modest and pleasant flavor and worth eating if found in large enough quantities alexander h smith related a story of how unique circumstances led to development of a local superstition about species members of a family here in ann arbor were poisoned some fatally as result of eating caps of a species of amanita next year volvaria bombycina fruited on a maple tree at home of these people and story was circulated that some of spores of poisonous fungus which caused deaths year before had escaped from house lodged in tree germinated grew and were now producing fruiting bodies consequently of volvaria were held in great awe by neighbors and soon came to be referred to as ghost mushroom no one of course would consider eating them habitat and distribution thumb right fruit bodies often grow in knotholes or clefts of trees shown here on sugar maple volvariella bombycina is a saprobic species fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods favored species include sugar maple red maple silver maple magnolia mango beech oak and elm it is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks it has been noted to fruit in same location for several years despite its preference for hardwoods it has been reported growing on rare instances on coniferous wood an uncommon species with a wide distribution it has been reported from asia china india korea pakistan caribbean cuba australia europe north america and south america it acquired protected status in hungary in 2005 making it a legal offense to pick it variety microspora is known from venezuela while v bombycina var palmicola occurs in dr congo bioactive compounds several bioactive secondary metabolites have been isolated and identified from volvariella bombycina fruit bodies mycelium or pure culture compounds ergosta 4 6 8 14 22 3 one ergosterol peroxide indole 3 and were found in liquid culture in 2009 novel compound was identified from culture broth this compound inhibits enzyme human fungus also produces compounds that have antioxidative activity references
