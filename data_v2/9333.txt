kaimanawa horses are a population of feral horses in new zealand that are descended from domestic horses released in 19th and 20th centuries they are known for their hardiness and quiet temperament new zealand government strictly controls population to protect habitat in which they live which includes several endangered species of plants varying heritage gives breed a wide range of heights body patterns and colours they are usually well muscled sure footed and tough horses were first reported in kaimanawa range in 1876 although first horses had been brought into new zealand in 1814 feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases members of herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses as well as being caught for their meat hair and hides herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979 kaimanawa herd was protected by new zealand government in 1981 and there were 1 576 horses in herd by 1994 a small mostly unmanaged population also exists on aupouri peninsula at northern tip of north island roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage size of herd removing around 2 800 horses altogether kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by united nations food and agricultural organization and several studies have been conducted on herd dynamics and habits of breed history first horses were introduced to new zealand by protestant missionary reverend samuel marsden in december 1814 and wild horses were first reported in kaimanawa range in central north island of new zealand in 1876 kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released in late 19th century and early 20th century in middle of north island around kaimanawa mountains between 1858 and 1875 major george carlyon imported exmoor ponies to hawkes bay thought unlikely to be purebred exmoor s they were then later crossed with local stock to produce carlyon pony these carlyon ponies were later crossed with two welsh stallions caesar and comet imported by sir donald mclean and a breed known as comet resulted at some point during 1870s mclean released a comet stallion and several mares on plains and bloodline apparently became part of wild kaimanawa population other horses were added to bloodline through escapes and releases from local sheep stations and from cavalry units at waiouru that were threatened with a strangles epidemic it is also thought that in 1960s nicholas released an arabian stallion into argo valley region throughout 19th and 20th centuries horses were harvested from feral herds and used as riding and stock horses as well as being used for their meat hair and hides originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by british crown and native maori but many were eradicated with intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased need for stock horses kaimanawa horses today have highest amount of genetic similarity with thoroughbred and other thoroughbred cross breeds pressure from land development and an encroaching human population reduced range and number of kaimanawa horses and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained starting in 1981 kaimanawa population range size and herd movements began to be officially measured and a protected area was formed for breed in waiouru military training area legislative protection was similar to kiwi and other native species there was a rapid increase in herd size following protection of breed and 1 576 horses were known to exist in area by 1994 there is also a small population of horses on aupouri peninsula at northern tip of north island which is mostly unmanaged by new zealand government in 2008 kaimanawa herds were focus of a novel called kaimanawa princess by dianne haworth breed characteristics many characteristics of comet type are said to be shown in kaimanawa horses today although varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes colours and body types among wild horses kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance with heights ranging between high any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable they are usually well muscled their feral way of life has given them ability to adapt quickly and live on very little and they are usually sure footed and tough they have a medium sized head in good proportion to their body with wide variation in shape due to different conformation of their ancestors kaimanawa horses have a short deep neck with a thick throat area straight shoulders a deep girth and a short to medium back hindquarters vary from sloping to well rounded legs are long and well muscled with strong hooves and hind hooves that are generally smaller than front ones all horses are considered to age a year on first of august regardless of their actual date population control and study due to increase in population after protective legislation was put into place department of conservation developed a management plan for kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990 a draft plan was made available to public for comment in 1991 and public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters and instead favored horses remaining alive after being removed from herd however core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was most humane option trial musters were conducted in 1993 1994 and 1995 and were successful although costly and with a limited demand for captured horses in 1994 a working party was established to look at management of kaimanawa herd they aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management to ensure that treatment of horses is humane to preserve and control best attributes of herds and to eliminate impacts of herds on other conservation priorities goals included ensuring welfare of horses protecting natural ecosystems and features that kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping herd at a sustainable level ecological objectives included ensuring that kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered rare and biogeographically significant plants ensuring that herd does not further degrade ecosystems in which it lives and preventing herd from spreading into kaimanawa forest park and tongariro national park herd objectives included ensuring that public was safe from roaming horses while still allowing and improving public access to herd and ensuring humane treatment of horses reducing conflict between herd and other ecological values and land uses and ensuring that herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging department of conservation has since 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of kaimanawas to keep herd population around a target level of 500 horses target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009 these horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes a main reason for strict population control is to protect habitat in which they live this habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered which kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing these plants include herbs grasses sedges flowers and mistletoes among these are a very rare tussock grass a vulnerable mistletoe and a possibly locally extinct sand iris 2009 culling of population removed 230 horses from herd largest culling since beginning of program with homes found for 85 of horses removed conservation of these horses is an important matter to public and between 1990 and 2003 new zealand minister for conservation received more public comments on kaimanawa horse than on any other subject in this period more than 1 400 requests for information and letters were received with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997 this was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996 due to public opposition shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997 in 1997 around 1 069 horses were removed from range and adopted reducing main herd to around 500 and reducing their range to around 25 000 ha from around 70 000 since 1993 a total of around 2 800 horses have been removed from range only one injury resulting in death of a horse is known to have occurred united nations food and agricultural organization lists kaimanawa horses as a herd of special genetic value that can be compared with other groups of feral horses such as new forest ponies assateague ponies wild mustangs and with free living zebras kaimanawas are of special value because of their low rate of interaction with humans this lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics which is of special interest to researchers between 1994 and 1997 students from massey university studied a population of around 400 kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics a 2000 study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in kaimanawa horse herds only two stallions highest in herd hierarchy mate with herd females this differs from other feral horse herds some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares while others have several stallions that
