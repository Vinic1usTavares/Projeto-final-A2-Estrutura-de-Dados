wood stork mycteria americana is a large american wading bird in stork family ciconiidae it was formerly called wood ibis though it is not an ibis it is found in subtropical and tropical habitats in americas including caribbean in south america it is resident but in north america it may disperse to as far as south america originally described by carl linnaeus in 1758 this stork likely evolved in tropical regions head and neck are bare of feathers and dark grey in colour plumage is mostly white with exception of tail and some of wing feathers which are black with a greenish purplish sheen juvenile differs from adult with former having a feathered head and a yellow bill compared to black adult bill sexes are similar habitat of wood stork can vary but it must have a tropical or subtropical climate with fluctuating water levels in diameter nest is found in trees especially mangroves and those of genus taxodium usually surrounded by water or over water wood stork nests colonially nest itself is made from sticks and greenery during breeding season which is initiated when water levels drop and can occur anytime between november and august a single clutch of three to five eggs is laid these are incubated for around 30 days and chicks hatch altricial they fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching although only about 31 of nests fledge a chick in any given year with most chicks dying during their first two weeks despite being watched by an adult during that time chicks are fed fish of increasing size diet of adult changes throughout year during dry season fish and insects are eaten compared to addition of frogs and crabs during wet season because it forages by touch it needs shallow water to effectively catch food this is also reason why wood stork breeds when water levels start to fall globally wood stork is considered to be of least concern by international union for conservation of nature this is due to its large range in united states on other hand it is considered to be threatened predators of wood stork include raccoons which predate chicks northern crested caracaras which prey on eggs and other birds of prey which feed on both eggs and chicks hunting and egg collecting by humans has been implicated as a factor in decline of south american wood storks humans also cause nest failures through ecotourism although observation through binoculars about away does not have a large effect on nesting success in both north and south america habitat alteration has caused wood stork to decline with levee and drainage systems in everglades causing a shift in timing of breeding and thus a decrease in breeding success taxonomy and etymology wood stork was first formally described and given its binomial name mycteria americana by linnaeus in 1758 linnaeus based his description on a misplaced account and illustration in historia naturalis 1648 of jabiru guacu linnaeus also described tantalus loculator which was proven to also apply to jabiru guacu after m americana based on a 1731 illustration of wood stork by mark catesby under name of wood pelican since these binomials referred to same species m americana and t loculator are synonymous but m americana takes priority as it occurs before t loculator accepted genus name derives from greek meaning snout and species name references distribution of this stork this species seems to have evolved in tropical regions its north american presence probably postdates last ice age a fossil fragment from touro passo formation found at touro passo rio grande do sul brazil might be of living species it is at most from late pleistocene age a few 10 000s of years ago north american fossils from that time are of an extinct larger relative m wetmorei which would be distinguished from wood on basis of size and on basis of m wetmorei s less curved mandible this was probably a sister species both occurred sympatrically on cuba at end of pleistocene of extant members of genus mycteria this bird is basal to clade yellow billed stork which is itself basal to milky stork and painted stork this phylogeny is based on a 1996 study that sequenced b chromosome and then utilized dna dna hybridization to find relations between storks likely because of its decurved bill wood stork has formerly been called wood ibis although it is not an ibis it also has been given name of american wood stork because it is found in americas regional names include and preacher description left upright thumb wood stork s head much resembles that of an ibis adult wood stork is a large bird which stands

grey black downward curved bill is long and very wide at base plumage is mostly white with and tail being black and having a greenish and purplish iridescence legs and feet are dark and flesh coloured toes are pink during breeding season sexes are similar thumb two wood stork chicks at their nest newly hatched chicks have a sparse coat of grey down that is replaced by a dense wooly and white down in about 10 days chicks grow fast being about half height of adults in three to four weeks by sixth and seventh weeks plumage on head and neck turns smokey grey when fledged they resemble adult differing only in that they have a feathered head and a yellow bill distribution and habitat this is a subtropical and tropical species which breeds in much of south america central america and caribbean wood stork is only stork that breeds in north america in united states there are small breeding populations in florida georgia and carolinas in south america it is found south to northern argentina some populations in north america disperse after breeding frequently to south america this stork is able to adapt to a variety of tropical and subtropical wetland habitats having fluctuating water levels as that initiates breeding it nests in trees that are over water or surrounded by water in freshwater habitats it primarily nests in forests dominated by trees of genus taxodium in usa while in estuaries it generally nests on trees in mangrove forests to feed wood stork uses freshwater marshes in habitats with an abundance of taxodium trees while in areas with mangrove forests it uses brackish water areas with more lakes attract feeding on lake stream and river edges behaviour breeding right thumb nesting colony in georgia united states a resident breeder in lowland wetlands with trees wood stork builds a large stick nest in a tree in freshwater habitats it prefers to nest in trees that are larger in diameter it nests colonially with up to 25 nests in one tree height of these nests is variable with some nests located in shorter mangrove trees being at heights of about compared to a height of about for taller mangrove trees for taxodium trees it generally nests near top branches frequently between above ground on tree itself forks of large limbs or places where multiple branches cross are usually chosen nest itself is built by male from sticks and green twigs collected from colony and surrounding area greenery usually starts to be added before eggs are laid but after main structure of twigs is completed frequency at which it is added decreases after eggs hatch this greenery functions to help insulate nest when complete nest is about in diameter with a central green area having an average diameter of about thickness of edge of nest usually measures from thumb left wood storks copulating wood storks without a nest occasionally try to take over others nests such nest take overs are performed by more than one bird young and eggs are thrown out of nest within about 15 minutes if only one stork is attending nest when it is forced out then it usually waits for its mate to try to take nest back over breeding is initiated by a drop in water level combined with an increased density of fish with former likely triggering latter this is because a decrease in water level and an increased density of fish allows for an adequate amount of food for nestlings this can occur anytime between november and august after it starts breeding takes about four months to complete this bird lays one clutch of three to five cream coloured eggs that are about in size these eggs are usually laid one to two days apart and incubated for 27 to 32 days by both sexes this incubation period starts when first egg is laid during first week of incubation parents do not go far from colony with exception of short trips to forage drink and collect nesting material carried out by non incubating bird after first week non incubating bird spends less time in colony although eggs are never left unattended after a few hours of incubation this bird sometimes takes a break to stretch preen itself rearrange nest material or turn eggs eggs hatch in order in which they were laid with an interval of a few days between when each egg hatches thumb eggs of wood stork chicks hatch altricial unable to move and weigh an average of they are brooded for first week after hatching and after that when it is raining and at night chicks are not left alone until at least three weeks of age with one parent foraging while other guards nest and chicks when chicks are at least three weeks old they are large enough to stay and protect nest this coincides with chicks getting more aggressive when presented with foreign objects or organisms they fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching and reach sexual maturity at four years of age although they usually do not successfully fledge chicks until their fifth year of age hatching success percentage of birds that had at least one egg that hatched in a year of wood stork is around 62 this can vary widely though with colonies ranging from about 26 to 89 hatching success period when chicks are most vulnerable to death is from hatching to when they are two weeks old overall about 31 of nests produce at least one fledged bird raccoons and caracaras especially northern crested caracaras are prominent predators of eggs and chicks other causes of nesting failure is falling of nests thus breaking eggs inside this can be caused by many events most prominent being poor nest construction and fights between adults feeding during dry season wood stork eats mostly fish supplemented by insects during wet season on other hand fish make up about half diet crabs make up about 30 and insects and frogs make up rest wood stork eats larger fish more often than smaller fish even in some cases where latter is more abundant it is estimated that an adult wood stork needs about per day to sustain itself for a whole family it is estimated that about are needed per breeding season thumb left a wood stork foraging wood stork usually forages in flocks when not breeding and alone and in small groups when it is breeding in dry season this bird generally forages by slowly walking forward with its bill submerged in water while groping for food during wet season this method is used about 40 of time to catch food during this period foot stirring where stork walks very slowly with bill in water while pumping its foot up and down before every step is used about 35 of time both these hunting methods are non visual because of its non visual foraging methods wood stork requires shallow water and a high density of fish to forage successfully water that it forages in during dry season averages about in depth while during wet season water usually is about deep in dry season this stork prefers to forage in waters with no emergent vegetation whereas in wet season it prefers areas with vegetation emerging between above surface on average this bird can travel over to reach foraging sites lending it access to a wide variety of habitats both parents feed chicks by regurgitating food onto nest floor chicks are mainly fed fish that are between in length with length of fish usually increasing as chicks get older amount of food that chicks get changes over time with more being fed daily from hatching to about 22 days when food intake levels off this continues until about 45 days when food consumption starts to decrease overall a chick eats about before it fledges flight thumb a wood stork in flight when flying this bird utilizes two different techniques when it is not sufficiently warm and clear such as in late afternoon or on cloudy days this stork alternates between flapping its wings and gliding for short periods of time when it is warm and clear this bird glides after it gains an altitude of at least through continuously flapping its wings it can then glide for distances ranging from it does not have to flap its wings during this time because warm thermals are strong enough to support its weight because of energy that is conserved by soaring this stork usually uses this method to fly to more distant areas it flies with its neck outstretched and its legs and feet trailing behind it when flying to foraging areas wood stork averages a speed of about in flapping flight it does and about by gliding excretion and thermoregulation thumb a wood stork shading its young during breeding season wood stork commonly defecates over edge of its nest while chicks usually defecate inside method of defecation of adult differs based on temperature normally it excretes by leaning forward and slightly raising its tail with waste either going straight down or slightly backwards when it is hot though adult takes a different position quickly moving its tail downwards and forwards while twisting its body around to aim at a leg that is bent backwards this is called urohidrosis which leg is aimed at is alternated excrement aimed at legs is fluid and watery it generally hits legs around middle of unfeathered tibia and runs down leg as it is being directed by scales this results in evaporation making this a method of thermoregulation temperature at which this starts is slightly above threshold for panting latter of which takes place at temperatures of about and above compared to normal body temperature of about in hot weather breeding adults will also shade their chicks with their wings predators and parasites raccoons are predators of wood stork chicks especially during dry periods where water beneath nesting trees dries up where it occurs crested caracara is a significant predator of eggs other caracaras and hawks and vultures also prey on both eggs and chicks in united states haemoproteus a blood protozoan can be found in subadult and adult wood storks other species of haemoproteus also infect wood storks in costa rica in addition to a nematode found in gizzard of wood stork status globally wood stork is considered least concern by international union for conservation of nature due to its large range in united states this bird is considered to be threatened this is a recovery from its former status as endangered which it held from 1984 to 2014 because of a decline in its population caused by habitat loss and drought similarly in state of santa catarina brazil its decline seems to have been reversed after an absence between late 1960s and mid 1990s species is now again regularly encountered there in particular in river region it is likely that parana river region s wetlands served as a stronghold of species from where it is now re colonizing some of its former haunts threats disturbance by tourists can have an effect on nesting success with a study finding that nests that had boats passing by them within about had an average of 0 1 chicks fledging compared to normal rate for that area of about 0 9 chicks fledging per nest pedestrians watching from a distance of at least did not significantly affect nesting success in everglades levee and drainage systems have caused timing of water fluctuations to change thus shifting timing of nesting and consequently a decrease in population references external links wood stork species account cornell lab of ornithology wood stork mycteria americana usgs patuxent bird identification infocenter florida
