dark shyshark or pretty happy haploblepharus pictus is a species of catshark belonging to family scyliorhinidae endemic to temperate waters off southern namibia and western south africa it is benthic in nature and inhabits shallow inshore waters and favors rocky reefs and kelp forests growing to long this small stocky shark has a wide flattened head with a rounded snout and a large flap of skin extending from before nostrils to mouth its dorsal coloration is extremely variable and may feature black edged orange to blackish saddles and or white spots on a light brown to nearly black background when threatened dark shyshark curls into a ring with its tail covering its eyes hence name shyshark it preys mainly on small crustaceans bony fishes and molluscs reproduction is oviparous and proceeds throughout year females lay two egg cases at a time which hatch after 6 10 months this harmless species is of little commercial significance due to its small size it is frequently caught by recreational fishers and persecuted as a pest international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed dark shyshark under least concern as it is common and does not appear to be substantially threatened by fishing or habitat degradation taxonomy and phylogeny german physicians and biologists johannes peter muller and friedrich gustav jakob henle originally described dark shyshark in their 1838 41 systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen based on five specimens caught off cape of good hope and deposited in rijksmuseum van historie in leiden netherlands because of shark s ornate coloration they gave it specific epithet from latin for painted originally placed in now obsolete genus scyllium subsequent authors moved this species to genus haploblepharus coined by american zoologist samuel garman in 1913 dark shyshark was often regarded to be same as shyshark h edwardsii until 1975 with publication of a j bass jeanette d aubrey and nat s review of southern african sharks it continues to be confused for other three shyshark species because of its extremely variable coloration common name pretty happy happy refers to genus name haploblepharus was recently introduced to public as an easily remembered alternative to colloquial names shyshark and doughnut which can apply to several species and have confounded research efforts brett human s 2006 phylogenetic analysis based on three mitochondrial dna genes found that dark shyshark and brown shyshark h fuscus are sister species and that two make up more derived clade within genus description thumb left identifying traits of dark shyshark include its wide flattened head broadly rounded snout and ornate coloration reaching no more than long dark shyshark differs from other in that it is slender bodied when juvenile and stocky bodied when adult its head is short wide and flattened with a bluntly rounded snout and very large nostrils anterior rims of nostrils bear greatly enlarged lobes of skin which are fused into a single flap that reaches mouth flap conceals nasal excurrent openings and a pair of grooves that run between them and mouth large horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes protective third eyelids and have strong ridges beneath mouth is short but wide and bears furrows at corners extending onto both jaws there are 45 83 upper and 47 75 lower tooth rows each tooth has a long central cusp flanked by a pair of smaller cusplets five pairs of gill slits are located fairly high on body two dorsal fins are of nearly equal size and placed far back on body with first originating over latter third of pelvic fin bases and second over latter half of anal fin base pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded males have stout claspers pelvic and anal fins are about as large as dorsal fins broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of total body length and has a strong notch near tip of upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe skin is thick and covered by well calcified arrowhead shaped dermal denticles coloration of dark shyshark is highly variable and particular individuals can resemble any of other shyshark species background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above transitioning abruptly to white or cream below sometimes with dark blotches beneath paired fins there may be 6 8 orange brown or blackish variably shaped saddles along back and tail edged more or less obviously in black there may also be white spots within or within and between saddles distribution and habitat thumb left a dark shyshark amongst coral in false bay south africa range of dark shyshark is restricted to coastal waters of southern africa from north of luderitz in southern namibia to east of storms river mouth in eastern cape province of south africa it is abundant particularly west of cape agulhas this species is a bottom dweller found close inshore from intertidal zone to a depth of it prefers rocky reefs and kelp forests but also presumably traverses sandy flats in between patches of more suitable habitat as this shark is not known to travel long distances there is likely subpopulation differentiation across parts of its range biology and ecology dark shyshark is a generalist predator whose main food sources are in descending order of importance small benthic crustaceans bony fishes and molluscs larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans polychaete worms and echinoderms are also taken on occasion and algae may be swallowed incidentally this species is preyed upon by broadnose sevengill shark notorynchus cepedianus and potentially also other large fishes and marine mammals when threatened it adopts a characteristic defense posture in which it curls into a ring with its tail over its eyes this behavior likely makes shark harder to swallow and is origin of common names shyshark and doughnut in captivity whelks and b have been documented piercing egg cases of this species and extracting yolk a known parasite of dark shyshark is trypanosoma which infests blood thumb egg case of dark shyshark is purse shaped and uniformly brown like other members of its genus dark shyshark is oviparous adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts there appears to be no distinct breeding season and reproduction occurs year round females produce mature eggs two at a time one per oviduct eggs are enclosed in purse shaped capsules measuring long and across each capsule is plain amber to dark brown in color and bears thin coiled tendrils at four corners in one observation of an egg that hatched after 104 days developing embryo had external gill filaments until it was 50 days old and completely absorbed its yolk sac shortly before hatching eggs in nature typically hatch in 6 10 months with newly hatched shark measuring long both sexes grow at approximately same rate reaching sexual maturity at around 15 years of age mature males and females range from and long respectively maximum lifespan is 25 years human interactions dark shyshark poses no danger to humans and is too small to be of commercial importance many are hooked by sport fishers casting from shore who regard shark as a pest and often kill it it may also be caught by subsistence fishers and in lobster traps and bottom trawls though not in substantial quantities this shark occasionally finds its way into aquarium trade though there is no direct fishing for this purpose as dark shyshark remains common and does not seem heavily threatened by human activity it has been assessed as least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn its small range does raise concerns that an increase in regional fishing pressure or habitat degradation could impact entire population references category haploblepharus category fish described in 1838
