management agency camp michael riley production manager for episode contacted newnan police department to collaborate with producers because of large size of filming location riley s production company notified surrounding neighborhoods to ease inconvenience save last one marked final appearance of pruitt taylor vince whose character was killed off in episode after shane shoots him this subsequently marks a turning point for him as a false protagonist in an interview with entertainment weekly writer robert kirkman explained reaction of jon bernthal to particular scene jon bernthal is a tremendous talent and he s got a lot of professionalism a lot of actors came in to room as we were starting this season and bernthal was one of those actors he was aware of a lot of things that were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it it was nice being able to run through scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character because actors a lot of times think about their characters more than writers because they re focused on that single character for months of their lives if not years he was all prepared for this kirkman expressed that death of otis was a somewhat justifiable homicide and retorted that otis was slowing him down and carl s life hangs in balance he continued it s walking dead and we re existing in that gray area and we re really pushing boundaries of that but at end of day shane shot that guy and left him for dead and ran off it s a pretty dark moment and it informs shane s character and sets up a lot of things that are going to be happening moving forward reception ratings save last one was originally broadcast on october 30 2011 in united states on amc

appreciated character development of shane jon bernthal pictured save last one was critically acclaimed by television critics ign s eric goldman praised episode giving it a nine out of ten signifying an amazing rating he opined that it was his favorite episode since series pilot episode days gone bye and added that it had scary zombie scenes good action interesting character interaction and a revelation at end that gave us a whole lot to process john serba of grand rapids press was split on save last one while asserting that it was imminently watchable he felt that episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized dialogue serba wrote show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to development of its characters it needs to do a better job of biding its time between crowd pleasing zombie attacks hitfix s alan sepinwall echoed similar thoughts opining characters need more depth show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow burning character study in context of a zombie apocalypse and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain eating action and characters need to be more complex than they ve been shown to be so far baltimore sun journalist andrew conrad commended episode citing that episodic pace was faster than preceding episode josh wigler of mtv opined tonight s episode was all about pairs shane and otis two soldiers in a foxhole rick and lori two parents at odds over how to handle their son s failing condition glenn and maggie two strangers desperate to make a connection andrea and daryl two opposites trying to find a reason to move on great scenes with all of these duos and it really goes to show just how fantastic walking dead cast is both in loud and quiet moments zack handlen from a v club awarded episode a b grade and felt that episode was superior to previous episode in contrast aaron rutkoff of wall street journal was less enthusiastic about episode expressing truth be told after three episodes very little has happened so far this season tv fanatic sean mckenna asserted that despite not having any direction save last one managed to retain tension and action that makes this show a thrill ride every week he added i m sure for some slow pace in real time is something of a bother but for me it adds to intensity of characters situation and show itself mckenna ultimately gave episode a 4 5 out of 5 stars similarly morgan jeffrey of digital spy stated that episode was strongest installment of season as well as amongst series best installments critics praised character development of shane in episode as well as execution of otis nate rawlings of time felt that it was a dark moment for series and felt that it added anticipation to future development he wrote at some point shane will have to come clean with rick about what happened to otis given rick s extremely rigid morale sic code and shane s now demonstrated willingness to do whatever it takes to survive showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males rick shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival mark maurer of star ledger opined that both multi layered opening illustrates how shane s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior handlen appreciated character development of shane writing shane has long been dark horse of group one most likely to go off morality reservation and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness it s not subtlest moment but given how friendly and cool otis was and given how well two seemed to be working together it s a strong twist he added that because of death of otis show now has a sense of direction his decision to sacrifice otis is easy enough to rationalize somebody had to get back for carl s sake shane was faster and both of them probably weren t going to make it that s beauty of it in a certain light he made right choice morgan jeffrey wrote this week s installment delivered even more scares than usual shane s escape from high school was almost unbearably tense references external links save last one at amc category 2011 american television
