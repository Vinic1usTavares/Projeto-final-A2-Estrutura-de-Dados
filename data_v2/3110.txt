lightning bolt is tenth studio album by american rock band pearl jam produced by long time pearl jam collaborator brendan o brien album was released in united states on october 15 2013 through band s own monkeywrench records with republic records handling international release band began composing new songs in 2011 album s first recording sessions took place in early 2012 before musicians decided to take a break as all band members got into side projects afterwards work on lightning bolt only resumed in march 2013 music for lightning bolt has a harder rock sound with longer songs in contrast to predecessor backspacer 2009 and lyrics convey singer eddie vedder s feelings on aging and mortality preceded by a promotional campaign focusing on pearl jam s website and social network profiles and two moderately successful singles mind your manners and sirens lightning bolt was well received by critics who considered album an effective return to band s old sound and topped charts in united states canada and australia production soon after completing backspacer in 2009 pearl jam and producer brendan o brien intended to soon repeat experience given that according to o brien we had a really good time doing it in 2011 amidst preparations for documentary pearl jam twenty and its accompanying tour band recorded some tracks with o brien at los angeles henson recording studios with song ole being issued as a free download o brien considered that studio helped band get to a submarine mentality and everybody going into ship together and bassist jeff ament added that working outside band s hometown seattle led musicians to work more efficiently after some time developing demos musicians returned to henson in march 2012 recording seven songs before band decided to take a break as according to guitarist mike mccready we had to take some time to figure out what we wanted to do guitarist stone gossard added that despite bandmembers thinking that after productive sessions album was nearing completion eventually they considered tracks didn t feel strong enough for a record work on album resumed only in march 2013 as bandmembers regrouped with new compositions mostly done separately in each member s home studio though mccready at times worked along with drummer matt cameron before group reunited to finish songs together o brien attributed long break to band s busy schedule as musicians got into side projects after putting pearl jam album on hold singer eddie vedder started a solo tour drummer matt cameron returned to soundgarden guitarist stone gossard rejoined side project brad ament recorded solo album while my heart beats and started project and mccready formed group walking papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of mad season reiff corbin interview mike mccready on mad season reissue and new pearl jam premier guitar march 6 2013 vedder still considered that all diversions helped pearl jam to have more importance placed on records and focusing on making best album possible like with previous records songs had their first recordings with all musicians playing together though o brien added that with lightning bolt we don t keep as much of live recordings as we used to guest musicians include o brien himself at keyboards long time keyboardist boom gaspar and violinist ann marie calhoun after six weeks of new recording sessions album was mixed in seattle at band s desire with process taking place in studio x composition in contrast to short tracks of backspacer lightning bolt features longer songs and a more experimental sound that mccready declared to aim for a logical extension of what backspacer was stone gossard added that band being more comfortable with composing and recording process lead to a slight return to some of more sort of peculiar things we did say between no code and binaural mccready said that there s a pink floyd vibe to some of it there s a punk rock edge to other stuff with lead singles mind your manners and sirens being inspired by dead kennedys and a concert in roger waters wall live respectively neil young was noted as an influence in yellow moon o brien considered track listing to have a lot of drama from intensity of musicians work but that band itself were united and enjoying themselves during creation process according to gossard album s simpler arrangements out songwriting and less production than in backspacer made for songs that were easier to learn and play live one of tracks sleeping by myself had been previously featured in vedder s 2011 solo album ukulele songs o brien suggested re recording as he thought that composition was a pearl jam song as far as i m concerned another pendulum was originally composed during backspacer sessions while writing lyrics to lightning bolt vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his feelings compared to word games of previous pearl jam albums songs discuss lasting relationships bad faith getaway mind your manners state of world infallible and life s transience pendulum which vedder summed up as same mysteries that i ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now gossard explained that reflective tone was indicative of bandmembers age at 40 something almost 50 something you re looking at life through your kids eyes through filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long through filter of your parents getting older and passing of friends and relatives relationships and all that they encompass difficulties of them and sacrifices you make in them and also joy they bring you vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality but relented given he felt that death is everywhere and writing about death would help getting through it as living to day you die and being cognizant of end you might lead a more appreciative life one of compositions about theme was future days which discusses loss of vedder s friend dennis who accidentally drowned in 2012 in songs also owed to vedder being a father as singer detailed that it s going to be their world and what is their future it feels like there is a lot that can be lost in next 50 years if people don t pay attention release and

packaging artwork for lightning bolt was made by don pendleton who is best known as a skateboard graphic artist ament bought some of pendleton s paintings in 2008 or 2009 and later asked artist to do a logo for their upcoming album which would later develop into all illustrations bassist then kept in contact with pendleton to guide his work sending him song lyrics some sketches he had done and an unmastered copy of album intention was to make something that was a total package according to pendleton who said that there was an attempt to bring back these classic lps in days where you would read lyrics you related band to imagery to song to lyrics pendleton tried to keep it iconic with some symbols but also really heavy with archetypes given body of images could be used consistently with all of promotion while some of graphics evolved directly from ament s sketches pendleton took some inspiration from his past work such as a series of skateboards he painted based around icons and logos and very first image sent to ament an eye with a lightning bolt which pendleton made back in 2006 for a failed project that evolved into album cover said cover was painted by hand as pendleton wanted something so geometric that there would be some flaws in it especially compared to vector computer stuff republic records art designer joe then handled presentation with particular detail in vinyl packaging pendleton also painted ament s bass pearl jam themed shirts for volcom and posters for barclays center concerts in october 2013 at 57th annual grammy awards in february 2015 album won award for best recording package critical reception upon its release lightning bolt was met with generally positive reviews from music critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album received an average score of 73 based on 33 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave album four out of five stars stating that band seemed more settled and comfortable while accentuating big riffs and bigger emotions crafting songs without a worry as to whether they re hip or not and most importantly enjoying deep rooted nervy arena rock that is uniquely their own jim farber of new york daily news gave album four out of five stars commenting that while some key sounds and sensibilities and uplifting lyrics were unlike pearl jam s earlier style music in lightning bolt marked a return to thick bottomed rhythms hard nosed guitars and darkened tone of classic pearl jam compared to predecessor backspacer cole waterman of popmatters gave album an eight out of ten praising pearl jam thriving in their persona building on what worked in past without trying to copy it while adding new elements to mix and feeling that despite closing songs get ting monotonous in their united balladry future days was a good album closer comparing it to tom waits dom lawson of guardian gave album three out of five stars describing it as a sturdy return to great form tom willmott of independent gave album three out of five stars considering lightning bolt to offer a broad range of styles and praising rock focused tracks will hermes of rolling stone gave album three and a half stars out of five saying that eddie vedder s earnest lyrics and vocals made for compelling tracks and that musicians overthink and overreach josh modell of a v club gave album a b complaining about excessive length and a couple too many songs that revisit past without any fresh insight while feeling that album still feels fresher and more relevant than world at large might expect at this point marc hirsh of boston globe considered album to showcase that pearl jam has plenty of spark left comparing it to both dense eclecticism of band s own vitalogy 1994 and who s solidity of purpose some reviewers still felt that lightning bolt was not up to standards set by band s previous work blue sullivan of slant magazine gave album three out of five stars saying that album had a familiar spark and was dragged down by pearl jam s antiseptic 70s album rock radio conservatism along with frontman eddie vedder s ham fisted lyrics ultimately concluding that lightning bolt is no masterwork years removed from raw emotion and desperate appetites of youth pearl jam has slipped into alt rock elder statesmanship as one would a comfortable old sweater rob harvilla of spin gave album a six out of ten describing it as far from an implosion far from spectacular criticizing focus on calm songs and considering that backspacer barked louder and bit harder overall in his 5 0 out of 10 review for pitchfork stuart berman also had a negative reaction to what he described as centerpiece ballads that tread on odious lite fm territory and forcefully tip scales from poignant to maudlin philip cosores of paste gave album a 4 0 out of 10 saying album does grow on listener as vedder s voice and band s seeming ambivalence to all musical trends and developments outside of them is strangely comforting and maybe some of these songs will come alive when performed but there is not a single one to love in set essentially cruise control is running onward with disregard for all maintenance and repairs that an engine needs and result is worst album of their career commercial performance lightning bolt became pearl jam s fifth
