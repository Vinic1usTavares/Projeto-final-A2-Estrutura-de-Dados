city and south london railway c slr was first deep level underground tube railway in world and first major railway to use electric traction railway was originally intended for cable hauled trains but owing to bankruptcy of cable contractor during construction a system of electric traction using electric locomotives an experimental technology at time was chosen instead when opened in 1890 line had six stations and ran for length of line calculated from distances given at in a pair of tunnels between city of london and stockwell passing under river thames diameter of tunnels restricted size of trains and small carriages with their high backed seating were nicknamed padded cells railway was extended several times north and south eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of from camden town in north london to morden in surrey although c slr was well used low ticket prices and construction cost of extensions placed a strain on company s finances in 1913 c slr became part of underground group of railways and in 1920s it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of group s railways charing cross euston hampstead railway forming a single london underground line called morden edgware line in 1933 c slr and rest of underground group was taken into public ownership today its tunnels and stations form bank branch of northern line from camden town to kennington and southern leg of line from kennington to morden establishment in november 1883 notice was given that a private bill was to be presented to parliament for construction of city of london southwark subway cl ss promoter of bill and engineer of proposed railway was james henry greathead who had in 1869 70 constructed tower subway using same tunnelling shield segmented cast iron tube method proposed for cl ss railway was to run from elephant and castle in southwark south london under river thames to king william street in city of london tracks were to be in twin tunnels in diameter running for a distance of bill received royal assent as city of london and southwark subway act 1884 on 28 july 1884 section 5 of act stated in 1886 a further bill was submitted to parliament to extend tunnels south from elephant and castle to kennington and stockwell this received assent on 12 july 1887 as city of london and southwark subway kennington extensions c act 1887 allowing construction of extension to be added to work on original route which had begun in 1886 tunnels on this section were of a slightly larger diameter and extended line by a further before railway opened a further bill received assent granting permission to continue line south to clapham common act was published on 25 july 1890 as city and south london railway act 1890 also effecting a change of company s name haulage and infrastructure thumb 400px a picture of a city and south london railway train from illustrated london news 1890 given small dimension of tunnels as well as difficulty of providing sufficient ventilation steam power as used on london s other underground railways was not feasible for a deep tube railway like greathead s earlier tower subway cl ss was intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling cable through tunnels at a steady speed section 5 of 1884 act specified that patent cable tramway corporation owned rights to hallidie cable car system first invented and used in san francisco in 1873 trains were attached to cable with clamps which would be opened and closed at stations allowing carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop cable or to interfere with other trains sharing cable there were to be two independent endless cables one between city station and elephant and castle moving at and other between elephant and castle and stockwell where gradient was less at however additional length of tunnel permitted by supplementary acts challenged practicality of cable system it is reported that this problem with cl ss contributed to bankruptcy of cable company in 1888 however electric motor traction had been considered all along and much engineering progress had been made since tunnel s construction had begun in 1886 so cl ss chairman charles grey mott decided to switch to electric traction other cable operated systems using hallidie patents continued to be designed such as glasgow subway which opened in 1896 thumb left c slr locomotive number 13 at london transport museum depot in 2005 solution adopted was electrical power provided via a third rail this is now a fourth rail beneath train but offset to west of centre for clearance reasons although use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during previous decade and small scale operations had been implemented c slr was first major railway in world to adopt it as a means of motive power system operated using electric locomotives built by mather platt collecting a voltage of 500 volts actually 500 volts in northbound tunnel and 500 volts in southbound from third rail and pulling several carriages a depot and generating station were constructed at stockwell owing to limited capacity of generators stations were originally illuminated by gas depot was on surface and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although following a runaway accident a lift was soon installed in practice most rolling stock and locomotives went to surface only for major maintenance to avoid need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings tunnels were bored below roadways where construction could be carried out without charge at northern end of railway need to pass deep beneath bed of river thames and medieval street pattern of city of london constrained arrangement of tunnels on approach to king william street station because of proximity of station to river steeply inclined tunnels were required to west of station because of narrow street under which they ran they were bored one above other rather than side by side as elsewhere outbound tunnel was lower and steeper of two tunnels converged immediately before station which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side other terminus at stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform opening thumb kennington station only one of original station buildings not replaced or substantially altered railway was officially opened by edward prince of wales later edward vii on 4 november 1890 and was opened to public on 18 december 1890 initially it had stations at stockwell oval now oval kennington elephant castle borough king william street original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages thirty two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at ends leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting it was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in tunnels so only windows were in a narrow band high up in carriage sides gate men rode on carriage platforms to operate lattice gates and announce station names to passengers because of their claustrophobic interiors carriages soon became known as padded cells unlike other railways c slr had no ticket classes or paper tickets when railway began operations a flat fare of two pence collected at a turnstile was charged despite cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services railway attracted 5 1 million passengers in 1891 its first year of operation to alleviate overcrowding fleet of rolling stock was enlarged extensions to clapham common and angel 1890 1901 shortly before it opened to public c slr gave notice of its intention to submit another private bill to parliament to construct a new line from its northern terminus at king william street towards islington because of awkward arrangement of king william street station extension was not to be connected directly to existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between separate lines bill was rejected on grounds that extension failed to make a connection to existing line in november 1891 c slr published details of a revised bill for extension to islington company had recognised deficiencies of its king william street station and just a year after line had opened planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass problematic northern section near borough station new tunnels would branch off via a new station to form an interchange with se cr and lb scr at london bridge mainline station tunnels would then pass to east of london bridge north through city of london to angel following a delay during which a joint select committee reviewed proposals of several new underground railways city and south london railway act 1893 received royal assent on 24 august 1893 act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant an extension of time to build southern extension to clapham construction of two authorised extensions was delayed while funds were raised and plans were finalised between 1895 and 1898 three further bills were put before parliament to keep permissions alive and obtain additional approvals 1895 an extension of time for 1890 act and to allow for a new approach tunnel to be built into king william street station approved as city and south london railway act 1895 on 14 april 1895 1896 an extension of time for 1893 act and changes to construction of bank station approved as city and south london railway act 1896 on 14 august 1896 1898 an extension of time for 1896 act plans to add sidings to southern extension at clapham common and plans to sell king william street station and its approach tunnels to newly proposed city and brixton railway c br approved as city and south london railway act 1898 on 23 may 1898 thumb 200px narrow central platform at clapham common with tracks on both sides dates from 1900 extension new tunnels permitted by 1895 act enabled track layout at king william street station to be modified to a single central platform with a track each side this was opened as a temporary measure while funds for extensions were raised finance was eventually obtained and construction proceeded so that king william street section closed and first section of northern extension opened on 25 february 1900 with stations at london bridge bank moorgate street southern extension opened on 3 june 1900 with stations at clapham road clapham common like original stockwell station and rearranged king william street clapham road and clapham common were constructed with a single station tunnel with a central platform served by tracks on each side work continued on rest of northern extension city and south london railway act 1900 approved on 25 may 1900 gave permission to enlarge station tunnel at angel to a diameter of and rest of extension opened on 17 november 1901 with stations at old street city road closed 1922 angel extension to euston 1901 1907 thumb 300px geographic route map of city south london railway despite technical innovations of railway and large passenger demand c slr was not particularly profitable and rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on finances dividends were low and declining 2 in 1898 1 in 1899 and 1 in 1900 and company had been accused of extravagance for abandonment of king william street station in an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds next bill for an extension of line was submitted in november 1900 by a notionally separate company islington and euston railway i er albeit one that shared its chairman with c slr proposed railway was to run from as yet unfinished c slr station at angel to main line stations at king s cross st pancras and euston i er bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by successful opening of central london railway clr in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another parliamentary joint committee in 1901 bill was approved but time taken for committee s review meant that it had to be resubmitted for 1902 parliamentary session in 1902 session bill was considered again but was subject to opposition from one of london s other underground railways metropolitan railway mr which considered proposed extension to be a threat to its service between king s cross and moorgate i er also submitted a petition to allow c slr to take over powers of railway if approved committee reversed its earlier decision and rejected bill in november 1902 c slr submitted a bill in its own name for euston extension as well as authority to take over dormant powers of c br at euston railway would have an interchange with planned but not yet built charing cross euston hampstead railway cce hr intention for c br powers was to adapt them to provide a new station at king william street which would have pedestrian subway connections to c slr s bank station and district railway s dr s monument station a third pair of tunnels would be constructed under thames to connect with original abandoned tunnels north of borough station and then c br route would be constructed as previously approved with connections to existing c slr route at london bridge and oval this time bill was approved and received royal assent as city and south london railway act 1903 on 11 august 1903 although c br proposals were never implemented euston extension was quickly built and opened on 12 may 1907 with stations at king s cross euston cooperation and consolidation 1907 1919 by 1907 londoners had seen network of deep tube underground railways expand from original c slr line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations these companies along with sub surface metropolitan railway and district railway criss crossed beneath city streets competing with one another for passengers as well as with new electric trams and motor buses in several cases pre opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic reduced revenues generated from lower numbers of passengers using lines made it difficult for operators to pay back capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders in an effort to improve their collective situations most of underground railways in london c slr clr great northern city railway and underground electric railways company of london uerl which operated baker street

as underground waterloo city railway operated by main line london and south western railway was only tube railway that did not participate in arrangement in 1912 c slr submitted another bill for parliamentary consideration seeking to increase its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to larger diameter used for tunnels of more recently built railways to allow larger more modern rolling stock to be used a separate bill was published at same time by london electric railway ler a company formed by uerl in 1910 through a merger of bs wr gnp br and cce hr which included plans to construct tunnels to connect c slr at euston to cce hr s station at camden town together works proposed in these bills would enable cce hr s trains to run over c slr s route and vice versa effectively combining two separate railways on 1 january 1913 uerl purchased c slr paying two shares of its own stock for three of c slr s a discount reflecting struggling financial position of older company both bills were enacted on 15 august 1913 as city and south london railway act 1913 and london electric railway act 1913 proposed extension and tunnel enlargement works were delayed by world war i and it was not until after war that works could begin reconstruction connections and extension 1919 1926 in february 1919 with war over c slr submitted a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for tunnel enlargement works approved in act of 1913 resulting act was passed on 19 august 1919 as city and south london railway act 1919 in 1920 under special wartime provisions ler was granted an extension of time to carry out works for its own 1913 act although permissions to carry out works had been renewed underground companies were not in a position to raise funds needed to pay for works construction costs had increased considerably during war years and returns produced by companies could not cover cost of repaying borrowed capital projects were made possible when government introduced trade facilities act 1921 by which treasury underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment with this support underground companies were able to obtain funds and work began on enlarging tunnels of c slr tunnels were enlarged by removing several of cast iron segments from each tunnel ring excavating a void behind to required new diameter and segments with additional packing spacers northern section of c slr between euston and moorgate was closed from 8 august 1922 but rest of line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night a collapse on 27 november 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on incomplete excavations near elephant castle station filled tunnel with soil line was briefly operated in two parts but was completely closed on 28 november 1923 euston to moorgate section reopened on 20 april 1924 along with new tunnels linking euston to camden town rest of line to clapham common reopened on 1 december 1924 at same time as tunnels were being enlarged stations were modernised with longer platforms a new tiling scheme on platform and passageway walls and new frontages to surface buildings some stations also received escalators to replace original lifts while reconstruction works were underway c slr submitted a bill in 1922 that contained proposals to extend line south from clapham common through balham and tooting to morden in tunnel from morden line was to continue on surface to sutton sharing part of route of an unbuilt railway planned from wimbledon to sutton see wimbledon and sutton railway for full details bill was enacted as city and south london railway act 1923 on 2 august 1923 parallel negotiations with southern railway over proposals curtailed extension at morden where a large new depot was constructed morden extension opened on 13 september 1926 with stations designed by charles holden at clapham south balham opened on 6 december 1926 tooting bec originally trinity road tooting broadway colliers wood south wimbledon morden also on 13 september 1926 a further connection between cce hr and c slr was opened when tunnels were brought into service from cce hr s charing cross station now embankment to kennington station latter having been rebuilt with four platforms an intermediate station was constructed at waterloo thus fully integrated combined services operated over c slr and cce hr routes using new standard stock trains on tube maps combined lines were then shown in a single colour although separate names continued in use into 1930s before introduction of northern line on 28 august 1937 names edgware highgate and morden line and morden edgware line were used in mid 1930s move to public ownership 1924 1933 despite modernisation of c slr and other improvements made to other parts of network underground railways were still struggling to make a profit underground group s ownership of highly profitable london general omnibus company lgoc since 1912 had enabled group through pooling of revenues to use profits from bus company to subsidise less profitable railways however competition from numerous small bus companies during early years of 1920s eroded profitability of lgoc and had a negative impact on profitability of whole group in an effort to protect group s income its managing director chairman lord ashfield lobbied government for regulation of transport services in london area during 1920s a series of legislative initiatives was made in this direction with ashfield and labour london county councillor later mp herbert morrison at forefront of debates as to level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought ashfield aimed for regulation that would give existing group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of lcc s tram system morrison preferred full public ownership eventually after several years of false starts a bill was announced at end of 1930 for formation of london passenger transport board a public corporation that would take control of underground group metropolitan railway as well as all buses and trams within an area designated as london passenger transport area board was a compromise public ownership but not full nationalisation and came into existence on 1 july 1933 on this date c slr and other underground companies were liquidated legacy technologies of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by c slr shaped direction of subsequent underground railways built in london c slr demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for shallow cuttings of sub surface steam operated railways instead it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on surface c slr thus encouraged construction of a network of underground railways in london far larger than might have been case otherwise size and depth of tunnels used on deep tube lines including northern line does have drawbacks tunnels have a limited loading gauge and lines suffer from overheating in summer during world war ii disused tunnels between borough and king william street stations were converted for use as an air raid shelter with entrances to shelter at king william street and at six sites south of thames of nine planned in 1960s disused tunnels were used to assist ventilation of london bridge station and all entrances bar that at 9 london bridge street were infilled with concrete it is now only possible to access tunnels from three castles house or a passage from jubilee line at london bridge most of c slr s six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during improvements to line
