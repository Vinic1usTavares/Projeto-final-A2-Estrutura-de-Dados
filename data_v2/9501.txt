usually named as instructions like to roast a pig to make sauce for a pig occasionally there is a comment as in a nice way to dress a cold fowl names of dishes are overwhelmingly in english even when

contemporary monthly review or literary journal of 1770 listed book commenting only that reviewers are sorry to own but their regard to truth obliges them to it that there are subjects with which alas

noted in 1999 that raffald distinguishes her work as purely from practice unlike books of untried recipes copied from elsewhere and that she apologises for plainness of style in her introductory letter guide observes however that this is essence of her lasting appeal and her clarity and economy with words find an echo in work of eliza acton a century later cookery writer sophie grigson wrote in independent that her mother jane made raffald s orange custards every year when seville orange season was in full swing a treat to look forward to in 2013 raffald s former workplace arley hall brought some of her recipes including lamb pie pea soup and rice pudding back to their tables general manager steve hamilton however said they would avoid raffald s turtle and calf s foot pudding
