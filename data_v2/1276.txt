within you without you it was last of harrison s three songs from beatles era that demonstrate an overt indian classical influence and are styled as indian pieces lyrics are a rendering of a poem from taoist tao te ching which he set to music on recommendation of juan mascaro a sanskrit scholar who had translated passage in his 1958 book lamps of fire harrison recorded instrumental track for inner light in bombay in january 1968 during sessions for his wonderwall music soundtrack album it is only beatles studio recording to be made outside europe and introduced indian instruments such as sarod shehnai and pakhavaj to band s sound musicians on track include aashish khan hanuman jadev and hariprasad chaurasia aside from harrison s lead vocal recorded in london beatles only contribution came in form of group backing vocals over song s final line in decade following its release song became a comparative rarity among band s recordings it has subsequently appeared on compilation albums such as rarities past masters volume two and mono masters inner light has received praise from several music critics and musicologists for its melodic qualities and its evocation of meditation experience jeff lynne and anoushka shankar performed song at concert for george tribute in november 2002 a year after harrison s death an alternative take of 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on remastered wonderwall music cd screenwriter morgan gendel named a 1992 episode of television series star trek next generation as an homage to song background and inspiration in his autobiography i me mine george harrison recalls that he was inspired to write inner light by juan mascaro a sanskrit scholar at cambridge university mascaro had taken part in a debate televised on frost programme on 4 october 1967 during which harrison and john lennon discussed merits of transcendental meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders in a subsequent letter to harrison dated 16 november mascaro expressed hope that they might meet again before beatles departed for india where group were to study meditation with their guru maharishi mahesh yogi mascaro enclosed a copy of his book lamps of fire an anthology of religious writings including from lao tzu s tao te ching having stated his admiration for spiritual message in harrison s composition within you without you mascaro enquired might it not be interesting to put into your music a few words of tao for example no 48 page 66 of lamps harrison wrote song during a period when he had undertaken his first musical project outside beatles composing soundtrack to joe massot directed film wonderwall and continued to study indian sitar partly under tutelage of ravi shankar when writing inner light he made minimal alterations to translated lao tzu text and used same title that mascaro had used in i me mine harrison says of changes required to create his second verse in original poem verse says without going out of my door i can know ways of heaven and so to prevent any misinterpretations and also to make song a bit longer i did repeat that as a second verse but made it without going out of your door you can know all things on earth without looking out of your window you can know ways of heaven so that it included everybody after within you without you inner light was second composition to fully reflect harrison s immersion in eastern spiritual concepts particularly meditation an interest that had spread to his beatles bandmates available at rock s backpages subscription required and to group s audience and peers lyrics espouse meditation as a means to genuine understanding theologian dale allison describes song as a hymn to quietism and comments that in their attempt to and disparage knowledge of external world words convey harrison s enduring worldview author john winn notes that harrison had pre empted message of inner light in an august 1967 interview when he told new york dj murray kaufman more you learn more you know that you don t know anything at all writing in his study of harrison s musical career ian inglis similarly identifies a precedent in song it s all too much where harrison sings more i learn less i know composition and musical structure left thumb 75px lute like sarod is featured throughout song inner light was harrison s third song in indian musical genre after love you to and within you without you while those earlier songs had followed hindustani north indian system of indian classical music as sitar and tabla based compositions inner light is closer in style to carnatic or south indian temple music tradition harrison s progression within genre reflected his concept for wonderwall soundtrack namely that assignment allowed him to create an anthology of indian harrison in and present a diverse range of styles and instrumentation composition is structured into three instrumental passages separated by two sections of verse buoyant mood of instrumental sections set to what author peter lavezzoli describes as a raucous 4 4 rhythm contrasts with gentle meditative portions containing verses contrast is reflected in lead instruments that harrison would use on recording whereas sarod and shehnai supported by pakhavaj are prominent during musical passages softer sounding bansuri bamboo flute and harmonium accompany singing over verses as sarod provides a response to each line of vocal in last instrumental section harrison incorporates conclusion of lao tzu s poem beginning with line arrive without travelling melody conforms to pitches of mixolydian mode or its indian equivalent khamaj thaat musicologist dominic pedler writes that tune features unusual tritone intervals which together with musical arrangement ensure that song is far removed from standard pop tunes in a further departure from harrison s previous forays into indian music both of which made extensive use of single chord drone melody allows for formal chord changes over verses dominant e major alternates with f minor before a move to a over line farther one travels less one knows in opening words without going out melody uses what pedler terms a hauntingly modal g b d tritone progression as within song s tonic key of e 3rd note heads towards flat 7th musicologist walter everett likens this ascending of diminished triad to a melodic feature in within you without you over that song s recurring phrase we were talking inner light is an example of harrison creating ambiguity about tonic key a technique that pedler recognises as a characteristic of harrison s spiritually oriented songwriting recording bombay right thumb 150px hariprasad chaurasia shown playing north indian bamboo flute known as bansuri having used london based indian musicians from asian music circle on love you to and within you without you harrison recorded inner light in india with some of country s foremost contemporary classical players in early january 1968 he travelled to hmv studios in bombay to record part of score for wonderwall much of which would appear on his debut solo album wonderwall music day after completing soundtrack recordings on 13 january harrison taped additional pieces for possible later use one of which was instrumental track for inner light five takes of song were recorded on a two track recorder musicians at sessions were recruited by das who had assisted in harrison s sitar tuition on his previous visit to bombay in 1966 and vijay dubey head of a r for hmv records in india line up on track was aashish khan sarod mahapurush misra pakhavaj hanuman jadev shehnai hariprasad chaurasia bansuri and rijram desad harmonium in lavezzoli s estimation although these instruments are more commonly associated with hindustani discipline performers play them in a south indian style which adds to carnatic identity of song recording features tabla tarang over quiet vocal interludes author simon leng refutes presence of oboe like shehnai however saying that this part was played on an a bow played string instrument as with wonderwall selections recorded at hmv harrison directed musicians but did not perform on instrumental track london harrison completed song in london during sessions for a new beatles single which was intended to cover their absence while group were in rishikesh india with maharishi once bombay recording had been transferred to four track tape harrison recorded his vocal part for inner light on 6 february at emi studios now abbey road studios lacking confidence in his ability to sing in so high a register he had to be coaxed by lennon and paul mccartney into delivering requisite performance two days later mccartney and lennon overdubbed backing vocals at very end of song over words do all without doing inner light was held in high regard by harrison s bandmates particularly mccartney and was selected as b side for forthcoming single it was first harrison composition to appear on a beatles single in addition to being only beatles studio recording made outside europe everett writes that lennon s admiration for track was evident from his subsequent creation of song julia through a very parallel process in that instance by adapting a work by kahlil gibran although harrison had served as producer at bombay session only george martin received a production credit for inner light release song was issued as b side of lady madonna on 15 march 1968 in uk with us release following three days later while chris welch of melody maker expressed doubts about hit potential of a side billboard magazine commented on aptness of inner light given band s concurrent meditation spell cash boxs reviewer wrote lyrics from transcendental meditation school and near eastern orchestrations on a very interesting coupler that could show sales as strong as lady madonna in america song charted independently on billboard hot 100 for one week placing at number 96 in australia it was listed with lady madonna as a double a side when single topped go set national chart in description of author and critic david quantick whereas lady madonna represented a departure from beatles psychedelic productions of previous year inner light was an accurate indication of group s mindset in rishikesh paul saltzman a canadian film maker who had been inspired by beatles adoption of indian musical and philosophical themes joined band at maharishi s ashram and recalls hearing song there for first time he said he found harrison s perspective on meditation profoundly moving particularly when harrison told him that while beatles had achieved wealth and fame in abundance it isn t love it isn t health it isn t peace inside is it beatles 1968 visit to rishikesh resulted in a surge of interest in indian culture and spirituality among western youth but it also marked end of band s overtly indian phase from june that year harrison abandoned his efforts to master sitar and returned to guitar as his principal instrument in an interview in september harrison discussed his renewed interest in rock music and described inner light as one of my precious things critical reception author nicholas schaffner wrote in 1977 that inner light proved to be best and last example of harrison directly incorporating indian music into beatles work schaffner paired it with within you without you as raga rock songs that feature haunting exquisitely lovely melodies and as two pieces that could have been among harrison s greatest achievements had they been made with his bandmates participation bruce eder of allmusic describes same tracks as a pair of beautiful songs that were effectively solo recordings ian macdonald likens song s studied innocence and exotic sweetness to recordings by incredible string band and concludes inner light is both spirited and charming one of its author s most attractive pieces writing for mojo magazine in 2003 john harris similarly admired it as harrison s loveliest addition of indian music to beatles repertoire in ian inglis view it is extraordinary synthesis of separate musical and lyrical traditions in this case indian instrumentation chinese philosophy and western popular music that distinguishes song harrison s uncharacteristically warm vocal weaves in and around delicate almost fragile melody to deliver a simple testimony to power of meditation with regard to song s influence inglis recognises harrison s espousal of eastern spirituality as a serious and important development that reflected popular music s increasing maturity and a statement that prepared rock audiences for later religious pronouncements by pete townshend carlos santana john mclaughlin cat stevens and bob dylan nick deriso of music website something else considers inner light to be one of its composer s most successful marriages of raga and rock and through harrison s introduction of instruments such as sarod shehnai and pakhavaj a key recording in evolution of 1980s world music genre while admiring song s transcendent qualities everett quotes ethnomusicologist david reck who wrote in 1988 most memorable is sheer simplicity and straightforwardness of haunting modal melody somehow capturing perfectly mood and truth and aphoristic essence of lyrics later releases a stereo mix of inner light was created at abbey road on 27 january 1970 for what beatles recording historian mark lewisohn terms some indefinable future use on this later mix opening instrumental section differs slightly from that on
