landing at lae was an amphibious landing to east of lae and then subsequent advance on town during salamaua lae campaign of world war ii part of operation postern which was undertaken to capture japanese base at lae landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 september 1943 by australian troops from 9th division supported by us naval forces from vii amphibious force first major amphibious operation undertaken by australian army since failed gallipoli campaign australians invested a significant amount of effort into planning operation initial landing saw one brigade and supporting elements being landed at two beaches about east of lae once this brigade had secured beachhead a second brigade was landed to follow them up and help expand beachhead in days following landing division s third and final brigade was brought ashore landing was carried out in conjunction with airborne landing at nadzab and was followed by a drive on lae by 7th division from nadzab and 9th from landing beaches which advanced with two brigades while one held landing beach hampered by bad weather logistical difficulties and stiff resistance by japanese defenders 9th division s advance stalled and ultimately troops from 7th division entered lae first entering town on 16 september day before 9th strategy allied thumb right a map depicting elkton iii plan march 1943 in july 1942 united states joint chiefs of staff approved a series of operations by general douglas macarthur supreme commander south west pacific area swpa against japanese bastion at rabaul which blocked any allied advance along northern coast of new guinea toward philippines or north toward main japanese naval base at truk in keeping with overall allied grand strategy of defeating nazi germany first immediate aim of these operations was not defeat of japan but merely reduction of threat posed by japanese base at rabaul to air and sea communications between united states and australia in 1942 and early 1943 macarthur s forces fought off a series of japanese offensives in papua in kokoda track campaign battle of milne bay battle of buna gona battle of wau and battle of bismarck sea following these victories initiative passed to allies at pacific military conference in washington d c in march 1943 macarthur s plans were reviewed by joint chiefs of staff chiefs were unable to supply all requested resources so plans had to be scaled back with capture of rabaul postponed to 1944 on 6 may 1943 macarthur s general headquarters ghq in brisbane officially informed subordinate commands of next phase of operations which were to occupy kiriwina and woodlark islands and establish air forces thereon seize lae salamaua finschhafen madang area and establish air forces therein occupy western new britain establishing air forces at cape gloucester arawe and gasmata second part was assigned to general sir thomas blamey s new guinea force which was a mainly australian formation as a result it became obvious that any military offensive in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by australian army just as during bitter campaigns of 1942 japanese in early 1942 japanese began making plans for capture of salamaua lae area which according to kengoro tanaka they desired as part of plans to control sea area to east and north of australia due to airfields located in region lae was subsequently secured by a battalion of naval troops in february march 1942 lae was then developed into a significant forward base for japanese aircraft while salamaua was invested with a naval garrison in december that year japanese began reinforcing lae as they sought to shore up their southern flanks after failure of operations to capture port moresby by january 1943 total strength of japanese forces around salamaua lae was around 6 500 its strategic position adjacent to solomon sea meant that it was main japanese base in region and throughout 1943 plans were made to hold both lae and salamaua by 1943 japanese maintained separate army and navy headquarters at rabaul which cooperated with each other but were responsible to different higher authorities naval forces came under southeast area fleet commanded by vice admiral jinichi kusaka army forces came under general hitoshi imamura s eighth area army consisting of xvii army in solomon islands lieutenant general hatazo adachi s xviii army in new guinea and 6th air division based at rabaul as a result of destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in battle of bismarck sea japanese decided not send any more convoys to lae but instead to land troops at hansa bay and wewak and move them forward to lae by barge or submarine in long run they hoped to complete a road over finisterre range and thence to lae through ramu and markham valleys imamura ordered adachi to capture allied bases at wau bena bena and mount hagen to support these operations imperial general headquarters transferred 7th air division to new guinea on 27 july 1943 lieutenant general kumaichi teramoto s fourth air army was assigned to imamura s command to control 6th and 7th air divisions 14th air brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons by june adachi had three divisions in new guinea 41st division at wewak and 20th division around madang both recently arrived from palau and 51st division in salamaua area a total of about 80 000 men of these only 51st division was in contact with enemy like blamey adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to bring his troops into battle geography thumb right map of advance on lae september 1943 lae lies on western base of huon peninsula on southern side of huon gulf area was flat and generally well drained it had been developed as a port to meet needs of gold fields to south but there was no harbour and deep water offshore meant that anchorages were limited tidal range was small with spring tides and and there were no coral reefs beaches to east of lae were suitable for landing craft they were composed of firm black sand or shingle and were about wide but they had few exits and for most part were backed by dense jungle and mangrove swamps there were no roads area was intercut by streams and rivers most important of which were burep and busu rivers while neither wide nor deep with firm stoney bottoms they were swift flowing with no fords and so presented an obstacle to troops crossing planning landing would be made by major general george wootten s 9th division veterans of siege of tobruk and first and second battles of el alamein it had returned to australia from middle east after el alamein and been re equipped re organised and re trained for jungle operations around kairi on atherton tablelands in queensland training in amphibious warfare was conducted nearby at trinity beach in cairns with american 2nd engineer special brigade this brigade was a large formation with an establishment strength of 354 officers 16 warrant officers and 6 806 enlisted men each of its three boat battalions had 120 small lcvps and 12 larger lcms which they assembled themselves at a facility near cairns 2nd engineer special brigade was trained and equipped for shore to shore operations over a maximum distance of thumb left blamey briefs news media using a scale model of target area original concept was for a brigade of 9th division to be ferried along coastline of new guinea from a forward base at morobe more blamey thought about prospect of doing this under noses of japanese air base at lae more hazardous it seemed in may he went back to macarthur and obtained approval for operation to be modified to employ entire 9th division and that they be carried in additional large landing craft operated by vii amphibious force also known as task force 76 this was part of us navy s seventh fleet it was commanded by rear admiral daniel e barbey and operated large ocean going landing ships such as lst lci and lct ships greater range meant that entire force could stage at milne bay and travel directly to lae from there in july and august 1943 9th division moved up to milne bay where barbey had already established his headquarters on board as it was first significant amphibious operation mounted by australian forces since gallipoli extensive planning was put into capture of lae indeed it was first major operation for which australian army was able to conduct long term forward planning with deliberate planning beginning six months prior wooten deliberately chose landing sites beyond range of japanese artillery in lae red beach was to east of mouth of busu river east of lae and yellow beach near malahang this was first time in swpa that beaches were designated with colours left end of beach was marked with a solid red panel mounted on tent poles right with one alternating red and white at night left would have a red light and right one alternating red and white yellow beach was marked same way with yellow instead of red maps and models of landing sites were made and kept closely guarded soldiers were made familiar with models of beaches where they would be landing but names were kept secret rehearsals were conducted on normanby island thumb right order of arrival of landing craft and stores on red and yellow beaches a series of meetings involving wooten barbey edmund herring wooten s superior as commander of i corps colonel merian c cooper from fifth air force and air commodore joe hewitt from raaf reached agreement or at least compromise on many points wooten wanted at least 10 days reserve rations this meant that some stores would have to be transported in bulk and not pre loaded on trucks as barbey initially wanted loading stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space but permitted quick unloading of lsts as trucks could simply be driven off 9th division did not have sufficient trucks for this but 200 trucks earmarked for us advanced base at lae were borrowed from usasos barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on tank decks of lsts as this was a fire hazard so bulk stores were carried there instead ammunition requirements were based on experience in desert there being no reliable data on usage in swpa due to acute supply difficulties some of ammunition was drawn from 10th advanced ammunition depot at milne bay for 25 pounders of 2 12th field regiment and bofors 40 mm guns of 2 4th light antiaircraft regiment 9th division also had two shore fire control parties from 1st australian naval bombardment group to coordinate naval gunfire support who had been specially trained at flinders naval depot in victoria wooten initially wanted a night landing which would give tactical surprise and maximise time for unloading landing ships before japanese aircraft put in an appearance but there would be no moon on 4 september so barbey was uncertain that he would be able to correctly locate beaches h hour was therefore set at 06 30 which was twenty minutes after sunrise because air force had commitments to support 7th division s landing at nadzab following day air cover would not be available in afternoon barbey therefore wanted ships to depart at 11 00 this raised question of whether ships could be unloaded in just 4 1 2 hours barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under japanese air attack for australian officers with memories of tobruk ferry service where royal navy and royal australian navy had lost 25 ships keeping port s garrison supplied us navy s attitude was not good enough a key part of blamey s plan was for australian and us forces to maintain pressure on japanese garrison around salamaua to south west in lead up to landing in an effort to draw japanese reinforcements away from lae in this they were completely successful japanese 51st division continued to reinforce position around salamaua with thousands of japanese troops including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment being moved to area throughout campaign allied intelligence estimated that there were 7 250 japanese soldiers in lae of whom 5 100 were in combat units battle landing brigadier victor windeyer s 20th infantry brigade

for a few hours at buna on 3 september where men on lcis were allowed to disembark at around 12 15 nine japanese betty bombers attacked landing craft at morobe but inflicted no damage or casualties on night of 3 4 september final voyage to landing beaches began landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five us destroyers it was unopposed by japanese land forces with small number of

dropped twelve bombs one hit deck of uss lci 339 forward of conning tower another two were near misses badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments ship caught fire lci 339 remained on beach where she served as a landmark for japanese aircraft she was eventually towed off beach but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss uss lci 341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side eight australians were killed including lieutenant colonel r e wall commanding officer of 2 23rd infantry battalion and 45 were wounded landing operation continued despite air attacks and within four hours of first landing craft being lowered into water around 8 000 men had been put ashore during initial phase of landing 2 13th infantry battalion landed at yellow beach securing beachhead after which it pushed patrols to west to link up with 2 15th infantry battalion which had landed at red beach before advancing east towards hopoi mission station to secure right flank of allied lodgement 2 17th infantry battalion came ashore on red beach behind 2 15th and pushed itself towards west to force its way across buso river and establish a beachhead on its opposite bank 26th infantry brigade then followed 20th brigade ashore conducting a passage of lines with 20th brigade moving through their position and then pushing west temporarily assuming control of 2 17th infantry battalion engineers laid wire mesh on beaches felled trees built roads and established supply dumps while lsts were unloaded quickly enough seven bulk loaded lcts were not due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading last was not unloaded until 14 30 at 13 00 six lsts heading for red beach were attacked by a force of about 70 japanese aircraft some 48 lockheed p 38 lightnings

divisional reserve 24th infantry brigade was brought ashore on evening of 5 6 september in days following landing australians advanced with two brigades forward 24th on coast and 26th about inland on right of 26th brigade flank security was provided by 2 4th independent company while 20th brigade remained behind to secure beachhead advance on lae thumb right upright sappers erect a pontoon bridge over bunga river on track to lae to facilitate passage of artillery following landing east of lae 7th division having concentrated in port moresby was flown into nadzab following its capture by us 503rd parachute infantry regiment 503rd pir on 5 september tasked with advancing from north west its main role was to act as a buffer between 9th division and japanese reinforcements which might try to move down through markham and ramu valleys 9th division s initial advance along coast met with limited resistance with largest japanese elements being mainly company sized in response to landing at nadzab japanese command ordered lieutenant general nakano s 51st division to reinforce ryoichi shoge s heavily entrenched garrison at lae falling back from salamaua region there were numerous small creeks and rivers west of buso including four major rivers and on inland route 2 23rd infantry battalion having crossed buso on first day began a series of what author joseph morgan has described as treacherous river crossings and hard slogs through jungle pushing their way across bunga and buiem rivers 2 23rd fanned out through apo village while maintaining contact with 2 17th infantry battalion by signal cable around burep river 2 23rd was held up by terrain and as a result commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position a platoon under sergeant don lawrie was pushed forward near mouth of river as a protection measure to provide early warning on 6 september a company of japanese attacked 2 23rd s main defensive position south of singaua plantation on western side of buiem river alongside a company from 2 24th battalion having been alerted by lawrie s platoon who had sent back two runners battalion was able to repel attack although numerous casualties were inflicted on 2 23rd and 2 17th by japanese mortars japanese company numbering about 60 men subsequently fell back towards lawrie s platoon near bunga positioned on japanese line of retreat australian platoon was subjected to six attacks these were fended off over course of afternoon and by evening as heavy rain began to fall australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to 2 23rd s main defensive position japanese assault on 2 23rd subsequently delayed 9th division s advance for several days and these would eventually prove significant as in that time rain set in flooding numerous waterways that forked inland from coast covered with heavy fire from opposite bank they would prove difficult for australians to cross as advance continued stores were pushed forward from red beach and landed by and lcms around apo fishing village on 6 7 september and then again on 7 september around singaua plantation from where both 24th and 26th infantry brigades undertook a resupply before advance continued going was slow with ground saturated and thick jungle and kunai grass along route of advance delayed troops who had to cut several tracks through foliage on inland route 2 24th led way towards burep river while along coast 2 28th relieved 2 32nd as they reached burep two brigades separated with 26th advancing alongside burep for several miles before crossing it further inland and then driving towards busu thumb left a number 6 artillery tractor a bofors 40 mm gun across burep river on way to lae by 8 september commander of japanese 51st division nakano gave order for his forces and those in lae to begin their withdrawal northwards as it became clear that twin drives on town threatened them with encirclement same day though australians came up against most significant obstacle to their advance on lae busu river which at its widest was across and deep three days of heavy rain had flooded river making it treacherous to cross however need to maintain initiative forced australians to launch a hazardous crossing without bridging equipment or boats on coast 2 28th infantry battalion under command of lieutenant colonel colin norman attempted to run a cable across river this failed after soldier who made crossing was killed on opposite bank by a squad of japanese norman then shifted his focus to mouth of river where there was a small central island that could be exploited to provide some cover for assaulting troops covered by mortars and heavy machine guns western australians fixed bayonets and advanced in company lots with men strung out in extended line japanese opened up with their own mortars and machine guns from well concealed positions on opposite bank thirteen australians drowned in crossing while dozens more were swept away and had to be rescued by troops from neighbouring units nevertheless 2 28th pushed through subsequently securing a beachhead on opposite bank weather continued to hamper 9th division s advance 26th brigade further inland remained stuck on eastern side of busu on 10 september commandos providing flank security managed to get across river close to its confluence with busu pushing a kunda bridge across shortly afterwards they clashed with a small party of japanese attempting to advance towards bridge and several japanese were killed to reinvigorate 26th engineer support was brought up 2 7th field company was pushing a jeep track forward with help of 2 48th and they subsequently arrived with boats ropes and cables and several attempts were made to get across all of which eventually failed as engineers came under fire from opposite bank heavy clashes later took place as australians and japanese fought desperately in swamp around crossing as it became uncertain whether 26th would be able to force their way across a company from 2 48th was sent south to use 24th brigade s crossing and then advance north along western bank of busu to help secure brigade s beachhead when it finally did get across on 13 september further engineer stores arrived including bridging equipment and folding boats and following day a small box girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from opposite bank allowing 26th brigade to get across busu on 14 september 26th infantry brigade s leading elements immediately clashed with japanese on opposite bank as they worked to push two battalions towards and malahang mission to secure sawmill to south west and northern end of malahang airfield meanwhile 24th infantry brigade had pushed 2 28th along coast with a view advancing towards malahang anchorage while 2 32nd and 2 43rd invested wagan to south of malahang airfield in addition to weather allied supply situation also proved problematic with geography making resupply efforts difficult while service politics led to arguments between military and naval commanders developing over misunderstandings about capabilities of navy and risks involved in operating close to shore these factors combined to stymie 9th division s progress and as a result 7th division s troops eventually beat 9th in reaching town with its 25th infantry brigade having fought a sharp action around jensen s and heath s plantations entering lae on morning of 16 september just ahead of 24th infantry brigade which had taken airfield around malahang day before base development thumb right liberty ships unload at

brigadier general carl w connell commander of us base e advance party of lieutenant colonel o a australian lae base sub area headquarters arrived by air on 18 september followed by main body by sea on 30 september to control australian and american bases herring created lae fortress under major general edward milford lae was not intended to be an air base but 9th division wanted to use lae drome for casualty evacuation and artillery spotting by no 4 squadron raaf by 18 september it had been extended to and widened to allowing four of no 4 squadron s cac wirraways to land closure of markham valley road on 7 october due to heavy rainfall meant that airbases at nadzab and gusap had to be maintained by air fuel was shipped to lae in 44 gallon drums and then flown to nadzab at one point there was a take off or landing at lae drome every 26 seconds only after a herculean effort by us 842nd engineer aviation battalion was road reopened on 15 december development of lae as a port on other hand was envisaged from start but when town was captured port was blocked by sunken barges and debris only discharge facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks first cargo was delivered by lst and brought ashore over beach by dukws lcms and lighters australian and american dukws were operated as a common pool initially us navy would only allow lsts to arrive at night and they had to shove off before daybreak only in november did it allow them to operate in daylight sunken japanese barges were cleared away by a 150 ton floating crane american engineers then installed a floating dock which was towed to lae in sections it opened on 20 october and a type c1 ship cape discharged there that day a new dock was completed on 23 november although it was used to unload liberty ship fremont older on 15 november a fuel jetty was built along with a bulk petroleum storage facility and first tanker discharged there on 20 november a 4 inch pipeline was run through to nadzab aftermath thumb a japanese gun captured by aif at lae after capture of lae japanese high command determined that a withdrawal to a new line of defence was required a total of about 9 000 japanese troops subsequently began withdrawing across busu river and then through saruwaged and finisterre ranges to north east coast while efforts were made to reinforce huon peninsula with 20th division being transferred from madang to finschhafen allies who had captured a copy of nakano s withdrawal order when troops from 2 25th infantry battalion clashed with a japanese force on 13 september attempted to cut off withdrawing troops and subsequently there were heavy clashes along markham valley road with troops from australian 25th infantry brigade and 503rd pir engaged during withdrawal many japanese troops ran short of food and abandoned essential equipment including artillery small arms and load carriage equipment they subsequently reached their objective in middle of october having lost a further 600 to 1 000 men on march japanese strength returns indicated that 51st division had 6 417 men of whom 1 271 were sick 9th division lost 77 killed 397 wounded and 73 missing allies subsequently launched a follow up campaign on huon peninsula with a landing at scarlet beach by 20th infantry brigade at same time 22nd infantry battalion an australian militia unit that had landed as part of 4th infantry brigade on 10 11 september to relieve 2 13th and 2 15th infantry battalions around beachhead to free them up for advance west on lae followed japanese that were withdrawing to east marching from hopoi mission station to finschhafen with a view to placing pressure on japanese southern flank this feat was described by kalgoorlie miner as greatest march of new guinea campaign and in 10 days battalion covered of rugged terrain 7th division would later advance on dumpu through markham and ramu valleys and over finisterre range on their way towards madang during finisterre range campaign this advance coupled with us seizure of new georgia gave allies access to vital airfields from which they were able to project air power notes references further
