fossils of burgess shale like burgess shale itself formed around 505 million years ago in mid cambrian period they were discovered in canada in 1886 and charles doolittle walcott collected over 60 000 specimens in a series of field trips up from 1909 to 1924 after a period of neglect from 1930s to early 1960s new excavations and re examinations of walcott s collection continue to discover new species and statistical analysis suggests discoveries will continue for foreseeable future stephen jay gould s book wonderful life describes history of discovery up to early 1980s although his analysis of implications for evolution has been contested fossil beds are in a series of shale layers averaging and totalling about in thickness these layers were deposited against face of a high undersea limestone cliff all these features were later raised up above current sea level during creation of rocky mountains these fossils have been preserved in a distinctive style known as burgess shale type preservation which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films and soft tissues as solid shapes quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them moderately soft tissues such as muscles are lost scientists are still unsure about processes that created these fossils while there is little doubt that animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment it is uncertain whether they were transported by flows from other locations or lived in area where they were buried or were a mixture of local and transported specimens this issue is closely related to whether conditions around burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen anoxic conditions are generally thought most favourable for fossilization but imply that animals could not have lived where they were buried in 1970s and early 1980s burgess fossils were largely regarded as evidence that familiar phyla of animals appeared very rapidly in early cambrian in what is often called cambrian explosion this view was already known to charles darwin who regarded it as one of greatest difficulties for theory of evolution he presented in origin of species in 1859 however from early 1980s cladistics method of analysing evolutionary family trees has persuaded most researchers that many of burgess shale s weird wonders such as opabinia and hallucigenia were evolutionary aunts and cousins of present day types of animal rather than a rapid proliferation of separate phyla some of which were short lived nevertheless there is still debate sometimes vigorous about relationships between some groups of animals discovery collection and re examinations first burgess shale fossils were found on mount stephen in canada s rocky mountains by a construction worker whose reports of them reached richard mcconnell of geological survey of canada mcconnell found trilobite beds there in 1886 and some unusual fossils that he reported to his superior these were misdiagnosed as headless shrimps with appendages and were named anomalocaris because of their unusual appendages but turned out to be pieces of a puzzle that took 90 years to solve alt photo of two men and a woman digging among rocks thumb 250px charles walcott searches burgess shale for fossils assisted by his wife and son c 1913 similar fossils were reported in 1902 from nearby mount field another part of stephen formation these may have been why charles doolittle walcott visited mount field in 1909 while taking photographs there walcott found a slab of fossils that he described as phyllopod crustaceans from late august to early september 1909 his team including his family collected fossils there and in 1910 walcott opened a quarry that he and his colleagues re visited in 1911 1912 1913 1917 and 1924 bringing back over 60 000 specimens in total walcott was secretary of smithsonian institution from 1907 to his death in 1927 and this kept him so busy that he was still trying to make time for analyzing his finds two years before his death although he drew attention to exceptional detail of specimens which were first known fossils of soft bodied animals from cambrian period he also had other research interests early paleozoic stratigraphy of canadian rockies which took up great majority of his time there and precambrian fossils of algae and bacteria to which he assigned as much importance as to fossils of animals he managed to publish four preliminary papers on fossil animals in 1911 and 1912 and further articles in 1918 1919 and 1920 four years after walcott s death his associate charles produced a package of additional descriptions from walcott s notes walcott s classifications of most of fossils are now rejected but were supported at time and he accepted a change for one of few where his conclusion was disputed many of later comments were made with benefits of hindsight and of techniques and concepts unknown in walcott s time although in 1931 percy raymond opened and briefly excavated another quarry about above walcott s phyllopod bed there was very little interest in burgess shale fossils from 1930s to early 1960s and most of those collected by walcott were stored on high shelving in back rooms at smithsonian institution between 1962 and mid 1970s alberto simonetta re examined some of walcott s collection and suggested some new interpretations beginning in early 1970s harry whittington his associates david bruton and christopher hughes and his graduate students derek briggs and simon conway morris began a thorough re examination of walcott s collection although they assigned groups of fossils to each member of team they all decided for themselves which fossils to investigate and in what order their publications and stephen jay goulds popularization of their work in his book wonderful life aroused enduring scientific interest and some public interest in cambrian explosion apparently rapid appearance of moderately complex bilaterian animals in early cambrian continuing search for burgess shale fossils since mid 1970s has led to description in 1980s of an arthropod sanctacaris and in 2007 of orthrozanclus which looked like a slug with a small shell at front chain mail over back and long curved spines round edges recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named they have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier for example odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen but discovery of a further 189 formed basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006 a full pre publication draft free but without pictures may be available at re examination of walcott s collection also continues and has led to reconstruction of large marine animal in 2009 geology burgess shale is a series of sediment deposits spread over a vertical distance of hundreds of metres extending laterally for at least deposits were originally laid down on floor of a shallow sea during late cretaceous laramide orogeny mountain building processes squeezed sediments upwards to their current position at around elevation in rocky mountains rocks containing fossils are on border between two partially overlapping bands of rock that run along western face of canadian rockies on eastern side of this border is cathedral formation a platform of limestone formed by algae western surface of cathedral formation is steep and consists of resistant rock dolomite which was originally part of limestone platform but between mid silurian and late devonian was transformed by hydrothermal flows of brine at up to which replaced much of limestone s calcium with magnesium a layer of shale lies partly on top of and partly to west of cathedral formation this shale layer used to be called thin stephen formation where it lies above cathedral formation and thick stephen formation where it lies to west but thick stephen formation is now generally known as burgess formation shale is made of alternating fine grained layers of siliceous mudstone compressed hardened mud originally made of ground up silicate rock and calcisiltite originally animal shells calcisiltite layers contain relatively unremarkable shells and occasional non biomineralized fossils such as tubes soft bodied organisms for which burgess shale is famous are fossilized in mudstone layers which are between thick averaging and have well defined bases opinions vary about how mudstone layers were produced perhaps by mudslides from top of cathedral limestone platform when its edge collapsed occasionally or possibly by storms that created back currents that abruptly washed large volumes of mud off platform each mudstone layer is result of one such catastrophe greater phyllopod bed a thick sequence consisting of walcott s famous phyllopod bed plus below that contains at least 36 layers deposited over 10 to 100 thousand years during which environment was essentially stable fossil preservation processes responsible for exceptional preservational quality of burgess shale fossils are far from clear interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked whether animals were buried where they lived or washed long distances by sediment flows and whether water at burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals traditional view is that soft bodies and organs could only be preserved in anoxic conditions otherwise oxygen breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization this would imply that sea floor organisms could not have lived there however in 2006 caron and jackson concluded that sea floor animals were buried where they lived one of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft bodied animals such as polychaetes which had already died shortly before burial event and would have been fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment other evidence for burial where animals had lived includes presence of tubes and burrows and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed such as a group of carnivorous clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived fossil tracks are rare and no burrows under sea floor have so far been found in burgess shale these absences have been used to support idea that water near sea floor was anoxic however it is possible that water just above sea floor was oxygenated while water in sediment below it was anoxic and also possible that there simply were no deep burrowing animals in burgess shale some fossils such as marrella are almost always right way up which suggests they were not transported far if at all others such as wiwaxia are often at odd angles and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues this suggests that distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera although most were buried where they had lived thumb 200px typical wrinkled elephant skin texture of microbial mats fossils known as and morania may represent members of microbial mat communities morania appears on about a third of slabs caron and jackson studied and in some cases presents wrinkled elephant skin texture typical of fossilized microbial mats if such mats were present they may have provided food for grazing animals and possibly helped to preserve soft bodies and organs by creating oxygen free zones under mats and thus inhibiting bacteria that cause decomposition burgess shale animals were probably killed by changes in their environment either immediately preceding or during mud slides that buried them proposed killing mechanisms include changes in salinity poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane changes in availability of oxygen and changing consistency of sea floor death event was not necessarily related to burial and there may have been multiple death events between burial events but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand any chance of being fossilised instead of rotting or being eaten thumb right a typical flattened burgess shale fossil opabinia burgess shale type preservation is defined as fossilization of non biomineralized organisms as flattened carbonaceous films in marine shales when animals started to decompose their tissues collapsed under weight of sediment that buried them typical flattened fossils are outlines of tougher parts such as cuticles and jaws which resisted decomposition for long enough to be fossilized soft elements such as muscles and gut contents were sometimes squeezed out of decomposing organism to produce dark stains on fossils organisms that lack tougher structures such as flatworms nemerteans and shell less molluscs were not preserved by this process very soft but chemically active tissues may be preserved by different processes for instance during decomposition bacteria modify chemically unusual mid gut glands of some organisms into durable mineral phosphate this change happens extremely quickly before corpse is compressed and leaves a three dimensional mold of tissues gills can also be preserved in something close to their original three dimensional shape by this process both preservation mechanisms can appear in same fossil in burgess like shales organisms and parts that are only quite soft such as muscles are generally lost while those that are extremely soft and those that are fairly tough are preserved preservation of different body parts in different ways may sometimes help palaeontologists by suggesting whether a body part was fairly tough like an arthropod limb preserved as flat film or very soft and chemically active like a part of gut preserved as a solid piece of mineral these differences may also help to identify fossils by excluding from consideration organisms whose body parts do not match combination of types of preservation found in a particular fossil bed it has often been suggested that this type of preservation was possible only when sediments were not disturbed by burrowing animals or anchors of plants however a similar type of preservation has been found in fossils from late period about but in no known fossils between end of that epoch and start of cambrian this suggests that such bioturbation has little to do with appearance and disappearance of burgess shale type preservation such preservation may depend on presence of clay like minerals that inhibit decomposition and ocean chemistry may only have favoured production of such minerals for limited periods of time if so it is impossible to be sure when animals known as burgess shale fauna first appeared or when they became extinct a few fossils of animals similar to those found in burgess shale have been found in rocks from silurian ordovician and early devonian periods in other words up to 100 million years after burgess shale faunal composition as of 2008 only two in depth studies of mix of fossils in any part of burgess shale had been published by simon conway morris in 1986 and by caron and jackson in 2008 caron and jackson commented that conway morris had to rely on a set of specimens that may not have been representative since their excavators discarded specimens they found uninteresting and for which exact level in rock sequence had not been recorded making chronological analyses impossible both studies noted that set of species in walcott s phyllopod bed conway morris 1986 and its expanded version greater phyllopod bed caron and jackson 2008 was different from those found in other parts of burgess shale and conway morris commented that faunas at most other burgess shale sites resembled those of raymond quarry which is above and therefore more recent than greater phyllopod bed abbreviated gpb conway morris found that shelly fossils in walcott s phyllopod bed were about as abundant as in other shelly fossil deposits but accounted for only 14 of phyllopod bed fossils assuming that as in modern marine ecosystems about 70 of species that lived in early cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization he estimated that shelly fossils probably represent about 2 of animals that were alive at time since these shelly fossils are found in other parts of north america and in many cases over a much wider range burgess shale fossils including soft bodied ones probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if burgess shale type preservation were found there caron and jackson found that about 25 of 172 known species were abundant and widespread throughout time range of gpb while majority of species were rare and occurred in a small area for a short period of time in most layers five most abundant species accounted for 50 to 75 of individual animals species that had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists while rest were specialists in particular types of environment alternatively some wide ranging species may have been opportunists that were quick to recolonize area after each burial event 6 species that appeared in all layers were very probably generalists in each burial event layer commonest species generally has several times as many individuals as second most common and accounts for 15 to 30 of individual fossil animals more common a species is in one layer greater number of other layers it appears in these recurrent species account for 88 of individual specimens but only 27 of number of species this suggests that majority of species were in existence for much shorter periods than recurrent ones species that cover shorter periods of time occur mainly in higher younger layers gpb shows an overall trend of increasing diversity as time progresses in almost all layers arthropods are most abundant and diverse group of fossils in gpb followed by sponges 69 2 of gpb individuals and 63 9 of species lived on surface of sea bed within this group mobile deposit feeders that extracted food particles from sediment accounted for 38 2 of total number of individuals and 16 8 of total species smallest sub group was mobile hunters and scavengers and rest were sessile suspension feeders animals that lived in sediment made up 12 7 of species and 7 4 of individuals largest sub group was mobile hunters and scavengers bottom dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12 7 of species and 7 4 of individuals organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare accounting for only 1 5 of individuals and 8 3 of species these patterns a few common species and many rare ones dominance of arthropods and sponges and percentage frequencies of different life styles seem to apply to all of burgess shale however identity of dominant species differs between sites for example marrella splendens is often credited as commonest animal in burgess shale because of its abundance among specimens collected by walcott but is only third most abundant organism in greater phyllopod bed and very rare at other localities overall community and ecology is very similar to that of other cambrian localities suggesting a global pool of species that repopulated localities after calamitous burial events occurred caron and jackson used computer software to simulate numbers of species that would be found if smaller numbers of specimens were included and found that number of species discovered kept increasing as number of specimens increased rather than reaching a plateau this suggests that burgess shale probably still contains as yet undiscovered species although probably very rare ones some recently discovered species known in 2008 only by nicknames like woolly bear and siamese lantern are familiar to collecting teams but have yet to be formally described and named team also nicknamed another discovery as and in 2010 this animal was described and formally named notable fossils soft bodied fossils caron and jackson s survey covered 172 species found in greater phyllopod bed list below concentrates on recent discoveries and on species that have been central to major scientific debates marrella was first burgess shale fossil that whittington re examined and gave first indication that surprises were on way although clearly an arthropod that walked on sea floor marella was very different from known marine arthropod groups trilobites crustaceans and chelicerates in structure of its legs and gills and above all in number and positions of appendages on its head which are main feature used to classify arthropods a fossil of marrella from burgess shale has also provided earliest clear evidence of molting whittington s first presentation about opabinia made audience laugh reconstruction showed a soft bodied animal with a slim segmented body a pair of flap like appendages on each segment with gills above flaps five stalked eyes a backward facing mouth under head and a long flexible hose like proboscis that extended from under front of head and ended in a claw fringed with spines whittington concluded that it did not fit into any phylum known in mid 1970s free abstract at opabinia was one of main reasons why stephen jay gould in his book wonderful life considered that early cambrian life was much more diverse and experimental than any later set of animals and that cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms he regarded opabinia as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he originally wanted call his book homage to opabinia however subsequent research has concluded that opabinia is closely related to arthropods and possibly even closer to ancestors of arthropods thumb right 200px reconstruction of a large anomalocaris with a human leg and various burgess shale animals to show its size discovery of anomalocaris abnormal shrimp was a comedy of errors name was initially given to a fossil that looked like rear end of a shrimp like crustacean walcott classified a ring like fossil he called peytoia as a kind of jellyfish and another poorly preserved fossil he called laggania as a sea cucumber after many plot twists derek briggs started dissecting another ill defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of anomalocaris like structures on one end of a specimen of laggania which also had a specimen of peytoia attached just behind those of anomalocaris after dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations briggs and whittington concluded that whole assemblage represented a single animal which was named anomalocaris because that was earliest name assigned to any of its parts this animal s body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized but complete animal had tough grasping appendages anomalocaris a tough ring like mouth with teeth on inner edge peytoia and a long segmented body laggania with flaps on sides that enabled it to swim with a mexican wave motion and perhaps to turn quickly by putting flaps on one side into reverse this monster was over long when other animals were only a few inches at most gigas was long and was one of largest non suggested in 1999 that animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock other end of animal back and forth causing prey s exoskeleton to rupture and allowing predator to access its innards in 2009 found that mouthparts showed little wear which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells computer modeling of anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller soft bodied organisms although whittington and briggs concluded that anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum research since 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to opabinia and to ancestors of arthropods in 2009 a fossil named an apparent relative of anomalocaris was found in early devonian period about 100 million years later than burgess shale conway morris gave hallucigenia its name because in his reconstruction it looked bizarre a worm like animal that walked on long rigid spines and had a row of tentacles along its back science fiction author greg bear says in his way stories were scaled up versions of this reconstruction however in late 1980s lars ramskold literally turned it over so that tentacles which he found were paired became legs and spines were defensive equipment on its back ramskold classified it as one of onychophora a phylum of worms with legs that is considered closely related to arthropods another current view is that hallucigenia was an armored lobopod in other words more closely related to arthropods than onychophorans are but less closely related to arthropods than opabinia or anomalocaris are most fossils of wiwaxia are just a jumble of armor plates and spines but after examining dozens of them conway morris reconstructed them as slug like animals covered in rows of overlapping armor plates with two rows of longer spines projecting upwards since 1990 there has been an intense debate about whether wiwaxia was more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete annelids supporters of a close relationship with molluscs maintained that a pair of bars running across mouth and armed with backward pointing teeth were a rudimentary form of radula toothed tongue that molluscs use to scrape up food and convey it back to throat nicholas butterfield one academic who has so far published articles placing wiwaxia closer to polychaetes stated that wiwaxia s two row feeding apparatus could not have performed sophisticated functions of multi row conveyor belt radula suggesting instead that wiwaxia s apparatus was like side by side pair of toothed bars found in some polychaetes later he found some fragmentary fossils 5 to 10 million years before burgess shale that he regarded as a much more convincing early radula butterfield has also described wiwaxia s armor plates and spines as similar in internal structure to hairs of polychaetes supporters of link with molluscs have stated that wiwaxia shows no signs of segmentation appendages in front of mouth or legs all of which are typical polychaete features one writer adopted a neutral position saying he saw no strong grounds for classifying wiwaxia as a proto annelid or a proto mollusc although he thought objections against classification as a proto annelid were stronger thumb right 150px odontogriphus top at left underside at right with tooth rows in red for many years odontogriphus toothed riddle was known from only one specimen an almost featureless oval smear on a slab with hints of tiny conical teeth however 189 new finds in years immediately preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible it had a pair of slightly v shaped tooth rows just ahead of mouth very like wiwaxia s this pitched odontogriphus into middle of debate about whether wiwaxia was closer to mollusc or annelid lineage resulting in a frank exchange of views near end they wrote many of butterfield s misconceptions might well have been avoided had he taken opportunity to examine all new material that formed basis of our study thumb 150px artist s impression of orthrozanclus orthrozanclus reburrus dawn scythe with bristling hair was discovered in 2006 and formally described in 2007 this animal had a soft unarmored underside but upward facing surfaces were armored by a small shell near front end three zones of armor plates which fitted close to body and one of which ran all way round animal 16 to 20 long upwards curving spines on each side of body arrangement of orthrozanclus armor plates is very similar to that of its burgess shale contemporary wiwaxia its shell is very similar to one of two burgess shale shell types labelled forward shell of halkieriids most fossils of which are dated to early cambrian and those of other early cambrian fossils such as and these similarities suggest that orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between wiwaxia and halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants so orthrozanclus was also drawn into complex debate about whether wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms for many years only one fossil was known poorly preserved and without a counterpart this fossil was a puzzle as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body with what seemed to be fins along its back and belly looked rather like of a chordate s in 2010 smith and caron described another 91 specimens some very good and reconstructed it as a cephalopod and earliest one as of 2010 unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms and its eyes seem mounted on stalks but it had a soft funnel similar to ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods summary has always been classified as a polychaete worm recent microscopic examination has indicated that surfaces of many bristles on its legs were diffraction gratings that made animal iridescent fossils of chordates phylum to which humans belong are very rare in cambrian sediments conway morris classified burgess shale fossil pikaia as a chordate because it had a rudimentary notochord rod of cartilage that evolved into backbone of vertebrates doubts have been raised about this because most of important features are not quite like those of chordates it has repeated blocks of muscle along its sides but they are not chevron shaped there is no clear evidence of anything like gills and its throat appears to be in upper part of its body rather than lower it also has tentacles on front of its head unlike living chordates at best it may be a stem group chordate in other words an evolutionary aunt of living chordates also found in burgess shale but even rarer may be a chordate if repeated chevron shaped structures along its sides represent muscle blocks while pikaia was celebrated in mid 1970s as earliest known chordate three jawless fish have since been found among chengjiang fossils which are about 17 million years older than burgess shale notable burgess shale fossils genus phylum class abundance notes group a lobopod that possessed appendages for walking often found associated with sponges it is possible that it fed on them in both burgess shale and in armoured lobopod that was originally reconstructed upside down material from china now shows that original interpretation of legs are actually spines bristle worm that used tentacles to feel for food it had 24 segments each carrying a pair of appendages used for propulsion 15000 common burgess shale fauna called lace crab by walcott it carried a shield extending from its head over its gills brush like appendages of its head probably swept food into its mouth specimens from burgess relative of modern day shrimp most canadaspis specimens preserve only its distinctive carapace using its legs canadaspis brushed off mud to find food arthropod that had an elongated body with front covered by a hard carapace armour less abdomen possessed no legs and at end held a forked tail unlike canadaspis legs of waptia had separate proposes waptia was a forager moving along ocean floor to burgessia had a delicate structure below its round carapace it is less than long is distinguished from other arthropods by its arms they split into three appendages probably to find food as they lack spiny characteristic of predators to today s horseshoe crab sanctacaris was only first described in 1981 it possessed a large flat tail suggesting it was a good swimmer a group of six appendages in each side of its body and a very streamlined head was a large long predator of burgess shale and ate trilobites ostracods and it was named after walcott s second son sidney was streamlined and around 2000 it was compared to modern mantis shrimp in had two four fingered hands and may have preyed on trilobites smashing or spearing them with its fingers in appearance to a leaf plated slug wiwaxia is a possible bristle worm although its classification is controversial its diet likely constituted of organic detritus is a strange burgess shale taxon it had five stalked eyes and one appendage with a grasping claw it may have both swum and walked along sea floor rare is rarely preserved and was probably a swimmer based on streamlined body descended from an even earlier chordate based on fossil material from china pikaia swam through cambrian like a modern fish originally thought to be most primitive chordate it had two lobe like appendages on its head unlike vertebrates a headless shrimp anomalocaris was up to long it was apex predator of burgess fauna and trilobite remains preserve bite marks that may come from it when described only lower jaws were known and mouth was named separately as jellyfish peytoia like its relatives anomalocaris possessed eye stalks 200px trace fossils although trace fossils are rare in burgess shale arthropod trackways have been recovered significance analysis of burgess shale fossils has been important to interpretation of precambrian and cambrian fossil records and thus to scientific understanding of nature of early evolution english geologist and palaeontologist william buckland 1784 1856 realised that a dramatic change in fossil record occurred around start of cambrian period earliest cambrian trilobite fossils are about 530 million years old but were already both diverse and widespread suggesting that group had a long hidden history earliest fossils widely accepted as echinoderms appeared at about same time because darwin s contemporaries had insufficient information to establish relative dates of cambrian rocks they had impression that animals appeared instantaneously charles darwin regarded solitary existence of cambrian trilobites and total absence of other intermediate fossils as gravest problem to his theory of natural selection and he devoted an entire chapter of origin of species on matter he speculated that phenomenon now known as cambrian explosion was a product of gaps in sequence of fossil bearing rocks and in contemporary knowledge of those rocks thumb right dickinsonia one of fossils sprigg discovered in ediacara hills while some geological evidence was presented to suggest that earlier fossils did exist for a long time this evidence was widely rejected fossils from ediacaran period immediately preceding cambrian were first found in 1868 but scientists at that time assumed there was no precambrian life and therefore dismissed them as products of physical processes between 1883 and 1909 walcott discovered other precambrian fossils which were accepted at time however in 1931 albert charles seward dismissed all claims to have found precambrian fossils in 1946 reg sprigg noticed in rocks from australia s ediacara hills however while these are now recognized as coming from ediacaran period they were thought at time to have been formed in cambrian from 1872 onwards small shelly fossils none more than a few millimeters in size were found in very early cambrian rocks and later also found in rocks dating to end of preceding ediacaran period but scientists only started in 1960s to recognize that these were left by a wide range of animals some of which are now recognized as molluscs darwin s view that gaps in fossil record accounted for apparently sudden appearance of diverse life forms still had scientific support over a century later in early 1970s wyatt durham and martin glaessner both argued that animal kingdom had a long proterozoic history that was hidden by lack of fossils and however preston cloud held a different view about origins of complex life writing in 1948 and 1968 that evolution of animals in early cambrian was explosive and this explosive view was supported by hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium which eldredge and gould developed in early 1970s which views evolution as long intervals of near stasis punctuated by short periods of rapid change fossils of burgess shale were hidden in store rooms until 1960s when whittington and his colleagues first began to publish their burgess finds in early 1970s fossils became central to debate about how quickly animals arose and were interpreted as evidence that all living bilaterian phyla had appeared in early cambrian along with many other phyla that had become extinct by end of cambrian thumb 275px stem groups however at this time cladistics which appeared in 1950s was starting to change scientists approach to biological classification unlike previous methods cladistics attempts to consider all characteristics of an organism rather than those subjectively chosen as most important as a result it gives less significance to unique or bizarre characteristics than to those that are shared since only latter can demonstrate relationships cladistics also emphasises concept of a monophyletic group in other words one that consists only of a common ancestor and all its descendants for example it regards traditional term reptile as useless since mammals and birds are descendants of different groups of reptiles but are not considered reptiles concepts of crown groups and stem groups first presented in english in 1979 are consequences of this approach a crown group is a monophyletic group of living organisms and a stem group is a non monophyletic set of organisms that do not have all shared features of crown group but have enough to distinguish them clearly from close relatives of other crown groups in very simple terms they are evolutionary aunts of organisms in crown group phyla are crown groups and fact that some of their characteristics are considered defining features is simply a consequence of fact that their ancestors survived while closely related lineages became extinct briggs and whittington started experimenting with cladistics in 1980 to 1981 and results while full of uncertainties convinced them that cladistics offered reasonable prospects of making sense of burgess shale animals other fossil beds discovered since 1980 some rather small and others rivalling burgess shale have also produced similar collections of fossils and show that types of animals they represent lived in seas all over world it appears that most of major animal lineages had arisen before time of burgess shale and before that of chengjiang and sirius passet lagerstatten about 15 million years earlier in which very similar fossils are found and that cambrian explosion was complete by then in 1990s it was suggested that some ediacaran fossils from just before start of cambrian may have been primitive bilaterians and one kimberella may have been a primitive mollusc by 1996 with new fossil discoveries filling in some of gaps in family tree some burgess shale weird wonders such as and opabinia were seen as stem members of a total group that included arthropods and some other living phyla see also references burgess shale fossils burgess shale fossils burgess shale fossils burgess shale fossils fossils burgess shale
