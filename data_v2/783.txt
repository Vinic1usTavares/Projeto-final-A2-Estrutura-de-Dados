typhoon etau known in philippines as typhoon kabayan produced near record winds and rainfall in japan in august 2003 tenth named storm and fifth typhoon of 2003 pacific typhoon season etau developed on august 2 and gradually intensified while moving to northwest etau formed an eye and became a large storm by time it approached okinawa on august 7 typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km h 100 mph before weakening slightly while turning to northeast etau made landfall on japanese island of shikoku on august 8 and later moved across portions of honshu and hokkaido after weakening to tropical storm status cyclone became extratropical on august 9 and dissipated three days later while passing northeast of philippines typhoon caused light damage in archipelago eye crossed over okinawa where etau left 166 800 people without power and caused 10 injuries near where etau first struck japan muroto reported a peak wind gust of 166 km h 103 mph at time third strongest on record there typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides particularly on hokkaido nationwide etau killed 20 people destroyed 708 houses and caused y 35 1 billion jpy 294 8 million usd in damage meteorological history origins of typhoon etau were from an area of convection that persisted along west side of a weak circulation near chuuk state on july 31 with initially moderate but steadily decreasing wind shear system was able to organize as it moved generally westward on august 2 joint typhoon warning center jtwc initiated advisories on tropical depression 11w that day another circulation was developing on western side of system briefly classified by taiwan central weather bureau as a tropical depression eastern circulation became dominant with pronounced outflow to south although it was initially broad and elongated later on august 2 japan meteorological agency jma classified system as a tropical depression to northeast of yap with a subtropical ridge in vicinity of marianas islands nascent depression moved to northwest on august 3 jma upgraded depression to tropical storm status naming it etau an upper level low to northeast improved northerly outflow allowing storm to strengthen quickly on august 4 philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa began issuing advisories as storm approached region naming it kabayan late on august 4 jma upgraded etau to typhoon status with storm later developing an eye an approaching shortwave trough weakened ridge causing etau to turn more to north at around 0030 utc on august 7 typhoon made its closest approach to okinawa passing within 120 km 75 mi and close enough for 100 km 60 mi wide eye to cross over island later that day jma estimated peak maximum sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph sustained over a duration of 10 minutes jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 205 km h 125 mph after reaching peak winds etau began turning to north northeast due to approaching trough passing near amami oshima by that time typhoon had become large with gale force winds extending 870 km 540 mi in diameter increasing wind shear and cooler air caused etau to weaken typhoon still maintained 10 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph when it made landfall near muroto on japanese island of shikoku shortly before 1300 utc on august 8 continuing northeastward typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm as it passed near awaji island before making landfall on honshu near at 2100 utc on august 8 while accelerating to northeast etau lost tropical characteristics over land after briefly reaching open waters to northeast of honshu storm made its final landfall near erimo hokkaido at 1630 utc on august 9 shortly before becoming extratropical this was based on analysis from jma whereas jtwc assessed storm remaining offshore hokkaido remnants of etau entered sea of okhotsk and persisted for several more days dissipating on august 12 to west of kamchatka peninsula preparations and impact right thumb typhoon etau approaching japan on august 8 rough waves from typhoon etau produced rip currents on saipan that swept up four swimmers who were later rescued after holding onto a buoy outer periphery of storm caused p36 98 million php 673 000 usd in damage mostly to infrastructure with some minor crop damage late in its duration etau caused damage in russia s kuril islands while etau was in vicinity of okinawa wind gusts at kadena air base reached 181 km h 113 mph rainfall on okinawa peaked at while on nearby yakushima to north rainfall reached throughout okinawa prefecture typhoon left 166 800 buildings without power due to strong winds etau damaged seven buildings blocked one road and caused moderate damage to crops and fisheries in amami islands about 45 000 houses lost power due to high winds from storm affecting 53 of residents etau injured ten people in island group including one man who was blown off his roof officials closed naha airport due to typhoon causing 293 flights in region to be canceled ahead of storm exxonmobil oil refineries in okinawa were closed but were reopened after sustaining minimal damage on shikoku muroto reported typhoon force winds for eight hours and wind gusts peaked at 166 km h 103 mph at time this was third strongest gust ever reported there behind typhoon nancy in 1961 and typhoon shirley in 1965 sustained winds there reached 180 km h 112 mph in tokushima prefecture etau dropped heavy rainfall peaking at although similarly heavy totals of and were reported in kochi and miyazaki prefectures respectively about 95 of rainfall total in kochi fell in 24 hours in miyazaki a station reported an hourly rainfall total of rainfall at hokkaido reached in a 48 hour period highest at station since records began in 1962 heavy rainfall caused landslides across hokkaido particularly in areas where rainfall totaled over in area around saru river shallow landslides displaced about of soil of which about entered river this caused highest sediment levels in river since 1960s washing about into dam landslides also swept about of soil and trees into river which caused additional damage by washing away adjacent homes and bridges in addition rainfall etau spawned a weak tornado near kumagaya on honshu mainland rated around an f1 typhoon brought a plume of warm air to country that caused warmest temperatures of year at that point heavy rainfall in tokushima caused landslides and blocked roads resulting in disruptions to bus and train service strong winds overturned a truck injuring two occupants in muroto several people were injured by flying glass rough waves killed two people in same city one in fukuoka damaged seawall in kyoto and damaged 25 ships in takamatsu kagawa etau left about y 1 2 billion jpy 10 million usd in crop damage mainly due to damaged greenhouses two workers were killed in after being swept away by a river on hokkaido heavy rainfall caused landslides damaging hundreds of roads and bridges and isolating several villages river flooding swept away a vehicle in killing five occupants along mount 29 people were rescued by helicopter from a mountain lodge after etau blocked off their descending trail throughout japan etau caused over 1 000 flights to be canceled and for bullet trains to operate at a slower speed causing delays about 62 000 people lost power during storm and across country typhoon destroyed 708 houses and flooded 2 253 others causing over 6 000 people to evacuate to storm shelters about of fields were damaged throughout japan etau killed 20 people and injured 93 others 19 of them seriously overall damage totaled y 35 1 billion jpy 294 8 million usd largely because etau remained tropical and weakened over japan damage was much less than typhoon tokage a year later which produced comparable rainfall totals at a similar intensity but struck country while extratropical see also
