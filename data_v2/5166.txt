imperator torosus commonly known as brawny bolete is a species of bolete fungus in family boletaceae it is native to southern europe east to caucasus and israel it is generally associated with deciduous trees such as hornbeam oak and beech in warm dry locales although generally rare in europe it appears to be relatively common in hungary appearing in summer and autumn on chalky soils stocky fruit bodies have an ochre cap up to 20 cm 8 in across yellow pores on cap underside and a wine red to brown or blackish stipe up to long by wide pale yellow flesh changes to different colours when broken or bruised depending on age younger mushrooms become reddish and older ones additionally take on bluish tones elias magnus fries and christopher theodor hok first described this species as boletus torosus in 1835 a name by which it came to be known for many years modern molecular phylogenetics shows that it is only distantly related to boletus edulis type species of boletus and it was duly placed in new genus imperator in 2015 eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens though some people have eaten it without ill effects taxonomy swiss mycologist louis secretan described brawny bolete as boletus pachypus in his 1833 work suisse many of his names have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because secretan had a narrow species concept dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently swedish mycologists elias magnus fries and christopher theodor hok described boletus torosus in 1835 based on secretan s b pachypus distinct from b pachypus described by fries himself fries reported in his 1838 book epicrisis systematis mycologici seu synopsis that he had not actually observed species and he did not designate a type specimen or illustration specific epithet torosus which derives from latin means muscular in united kingdom it is known commonly as brawny bolete german name means oxen bolete and french bolet is strong bolete french naturalist lucien quelet transferred species to now obsolete genus dictyopus in 1886 which resulted in synonym dictyopus torosus boletus xanthocyaneus first described by henri romagnesi in 1948 as boletus purpureus var xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976 was considered by italian mycologist carlo luciano alessio to be synonymous with b torosus others however regard this fungus a distinct species in 2013 italian mycologists valerio bertolini and giampaolo simonini observed that brevity of original species description meant that some subsequent papers used b torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of boletus rhodopurpureus or b luteocupreus both now placed in genus imperator they did note that swiss and french authors had adhered to a more detailed description by quelet and that this was only description faithful to original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red they concluded original description must have been based on specimens growing near french swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region within large genus boletus brawny bolete was classified in section luridi which included species producing medium to large fruit bodies with thick swollen stipes and minute pores in 1996 czech mycologist jiri further subdivided section luridi defining and naming subsection for b torosus to contain boletes that strongly bruised blue black with handling in a molecular analysis of boletaceae phylogeny brawny bolete was most closely related to boletus luteocupreus these two species formed a clade that was sister to b luridus genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that b torosus and many but not all red pored boletes were part of a dupainii clade named for b dupainii well removed from core group of boletus edulis type species of genus boletus and relatives within boletineae this indicated that brawny bolete and its relatives needed to be placed in a new genus it was made type species of new genus imperator becoming imperator torosus in 2015 description thumb left base of thick stipe is wine red coloured quite heavy compared with other mushrooms of similar size stocky fruit body contains relatively high amounts of chitin holding brawny bolete has been described as having a stone in your hand cap is in diameter hemispherical when young it extends and flattens into a convex and finally a flattish shape sometimes forming a slight depression in centre initially curled downward and inward cap margin gradually turns outward eventually flattening in maturity and sometimes protruding beyond pored undersurface surface texture starts slightly velvety but becomes smoother and hairless with age in moist weather cap is slightly sticky changing over time colour of cap is initially vivid yellow or golden yellow then ochre then darkening in age to brown however if cap cuticle is bruised or even touched there are sudden changes in colour that depend on age of mushroom young yellow caps become cherry red while ochre brown cap tissue bruises to reddish purple these colour changes soon give way to bluish or greyish tones which when combined give cap a variegated appearance pores on cap underside are round and small sulfur yellow colour of pore surface becoming less intense with age squat stipe measures long by thick egg shaped when young it lengthens somewhat as mushroom grows but is still bulbous in maturity a mature stipe is typically a little shorter than diameter of cap it is initially roughly same colour as cap but as it matures develops a wine red colouration near base and a dirty brown to bluish black colouration elsewhere surface has a mesh like pattern reticulation that has a colour development similar to that of cap initially yellow then purplish and finally dark brown flesh is thick and hard it is yellow except for stipe base where it is deep red or dark brownish in older mushrooms pores stipe and flesh turn greenish blue with bruising or cutting smell is unpleasant but taste is mild spore print is olive brown smooth oval spores measure 12 15 by 5 6 mm and sometimes have an internal oil drop basidia spore bearing cells are club shaped four spored and measure 22 34 by 8 9 mm fusiform fuse shaped cystidia are colourless with oil droplets and have dimensions of 40 50 by 7 8 mm cap cuticle tissue is in form of a trichoderm where outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel like hairs perpendicular to cap surface these cylindrical interwoven hyphae contain septa similar species mediterranean species boletus poikilochromus somewhat resembles i torosus but can usually be distinguished by a smaller fruit body a cylindrical stipe and lighter colours of younger mushrooms also b poikilochromus does not feature colour change of stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in i torosus imperator luteocupreus and are also similar but pores of former are red and flesh of latter has a bitter taste several chemical tests can be used to distinguish i torosus from other similar boletes such as i rhodopurpureus i torosus displays following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old ammonium hydroxide nh4oh yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring potassium hydroxide koh deep buff instantly ferrous sulphate no change melzer s reagent dark blue phenol blue green very slow formalin mid blue slow toxicity like many boletes imperator torosus causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain diarrhoea and vomiting when eaten raw these reactions can also happen to some people when mushroom is eaten cooked though others have consumed it with no ill effects in a 1994 study researchers ulrich and hartmut looked for antabuse like compound coprine in suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse like reactions with alcohol coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in face tingling in arms and legs nausea and vomiting and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol they found none in suspect species but did find indications for it in imperator torosus they concluded that most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of i torosus with suillellus luridus though they could not rule out latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol related reactions no clinical cases of alcohol related sensitivity have been recorded for i torosus distribution and habitat imperator torosus is native to southern europe east to caucasus and israel a mycorrhizal species fungus is generally associated with deciduous trees such as hornbeam carpinus oak quercus and beech fagus in warm dry locales and is generally rare in europe in united kingdom it is listed as a priority species a threatened species requiring conservation action under uk biodiversity action plan similarly it is on list of protected species of macrofungi in montenegro it appears to be relatively common in hungary it is found under palestine oak quercus in bar am forest in upper galilee fruitings typically occur from july to september in
