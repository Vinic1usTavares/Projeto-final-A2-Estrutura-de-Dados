dove is closely related to eared dove zenaida and socorro dove zenaida graysoni some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in separate genus but current classification has them as separate species in genus zenaida in addition socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with mourning dove although several differences in behavior call and appearance justify separation as two different species while three species do form a subgroup of zenaida using a separate genus would interfere with monophyly of zenaida by making it paraphyletic there are five subspecies of mourning dove eastern z m carolinensis linnaeus 1766 clarion island z m c h townsend 1890 west indian z m macroura linnaeus 1758 western z m woodhouse 1852
