momentum as it progressed but allowed for organic process of adding new elements as writers thought of them a process favored by series co creator david lynch it also allowed mark frost lynch s partner in creating series to plan ahead to ensure plot details and threads would be revisited as necessary deschanel peyton 00 30 02 10 deschanel recalls teleplay for episode being approximately 40 45 pages long which he felt offered show a leisurely pace compared to modern television episode which are filmed from teleplays of up to 120 pages this allowed series to dwell on its subtext and unexpressed desires of its characters rather than focusing solely on narrative action deschanel peyton 04 08 04 59 deschanel and peyton have described episode as exemplifying need to be a fan of series to fully enjoy it as progression and development of characters occurs over multiple episodes and rewards attention of a regular viewer deschanel peyton 33 01 34 05 peyton has noted that

character had an idiosyncratic view of world which needed to be maintained deschanel peyton 06 59 08 08 but found audrey horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered character and actress sherilyn fenn to be both sexy and smart and to have developed substantially as series progressed deschanel peyton 13 16 14 17 character of madeline ferguson was named for characters in alfred

after titular character in otto preminger s 1944 film laura hunter engels 28 03 29 30 while other characters in series would also be named for film noir characters popular cherry stem scene was inspired by an incident in peyton s life he had been dining with friends during time he was writing script when a female friend demonstrated to group that she could knot a cherry stem with her tongue peyton immediately added this to script finding it fascinating that he could witness something on one day write it next and two weeks later see newspapers discussing his version of it fenn has admitted that she was unable to actually perform trick simply switching stem for a tied one already hidden in her mouth however co star madchen amick has since demonstrated it during television interviews deschanel peyton 37 59 38 55 scenes filmed in one eyed jacks casino and brothel were shot on location at a house on shore of california s lake footage for several episodes were shot on same day by different directors so as to scatter scenes throughout episodes that required them deschanel peyton 32 01 32 53 deschanel has expressed regret over use of a house style in series direction and cinematography feeling that he lit certain scenes in this episode in a way he would not usually have done preferring to have employed a chiaroscuro use of shadow as opposed to reddish tints used
