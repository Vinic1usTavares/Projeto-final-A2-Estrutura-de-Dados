executed around 1460 by netherlandish painter rogier van der weyden composition is built from geometric shapes that form lines of woman s veil neckline face and arms and by fall of light that illuminates her face and headdress vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance almost unnatural beauty and gothic elegance of model van der weyden was preoccupied by commissioned portraiture towards end of his wolff 242 and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character in this work woman s humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers kleiner 407 she is slender and depicted according to gothic ideal of elongated features indicated by her narrow shoulders tightly pinned hair high forehead and elaborate frame set by headdress it is only known portrait of a woman accepted as an autograph work by van der weyden yet sitter s name is not recorded and he did not title work although van der weyden did not adhere to conventions of idealisation he generally sought to flatter his sitters he depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing often with rounded almost sculpted facial features some of which deviated from natural representation he adapted his own aesthetic and his portraits of women often bear a striking resemblance to each other grossinger 60

below her breasts buff coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil which spills over her shoulders reaching her upper arms van der weyden s attention to structure of clothing careful detailing of pins pushed into veil to fix its position is typical for artist dress and reality in rogier van der weyden by margaret scott in campbell and van der stock 140 woman s veil forms a diamond shape balanced by inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress she is shown at a slight angle but her pose is centred by interlocked broad lines of arms and veil woman s head is delicately lit leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin she has a long thin face plucked eyebrows and eyelids and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead a plucked hairline was also fashion in renaissance italy at time her hair is tightly pinned back on rim of bonnet and rests above her ear her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face giving it a sculpted appearance woman s left ear is set according to art historian norbert schneider unnaturally high and far back parallel to her eyes rather than to her nose this position is probably an artistic device used to continue flow of diagonal line of veil s inner right wing in 15th century veils were normally worn for modesty to hide sensuality of flesh in this work veil has opposite effect

area of picture it is likely van der weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from description of her head her slender fingers are minutely detailed van der weyden often indicated social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists her fingers are folded in layers their intricate portrayal is most detailed element in painting and echoes pyramidal form of upper portion of painting her eyes gaze downward in humility in contrast to her relatively extravagant clothes piety of her expression is achieved through motifs common to van der weyden s work her eyes and nose are elongated and her lower lip made fuller by use of tone and pronounced finish some vertical lines around these features are emphasised while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised in addition contours of her face are highlighted in a manner that is slightly unnatural and abstract campbell 15 and outside usual spatial constraints of 15th century human representation this methodology was described by art historian erwin panofsky rogier concentrated on certain salient features salient both from a and psychological point of view which he expressed primarily by lines kemperdick 22 her high forehead and full mouth have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual ascetic and passionate symbolic of an unresolved conflict in her personality walker 126 panofsky refers to a smouldering excitability panofsky p 292 in superficially similar but considerably later portrait of a young lady in national gallery of washington hands are analogously placed but fingers reveal a smouldering excitability which even more severely repressed lives in her veiled downcast eyes and full sensuous lips sitter is unknown although some art historians have speculated on her identity on grounds of similarity of facial features writer wilhelm stein suggested in early 20th century that she might be marie de monro and monro 620 illegitimate daughter of philip good of burgundy philip good commissioned a portrait from van der weyden around 1450 however this is a contentious assertion and not widely held because her hands are shown as resting on painting s lower frame art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait rather than a devotional work it is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of woman s husband however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion break from idealisation thumb 180px

s work it is not known if two met van eyck died in 1441 and robert campin he was apprenticed to campin in 1426 see friedlaender 16 in early to middle 15th century these three artists were among first generation of northern renaissance painters and first northern europeans to portray members of middle and upper classes naturalistically rather than in a medieval christian idealised form in earlier netherlandish art profile view was dominant mode of representation for nobles or clergy worthy of portraiture smith 95 96 in works such as portrait of a man in a turban 1433 jan van eyck broke this tradition and used three quarter profile of face which became standard in netherlandish art here van der weyden utilises same profile which better allows him to describe shape of head and facial features of sitter smith 96 she is shown in half length which enables artist to show her hands crossed at her waist virtue and beauty leonardo s ginevra de benci and renaissance portraits of women national gallery of art washington retrieved 2 march 2014 brown p 136 despite this new freedom van der weyden s portraits of women are strikingly similar in concept and structure both to each other and to female portraits by campin similarity between van der weyden and campion s female portraits is so strong that they were sometimes misattributed see campbell 19 most are three quarter face and half length they typically set their models in front of a dark background that is uniform and nondescript while portraits are noted for their expressive pathos rogier van der weyden national gallery london retrieved 8 march 2010 facial features of women strongly resemble one another this indicates that although van der weyden did not adhere to tradition of idealised representation he sought to please his sitters in a manner that reflected contemporary ideals of beauty most of van der weyden s portraits were painted as commissions from nobility he painted only five including portrait of a lady that were not donor portraits portraits were at time a common means of initiating marriage alliances christus van eyck and van der weyden were known to have been employed for this reason in particular extent and level of detail that christus and van der weyden undertook to make their subjects appear attractive suggest this was often a primary motive see wilson 47 14 it is known that in his portrait of philip de croy c 1460 van der weyden complimented young flemish nobleman by concealing his large nose and undershot jaw when describing this tendency in relation to washington portrait art historian norbert schneider wrote while van eyck shows nature in raw as it were rogier improves on physical reality civilising and refining nature and human form with help of a brush high quality of painting is highlighted when compared to national gallery s very similar workshop painting london subject has softer more rounded features and is younger and less individually characterised than c 1460 model technique also is less subtle and fine in london work see hand and wolff 244 for a comparison however both share a similar expressions and dress van der weyden was more concerned with aesthetic and emotional response created by pictures overall than in specific portraits art historian and curator lorne campbell suggests that popularity of portrait is due more to elegant simplicity of pattern which sitter creates than to grace of her depiction while van der weyden did not stay within traditional realms of idealisation he created his own aesthetic which he extended across his portraits and religious pictures campbell 16 this aesthetic includes mood of sorrowful devotion which forms dominant tone in all his portraits his figures may be more natural than those of earlier generations of artists however his individualistic approach to depiction of his sitters piety often leads to abandonment of rules of scale campbell 28 john walker former director of national gallery of art referred to subject as outre but believed that despite awkwardness of her individual features model was nonetheless strangely beautiful walker 126 by time of work s completion van der weyden had eclipsed even van eyck in popularity and this painting is typical of austere spirituality over latter s sensuality for which van der weyden is renowned friedlaender 268 condition and provenance
