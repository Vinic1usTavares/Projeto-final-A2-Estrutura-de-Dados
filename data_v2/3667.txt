president mark pedowitz stated network s intention to have an arrowverse crossover every season after previous year s two part event with eighth episodes of third season of arrow and first season of flash titled flash vs arrow in july 2015 andrew kreisberg creator and executive producer on both series confirmed that eighth episodes of fourth season of arrow and second season of flash would be a two part crossover next month kreisberg revealed that crossover would help lay groundwork for new team up spin off series legends of tomorrow kreisberg said both arrow and flash are helping to set those things up in both big ways and small ways which is lovely there s going to be a lot happening leading up to crossover which is serving as a sort of pilot for legends kreisberg described crossover between both shows as a superhero a go go saying it s insane to have them all together unlike 2014 crossover which was two separate self contained adventures that involved each show marc guggenheim executive producer on arrow said this year s is a crazy full on to be continued crossover it really feels like a 2 hour movie airing over two nights kreisberg and guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up spin off series and that crossover is still oliver queen and barry allen having their own adventure these episodes have important stuff going on for narratives of both flash and arrow said while guggenheim added final moments of flash have a pretty big jaw and we pick up those threads in arrow then we do some things with characters from arrow that are pretty epic and major in flash episode caitlin and harry create a drug called velocity 6 to make barry faster against zoom kreisberg commented that it s safe to say that there ll be a few more iterations of that formula but viewers will have to wait and see how everything plays out and effects on those who use it teddy sears whose character jay garrick uses drug which temporarily restores his speed said while his character is not fixated on restoring his speed velocity 6 presents an interesting fix that will tempt him due to his haunting memories of his previous life with powers writing in july 2015 greg berlanti creator and executive producer on both series said we ve just been breaking into it over last week or so actually so we re really excited about it we ve got a great story lined up for towards end of fall early winter this year our real hope is to make a crossover that s even bigger and even more rewarding for audience than last years scripts for heroes join forces crossover were written in september 2015 berlanti created story for event and kreisberg and guggenheim helped to craft story of flash and arrow episodes respectively teleplay for flash was written by showrunners aaron and todd helbing arrows was written by brian ford sullivan and guggenheim filming filming of two episodes occurred from september 25 2015 until october 15 2015 flashs episode was directed by ralph hemecker and arrows by thor freudenthal berlanti discussed logistic nightmare of bringing three series together since first couple of episodes of legends of tomorrow had already been shot before filming of crossover episodes in addition there were characters from flash and arrow that we were also shooting out of those respective shows before we went into shooting legends to then have to come back and do introduction of some of characters here falk hentschel described filming as an acting marathon constantly moving from one set to another during day

week critical response alasdair wilkins writing for a v club described crossover as one big 90 minute movie and found it is only when viewer is well into broadcast that it becomes clear that there are two storylines from separate shows wilkins found legends of today and legends of yesterday charming feeling they operate on a more epic scale than either show s typical episode oliver s paternity storyline felt creaky to wilkins and he noted episodes again strained to set up latest spin off despite these faults he found overall effect of this crossover two parter pretty damn impressive and team up story grand enough to be more than sum of its parts screen rants alice walker also noted annual arrow flash crossover suffered from trying to set up legends she felt it too much to ask from busy storylines criticizing producers for planting more seeds than they could reap she felt crossovers had ceased to be a fun way to contrast two shows now that they had to set up a new world flash jesse schedeen of ign gave flash episode a score 7 5 out of 10 he was critical of episode s wonky pacing and story progression and given its legitimate two part storyline was disappointed it was not more cohesive than previous year s crossover he felt crossover had a fairly rocky start and wondered whether arrows characters were actually necessary to storyline even so said there was a lot of fun to be had in seeing both teams cross paths and grapple with an increasingly strange world of heroes and villains and was looking forward to a focused conclusion a v clubs scott von awarded episode an a saying legends of today is a sterling example of how to do this crossover thing right he noted that episode wove ongoing storylines into an expansive dc universe adventure calling it most purely enjoyable outing of season so far dave trumbore of collider gave flash episode 3 stars out of 5 saying not only did legends of today i e hawkman and hawkgirl do a good job introducing most of main players of legends of tomorrow it also provided a solid setup for new arrow episode legends of yesterday he described show as big adventurous fun but had same problem as he had with previous year s crossover in that when it gave screen time to flash it lost sight of its own identity entertainment weeklys jonathon dornbush gave flash episode a positive review stating while flash is burdened with part 1 setting up showdown in part 2 legends of today has its own big moments and plenty of laughs giving episode a 7 5 out of 10 eric walters of paste stated that unlike last year legends of today did not feel like a flash episode featuring team arrow he expected 2015 crossover would be bigger than previous years noting it is but it s also far from complete he felt that legends of today was not so much a flash episode but more like first half of something much larger in end he wished show had embraced it fully den of geek s mike cecchini gave episode 3 5 stars out of 5 saying i m really kind of amazed at just how much work legends of today gets done without just becoming a massive mess he described it as a proper two parter this year and concluded amidst all legends of tomorrow and fun of getting teams together legends of today still manages to move main flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple of neat ways arrow jesse schedeen gave arrows episode an 8 7 out of 10 noting that flash episode was saddled with setup while arrow gets to have fun with payoff he felt pace and storyline issues in legends of tomorrow flash episode were resolved satisfactorily inclusion of flashbacks and time travel gave it a larger scope and an added sense of drama as well ollie subplot allowed stephen amell to show a much different and more vulnerable side to his character wilkins awarded episode a b noting how much better show s entire dynamic is this season compared with last year he added that legends of yesterday shows oliver s conflict between keeping his friends safe and recognizing he cannot be victorious without them dave trumbore felt arrow episode tied up introduction of hawkgirl and hawkman and their nemesis vandal savage and effectively set up launch of cw s mid season spin off legends of tomorrow he gave it 4 stars out of 5 he added that crossover specials do a fantastic job of pulling back camera to reveal wider world that their heroes and villains share jonathon dornbush was impressed with carlos valdes performance saying while oliver naturally takes center stage and stephen amell steps up to task arguably giving his best performance on show yet secret mvp of hour is carlos valdes cisco who also happens to steal flashs half of crossover mark rozeman of paste gave arrow episode an 8 8 out of 10 saying episode has freedom to play around with its toys a bit more compared to unavoidable amount of world building and backstory that ended up massively bogging down crossover s first installment he felt crossover was fun and a rollicking good time kain praised shows creative team for making special feel like a legitimate event as opposed to just a half assed stab at ratings gold mike cecchini was pleased that episode was not another hour of fan service with little substance and felt legends of yesterday was a really good arrow oliver queen episode he praised amell s performance and highlighted that two teams really gelled nicely and just as barry and ollie felt like real friends during episode s dramatic moments flash and green arrow felt like natural teammates during superheroic moments he gave episode 3 5 stars out of 5 accolades collider com named second annual flash and arrow crossover one of 10 biggest superhero moments of 2015 saying two night crossover event was a great success reaffirming fun of universe they ve built and stoking
