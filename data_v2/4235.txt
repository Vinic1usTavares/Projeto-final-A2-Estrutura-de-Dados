prow and pleasure at helm also known as fair laughs morn and youth and pleasure is an oil painting on canvas by english artist william etty first exhibited in 1832 and currently in tate britain etty had been planning painting since 1818 19 and an early version was exhibited in 1822 piece was inspired by a metaphor in thomas gray s poem bard in which apparently bright start to notorious misrule of richard ii of england was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm etty chose to illustrate gray s lines literally depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near nude figures etty felt that his approach to work illustrated a moral warning about pursuit of pleasure but his approach was not entirely successful bard was about a supposed curse on house of plantagenet placed by a welsh bard following edward i of england s attempts to eradicate welsh culture and critics felt that etty had somewhat misunderstood point of gray s poem some reviewers greatly praised piece and in particular etty s technical abilities but audiences of time found it hard to understand purpose of etty s painting and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider work tasteless and offensive painting was bought in 1832 by robert vernon to form part of his collection of british art vernon donated his collection including youth on prow and pleasure at helm to national gallery in 1847 which in turn transferred it to tate gallery in 1949 it remains one of etty s best known works and formed part of major exhibitions at tate britain in 2001 02 and at york art gallery in 2011 12 background thumb dawn of love 1828 was intended to illustrate john milton s comus by end of 1820s etty had become notorious for his use of literary and mythological subjects as a pretext for nudity alt a naked woman attempts to wake a sleeping naked man william etty seventh son of a york baker and miller had been an apprentice printer in hull on completing his seven year apprenticeship at age of 18 he moved to london with a few pieces of chalk crayons and intention of becoming a history painter in tradition of old masters he enrolled in schools of royal academy of arts studying under renowned portrait painter thomas lawrence he submitted numerous paintings to royal academy over following decade all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited in 1821 etty s arrival of cleopatra in cilicia also known as triumph of cleopatra was a critical success painting featured nude figures and over following years etty painted further nudes in biblical literary and mythological settings all but one of 15 paintings etty exhibited in 1820s included at least one nude figure while some nudes existed in private collections england had no tradition of nude painting and display and distribution of nude material to public had been suppressed since 1787 proclamation for discouragement of vice etty was first british artist to specialise in nude and reaction of lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout 19th century although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent composition youth on prow and pleasure at helm was inspired by a passage in thomas gray s poem bard theme of bard was english king edward i s conquest of wales and a curse placed by a welsh bard upon edward s descendants after he ordered execution of all bards and eradication of welsh culture etty used a passage gray intended to symbolise seemingly bright start to disastrous reign of edward s great great grandson richard ii left thumb upright 0 9 william blake s treatment of same passage from bard gray s poem was a popular theme for artists alt a bearded man floats on sea with a storm cloud and a sunrise in background etty chose to illustrate gray s words literally creating what has been described as a poetic romance youth and pleasure depicts a small gilded boat above boat a nude figure representing zephyr blows on sails another nude representing pleasure lies on a large bouquet of flowers loosely holding helm of boat and allowing zephyr s breeze to guide it a nude child blows bubbles which another nude on prow of ship representing youth reaches to catch naiads again nude swim around and clamber on boat although seas are calm a sweeping whirlwind is forming on horizon with a demonic figure within storm clouds deterioration and restoration means this demonic figure is now barely visible intertwined limbs of participants were intended to evoke sensation of transient and passing pleasure and to express themes of female sexual appetites entrapping innocent youth and sexual power women hold over men etty said of his approach to text that he was hoping to create a general allegory of human life its empty vain pleasures if not founded on laws of him who is rock of ages while etty felt that work conveyed a clear moral warning about pursuit of pleasure this lesson was largely lost upon its audiences when etty exhibited completed painting at royal academy summer exhibition in 1832 it was shown untitled with relevant six lines from bard attached writers at time sometimes referred to it by its incipit of fair laughs morn by time of etty s death in 1849 it had acquired its present title of youth on prow and pleasure at helm versions right thumb 1822 version of painting provoked a strong reaction from times for its supposed indecency alt gold boat full of naked people right thumb three female nudes attributed to etty is possibly either a study for or derived from youth and pleasure but may be a study for an unrelated work alt three nude women on a rock with a sea serpent coiling around rock final version of youth and pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832 but etty had been contemplating a painting on theme since 1818 19 in 1822 he had exhibited an early version at british institution titled a sketch from one of gray s odes youth on prow in this version group of figures on prow is reversed and swimmers around boat are absent another rough version of painting also survives similar to 1832 version but again with figures on prow reversed this version was exhibited at a retrospective of etty s work at society of arts in 1849 it is dated 1848 but this is likely to be a misprint of 1828 making it a preliminary study for 1832 painting although it received little notice when first exhibited 1822 version provoked a strong reaction from times an oil sketch attributed to etty given to york art gallery in 1952 by judith hare countess of listowel and entitled three female nudes is possibly a preliminary study by etty for youth and pleasure or a copy by a student of three central figures art historian sarah burnage considers both possibilities unlikely as neither arrangement of figures subject matter or sea serpent approaching group appear to relate to completed youth and pleasure and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now unknown work reception youth on prow and pleasure at helm met with a mixed reception on exhibition and while critics generally praised etty s technical ability there was a certain confusion as to what painting was actually intended to represent and a general feeling that he had seriously misunderstood what bard was actually about library of fine arts felt in classical design anatomical drawing elegance of attitude fineness of form and of grouping no doubt mr etty has no superior and while representation of ideas in lines quoted from bard are beautifully and accurately expressed upon canvas they considered ulterior reference of poet to destruction of welsh culture and decline of house of plantagenet was entirely lost sight of and that if this be nearest that art can approach in conveying to eye happy exemplification of subject which gray intended we fear we must give up contest upon merits of poetry and painting similar concerns were raised in times which observed that it was full of beauty rich in colouring boldly and accurately drawn and composed with a most graceful fancy but meaning of it if it has any meaning no man can tell pointing out that although it was intended to illustrate gray it would represent almost as well any other poet s fancies examiner meanwhile took issue with cramped and overladen boat pointing out that characters if not exactly jammed together like figs in a basket are sadly constrained for want of room and also complained that boat would not in reality float half weight which is made to press upon it other reviewers were kinder gentleman s magazine praised etty s ability to capture beauty of proportion of antique noting that in central figures there is far more of than is to be seen in almost any modern picture and considered overall composition a most fortunate combination of of poetry and reality of nature athenaeum considered it a poetic picture from a very poetic passage praising etty for telling a story which is very difficult to tell with pencil greatest criticism of youth and pleasure came from morning chronicle a newspaper which had long disliked etty s female nudes it complained no decent family can hang such sights against their wall and condemned painting as an indulgence of what we once hoped a classical but which are now convinced is a lascivious mind commenting course of etty s studies should run in a purer channel and that he should not persist with an unhallowed fancy to pursue nature to her holy recesses he is a laborious draughtsman and a beautiful colourist but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on naked truth reviewer added we fear that mr e will never turn from his wicked ways and make himself fit for decent company legacy right thumb upright gratuitous nudity made youth and pleasure a popular piece for tableau vivant performances at time only form of live entertainment in which nudity was permitted alt handbill advertising madame warton s performance of youth on prow and pleasure at helm youth on prow and pleasure at helm was purchased at time of its exhibition by robert vernon for his important collection of british art price vernon paid for youth and pleasure is not recorded although etty s records a partial payment of ps250 about ps in terms so it is likely to have been a substantial sum vernon later purchased john constable s valley farm planning to hang it in place then occupied by youth and pleasure this decision caused constable to comment my picture is to go into place where etty s bumboat is at present his picture with its precious freight is to be brought down nearer to nose vernon presented his collection to nation in 1847 and his 157 paintings including youth and pleasure entered national gallery when samuel carter hall was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched art journal he considered it important to promote new british artists even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive in 1849 hall secured reproduction rights to paintings vernon had given to nation and soon published and widely distributed an engraving of painting under title youth and pleasure describing it as of very highest class needled by repeated attacks from press on his supposed indecency poor taste and lack of creativity etty changed his approach after response to youth on prow and pleasure at helm he exhibited over 80 further paintings at royal academy alone and remained a prominent painter of nudes but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons he died in november 1849 and while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity interest in him declined over time and by end of 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices in 1949 painting was transferred from national gallery to tate gallery where it remains although youth and pleasure is one of etty s best known paintings it remains controversial and dennis farr s 1958 biography of etty describes it as singularly inept it was one of five works by etty chosen for tate britain s landmark exposed victorian nude exhibition in 2001 02 and also formed part of a major retrospective of etty s work at york art gallery in 2011 12 footnotes references notes bibliography
