which her forward superstructure was rebuilt in pagoda mast style ise was reconstructed in 1934 1937 with improvements to her armour and her propulsion machinery afterwards she played a minor role in second sino japanese war despite expensive reconstruction ship was considered obsolete by eve of pacific war and did not see significant action in early years of war following loss of most of ijn s large aircraft carriers during battle of midway in mid 1942 she was rebuilt with a flight deck replacing rear pair of gun turrets to give her ability to operate an air group of floatplanes lack of aircraft and qualified pilots meant that ise never actually operated her aircraft in combat she participated in battle off cape engano in late 1944 where she was one of ships that american carrier

four japanese aircraft carriers during battle of midway in june severely limited ability of ijn to conduct operations and alternatives were sought plans for full conversions of battleships into

october by morning of 24 october main body was within range of northernmost american carriers of task force 38 and ozawa ordered an air strike launched by third carrier division ise and hyuga had no aircraft aboard to attract attention of americans this accomplished little else as japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past defending fighters survivors landed at airfields on philippine island of luzon americans were preoccupied dealing with other japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from luzon and leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for japanese carriers until afternoon they finally found them but admiral william halsey jr commander of task force 38 decided that it was too late in day to mount an effective strike he did however turn

attacked ships as did submarine one of ises aa guns caused one of blowers torpedoes to detonate prematurely later that afternoon launched one of her floatplanes which spotted submarine on surface about ahead of convoy hyuga opened fire with her main guns and forced to submerge when one of her shells landed within of submarine convoy reached matsu islands off chinese coast on 15th and was
