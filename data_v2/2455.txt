as aliens andrew stanton as evil emperor zurg production development talk of a sequel to toy story began around a month after film s opening in december 1995 a few days after original film s release lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a woody doll at an airport lasseter described how boy s excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only but rather it belonged to others as well memory was a defining factor in production of toy story 2 with lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved characters ed catmull lasseter and ralph guggenheim visited joe roth successor to recently ousted jeffrey katzenberg as chairman of walt disney studios shortly afterward roth was pleased and embraced idea of a sequel disney had recently begun making direct to video sequels to its successful features and roth wanted to handle toy story sequel this way as well prior releases such as 1994 s aladdin sequel return of jafar had returned an estimated 100 million in profits initially everything regarding sequel was uncertain at first whether stars tom hanks and tim allen would be available and affordable what story premise would be and even whether film would be computer animated at pixar or traditionally hand drawn at walt disney feature animation lasseter regarded project as a chance to groom new directing talent as top choices were already immersed in other projects andrew stanton as co director in a bug s life and pete docter as director of what would eventually become monsters inc instead lasseter turned to ash brannon a young directing animator on toy story whose work he admired brannon a calarts graduate joined toy story team in 1993 disney and pixar officially announced sequel in a press release on march 12 1997 story story of toy story 2 is based a lot on my own experience i m a big toy collector and a lot of them are like antiques or one of a kind toys or prototypes toy makers have given me well i have five sons and when they were little and they loved to come to daddy s work and come in into daddy s office and they just want to touch and play with everything and i was sitting there saying oh no that s uh you can t play with that one oh no play with this one oh no and i found myself just sitting there looking at myself and laughing because toys are manufactured put on this earth to be played with by a child that is core essence of toy story and so i started wondering what was it like from a toy s point of view to be collected director john lasseter lasseter s intention with a sequel was to respect original film and create that world again story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or worse a child growing out of a toy brannon suggested idea of a yard sale where collector recognizes woody as a rare artifact concept of woody as a collectible set came from draft story of a tin toy christmas an original half hour special pitched by pixar to disney in 1990 obsessive toy collector named al mcwhiggin who had appeared in a draft of toy story but was later expunged was inserted into film lasseter claimed that al was inspired by himself making of toy story 2 disc 2 toy story 2 2 disc special edition dvd 2005 secondary characters in woody s set were inspired by 1940s 1950s western and puppet shows for children such as four feather falls cassidy and howdy doody development of jessie was kindled by lasseter s wife nancy who pressed him to include a strong female character in sequel one with more substance than bo peep scope for original toy story was basic and only extended over two residential homes roadways and a chain restaurant whereas toy story 2 has been described by unkrich as something all over map to make project ready for theaters lasseter would need to add 12 minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there extra material would be a challenge since it could not be mere padding it would have to feel as if it had always been there an organic part of film with scheduled delivery date less than a year away lasseter called stanton docter joe ranft and some disney story people to his house for a weekend there he hosted what he called a story summit a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days back at office that monday lasseter assembled company in a screening room and pitched revised version of toy story 2 from exposition to resolution story elements were recycled from original drafts of first toy story original film s original opening sequence featured a buzz lightyear cartoon playing on television which evolved into buzz lightyear video game that would be shown in opening toy story 2 a deleted scene from toy story featuring woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can was incorporated in a milder form for depicting woody s fear of losing andy idea of a squeak toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of toy story animation as story approached production stage in early 1997 it was unclear whether pixar would produce film as entire team of 300 was busy working on a bug s life for a 1998 release interactive products group with a staff of 95 had its own animators art department and engineers under intense time pressure they had put out two successful cd rom titles previous year disney s animated storybook toy story and toy story activity center between two products group had created as much original animation as there was in toy story itself steve jobs made decision to shut down computer games operation and staff became initial core of toy story 2 production team before switch from direct to video to feature film toy story 2 crew had been on its own placed in a new building that was well separated from rest of company by railroad tracks we were just small film and we were off playing in our sandbox co producer karen jackson said lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout film reused digital elements from toy story but true to company s prevailing culture of perfectionism it reused less of toy story than might be expected character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements team freely borrowed models from other productions such as geri from pixar s 1997 short geri s game who became cleaner in toy story 2 supervising animator glenn mcqueen inspired animators to do spectacular work in short amount of time given assigning different shots to suit each animators strengths while producing toy story crew was careful in creating new locations working within available technology at that time by time of production on toy story 2 technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in first film in making sequel team at pixar did not want to stray too far from first film s look but company had developed a lot of new software since first feature had been completed to achieve dust visible after woody is placed on top of a shelf crew was faced with challenge of animating dust an incredibly difficult task after much experimentation a tiny particle of dust was animated and computer distributed that image throughout entire shelf over two million dust particles are in place on shelf in completed film controversy and troubled production when we went from a direct to video to a feature film and we had limited time in which to finish that feature film pressure really amped up forget seeing your family forget doing anything once we made that decision on schedule it was like okay you have a release date you re going to make that release date you re going to make these screenings karen jackson co producer of toy story 2 disney became unhappy with pace of work on film and demanded in june 1997 that guggenheim be replaced as producer and pixar complied as a result karen jackson and helene plotkin associate producers moved up into roles of co producers lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with a bug s life until it wrapped in fall once available he took over directing duties and added lee unkrich as co director unkrich also fresh from supervising editor duties on a bug s life would focus on layout and cinematography while brannon would be credited as co director in november 1997 disney executives roth and peter schneider viewed film s story reels with some finished animation in a screening room at pixar they were impressed with quality of work and became interested in releasing toy story 2 in theaters in addition to unexpected artistic caliber there were other reasons that made case for a theatrical release more compelling economics of a direct to video pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to higher salaries of crew after negotiations jobs and roth agreed that split of costs and profits for toy story 2 would follow model of a newly created five film deal but toy story 2 would not count as one of five films disney had bargained in contract for five original features not sequels thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise jobs gathered crew and announced change in plans for film on february 5 1998 work done on film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of animators while routinely clearing some files accidentally started a deletion of root folder of toy story 2 assets on pixar s internal servers associate technical director oren jacob was one of first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress they shut down file servers but had lost 90 of last two years of work and backups were found to have failed some time previously film was saved when technical director susman who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child revealed she had backups of assets on her home computer pixar team was able to recover nearly all of lost assets save for a few recent days of work allowing film to proceed however many of creative staff at pixar were not happy with how sequel was turning out upon returning from european promotion of a bug s life lasseter watched development reels and agreed that it was not working pixar met with disney telling them that film would have to be redone disney disagreed and noted that pixar did not have enough time to remake film before its established release date pixar decided that they simply could not allow film to be released in its existing state and asked lasseter to take over production lasseter agreed and recruited first film s creative team to redevelop story to meet disney s deadline pixar had to complete entire film in nine months unkrich concerned with dwindling amount of time remaining asked jobs whether release date could be pushed back jobs explained that there was no choice presumably in reference to film s licensees and marketing partners who were getting toys and promotions ready brannon focused on development story and animation lasseter was in charge of art modeling and lighting and unkrich oversaw editorial and layout since they met daily to discuss their progress with each other they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in same direction boundaries of their responsibilities overlapped as was common with pixar features production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer still toy story 2 with its highly compressed production schedule was especially trying while hard work and long hours were common to team by that point especially so to lasseter running flat out on toy story 2 for month after month began to take a toll overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators and repetitive strain injuries for others catmull would later disclose that a full third of staff ended up with some form of rsi by time film was finished pixar did not encourage long hours and in fact set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime employees self imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints and were especially common to younger employees in one instance an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and in a mental haze forgot baby in back seat of his car in parking lot although quick action by rescue workers headed off worst incident became a horrible indicator that some on crew were working too hard wrote david price in his 2008 book pixar touch music and soundtrack toy story 2 an original walt disney records soundtrack is original score soundtrack album to toy story 2 although out of print in u s cd is available in u s as an import and all but one song is available digitally randy newman wrote two new songs for toy story 2 as well as complete original score when she loved me performed by sarah mclachlan used for flashback montage in which jessie experiences being loved forgotten then abandoned by her owner emily song was nominated

november 12 1999 in recognition of school s ties with lasseter and more than 40 other alumni who worked on film students were captivated film held its official premiere next day at el capitan theatre in los angeles same venue as toy story and was released across united states on november 24 1999 film s initial theatrical and video releases include luxo jr pixar s first short film released in 1986 starring pixar s titular mascot before luxo jr a disclaimer appears reading in 1986 pixar animation studios produced their first film this is why we have a hopping lamp in our logo on december 25 1999 within a month of film s theatrical release a blooper reel was added to film s mid credits re releases in 2009 both toy story and toy story 2 were converted to 3 d for a two week limited theatrical re release which was extended due to its success lasseter said toy story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we re so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to latest in 3 d technology with toy story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for buzz woody and gang from andy s room we thought it would be great to let audiences experience first two films all over again and in a brand new way translating films into 3 d involved revisiting original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene creating left eye and right eye views needed to achieve perception of depth unique to computer animation lasseter referred to this process as digital archaeology lead bob whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that impacted film s emotional storytelling it took four months to resurrect old data and get it in working order then adding 3 d to each of films took six months per film double feature was opened in 1 745 theaters on october 2 2009 and made 12 5 million in its opening weekend finishing in third place at box office features closed on november 5
