finnish defence intelligence agency is combined signals sigint geospatial geoint and imagery intelligence imint agency of finnish defence forces operational since 2014 its responsibility is to support defence of finland through information gathering and analysis as an intelligence agency organic to intelligence division of defence command agency s sigint history can be traced back to establishment of finnish radio intelligence in 1927 by reino hallamaa a defence command intelligence officer while its geoint history starts from 1812 with establishment of haapaniemi military surveying school and topographical service successes of its predecessors are considered instrumental in key battles of winter and continuation war during 1939 1944 such as intelligence at largest battle in history of nordic countries battle of tali ihantala organization thumb a fokker f27 model used by agency pictured in 2011 at joensuu airport left 200x200px function finnish defence intelligence agency is subordinate to intelligence division of defence command and its self stated tasks include analysing military strategies gathering geospatial and meteorological intelligence training defence forces and partner staff such as police or border guard as well as supporting peacekeeping operations such as finnish deployments to war in afghanistan with information services news reports and other independent sources usually describe it as main sigint geoint and imint agency of finnish military it was formed on 1 may 2014 by merging finnish military intelligence centre finnish intelligence research establishment and counter intelligence assets from intelligence division according to a 2014 interview with chief of intelligence then brigadier general harri aho merger enabled a more comprehensive intelligence overview and enhanced analytical cooperation agency s main elements are situated in helsinki and jyvaskyla with separate elements around finland according to a news report it employed 150 200 persons and its budget was 15 million euros in 2014 preceding sigint and imint arm of military finnish intelligence research establishment operated principally as a part of finnish air force headquarters at tikkakoski near jyvaskyla facility received its orders from defence command and employed 120 140 personnel according to a 2007 news report it was renamed finnish intelligence research centre when it became a subunit of agency according to a 2017 expose by finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat finnish intelligence research centre is responsible for monitoring russian armed forces by capturing and analysing electromagnetic radiation and maintaining an electronic intelligence mapping that contains information on russian military such as unit types command and control structures air defences readiness plans and missions during peacetime centre monitors at least leningrad military district while only a fraction of its monitoring is focused on western world centre reports its findings first to intelligence division and finally to president prime minister defence minister and high command of defence forces newspaper released examples of intelligence research centre s analysis topics such as russian synthetic aperture radars from 2005 security related effects of nord stream pipeline electronic countermeasures against buk missiles and russian military action during russo georgian war of 2008 before merger strategic analysis focused finnish military intelligence centre had been located in helsinki since 2007 and contained a topographical unit specialized in geoint as well as an intelligence school most information on agency or its predecessors is not public per finnish law regarding intelligence research establishment virtually every document concerning closer details such as leadership structure or intelligence processes were confirmed as secret by a supreme administrative court ruling in 2007 except for budget and employee count equipment in addition to land based intercept and listening stations facility gathers airborne imint and sigint for example intelligence research establishment started using a fokker f27 friendship airplane in 1991 and procured an eads casa c 295 tactical transport aircraft in 2012 to be fitted with a lockheed martin intermodal container based dragon shield electronic signals intelligence suite casa entered service in 2016 during procurement casa was required to be able to monitor signals from 1 5 mhz to 40 ghz listen to a minimum of a hundred different channels and be nato compatible to fulfil its intended mission full cost of airborne electronic signals intelligence programme was around 250 270 million euros according to helsingin sanomat history signals intelligence 1927 1939 thumb a dugout listening station in along svir river during continuation war in 1942 finland s history in signals intelligence sigint can be traced back to 1927 and birth of finnish radio intelligence on 14 june 1927 lieutenant reino hallamaa was transferred to statistics office of defence command a cover for military intelligence unit and ordered to create a radio intelligence capacity for finnish defence forces to kickstart process hallamaa studied radio intelligence theory and methods around europe recruited mathematicians and russian translators procured signal detectors and radio receivers built listening stations and started exchanging decrypted messages with counterparts such as polish intelligence for example he visited germany austria switzerland italy czechoslovakia and poland to examine sigint and cryptanalysis capabilities and equipment by 1929 statistics office was able to decrypt diplomatic cables such as united states messaging between washington d c and its embassy in helsinki to benefit of state leadership by 1934 office could intercept and decrypt soviet navy messages after monitoring and comparing its communications and movement extensively with a hansa brandenburg w 33 reconnaissance plane above gulf of finland and from neighbouring islands it also was able to ascertain most of soviet union s winter war invasion plans in advance through radio listening on eve of winter war 29 november 1939 office intercepted soviet messages to armored brigades to commence invasion as well as russian for torch invasion codes sent to soviet baltic fleet 1939 1944 as winter war began in 1939 hallamaa and sigint assets under his command were reorganized as signals intelligence office signals intelligence office was able to intercept soviet messages and inform colonel hjalmar siilasvuo of enemy s movements during battle of suomussalmi with intelligence colonel siilasvuo had initiative and could pocket and destroy soviet 44th rifle division at road division had been en route to support already encircled 163rd rifle division for example finns intercepted messages guiding encircled soviet troops how to light up signal fires for air supply pilots to recognize during night time subsequently finns lighted similar fires and some of soviet supplies landed on finn held ground over 20 000 soviet troops were killed and military hardware in dire need such as 43 tanks and 71 field guns was captured decisive victory by finnish army against superior enemy forces is cited as one of most significant battles of winter war during interim peace in 1940 hallamaa traded cracked soviet ciphers with other states to fund finnish signals intelligence operations for example to swedes in exchange for rca transmitters hallamaa was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed commander of defence command s radio battalion in october 1941 during early months of continuation war finnish radio intelligence had grown from 75 persons during winter war to approximately 1 000 soldiers reportedly they were able to decrypt 80 percent of soviet messages on finnish front collaboration and exchange of soviet ciphers with japan bore fruit when soviets switched their western front ciphers in late 1941 with eastern ciphers used in vladivostok immediately due to exchange in 1942 finnish intelligence cracked telegrams of allied convoys pq 17 and pq 18 heading to arkhangelsk soviet union and supplied information to abwehr german military intelligence finnish intelligence also made mistakes by revealing too much of its knowledge such as in 1941 when eager personnel messaged red fleet with its own ciphers to surrender fleet immediately switched their ciphers and frequencies likewise too much radio intelligence based information of airplane shot down by soviets bombers during peacetime was published most likely allowing soviets to learn of cracked ciphers amidst battle of tali ihantala in summer of 1944 considered largest battle in nordic military history finnish radio intelligence intercepted soviet messaging of divisions assembling to launch attacks due to captured information finnish artillery as well as finnish and german aircraft notably german detachment were able to pre emptively render soviet units waiting in assembly zones ineffective subsequently 50 000 person finnish defence was able to halt 150 000 person soviet attack and overall vyborg petrozavodsk offensive final large scale operation of continuation war av caesar finnish air force started its independent signals intelligence operations by establishing a radio intelligence company on 10 october 1942 later reorganized into a 500 person radio intelligence battalion in march 1944 and shut down after continuation war while hallamaa and his intelligence unit focused on land and sea based messaging air force naturally focused on air based intelligence 1944 present in autumn of 1944 after moscow armistice 700 to 800 finnish sigint staff fled to sweden with 350 crates of cryptography equipment in operation stella polaris led by colonels aladar paasonen and reino hallamaa goal of operation was to escape soviet retribution and communist takeover of finnish state police as well as to try and create a contingency sigint service if it would be required later on against a possible soviet union occupation of finland likewise material concerning sigint of finnish military was destroyed or hidden in sweden c of swedish military and national defence radio establishment coordinated operation at their end and received for example cracked ciphers from finns some war time documents hidden in operation were later reportedly found in microfilms for example at cia s central archives and nsa s national cryptologic museum while some have not resurfaced most of sigint staff were returned to finland by sweden after temporary internment and some 30 of them were interrogated by state police although no indictments were issued colonels paasonen and hallamaa did not return to finland during rest of their lives finnish intelligence research establishment was founded in 24 october 1955 within finnish air force first as intelligence research station in central helsinki establishment expanded throughout 1960s by building intercept stations and by appointing personnel to statistical units of air force and navy in december 1973 its headquarters relocated to tikkakoski garrison near jyvaskyla in 2014 intelligence research establishment was merged into finnish defence intelligence agency and it was redesignated intelligence research centre in december 2017 newspaper helsingin sanomat wrote an expose about intelligence research centre based on leaked classified defence forces documents president of finland sauli niinisto issued a statement where he deemed leak illegal and critical to national security and a criminal investigation was initiated geospatial intelligence thumb in 1944 at light and sound surveying data of soviet artillery locations received by phone during a battle is converted onto a map and immediately relayed to friendly batteries finnish geospatial intelligence geoint is considered to have started with haapaniemi military surveying school and topographical service established in 1812 in grand duchy of finland modern finland during 1918 finnish civil war major claes organized and led war topography division of white finland s military and continued in same role at defence command after finnish independence first months of division were hectic in assembling all maps it could find and organizing map printing services unit was reorganized more than twenty times until turn of century with different names such as topography office topography section and topography division similarly general vilho petter nenonen created a parallel surveying battery in 1924 to support imagery meteorological and topographical intelligence of finnish artillery with officers being educated at university of helsinki on surveying theory responsibilities of topography section of defence command and surveying battery overlapped during 1920s and 1930s and units disagreed on whether to centralize or decentralize geoint assets two separate surveying batteries and a topography company were mobilized in 1939 during winter war and four surveying batteries and a topography battalion during continuation war they supported frontline operations of finnish defence forces mostly at karelian isthmus while topographical unit of defence command continued its headquarters level geoint duties first as a section and later as a division during 2 week battle of tali ihantala in june 1944 topographical and surveying capability of finnish artillery especially trajectory corrector developed by nenonen allowed accurate simultaneous and concentrated fire of 21 artillery batteries approximately 240 guns to support counter attacks and render assembling soviet spearheads ineffective with an approximate total of 110 000 to 120 000 rounds of ordnance roughly 70 of approximately 22 000 soviet casualties were caused by artillery and mortar fire barrage was considered a world record of artillery at time and according to and others halted and destroyed over thirty soviet formations larger than a battalion after wars and demobilization surveying battery was transferred from its original location in hameenlinna to niinisalo in 1950 and bolstered in 1952 into an independent surveying artillery battalion directly under defence command likewise in 1952 topography division was organized back into its former name topography section as an independent unit this status quo remained until surveying artillery battalion was transferred in 1979 within niinisalo artillery school and later renamed as intelligence artillery battalion in 2007 topography section was merged into finnish military intelligence centre and in 2014 to finnish defence intelligence agency see also cold war ii european centre of
