albatrosses of biological family diomedeidae are large seabirds related to procellariids storm petrels and diving petrels in order procellariiformes tubenoses they range widely in southern ocean and north pacific they are absent from north atlantic although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found albatrosses are among largest of flying birds and species of genus diomedea great albatrosses have longest wingspans of any extant birds reaching up to albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera but disagreement exists over number of species albatrosses are highly efficient in air using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion it is only bird that can fly 10 000 miles without landing they feed on squid fish and krill by either scavenging surface seizing or diving albatrosses are colonial nesting for most part on remote oceanic islands often with several species nesting together pair bonds between males and females form over several years with use of ritualised dances and last for life of pair a breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt a laysan albatross named wisdom on midway island is recognised as oldest wild bird in world she was first banded in 1956 by chandler robbins of 22 species of albatrosses recognised by iucn all are listed as at some level of concern three species are critically endangered five species are endangered seven species are near threatened and seven species are vulnerable numbers of albatrosses have declined in past due to harvesting for feathers albatrosses are threatened by introduced species such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs chicks and nesting adults by pollution by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing and by longline fishing longline fisheries pose greatest threat as feeding birds are attracted to bait become hooked on lines and drown identified stakeholders such as governments conservation organisations and people in fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch science taxonomy and evolution albatross designation comprises between 13 and 24 species number is still a matter of some debate 21 being most commonly accepted number in four genera these genera are great albatrosses diomedea mollymawks thalassarche north pacific albatrosses phoebastria and sooty albatrosses or sooties phoebetria north pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to great albatrosses while sooty albatrosses are considered closer to mollymawks taxonomy of albatross group has been a source of much debate sibley ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order ciconiiformes whereas ornithological organisations in north america europe south africa australia and new zealand retain more traditional order procellariiformes albatrosses can be separated from other procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics size their legs and arrangement of their nasal tubes see below morphology and flight within family assignment of genera has been debated for over 100 years originally placed into a single genus diomedea they were rearranged by reichenbach into four different genera in 1852 then lumped back together and split apart again several times acquiring 12 different genus names in total though never more than eight at one time by 1965 diomedea phoebastria thalassarche phoebetria and thumb skeleton of a black browed albatross thalassarche melanophris on display at museum of osteology by 1965 in an attempt to bring some order back to classification of albatrosses they were lumped into two genera phoebetria sooty albatrosses which most closely seemed to resemble procellarids and were at time considered primitive and diomedea rest though a case was made for simplification of family particularly nomenclature classification was based on morphological analysis by elliott coues in 1866 and paid little attention to more recent studies and even ignored some of coues s suggestions more recent research by gary nunn of american museum of natural history 1996 and other researchers around world studied mitochondrial dna of all 14 accepted species finding four not two monophyletic groups within albatrosses they proposed resurrection of two of old genus names phoebastria for north pacific albatrosses and thalassarche for mollymawks with great albatrosses retaining diomedea and sooty albatrosses staying in phoebetria both british ornithologists union and south african authorities split albatrosses into four genera as nunn suggested and change has been accepted by majority of researchers while some agree on number of genera fewer agree on number of species historically up to 80 different taxa have been described by different researchers most of these were incorrectly

antipodean albatross and tristan albatross were distinct from wandering albatross per robertson and nunn but found that suggested gibson s albatross diomedea was not distinct from antipodean albatross for most part an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by itis and many other researchers though by no means all in 2004 and wink called for number of species to be reduced to 13 including lumping of amsterdam albatross with wandering albatross although this paper was itself controversial on all sides is widespread agreement on need for further research to clarify issue sibley and ahlquist s molecular study of evolution of bird families has put radiation of procellariiformes in oligocene period 35 30 million years ago mya though this group probably originated earlier with a fossil sometimes attributed to order a seabird known as being found in late cretaceous rocks 70 mya molecular evidence suggests that storm petrels were first to diverge from ancestral stock and albatrosses next with procellarids and diving petrels separating later earliest fossil albatrosses were found in eocene to oligocene rocks although some of these are only tentatively assigned to family and none appear to be particularly close to living forms they are middle eocene of uzbekistan manu early oligocene of new zealand and an undescribed form from late oligocene of south carolina

data on fossil species of living albatross genera see generic articles morphology and flight thumb portrait of a southern royal albatross diomedea epomophora note large hooked beak and nasal tubes albatrosses are a group of large to very large birds they are largest of procellariiformes bill is large strong and sharp edged with upper mandible terminating in a large hook this bill is composed of several horny plates and along sides are two tubes long nostrils that give order its former name tubes of all albatrosses are along sides of bill unlike rest of procellariiformes where tubes run along top of bill these tubes allow albatrosses to measure exact airspeed in flight nostrils are analogous to pitot tubes in modern aircraft albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring like other procellariiformes they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources whereas most birds depend on eyesight feet have no hind toe and three anterior toes are completely webbed legs are strong for procellariiformes making them and giant petrels only members of that order that can walk well on land albatrosses along with all procellariiformes must excrete salts they ingest in drinking sea water and eating marine invertebrates all birds have an enlarged nasal gland at base of bill above their eyes this gland is inactive in species that do not require it but in procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5 saline solution that drips out of their noses or is forcibly ejected thumb left taking off is one of main times albatrosses use flapping to fly and is most energetically demanding part of a journey adult plumage of most of albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper wing and back with white undersides often compared to that of a gull extent of colouration varies southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for ends and trailing edges of wings in fully mature males while amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile like breeding plumage with a great deal of brown particularly a strong brown band around chest several species of mollymawks and north pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on head and nape three albatross species black footed albatross and two sooty albatrosses vary completely from usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown or dark grey in places in case of light mantled albatross albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage wingspans of largest great albatrosses genus diomedea are largest of any bird exceeding although other species wingspans are considerably smaller at down to wings are stiff and cambered with thickened streamlined leading edges albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long winged seabirds dynamic soaring and slope soaring dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind thus gaining energy from vertical wind gradient only effort expended is in turns at top and bottom of every such loop this maneuver allows bird to cover almost 1000 km day without flapping its wings slope soaring uses rising air on windward side of large waves albatross have high glide ratios around 22 1 to 23 1 meaning that for every metre they drop they can travel forward 22 metres they are aided in soaring by a shoulder lock a sheet of tendon that locks wing when fully extended allowing wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure a morphological adaptation they share with giant petrels thumb right albatrosses range over huge areas of ocean and regularly circle globe albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with use of predictable weather systems albatrosses in southern hemisphere flying north from their colonies take a clockwise route and those flying south fly counterclockwise albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting this efficiency is such that most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not distance covered but landings take offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source a common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight although no direct evidence has ever been obtained this efficient long distance travelling underlies albatross s success as a long distance forager covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves but their long wings are ill suited to powered flight and most species lack muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight albatrosses in calm seas rest on ocean s surface until wind picks up again as using powered flight is not energetically worthwhile though they are capable of flight to avoid danger north pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap gliding where bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding when taking off albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under wing to provide lift dynamic soaring of albatrosses is inspiring to airplane designers german aerospace engineer johannes and colleagues have charted albatross s nuanced flight pattern and are looking for ways to apply this to aircraft especially in area of drones and unmanned aircraft distribution and range at sea thumb three birds on midway atoll 1958 most albatrosses range in southern hemisphere from antarctica to australia south africa and south america exceptions to this are four north pacific albatrosses of which three occur exclusively in north pacific from hawaii to japan california and alaska and one waved albatross breeds in galapagos islands and feeds off coast of south america need for wind to enable gliding is reason albatrosses are for most part confined to higher latitudes being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing doldrums extremely difficult exception waved albatross is able to live in equatorial waters around galapagos islands because of cool waters of humboldt current and resulting winds it is not known for certain why albatrosses became extinct in north atlantic although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period are thought to have submerged site of a short tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in bermuda some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in north atlantic and can become exiled remaining there for decades one of these exiles a black browed albatross returned to gannet colonies in scotland for many years in an attempt to breed cocker m mabey r 2005 birds britannica london chatto windus use of satellite tracking is teaching scientists a great deal about way albatrosses range across ocean to find food they undertake no annual migration but disperse widely after breeding southern hemisphere species often undertake circumpolar trips evidence also exists of separate ranges for different species at sea a comparison of foraging niches of two related species that breed on campbell island campbell albatross and grey headed albatross showed campbell albatross primarily fed over campbell plateau whereas grey headed albatross fed in more pelagic oceanic waters wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry feeding only in waters deeper than 1000 m ft so rigidly did satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked it almost appears as if birds notice and obey a no entry sign where water shallows to less than 1000 m also evidence shows different ranges for two sexes of same species a study of tristan albatrosses breeding on gough island showed that males foraged to west of gough and females to east birdlife has satellite tracking records for each of 22 species of albatross in their seabird tracking database diet thumb light mantled albatrosses regularly dive to feed and can dive to below 12 m 39 ft albatross diet is predominantly cephalopods fish crustaceans and offal organ meat although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only breeding season when albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species and even from population to population some concentrate on squid alone others take more krill or fish of two albatross species found in hawaii one black footed albatross takes mostly fish while laysan feeds on squid use of data loggers at sea that record ingestion of water against time providing a likely time of feeding suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during day analysis of squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses has shown that many of squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive and include mid water species likely to be beyond reach of albatross suggesting that for some species like wandering albatross scavenged squid may be an important part of diet source of these dead squid is a matter of debate some certainly comes from squid fisheries but in nature it primarily comes from die off that occurs after squid spawning and vomit of squid eating whales sperm whales pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales diet of other species like black browed albatross or grey headed albatross is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism harassing boobies to steal their food making it only member of its order to do so regularly until recently albatrosses were thought to be predominantly surface feeders swimming at surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to surface by currents predators or death deployment of capillary depth recorders which record maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird has shown that while some species like wandering albatross do not dive deeper than a metre some species like light mantled albatross have a mean diving depth of almost 5 m and can dive as deep as 12 5 m in addition to surface feeding and diving they have also been observed plunge diving from air to snatch prey breeding and dancing albatrosses are colonial usually nesting on isolated islands where colonies are on larger landmasses they are found on exposed headlands with good approaches from sea in several directions like colony on otago peninsula in dunedin new zealand many buller s albatrosses and black footed albatrosses nest under trees in open forest colonies vary from very dense aggregations favoured by mollymawks black browed albatross colonies on falkland islands have densities of 70 nests per 100 m2 to much looser groups and widely spaced individual nests favoured by sooty and great albatrosses all albatross colonies are on islands that historically were free of land mammals albatrosses are highly meaning they usually return to their natal colony to breed this tendency is so strong that a study of laysan albatrosses showed that average distance between hatching site and site where a bird established its own territory was albatrosses live much longer than other birds they delay breeding for longer and invest more effort into fewer young most species survive upwards of 50 years oldest recorded being a laysan albatross named wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in february 2017 making her at least 66 years old she is oldest confirmed wild bird and oldest banded bird in world albatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly after about five years but even once they have reached maturity they do not begin to breed for another few years even up to 10 years for some species young attend a colony prior to beginning to breed spending many years practising elaborate breeding rituals and dances for which family is famous birds arriving back at colony for first time already have stereotyped behaviours that compose albatross language but can neither read that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor respond appropriately after a period of trial and error learning young birds learn syntax and perfect dances this language is mastered more rapidly if younger birds are around older birds repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening pointing calling bill clacking staring and combinations of such behaviours such as sky call when a bird first returns to colony it dances with many partners but after a number of years number of interactions drops until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed they then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair having established a pair bond that will last for life however most of that dance will never be used again thumb left an albatross chick at northwestern hawaiian islands marine national monument midway atoll albatrosses are held to undertake these elaborate and painstaking rituals to ensure that appropriate partner has been chosen and to perfect partner recognition as egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment even species that can complete an egg laying cycle in under a year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years great albatrosses i e wandering albatross take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging albatrosses lay a single subelliptical egg white with reddish brown spots in a breeding season if egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken then no further breeding attempts are made that year larger eggs weigh from divorce of a pair is a rare occurrence due to diminished lifetime reproductive success it causes and usually happens only after several years of breeding failure all southern albatrosses create large nests for their egg using grass shrubs soil peat and even penguin feathers whereas three species in north pacific make more rudimentary nests waved albatross though makes no nest and even moves

that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items this oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by most procellariiformes and gives them their distinctive musty smell albatross chicks take a long time to fledge in case of great albatrosses it can take up to 280 days even for smaller albatrosses it takes between 140 and 170 days carboneras c 1992 family diomedeidae albatross in handbook of birds of world vol 1 barcelona lynx edicions like many seabirds albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition particularly growing all their flight feathers usually fledging at same weight as their parents between 15 and 65 of those fledged survive to breed albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents which return to nest after fledging unaware their chick has left studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour a genetically coded navigation route which helps young birds when they are first out at sea hybridization is rare in albatrosses largely due to low incidence of
