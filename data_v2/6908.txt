attempt at a satirical novel was captain pantoja and special service pantaleon y las visitadoras published in 1973 this short comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas these plot elements are similar to vargas llosa s earlier novel green house but in a different form captain pantoja and special service is therefore essentially a parody of both green house and literary approach that novel represents vargas llosa s motivation to write novel came from actually

fourth major novel war of end of world la guerra del fin del mundo was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel this work initiated a radical change in vargas llosa s style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour it recreates war of canudos an incident in 19th century brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by national army for months as in vargas llosa s earliest work this novel carries a sober and serious theme and its tone is dark vargas llosa s bold exploration of humanity s propensity to idealize violence and his account of a man made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides earned novel substantial recognition because of book s ambition and execution critics have argued that this is one of vargas

spain bbc news 8 october 2017 style of writing plot setting and major themes vargas llosa s style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences for example in his first novel time of hero his own experiences at leoncio prado military school informed his depiction of corrupt social institution which mocked moral standards it was supposed to uphold furthermore corruption of book s school is a reflection of corruption of peruvian society at time novel was written vargas llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge inadequacies of society such as and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power one of main themes he has explored in his writing is individual s struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality for example his two volume novel conversation in cathedral is based on tyrannical dictatorship of peruvian president manuel a odria protagonist santiago rebels against suffocating dictatorship by participating in subversive activities of leftist political groups in addition to themes such as corruption and oppression vargas llosa s second novel green house explores a denunciation of peru s basic institutions dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of workers in brothel by corrupt military officers many of vargas llosa s earlier novels were set in peru while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of latin america such as brazil and dominican republic his responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of peru war of end of world was his first major work set outside peru though plot deals with historical events of canudos revolt against brazilian government novel is not based directly on historical fact rather its main inspiration is non fiction account of those events published by brazilian writer da cunha in 1902 feast of goat based on dictatorship of rafael trujillo takes place in dominican republic in preparation for this novel vargas llosa undertook a comprehensive study of dominican history novel was characteristically realist and vargas llosa underscores that he respected basic facts i have not exaggerated but at same time he points out it s a novel not a history book so i took many many liberties qtd in one of vargas llosa s more recent novels way to paradise el paraiso en la otra esquina is set largely in france and tahiti based on biography of former social reformer flora tristan it demonstrates how flora and paul gauguin were unable to find paradise but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia unfortunately vargas llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction some critics such as barbara mujica argue that way to paradise lacks audacity energy political vision and narrative genius that was present in his previous works modernism and postmodernism works of mario vargas llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels though there is still much debate over differences between modernist and postmodernist literature literary scholar m keith booker claims that difficulty and technical complexity of vargas llosa s early works such as green house and conversation in cathedral are clearly elements of modern novel furthermore these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude another important defining aspect of modernist art by contrast his later novels such as captain pantoja and special service aunt julia and scriptwriter real life of alejandro mayta and storyteller el hablador appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing these novels have a much lighter farcical and comic tone characteristics of postmodernism comparing two of vargas llosa s novels green house and captain pantoja and special service booker discusses contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in writer s works while both novels explore theme of prostitution as well as workings of peruvian military booker points out that former is gravely serious whereas latter is ridiculously comic thumb 400px mario vargas llosa actor in his play los de la peste with sanchez gijon teatro espanol madrid 2015 interlacing dialogues literary scholar m keith booker argues that vargas llosa perfects technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel green house by combining two conversations that occur at different times he creates illusion of a flashback vargas llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places this technique is a staple of his repertoire which he began using near end of his first novel time of hero however he does not use interlacing dialogues in same way in all of his novels for example in green house technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space in contrast captain pantoja and special service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts this device is similar to both virginia woolf s mixing of different characters soliloquies and gustave flaubert s counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events such as speeches literary influences vargas llosa s first literary influences were relatively obscure peruvian writers such as martin adan carlos oquendo de amat and cesar moro as a young writer he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary multifaceted experience of urban peru he was looking for a style different from traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by peru s foremost novelist at time jose maria arguedas vargas llosa wrote of arguedas s work that it was an example of old fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities although he did not share arguedas s passion for indigenous reality vargas llosa admired and respected novelist for his contributions to peruvian literature indeed he has published a book length study on his work la utopia arcaica 1996 rather than restrict himself to peruvian literature vargas llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration two french figures existentialist jean paul sartre and novelist gustave flaubert influenced both his technique and style sartre s influence is most prevalent in vargas llosa s extensive use of conversation epigraph of time of hero his first novel is also taken directly from sartre s work flaubert s artistic independence his novels disregard of reality and morals has always been admired by vargas llosa who wrote a book length study of flaubert s aesthetics perpetual orgy in his analysis of flaubert vargas llosa questions revolutionary power of literature in a political setting this is in contrast to his earlier view that literature is an act of rebellion thus marking a transition in vargas llosa s aesthetic beliefs other critics such as sabine kollmann argue that his belief in transforming power of literature is one of great continuities that characterize his fictional and non fictional work and link his early statement that literature is fire with his nobel prize speech in praise of reading and writing sabine kollmann a companion to mario vargas llosa woodbridge tamesis 2014 one of vargas llosa s favourite novelists and arguably most influential on his writing career is american william faulkner vargas llosa considers faulkner writer who perfected methods of modern novel both writers styles include intricate changes in time and narration in time of hero for example aspects of vargas llosa s plot his main character s development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite faulkner novel light in august in addition to studies of arguedas and flaubert vargas llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired such as gabriel garcia marquez albert camus ernest hemingway and jean paul sartre main goals of his non fiction works are to acknowledge influence of these authors on his writing and to recognize a connection between himself and other writers critic sara castro argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors literary techniques in perpetual orgy for example he discusses relationship between his own aesthetics and flaubert s rather than focusing on flaubert s alone impact mario vargas llosa is considered a major latin american writer alongside other authors such as octavio paz julio jorge luis borges gabriel garcia marquez and carlos fuentes in his book new novel in latin america la nueva novela fuentes offers an in depth literary criticism of positive influence vargas llosa s work has had on latin american literature indeed for literary critic gerald martin writing in 1987 vargas llosa was perhaps most successful certainly most controversial latin american novelist of past twenty five years most of vargas llosa s narratives have been translated into multiple languages marking his international critical success vargas llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism an accomplishment characteristic of few other latin american writers he is recognized among
