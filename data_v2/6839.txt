arena browser also known as arena www browser was one of first web browsers for unix originally created by dave raggett in 1993 browser continued its development at cern and world wide web consortium w3c and subsequently by yggdrasil computing as a testbed browser arena was used in testing implementation for html version 3 0 cascading style sheets css portable network graphics png and libwww arena was widely used and popular at beginning of world wide web arena which predated netscape navigator and microsoft s internet explorer featured a number of innovations used later in commercial products it was first browser to support background images tables text flow around images and inline mathematical expressions arena browser served as w3c s testbed browser from 1994 to 1996 when it was succeeded by amaya project history in 1993 dave raggett then at hewlett packard hp in bristol england devoted his spare time to developing arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future html specifications development of browser was slow because raggett was lone developer and hp raggett demonstrated browser at first world wide web conference in geneva switzerland in 1994 and 1994 conference in prague to show text flow around images forms and other aspects of html later termed as html specification raggett subsequently partnered with cern to develop arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work using arena browser dave raggett henrik nielsen hakon lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions tables image backgrounds html math and other features at web world conference in orlando in early 1995 raggett demonstrated different new features of arena since july 1994 lie was integrating libwww and css and helping raggett in october 1995 yves joined team for a year to provide support for html form and style sheet development arena was originally released for unix and although there was talk of a windows and macintosh port neither came to fruition despite its time of development arena is in certain areas a relatively modern browser because it functioned as a testbed it saw implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream e g css arena implemented many elements of html3 and html3 2 specification including math elements that were deprecated in html tables and experimental style sheets w3c pre beta development history and source code of earlier software builds are not well documented because developers didn t want to distribute source code until they considered browser to be stable in version 0 95 support for inline jpeg images was added in version 0 96 support was added for ftp nntp and gopher protocols as well as experimental support for css in arena 0 98 dave beckett added full png support w3c beta 1 w3c published 5 versions of arena beta 1 between 27 november 1995 and 8 february 1996 improving 16 bit operating system support and css which was still a working draft w3c and a french national research institution gave additional funding to develop css to better implement and write css an experimental style sheet for arena was developed on 22 may 1996 w3c announced that amaya will replace arena as their new testbed and that w3c was looking for a new maintainer because w3c didn t have resources for two testbeds w3c beta 2 how arena works w3c arena w3c s http server buffer frame x11r6 libwww code html drawing conv parser routine omron s server buffer frame x11r6 http internal beta 2 had two builds beta 2a 28 february 1996 and beta 2b 21 march 1996 and introduced a new api for communicating with other applications also internal component libwww was updated to version 4 omron corporation developed an internationalized version that could display chinese korean and japanese characters in one page omron s arena supports both iso 2022 and unicode it is able to guess charset parameter automatically if charset parameter isn t specified in content type field w3c beta 3 beta 3a released on 14 august 1996 and beta 3b released on 16 september 1996 introduced support for linux operating systems on and dec alpha css 1 support was enhanced and internationalized version was also updated between two beta 3 releases w3c was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to amaya browser beta 3 was last involvement of w3c in development of arena on 17 february 1997 yggdrasil computing took over role of developing browser yggdrasil phase thumb latest arena 0 3 62 1 build on its start page on 17 february 1997 w3c approved yggdrasil to coordinate future development of arena development was taken over by yggdrasil with idea to turn arena into an open source x window system browser licensed under gnu general public license yggdrasil licensed an x emulator from pearl software to port arena to windows although these builds were never released yggdrasil didn t provide any official binaries at this time because they didn t want to expand community with alpha quality software although users would be able to run arena by compiling it from published source code volunteers created unofficial finished binaries yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers which resulted in new bookmarks feature in version 0 3 18 on 7 april 1997 development stopped in late 1998 with final release being on 25 november 1998 because official page is no longer online older source code and builds of yggdrasil s development are no longer available although debian s repository archive contains three newest builds w3c did not consider demonstration projects to be high priority and thus arena browser was entirely shut down in favor of outside linux community development features arena supported following features html3 0 html3 2 standard predecessor which includes math tables forms etc style sheet editing this very experimental style sheet editor was implemented using forms editing remote html pages mime reads your file and applies rules direct access to wais engines optionally http 1 1 proposed by rfc 2068 formerly called http ng html editing with external editor external client communication api and html scheme png jpeg gif but not animated gifs bookmarks since 0 3 18 full xpm since 0 3 33 and full since 0 3 34 java since 0 3 39 html table support html math equations link rendition ftp nntp gopher technical arena was built using multi threaded library of common code called w3c reference library now called libwww originally arena browser was built on top of as raggett considered programming manuals for motif and other x libraries to be rather daunting version numbering arena has three different systems for version numbering w3c pre beta phase uses a system of numbers up to 0 99 which indicated that these builds were in alpha quality and browser could have new features beta phase changed version numbering to a system consisting of word beta beta followed by a number after beta phase final product would have version 1 0 after yggdrasil overtook development development status was changed from w3c beta builds back to alpha implying that arena browser wasn t yet ready for release beta 3e version numbering then became 0 3 5 in gnu style development remained in alpha stage until 0 3 62 and never again advanced to beta criticism although arena ran well there were inconsistent reports about speed of arena biggest problems were that arena couldn t handle forms and that png support was broken from version 0 3 07 on earlier arena releases had full alpha channel support but only with using arena s own sandy background pattern animated gifs extension presented by netscape in march 1996 didn t work properly other problems included rendering problems with tables and lack of integration of so called extended html code i e bg color tag and div align tag earlier versions of arena until 0 3 26 01 06 97 didn t support email mime screenshots timeline of releases
