thumb 300px buildings which burned are shown in yellow on this map of copenhagen in 1728 by joachim hassing copenhagen fire of 1728 was largest fire in history of copenhagen denmark it began on evening of 20 october 1728 and continued to burn until morning of 23 october it destroyed approximately 28 of city measured by counting number of destroyed lots from cadastre left 20 of population homeless and reconstruction lasted until 1737 no less than 47 of section of city which dates back to middle ages was completely lost and along with copenhagen fire of 1795 it is main reason that few traces of medieval copenhagen can be found in modern city although number of dead and wounded was relatively low compared to extent of fire cultural losses were huge in addition to several private book collections 35 000 texts including a large number of unique works were lost with university of copenhagen library and at observatory on top of rundetarn instruments and records made by tycho brahe and ole romer were destroyed timeline thumb 300px section of joachim hassing s map color coded to illustrate approximate progress of fire showing origin of fire bright yellow and area affected by midnight on wednesday dark yellow by midnight on thursday orange by midnight on friday red and by saturday purple wednesday 20 october exact time that fire started is unknown various sources mention times between 6 00 and 8 00 p m and 7 30 p m is best estimate however exact location of origin of fire is known almost directly across street from west gate was lille sankt clemens straede on corner facing there was a small house on lot vester kvarter 146 according to cadastre of 1699 owned by signe widow of boye hansen lot is almost identical to one on corner of present day western end of and city hall square among widow s tenants were restaurant manager peder rasmussen and his wife anne it was on second floor of restaurateur s apartment that fire started at inquiries held after fire was over both he and his wife stated that their seven year old son had started fire by accidentally upsetting a candle but it is more likely that it was result of carelessness on behalf of parents while casting candles and that they blamed child to avoid punishment watchmen were quick to sound alarm but given fire department s relatively primitive equipment fact that streets of vester kvarter were too narrow for fire pumps strange dispositions of those fighting fire and a series of unlucky events fight was nearly hopeless wind blew from southwest that evening carrying fire along lille sankt clemens straede store sankt clemens straede and hellig kors straede by 9 00 p m main street of vestergade was burning on both sides from here fire spread along store lars bjorns straede lille lars bjorns straede and studiestraede thumb 300px left map of vester kvarter where fire started with lot numbers from cadastre of 1699 numbers of burned lots are underlined in red later that evening fire reached sankt straede where kollegium dormitory lot norre kvarter 122 was engulfed in flames professor peder horrebow who lived at dormitory lost most of his possessions presumably simultaneously fire also reached professor hans steenbuch s room on studiestraede lot norre kvarter 60 around midnight fire reached priest s residence by church sankt petri kirke on norregade another fire started at a brewery wednesday evening possibly between 10 p m and 11 p m just prior to that original fire had reached gammeltorv where people fought to keep fire back for that reason help was sent late to deal with new fire around midnight wind shifted to west and situation on norregade turned critical as fire was driven towards street along a wide front at first people sought to keep fire on western side of norregade but nevertheless it spread to eastern side during night simultaneously fire moved from present day norre voldgade towards norreport north gate thursday early thursday morning a final desperate attempt to keep flames from spreading was made at gammeltorv already burning houses were fired upon with cannons to make them collapse when that did not work an order was given to blow up houses with black powder charges building housing wine cellar known as blasen on corner of vestergade and norregade was to be first demolition but this dangerous undertaking failed when gunpowder blew up while men were still carrying in charges while building did go down people were killed and injured and explosion ignited nearby buildings including church vor frue kirke by 9 30 a m church spire had fallen into street and soon after whole church was engulfed in flames personal property that people had brought to church to keep them safe from fire was lost at norregade fire reached sankt petri kirke around 8 a m by 9 a m flames reached bishop christen worm s residence lot norre kvarter 112 which burned to ground bishop who was travelling was left with clothes on his back and three prayer books at nytorv flames consumed det kongelige royal orphanage now location of copenhagen district court city hall of copenhagen then located between nytorv and gammeltorv was now in peril around 10 a m flames had taken hold of building and it was soon added to list of buildings lost from gammeltorv inferno made its way down and heading towards amagertorv while from nytorv fire found fuel on towards canal and new fires were reported count adam christoffer knuth s house in a cellar in kobmagergade market street and a haystack at norreport northern gate all broke out in flames latter likely ignited by embers carried by wind when fire had consumed vor frue kirke university of copenhagen saw one building after another burn community building which was used to help support students by giving them free meals university s head building study courtyard at same location as current head building and anatomy building domus anatomica and anatomy theatre theatrum were all lost aforementioned professor hans steenbuch had sought refuge at professor hans gram s home where both he and his possessions found temporary safety but now fire reached gram s home next to vor frue kirke lot kvarter 245 and there was not enough time to save steenbuch s possessions although gram saved most of his own from destruction along one by one university of copenhagen professors homes fell prey to flames several more student dormitories were lost but along kobmagergade a wing of buildings were saved including church next notable victim of fire was church trinitatis kirke which housed university library in its attic flames got a hold church around 5 p m and when ceiling gave around 10 p m entire library s collection was delivered into a sea of flames rundetarn was left for most part undamaged but observatory at top burned out from gammeltorv fire spread out to plads now grabrodretorv around 4 p m monument that shamed traitor lost a few letters in heat a few hours later fire closed in on church and at 8 p m its carillon bells came to life as they did every half hour playing thomas s din herre gud af eng turn your anger lord by mercy just before they crashed into fire below from trinitatis church fire continued down towards gothersgade here fire met up with other branch of fire which ate its way down present day norre voldgade around midnight church kirke was ablaze only place in city where there was some control over fire was around friday friday morning wind shifted again this time to north firefighting finally started to show some semblance of organization and efforts were waged to stop fire in neighborhood around magstraede this failed though when fire took soap factory on magstraede around noon wind was now blowing northwest and firefighting moved via snaregade to nybrogade and gammel strand but failed to save nybrogade further east fire proceeded south to and montergade poul hospital on montergade was drowned in flames with some of residents still inside close by professor ludvig left his home on kobmagergade lot kvarter 18 around midnight blaze was close to and store regnegade saturday over course of night wind settled and stopped forward march of fire thirty six homes were selected for demolition to create a firebreak which did stop fire at corner of store regnegade and gothersgade further west amagertorv and church sankt nicolai kirke had been threatened but blaze was stopped close to amagertorv where only three houses furthest north kvarter lots 8 10 and 11 were lost fire on magstraede at soap factory was still a threat fire ate its way along snaregade at end of snaregade was house lot kvarter 2 of vice mayor christian which people tried to save houses around it were torn down and houses on opposite side of street were blown up with black powder outcome was hardly any better than that of earlier attempt at wine cellar though gunpowder went off people had to run for their lives and vice mayor s house was set afire and burned to ground after failed attempt to save house fire was stopped from spreading further though and among other things weigh station of christoffer was saved in line with christian interpretation of day slowdown of fire during saturday was seen as a result of divine intervention to thank god king christian vi introduced on 23 october as a new annual holiday in 1731 on which every church in copenhagen held a service of thanksgiving this holiday was abolished at holiday reform of 1770 losses thumb 300px old statistics attached to back of map by joachim hassing according to which 1640 houses burned and another 39 were ruined number is probably a bit too high property losses from fire can be accounted for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards city surveyor soren balle submitted first survey on 1 november 1728 and on 13 april 1729 magistrate of copenhagen finished a second made according to a royal request of 12 december 1728 differences between two surveys are limited to extent of damages on 43 lots so it is fairly certain that 1 227 lots containing about 1 600 buildings were lost in flames all of copenhagen consisted of about 4 500 lots per cadastre of 1699 so about 28 of lots were lost for medieval part of town ratio is 47 magistrate also made a survey of spared parts of town from which it appears that 8 749 former residents of parts touched by fire had found new lodgings it is estimated that as many as 15 000 had become homeless this is about 20 of population which is estimated at 70 000 however number of dead and wounded is unknown it is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources but number remains uncertain it is probably low in comparison with extent of fire though while human and property losses were staggering cultural loss is still felt today university of copenhagen library was without a doubt greatest and most frequently mentioned of such 35 000 texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in flames original works from historians hans anders sorensen niels krag and arild huitfeldt and scientists ole worm ole romer tycho brahe and brothers hans and caspar bartholin were lost atlas by peder hansen and archive of diocese of zealand went up in flames as well archive of diocese had been moved to university library very same day fire started several other book collections were lost as well professor mathias made mistake of bringing his possessions to safety in trinitatis church arni magnusson lost all his books notes and records but did manage to rescue much of his valuable collection of handwritten icelandic manuscripts at kollegium 3 150 volumes burned along with its museum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities burned out observatory in rundetarn had contained instruments and records by tycho brahe and ole romer professors horrebow steenbuch and two lost practically everything and on top of all that a large part of city archive of records burnt along with city hall consequences thumb 300px left map of vester kvarter after fire with new cadastre numbers and streets when reconstruction of denmark s capital was begun a number of changes were introduced a commission was appointed to regulate streets after among ruins this commission submitted a suggestion to create 12 to 15 metre wide main streets with 10 metre wide side streets with none of surrounding houses being half timbered this plan was not followed in reconstruction although half timbered houses were banned at first ban was lifted in 1731 as brick houses were considerably more expensive medieval copenhagen however had changed permanently when reconstruction was complete by 1737 streets and alleys no longer followed original paths and some even ceased to exist thumb 200px one of johan cornelius krieger s fire houses fire houses term english fire houses today refer to a type of townhouses that was built in large numbers in years immediately after fire many of them were modelled on generic renderings made by johan cornelius krieger with inspiration from christof houses are two or three storeys high five bays wide and have a prominent wall dormer facade towards street is in brick while rest of house has timber framing they are typically painted in bright colours well
