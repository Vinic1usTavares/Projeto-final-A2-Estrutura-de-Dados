40 era and 21 complete games in 36 games pitched as highlanders finished fifth in american league al however warhop led al in hit batsmen in 1909 26 and 1910 18 which might have been caused by his unorthodox pitching style in 1910 warhop pitched to a 14 14 win loss record a 3 00 era and 11 errors most among al pitchers gallagher p 226 he was respected throughout baseball and baseball magazine

up runs in each of first four innings however he improved a few weeks later on may 20 when he limited st louis browns to four hits this began a quality stretch for warhop who won five consecutive games by july 17 a result of an improvement in his control then during an august 21 road game against tigers he lost a 5 4 walk off game in eleventh inning in part due to his own unsuccessful strategy in fielding two bunts on both occasions he threw to second base but was too late and baserunners were able to advance safely and load bases highlanders lost when earle gardner booted a routine ground ball by bill donovan in an rushed attempt to throw out go ahead runner at home plate his desperation culminated in him unsuccessfully requesting league at end of season to change his win loss record to 14 11 under mistaken belief that his 12 13 record was incorrect warhop s penchant for tough luck was best exemplified in season when he finished with a 10 19 record second highest number of losses

louis browns having held them scoreless for first five innings 1913 1915 a sore arm in caused warhop to pitch ineffectively and have just seven games started he recovered by however warhop was on unfortunate end of a hard luck campaign he had an 8 15 win loss record with a 2 37 era however yankees were one of worst offensive and defensive teams in baseball which caused warhop to be on losing
