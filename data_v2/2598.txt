bobcat lynx rufus is a medium sized north american cat that first appeared during irvingtonian stage around 1 8 million years ago paleobiology database collection 20397 dona ana county new mexico authorized and entered by dr john alroy macquarie university april 30 1994 containing two recognized subspecies it ranges from southern canada to central mexico including most of contiguous united states bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas as well as semidesert urban edge forest edge and swampland environments it remains in some of its original range but populations are vulnerable to local extinction extirpation by coyotes and domestic animals with a gray to brown coat whiskered face and black tufted ears bobcat resembles other species of midsized genus lynx it is smaller on average than canada lynx with which it shares parts of its range but is several times larger than domestic cat it has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black tipped stubby or bobbed tail from which it derives its name though bobcat prefers rabbits and hares it hunts insects chickens geese and other birds small rodents and deer prey selection depends on location and habitat season and abundance like most cats bobcat is territorial and largely solitary although with some overlap in home ranges it uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans both for sport and fur their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas elusive predator features in native american mythology and folklore of european settlers taxonomy upright thumb canada lynx has distinct tufts atop its ears and longer mutton chop style fur on its lower face there had been debate over whether to classify this species as lynx rufus or felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether four species of lynx should be given their own genus or be placed as a subgenus of felis genus lynx is now accepted and bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources johnson et al reported lynx shared a clade with puma leopard cat prionailurus and domestic cat felis lineages dated to 7 15 million years ago mya lynx diverged first approximately 3 24 million years ago bobcat is believed to have evolved from eurasian lynx which crossed into north america by way of bering land bridge during pleistocene with progenitors arriving as early as 2 6 million years ago first wave moved into southern portion of north america which was soon cut off from north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20 000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in north developing into modern canada lynx hybridization between bobcat and canada lynx may sometimes occur subspecies 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on

several auxiliary shelters on outer extent of its range such as hollow logs brush piles thickets or under rock ledges its den smells strongly of bobcat sizes of bobcats home ranges vary significantly a world conservation union iucn summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger roughly and less well defined home ranges kittens had smallest range at about dispersal from natal range is most pronounced with males reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal one study found a large variation in male range sizes from in summer up to in winter another found that female bobcats especially those which were reproductively active expanded their home range in winter but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it which was consistent with numerous earlier studies other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation like most felines bobcat is largely solitary but ranges often overlap unusual for cats males are more tolerant of overlap while females rarely wander into others ranges given their smaller range sizes two or more females may reside within a male s home range when multiple territories overlap a dominance hierarchy is often established resulting in exclusion of some transients from favored areas in line with widely differing estimates of home range size population density figures are divergent from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey average is estimated at one bobcat per a link has been observed between population density and sex ratio one study noted a dense population in california had a sex ratio of 2 1 males per female when density decreased sex ratio skewed to 0 86 males per female another study observed a similar ratio and suggested males may be better able to cope with increased competition and this helped limit reproduction until various factors lowered density hunting and diet thumb bobcats often prey on rabbits hares and rodents bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food but eats heavily when prey is abundant during lean periods it often preys on larger animals which it can kill and return to feed on later bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce its preference is for mammals weighing about its main prey varies by region in eastern united states it is eastern cottontail species and in north it is snowshoe hare when these prey species exist together as in new england they are primary food sources of bobcat in far south rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as primary food source birds up to size of an adult swan are also taken in ambushes

decline in numbers of bobcat s principal prey abundance of its main prey species is main determinant of overall diet bobcat hunts animals of different sizes and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly with small animals such as rodents including squirrels birds fish including small sharks bobcat drags shark out of florida surf and insects it hunts in areas known to be abundant in prey and will lie crouch or stand and wait for victims to wander close it then pounces grabbing its prey with its sharp retractable claws for slightly larger animals such as geese rabbits and hares it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack less commonly it feeds on larger animals such as young ungulates and other carnivores such as fishers primarily female

endangered whooping crane bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry while larger species such as cattle and horses are not known to be attacked bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants such as sheep and goats according to national agricultural statistics service bobcats killed 11 100 sheep in 2004 comprising 4 9 of all sheep predator deaths however some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified as bobcats have been known to scavenge on remains of livestock kills by other animals it has been known to kill deer especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce or when deer populations become more abundant one study in everglades showed a large majority of kills 33 of 39 were fawns but prey up to eight times bobcat s weight could be successfully taken it stalks deer often when deer is lying down then rushes in and grabs it by neck before biting throat base of skull or chest on rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer it eats its fill and then buries carcass under snow or leaves often returning to it several times to feed bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche research in maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between bobcat and coyote or red fox separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals however other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations with more social inclination of canid giving them a possible competitive advantage with canada lynx however interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns competitive exclusion by bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of range of its felid relative reproduction and life cycle thumb right bobcat kittens in june about 2 4 months old average bobcat lifespan is 7 years long and rarely exceeds 10 years oldest wild bobcat on record was 16 years old and oldest captive bobcat lived to be 32 bobcats generally begin breeding by their second summer though females may start as early as their first year sperm production begins each year by september or october and male is fertile into summer a dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times generally from winter until early spring this varies by location but most mating takes place during february and march pair may undertake a number of different behaviors including bumping chasing and ambushing other males may be in attendance but remain uninvolved once male recognizes female is receptive he grasps her in typical felid neck grip and mates with her female may later go on to mate with other males and males generally mate with several females during courtship otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams hisses or other sounds research in texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring female has an estrous cycle of 44 days with estrus lasting five to ten days bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives female raises young alone one to six but usually two to four kittens are born in april or may after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation sometimes a second litter is born as late as september female generally gives birth in an enclosed space usually a small cave or hollow log young open their eyes by ninth or tenth day they start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months within three to five months they begin to travel with their mother they hunt by themselves by fall of their first year and usually disperse shortly thereafter in michigan however they have been observed staying with their mother as late as next spring tracks thumb right bobcat tracks in mud showing hind paw print top partially covering fore paw print center bobcat tracks show four toes without claw marks due to their retractable claws tracks can range in size from average is about 1 8 inches when walking or trotting tracks are spaced roughly apart bobcat can make great strides when running often from like all cats bobcat directly registers

fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood golden eagles aquila chrysaetos have been reportedly observed preying on bobcats diseases accidents hunters automobiles and starvation are other leading causes of death juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers while still perfecting their hunting techniques one study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0 62 in line with other research suggesting rates of 0 56 to 0 67 cannibalism has been reported kittens may be taken when prey levels are low but this is very rare and does not much influence population bobcat may have external parasites mostly ticks and fleas and often carries parasites of its prey especially those of rabbits and squirrels internal parasites endoparasites are especially common in bobcats one study found an average infection rate of 52 from toxoplasma gondii but with great regional variation one mite in particular has to date been found only on bobcat parasites and diseases role in mortality of bobcat is still unclear but they may account for greater mortality than starvation accidents and predation distribution and habitat thumb right bobcat in urban surroundings species range does not seem to be limited by human populations as long as it can still find a suitable habitat bobcat is an adaptable animal it prefers woodlands deciduous coniferous or mixed but unlike other lynx species it does not depend exclusively on deep forest it ranges from humid swamps of florida to desert lands of texas or rugged mountain areas it makes its home near agricultural areas if rocky ledges swamps or forested tracts are present its spotted coat serves as camouflage population of bobcat depends primarily on population of its prey other principal factors in selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather availability of resting and den sites dense cover for hunting and escape and freedom from disturbance bobcat s range does not seem to be limited by human populations as long as it can find a suitable habitat only large intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for species animal may appear in back yards in urban edge environments where human development intersects with natural habitats if chased by a dog it usually climbs up a tree historical range of bobcat was from southern canada throughout united states and as far south as mexican state of oaxaca and it still persists across much of this area in 20th century it was thought to have lost territory in us midwest and parts of northeast including southern minnesota eastern south dakota and much of missouri mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices while thought to no longer exist in western new york and pennsylvania multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats including dead specimens have been recently reported in new york s southern tier and in central new york and a bobcat was captured in 2018 on a tourist boat in downtown pittsburgh pennsylvania in addition bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern indiana and one was recently killed near albion michigan in early march 2010 a bobcat was sighted and later captured by animal control authorities in a parking garage in downtown houston by 2010 bobcats appear to have recolonized many states occurring in every state except delaware its population in canada is limited due to both snow depth and presence of canadian lynx bobcat does not tolerate deep snow and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas it lacks large padded feet of canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of larger felid displacement of canadian lynx by aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in nova scotia while clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of canadian lynx s range to advantage of bobcat in northern and central mexico cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak its range ends at tropical southern portion of country conservation thumb bobcat population has seen a decline in american midwest but is generally stable and healthy it is listed in appendix ii of convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites which means it is not considered threatened with extinction but hunting and trading must be closely monitored animal is regulated in all three of its range countries and is found in a number of protected areas of united states its principal territory estimates from us fish and wildlife service placed bobcat numbers between 700 000 and 1 500 000 in us in 1988 with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years for these reasons u s has petitioned cites to remove cat from appendix ii populations in canada and mexico remain stable and healthy it is listed as least concern on iucn red list noting it is relatively widespread and abundant but information from southern mexico is poor species is considered endangered in ohio indiana and new jersey it was removed from threatened list of illinois in 1999 and of iowa in 2003 in pennsylvania limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed after having been banned from 1970 to 1999 bobcat also suffered population decline in new jersey at turn of 19th century mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation by 1972 bobcat was given full legal protection and was listed as endangered in state in 1991 l r subspecies found in mexico was for a time considered endangered by us fish and wildlife service but was delisted in 2005 bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport it has been hunted and trapped by humans but has maintained a high population even in southern united states where it is extensively hunted in 1970s and 1980s an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting but by early 1990s prices had dropped significantly regulated hunting still continues with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause as a result rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter when hunting season is generally open urbanization can result in fragmentation of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between habitat patches which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches animals such as bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges a study in coastal southern california has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization creation of roads and other developments populations may not be declining as much as predicted but instead connectivity of different populations is affected this leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations for bobcats preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability educating local residents about animals is critical as well for conservation in urban areas in bobcats using urban habitats in california use of rodenticides has been linked to both secondary poisoning by consuming poisoned rats and mice and to increased rates of severe mite infestation known as notoedric mange as an animal with a poison weakened immune system is less capable of fighting off mange liver autopsies in california bobcats that have succumbed to notoedric mange have revealed chronic rodenticide exposure alternative rodent control measures such as vegetation control and use of traps have been suggested to alleviate this issue importance in human culture in native american mythology bobcat is often twinned with figure of coyote in a theme of duality lynx is used generically in mythological descriptions but necessarily implies bobcat throughout much of united states lynx and coyote are associated with fog and wind respectively two elements representing opposites in native american folklore this basic story in many variations is found in native cultures of north america with parallels in south america but they diverge in telling one version which appears in nez perce folklore for instance depicts lynx and coyote as opposed antithetical beings however another version depicts them with equality and claude levi strauss argues former concept that of twins representing opposites is an inherent theme in new world mythologies but they are not equally balanced figures representing an open ended dualism rather than symmetric duality of old world cultures latter notion then levi strauss suggests is result of regular contact between europeans and native cultures additionally version found in nez perce story is of much greater complexity while version of equality seems to have lost tale s original meaning in a shawnee tale bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit which gives rise to its spots after trapping rabbit in a tree bobcat is persuaded to build a fire only to have embers scattered on its fur leaving it singed with dark brown spots mohave believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers dreaming of two deities cougar and lynx they thought would grant them superior hunting skills of other tribes european settlers to americas also admired cat both for its ferocity and its grace and in united states it rests prominently in anthology of national folklore grave artifacts from dirt domes excavated in 1980s along illinois river revealed a complete skeleton of a young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by hopewell culture type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance hopewell normally buried their dogs so bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy but
