franchise history atlanta flames 1972 1980 thumb tom lysiak celebrates with teammates after a goal against colorado rockies from 1972 to 1980 flames were based in atlanta flames were result of nhl s first pre emptive strike against upstart world hockey association wha in december 1971 nhl hastily granted a team to long island new york islanders to keep wha s new york raiders out of brand new nassau veterans memorial coliseum needing another team to balance schedule nhl awarded a team to an atlanta based group that owned national basketball association s atlanta hawks headed by prominent local real estate developer tom cousins cousins named team flames after fire resulting from march to sea in american civil war by general william tecumseh sherman in which atlanta was nearly destroyed they played home games in omni coliseum in downtown atlanta flames were relatively successful early on under head coaches bernie boom boom geoffrion fred creighton and al macneil flames made playoffs in six of eight seasons in atlanta in marked contrast their expansion cousins islanders won only 31 games during their first two years in league combined however this relative success did not carry over to playoffs as flames won only two post season games during their time in atlanta despite on ice success atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing longtime general manager cliff fletcher said years later that cousins initial financial projections for an nhl team did not account for wha entering picture flames were also a poor draw and never signed a major television contract in 1980 cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell flames to stave off bankruptcy with few serious offers from local groups he was very receptive to an offer from canadian entrepreneur and former oilers owner nelson skalbania he was fronting a group of calgary businessmen that included oil magnates harley hotchkiss ralph t scurfield norman green doc and byron seaman and former calgary stampeders great norman kwong a last ditch effort to keep team in atlanta fell short and cousins sold team to skalbania for us 16 million a record sale price for an nhl team at time on may 21 1980 skalbania announced that team would move to calgary he chose to retain flames name feeling it would be a good fit for an oil town like calgary while flaming a logo was replaced by a flaming c skalbania sold his interest in 1981 and flames have been locally owned since early years in calgary 1980 1985 unlike wha s calgary cowboys who folded three years earlier flames were immediately embraced by city of calgary while cowboys could manage to sell only 2 000 season tickets in their final campaign of 1976 77 flames sold 10 000 full and half season ticket packages in 7 000 seat stampede corral thumb left brad marsh with flames during 1980 81 season team found greater playoff success qualifying for stanley cup playoffs for their first five years after moving to calgary led by kent nilsson s 49 goal 131 point season flames qualified for playoffs in their first season in calgary with a 39 27 14 record good for third in patrick division team found much greater playoff success in calgary than it did in atlanta winning their first two playoff series over chicago black hawks and philadelphia flyers before bowing out to minnesota north stars in semi finals this early success was not soon repeated after a losing record in 1981 82 fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from atlanta days who could not adjust to higher pressure hockey environment and rebuilt roster over next three seasons he put together a core of players that would remain together through early 1990s fletcher s efforts to match oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by nhl flames were among earliest teams to sign large numbers of u s college players including joel otto gary suter and colin patterson fletcher also stepped up search for european hockey talent acquiring hakan loob and other key players he was among first to draft players from soviet union including cska moscow star sergei makarov in 1983 but soviet players were not released to western teams until 1989 still team was sufficiently improved to challenge oilers who required maximum seven games to defeat flames en route to their 1984 stanley cup championship in 1983 flames moved into their new home olympic saddledome now known as scotiabank saddledome located on grounds of calgary exhibition and stampede saddledome was built as a venue for 1988 winter olympics in three seasons in corral flames lost only 32 home games saddledome hosted nhl all star game in 1985 a 6 4 victory by wales conference presidents trophies and stanley cup finals 1985 1990 players acquired by fletcher matured into one of strongest teams in nhl during mid 1980s and early 1990s from 1984 85 to 1990 91 flames tallied 90 points in every season but one however they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run largely because they could not get better of their provincial rivals powerhouse edmonton oilers oilers and flames usually finished at or near top of campbell conference and were usually among best teams in entire league during this time however nhl s playoff structure of time made it very likely flames would meet oilers in either first or second round rather than in campbell conference finals that same structure made it very likely that other two playoff qualifiers in smythe division would have to get past flames or oilers or both in order to make it to conference finals nhl playoff formats at nhl com from 1981 to 1993 first place team in each division played fourth place team in first round while division runner up played third place team two series winners then faced off in division final for right to go to conference final from 1983 until 1990 either oilers or flames represented campbell conference in stanley cup finals by 1986 flames landed forwards doug risebrough lanny mcdonald and dan quinn defenceman al macinnis and goaltender mike vernon finishing second in smythe with a 40 31 9 record only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points flames swept winnipeg jets in first round of playoffs setting up a showdown with oilers edmonton finished 30 points ahead of calgary during season and was heavily favoured to win a third cup in a row however flames upset oilers in seven games only time flames defeated oilers in a playoff series in decade series winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by steve smith ricocheted off goaltender grant fuhr s leg and into his own net goal remains one of most legendary blunders in hockey history from there flames went on to campbell conference finals where they defeated st louis blues in another seven game series this time calgary had to survive a scare of its own shaking off monday night miracle at st louis arena trailing by a score of 5 2 with ten minutes to play in third period of game 6 blues mounted a furious comeback to send contest into overtime where doug wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game calgary would win game 7 at home 2 1 advancing into stanley cup finals for first time flames proved to be no match for montreal canadiens losing championship series in five games montreal rookie goaltender patrick roy was nearly unbeatable in last two games allowing only four goals en route to winning conn smythe trophy flames followed up their run to finals with their best regular season to that point calgary s 46 31 3 record in 1986 87 was good for third overall in nhl behind oilers and philadelphia flyers however flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior losing their first round match up with jets in six games season was also difficult off ice as 1986 first round draft pick george was killed in a car accident prior to season s start flames recorded their first 100 point season in 1987 88 earning presidents trophy for having nhl s best record and ending oilers six year reign atop smythe division in process joe nieuwendyk became second rookie in nhl history to score at least 50 goals in a season earning calder memorial trophy as rookie of year looking to bolster line up for a playoff run flames traded young sniper brett hull along with steve bozek to blues in exchange for rob ramage and rick wamsley on march 7 1988 however their playoff frustrations continued after defeating los angeles kings in five games as calgary was swept out of playoffs in four straight by oilers in 1988 89 flames continued to improve they captured their second consecutive presidents trophy with a franchise record 117 points finishing 26 points better than second place kings in smythe division fletcher continued to tinker with roster acquiring doug gilmour as part of a six player deal at trade deadline in playoffs flames were stretched to seven games in first round by vancouver canucks they relied on several saves by goaltender mike vernon including a famous glove save off a stan smyl breakaway in overtime save remains a defining moment in flames history flames then made short work of kings defeating them in four straight before eliminating chicago blackhawks in five games to set up a rematch of 1986 stanley cup finals against montreal this time flames won in six games last being a 4 2 victory in montreal on may 25 1989 clinching win was especially significant in that it marked only time that an opposing team defeated canadiens to win stanley cup on montreal forum ice al macinnis captured conn smythe as playoffs most valuable player while long time captain lanny mcdonald announced his retirement 1989 stanley cup win gave flames co owner sonia scurfield ralph s widow distinction of being first and as of 2013 only canadian woman to have her name engraved on cup it also made kwong one of few to have his name on both stanley cup and grey cup in 1989 due in part to cliff fletcher s diplomatic efforts soviets gave permission for a select group of soviet hockey players to sign with nhl teams first of these players was sergei pryakhin although pryakhin never became an nhl regular his arrival blazed a trail for large number of russian players who entered nhl beginning in 1989 90 sergei makarov joined flames that season and though already in his 30s became fifth flame to win calder memorial trophy as nhl s rookie of year selection would prove controversial prompting nhl to amend rules to exclude any player over age 26 from future consideration that season team fell two points shy of their third straight presidents trophy with 99 points also that season they won their third straight smythe division title in playoffs they were dethroned in six games by los angeles kings they would not win another playoff series until 2004 one of longest such droughts in nhl history playoff contention to playoff drought 1991 2003 in 1991 fletcher left flames to become general manager of toronto maple leafs he had been team s general manager since its inception in 1972 he was succeeded in calgary by doug risebrough and two quickly completed a ten player mega trade that saw disgruntled forward doug gilmour dealt to toronto with four other players in exchange for former 50 goal scorer gary leeman and four others trade transformed both clubs formerly inept leafs turned into a contender almost immediately while leeman scored only 11 goals in a flames uniform despite blossoming of theoren fleury into an nhl star flames missed playoffs entirely in 1992 only a year after finishing with their third 100 point season in franchise history it was first time flames had missed playoffs since 1975 when they were still in atlanta it was also only third time out of playoffs in franchise s 20 year history calgary rebounded to make playoffs for next four seasons including two consecutive division titles however they were eliminated in first round of playoffs each time 1994 and 1995 division titles led to game 7 overtime home defeats in opening round to canucks and san jose sharks respectively in 1995 96 season joe nieuwendyk was traded to dallas stars in a deal that acquired jarome iginla iginla would make his flames debut in 1996 playoffs during which flames again lost in first round a four game sweep by blackhawks in 1997 only two years after winning their second consecutive division title flames missed playoffs and would not return for seven years low point came in 1997 98 season in which flames finished with only 67 points second lowest point total in franchise history behind only 1972 73 atlanta flames thumb performance of jarome iginla was one of team s few bright spots during its seven year playoff drought during this time flames found it increasingly difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while canadian dollar lost value against american dollar calgary has always been one of smallest markets in nhl it is currently third smallest behind only edmonton and winnipeg and nhl s small market canadian teams found it increasingly difficult to compete in new environment in 1999 for example flames traded fleury to colorado avalanche midway through season trade came shortly after fleury became franchise s all time leading scorer fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent at end of season and flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return as flames sank in standings their attendance also sagged for most of their first 16 years in calgary flames tickets were among toughest to get in nhl however by 1999 attendance had fallen off so severely that owners issued an ultimatum buy more season tickets or team would join its departed counterparts in winnipeg and quebec city in leaving for united states fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep flames in calgary for 1999 2000 season flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in summer of 2000 campaign aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8 700 to 14 000 proved successful however increased sales did not halt flames financial losses as team estimated it lost 14 5 million between 2001 and 2003 one of few bright spots in this stretch was iginla who captured maurice rocket richard and art ross trophies in 2001 02 as nhl goal and point scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points iginla again won rocket richard trophy tied with rick nash and ilya kovalchuk with 41 goals in 2003 04 another bright spot for team during this time was defenceman robyn regehr who became youngest nominee ever for bill masterton memorial trophy which recognizes perseverance sportsmanship and dedication to hockey regehr had suffered two broken legs in a car accident summer of 1999 but recovered in time to play 57 games at age 19 during 2002 03 season flames hired darryl sutter as team s head coach replacing greg gilbert who was fired as flames languished in last place in western conference sutter also became team s general manager following season and is credited with revitalizing franchise among sutter s first moves was to acquire goaltender miikka kiprusoff whom he had previously coached in san jose early in 2003 04 season kiprusoff responded by setting a modern nhl record for lowest goals against average gaa at 1 69 jarome iginla era and western conference champion 2004 2010 after seven consecutive seasons of not making playoffs flames finally returned to post season in 2004 they became first team in league history to defeat three division champions en route to becoming first canadian team to make it to stanley cup finals since canucks in 1994 flames first victim was northwest division champion vancouver canucks whom they defeated in seven games it was flames first playoff series win since they won 1989 final flames then upset presidents trophy winning detroit red wings in six games after eliminating pacific division champion san jose sharks also in six games in western conference final flames earned a trip to 2004 stanley cup finals to face tampa bay lightning martin gelinas scored winning goal in all three series canadian embassy in washington d c flew flames flag beside maple leaf while prime minister paul martin dubbed flames canada s team thumb left upright miikka kiprusoff won vezina trophy as nhl s top goaltender in 2005 06 final series went to seven games with flames suffering a controversial non goal in game 6 at home replays showed martin gelinas may have scored what would have been go ahead goal late in third period however referees never signalled a goal and later replays were ruled inconclusive goal would have made gelinas only player in nhl history to score winning goal in every playoff series en route to winning stanley cup lightning would go on to win game in double overtime before winning game seven at home to capture stanley cup despite loss 30 000 fans packed into olympic plaza to celebrate flames run flames would not raise their western conference championship banner for nearly 15 months as 2004 05 season was wiped out by a labour dispute during lock out team owner and chairman of board harley hotchkiss attempted to save season by engaging in discussions with national hockey league players association nhlpa president trevor linden while their discussions failed to save season hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective agreement flames played their 25th season in calgary in 2005 06 finishing with 103 points it was their best total since 1989 cup winning season and good enough to capture their first division title in 12 years however flames lost to mighty ducks of anaheim in seven games during first round of playoffs miikka kiprusoff captured both william m jennings and vezina trophies as nhl s top goaltender while dion phaneuf s 20 goals was third highest total for a rookie defenceman in nhl history 2006 off season began with a trade for alex tanguay formerly of colorado avalanche and with sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant jim playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96 point season it was only good enough for eighth place in a western conference where seven teams cracked 100 point barrier in playoffs calgary fell in six games to top seeded detroit red wings in first round during series flames were fined by nhl for several stick related penalties in fifth game notably backup goaltender jamie mclennan was suspended five games for slashing red wings forward johan franzen franzen would score series clinching goal in game 6 defeat in double overtime prior

their surprising 2014 15 year these expectations were bolstered after unexpected acquisition of dougie hamilton from boston bruins for a first round pick and two second round picks at 2015 nhl entry draft however along with other six canadian teams flames failed to qualify for playoffs as a result in may 2016 head coach bob hartley was relieved of his duties he was replaced by former vancouver
