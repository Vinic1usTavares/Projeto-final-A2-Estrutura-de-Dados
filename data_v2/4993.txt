year background and release following a brief hiatus polydor records enlisted brian higgins and xenomania to produce girls aloud s second album in its entirety following success of their debut album higgins explained that polydor were not going to continue with group s contract unless he produced songs for album he continued saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs however polydor insisted that he produce album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted album was recorded from april to september 2004 with lead single being released in june 2004 for lead single from what will neighbours say polydor presented band four singles choices including show wake me up graffiti my soul and androgynous girls although wake me up was preferred choice and also sarah harding s favorite from album it was deemed as sounding too harsh and record company didn t want to take risk they also added androgynous girls as a b side to album s second single three months later pressure to come up with singles was as always immense but we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on radio higgins said they decided to release show which was debuted on 28 june 2004 less than six months after release of jump wake me up was eventually released as fourth and final single from album on 21 february 2005 first verse was recorded on last day of sessions for what will neighbours say kimberley walsh s dressed up and put on my make up line was considered a pivotal point in recording process wake me up was released on two cd single formats as well as an additional 7 picture disc first disc included a remix of girls aloud s previous single a cover version

its inclusion on special edition rarities disc of girls aloud s first greatest hits album sound of girls aloud along with a demo version of wake me up which features an alternate first verse composition and critical reception described as having a garage rock inspired guitar riff wake me up is a fast paced pop rock song that marries a garage rock guitar sound to strange almost aphex twin like sound effects it was reported that girls aloud were going to re record song because are wary of playing song on children s tv in its unaltered form alexis petridis of guardian said that song sounds like what would happen if you married an alarmingly fast techno thud to an implausibly dumb three chord garage rock riff a bbc music critic however deemed track along with deadlines diets and i say a prayer for you an fairly predictable mix of well produced tunes covering various pop styles and themes reviewing girls aloud s first greatest hits album paul scott of stylus magazine said that wake me up long hot summer 2005 and something kinda ooooh 2006 all feel to varying degrees like attempts to recapture seductive bludgeoning of show in 2005 wake me up won award for popjustice ps20
