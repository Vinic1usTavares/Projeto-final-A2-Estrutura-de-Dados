at marie s apartment nicole garcia as l amie marie s friend themes and analysis like rivette s earlier film la belle noiseuse main themes are romantic longing impermanence and identity but this film adds themes of mortality chance and destiny and motifs are repeated from rivette s celine and julie go boating name of julien s cat nevermore evokes poe s raven and its similar themes of death and longing julien s work as a clockmaker literally trying to repair time is an obvious metaphor and film is also timeless giving no indication of when it is set blackmail sub plot is a device to help tell central love story between marie and julien and to explain marie s situation julien is an unlikely blackmailer and madame x s benevolence towards him is surprising plot features dream logic impinging on reality senses of cinema highlighted role of outlandish chance and film comment noted feeling that characters are inventing or re enacting narrative marie may be aware that she is part of a narrative but she still lacks control over her fate michael atkinson believed that rivette was working in border world between narrative meaning and cinematic artifice emotional distance of characters and intellectual and artificial seeming quasi theatrical dialogue is deliberate depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation chasm between marie and julien due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature is emphasised in contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker rivette says he wanted lovers to appear ill suited and for viewer to question relationship they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers beart believes that marie was more alive than julien and that he literally wakes up to her existence only at very end of film finally revealed to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth century french fantasy literature film uses conventions of genre that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts and openly details these conventions marie and adrienne s lives as revenants are reduced to a single purpose each with only memory of her suicide and her last emotions remaining julien like audience is eventually confronted with marie s nightmare of repetition elements of horror genre are used not to scare but to explore memory and loss to stay with marie julien first has to forget about her and at end they have promise of a new beginning marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy marie s tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death and may reflect a fantasy of turning back menopause credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by blossom our day will come that represents love as a pledge only music used in film thumb right

in 2004 at cannes film festival there is an aesthetic focus on beart s body julien telling marie that i love your neck your arms your shoulders your mouth your stomach your eyes i love everything focus is more than erotic as it symbolises marie s fight for corporeality film includes rivette s first ever sex scenes one of them arranged by beart five candid and emotionally charged sex scenes focus on their upper bodies and faces and on their erotic monologues that employ elements of fairy tale horror and sadomasochism beart is given an ethereal quality by lubtchansky s cinematography and lighting and she subtly portrays marie s detachment and vulnerability in latter part of film beart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan showing marie s ageing and angst beart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing part radziwilowicz s performance allows viewer to sympathise with julien despite character s initial nature brochet as madame x has a cool ease and grace

radziwilowicz in 2007 original shoot rivette originally began to make marie et julien as it was then titled in 1975 with producer stephane as part of a series of four films he first called les filles du feu and later scenes de la vie parallele rivette said in 2003 that film was based on true story of a woman who committed suicide he first shot duelle fr duelle in march april and noroit fr noroit in may although latter was not released and fourth film a musical comedy meant to star anna karina and jean marais was never shot filming began on marie et julien that august with albert finney and leslie caron in lead roles and brigitte as madame x but after two days rivette gave up filming due to nervous exhaustion he later used names of lovers marie and julien in his 1981 film le pont du nord revisiting screenplay after rivette had later success with la belle noiseuse and va savoir in 1990s he revisited his older unproduced screenplays with helene frappat he published in book form three of his phantom films including marie et julien in 2002 he decided to film marie et julien a script had never been written and footage had been lost but cryptic notes by his assistant claire denis that had been kept by lubtchansky who had also been cinematographer in 1975 were enough to work from original screenplay included a speaking polyglot cat characters whose names change a suicide room similar to seventh victim madame x and an unknown forbidden gesture that notes stated do not forget filming rivette worked with scriptwriters pascal and christine laurent using an automatic writing approach that involved writing script day by day actors and filmmakers did not know direction of story in advance of each day s filming eurimages provided 000 of funding in july 2002 and film was shot that autumn and winter rivette immediately thought of beart who starred in la belle noiseuse to play carnal marie beart has said that of all films i ve made this was one which most disturbed people very close to me they said it s almost as though emmanuelle we know was up there on screen beart s image in media at time was characterised by near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on cover of elle in may 2003 after filming ended direction right thumb 200px use of lighting is important in cinematography top panel shows light dimming as one oil lamp is placed on a chair in attic room and bottom panel shows light brightening as marie correctly replaces that lamp with a second lamp film illustrates rivette s view that act of watching cinema involves game playing day dreaming and paranoid fantasy he leaves aside usual devices of horror genre no music shock sound effects special effects or gore evoking feelings and scenes verbally rather than showing them yet he does employ hitchcockian macguffins such as chance encounters clues and blackmail plot line use of visuals in opening and closing scenes of film was influenced by rivette s earlier film 1985 an adaptation of wuthering heights by emily bronte some of dialogue that was in original notes was read as though quoting interview with jacques rivette dvd special feature film critic glenn kenny has said that calm precision of mise en scene in opening dream sequence put him under such a powerful spell that it reconfirmed rivette s standing as an ultimately master throughout film everyday sounds are amplified by a lack of music and film uses sweeping long shots and several incidental scenes of julien working talking with his cat and of characters sleeping slant magazine commented that cat is film s most interesting character and philippa hawker of age notes that film has one of best sequences involving a cat on film camera follows cat and films it looking directly at camera giving a sense of artistic freedom and spontaneity cinematography by william lubtchansky furthers rivette s interest in visual textures film s colour palette is largely natural except for certain scenes like initial dream sequence that are filmed in vivid colours in scene where marie is arranging attic room light changes from shadow to warm light just as she places an oil lamp on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly this introduces a supernatural element that contrasts with realism of rest of film interview with emmanuelle beart dvd special features reception critics responses were mixed some found film evocative and powerful whereas others saw it as slow and frustrating guy austin writing in scope noted that bodily reactions are not part of critical reactions to film in both press and online head governs body in reactions to rivette rivette had said before release that this i know in advance whether it is good or not some people will love it and others will hate it it was nominated for 2003 prix louis delluc senses of cinema suggested that it is rivette s most important work since his 1974 film celine and julie go boating and saw it as a film about filmmaking including it in their favourite films of 2004 dvd verdict concluded that it is not only intelligent but willing to assume same of its audience glenn kenny rated it as his favourite film of decade and film curator miriam bale writing in slant magazine included it in her ten most enduring films of decade film comment was equally taken with film stating that what s most remarkable about film is how moving it is finally how much is at stake after all nothing rivette has done before prepares you for emotional undertow that exerts itself in story of marie and final scenes la weekly described film as elegant and unsettling age called it quietly mysterious and haunting and heartrending peter bradshaw of guardian was disappointed arguing that all story s power is allowed to leak away by deliberative heaviness with which rivette pads through his 150 minute narrative with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis philip french noted similarities to hitchcock s vertigo and jean cocteau s orphee but called it surprisingly flat and new york times also found it dry and overdetermined and time out complained that it never supplies expected of a ghost story or emotional draw of a good love story film 4 compared it to sixth sense and others but said that its glacially slow pace will frustrate all but most patient rivette said when promoting film that i like sixth sense because final twist doesn t challenge everything that went before it you can see it again which i did and it s a second film that s just as logical as first one but end of others made rest of it meaningless an intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance ghost for art house audiences was empire wry take digital fix argued that rivette s direction resulted in a product that if never exactly dull and certainly work of a master is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness keith uhlich of slant magazine found it was a lesser rivette offering a watchable ultimately unfulfilling ghost story distribution film was ignored by both cannes and venice then premiered at toronto international film festival on 10 september 2003 it was shown in competition at san sebastian international film
