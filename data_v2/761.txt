area currently known as united arab emirates uae previously trucial states was formerly populated by inhabitants of a number of coastal and inland settlements with human remains pointing to a pattern of transmigration and settlement as far back as 125 000 years prehistoric settlement in uae spanned neolithic with a number of distinctive eras of ancient settlement including stone age arabian bifacial and ubaid cultures from 5 000 to 3 100 bce hafeet period with its distinctive beehive shaped tombs and nasr pottery from 3 200 to 2 600 bce umm al nar period from 2 600 to 2 000 bce wadi suq culture from 2 000 1 300 bce and three iron ages of uae uae s iron age i spanned 1 200 1 000 bce iron age ii 1 000 600 bce and iron age iii from 600 300 bce this was followed by hellenistic mleiha or late pre islamic era from 300 bce onwards through to islamic era which commenced with culmination of 7th century ridda wars remains of settlements burials and other extensive evidence of human habitation throughout these eras is littered throughout uae with many extensive finds of rich materials in shape of pottery jewellery weapons and both human and animal remains providing archaeologists and researchers with an increasingly sophisticated picture of longstanding involvement in regional trade alongside nomadic cultures eking out a living from frequently arid and inhospitable desert and mountain environment of uae first modern digs to take place in trucial states were led by teams from danish moesgaard museum in 1959 and focused island of umm al nar before going on to investigate beehive tombs in and around area of al ain then often still known as buraimi in emirate of abu dhabi first discovery thumb iron age building at jebel buhais first archaeological excavations in uae were in 1959 led by peter glob and his assistant geoffrey bibby glob was a professor at aarhus university and director of its moesgaard museum he had undertaken a series of digs in bahrain and was contacted by director of abu dhabi marine areas ltd an oil company temple hillyard who invited them to visit some graves he had found on small island of umm al nar then referred to as umm an nar having been directed to site by then ruler of abu dhabi sheikh bin sultan al nahyan hillyard had already determined that tumuli were reminiscent of bronze age one in bahrain during excavations at umm al nar ruler s brother sheikh zayed bin sultan al nahyan visited dig and told archaeologists that there were many more such artefacts in al ain he invited them to visit him and led them to a group of some 200 burial cairns what would later turn out to be hafit period burials zayed later took members of danish team to other sites in area including a low tell which is now known as rumailah a significant iron age site subsequent excavations by teams from iraq in 1970s unveiled jebel buhais site as well as hugely significant ancient city of ed dur since then digs have taken place around uae by teams from universities in france spain germany jordan australia and uk prehistory mleiha archaeological centre displays evidence of oldest archaeological finds in uae prehistoric faya 1 collection which dates human occupation in area to 130 000 120 000 bce and has been linked to movement of first anthropologically modern humans from africa to populate world faya discovery made in 2011 includes primitive hand axes as well as several kinds of scrapers and perforators which resemble those used by early modern humans in east africa through technique of thermoluminescence dating artefacts were placed at 125 000 years old this is earliest evidence of modern humans found anywhere outside africa and implies modern humans left africa much earlier than previously thought mleiha is also site of neolithic as well as umm al nar period burials and gives its name to hellenistic mleiha period now more commonly referred to as late pre islamic period from 300 bce onwards characterised by extensive fortified compound mleiha fort which was discovered in late 1990s and is thought to have been possibly seat of an ancient south arabian kingdom oldest radiometrically dated inland burial site in uae is extensive necropolis at jebel buhais site located near madam in sharjah consists of burial sites spanning stone bronze iron and pre islamic ages of human settlement in uae burials at jebel buhais jebel is arabic for mountain date back to 5th millennium bce arabian bifacial during glacial maximum period 68 000 to 8 000 bce eastern arabia is thought to have been uninhabitable finds from stone age arabian bifacial and ubaid cultures including knapped stone arrow and axe heads as well as ubaid pottery show human habitation in area from 5000 to 3100 bce archaeological record shows that arabian bifacial ubaid period came to an abrupt end in eastern arabia and oman peninsula at 3800 bc just after phase of lake lowering and onset of dune reactivation there is no evidence of human presence in area for approximately 1 000 years so called dark millennium this is thought to be consistent with changing patterns of human life as a result of climate change a spring discovered at jebel buhais dried up at this stage an event contemporaneous with similar discoveries pointing to increased aridity in interior of oman throughout southern arabia evidence of human inland settlement in 3rd millennium bce is scant ed dur one of most significant archaeological sites in uae is that at ed dur an ancient near eastern city located in umm al one of largest sites in country comprising an area of some five kilometres coastal settlement overlooks al lake it has been dubbed one of most significant lost cities of arabia it was first discovered by an iraqi archaeological team in 1973 and first dug in 1974 subsequent digs have unearthed evidence of human habitation spanning ubeid period stone age bronze age iron age and pre islamic period during latter period settlement appears to have been at its most prosperous and hills of area were entirely covered with dozens of buildings and thousands of stone built tombs some 500 of these tombs have been excavated with grave goods discovered including drinking sets roman glass weaponry pottery jewelry and ivory objects it is thought some 20 000 tombs are on site in all similarly necropolis of jebel buhais spans a remarkable period with burials evident as far back as fifth millennium bce while mleiha also represents human settlement dating back some 7 000 years hafit period thumb hafit period beehive tomb at jebel hafit hafit period is marked by and named for distinctive beehive tombs first discovered around area of jebel hafit in al ain period defines early bronze age human settlement in united arab emirates and oman in period from 3 200 to 2 600 bc hafit period tombs and remains have also been located across uae and oman in sites such as bidaa bint saud jebel buhais and buraimi in uae and bat al and al ayn in oman first find of hafit era tombs is attributed to danish archaeologist p v glob of moesgaard museum who also investigated umm al nar in 1959 and first of many excavations of these took place a few years later uncovering remains of some 317 circular stone tombs and settlements from hafit period as well as wells and partially underground falaj irrigation systems and mud brick constructions intended for a range of defensive domestic and economic purposes al ain oasis in particular provides evidence of construction and water management enabling early development of agriculture for five millennia up until present day pottery finds at hafit period sites demonstrate trading links to mesopotamia contiguous to nasr period 3100 2900 bc evidence of trading links with mesopotamia are also found in subsequent umm al nar and wadi suq periods of uae history umm al nar period thumb umm al nar period terracotta bottle on display at louvre abu dhabi bronze age umm al nar period spans period 2600 2000 bce name is derived from first excavations which took place at umm al nar an island on coast of abu dhabi in 1959 distinctive circular tombs of umm al nar period distinguish it from preceding hafit period together with finds of distinctive black on red decorated pottery and jewellery made with gems such as carnelian sourced from indus valley seven tombs from a total of fifty and three areas at ruins of ancient settlement were examined by danish archaeologists in 1959 season during their first visit they identified a few exposed shaped stones fitted together at some of stone mounds following year first excavations started at one of mounds on plateau now called tomb i two more seasons 1960 and 1961 involved digging more tombs while last three seasons 1962 63 1964 and 1965 were allocated to examining settlement danish excavations at umm al nar halted in 1965 but work resumed in 1975 by an archaeological team from iraq during iraqi excavations which lasted one season five tombs were excavated and a small section of village was examined between 1970 and 1972 an iraqi restoration team headed by shah al former member of antiquities director in baghdad restored and or reconstructed danish excavated tombs left thumb umm al nar tomb at mleiha at al archaeological site in dubai archaeological excavation between 1994 and 1995 revealing an umm al nar type circular tomb dating between 2500 and 2000 b c dubai municipality and archaeology institute conducted excavations at site of al ashoosh between november 2015 and may 2016 site was discovered during two seasons of survey in 2002 2003 following discovery of nearby iron age metallurgical centre saruq al hadid and is located 8 km from that site surveys in area by dubai municipality and department of antiquities of jordan identified 33 archaeological sites ranging in date from prehistory to late islamic period in 2006 2007 more detailed archaeological investigations of area of al ashoosh were conducted including survey excavation and geological sampling at tell abraq settlements associated with start of umm al nar culture began c 2500 bc finds at shimal and ed dur also point to a transitional period between umm al nar and following wadi suq periods excavations at shimal principally those of mid 1980s by a team from university of gottingen in germany are significant as they provided early evidence of wadi suq period including finds of pottery soft stone vessels bronze and copper weapons and beads which came to be regarded as typical of period c 2000 1300 bc in uae wadi suq period thumb wadi suq burial at shimal ras al khaimah wadi suq culture flourished in period from 2 000 to 1 300 bce it takes its name from a wadi or waterway east of sohar in oman rather than a seismic cultural shift a gradual change in human society which is centred around more sophisticated approaches to animal husbandry particularly domestication of camel as well as changes in surrounding trade and social environments took place between umm al nar and wadi suq periods transition between umm al nar and wadi suq is thought to have taken some 200 years and more with finds at important wadi suq site of tell abraq in modern umm al showing evidence of continuity of umm al nar burials at qattara oasis in al ain wadi suq communal tomb is thought to have been constructed from stones recovered from previous umm al nar burials evidence of increased mobility among population points to a gradual change in human habits rather than sudden change and important wadi suq era sites such as tell abraq ed dur seih al harf shimal and kalba show an increasing sophistication in copper and bronze ware as well as trade links both east to indus valley and west to mesopotamia changes in two important trading partners also took place during this period with mesopotamian city of ur falling to elam in 2 000 bc and decline of indus valley harappan culture in 1 800 bc abandonment of port of umm al nar took place at around this time left thumb wadi suq burial at jebel buhais wadi suq site at seih al harf in ras al khaimah was first excavated by a team from university of durham led by derek kennet in spring of 2013 site comprises a series of 50 burial sites of which two were directly threatened by road development an 18 metre horseshoe shaped and a w shaped tomb both were collective graves ten other excavated features were also impacted by road development although site was seen to be threatened by development of northern extension of arterial emirates road with proposals tabled to amend road development to avoid damage to site road project went ahead a number of wadi suq and iron age discoveries were made in mountain village of bithnah in fujairah first excavated by swiss liechtenstein foundation for archaeological research abroad slfa between 1987 and 1991 presided over by prince hans adam ii of liechtenstein and directed in field by pierre slfa team conducted several seasons of survey in mountainous inland area of fujairah including excavations at bithnah where a communal grave site was uncovered as well as a number of iron age finds there have also been excavations by teams from university of geneva and french national research centre significant iron age finds have been made throughout area including a number of petroglyphs iron age from 1 200 bc to advent of islam in eastern arabia through three distinctive iron ages iron age 1 1200 1000 bc iron age ii 1000 600 bc and iron age iii 600 300 bc and hellenistic mleiha period 300 bc onward area was variously occupied by and other forces and saw construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to development of falaj irrigation system also called qanat early finds of aflaj particularly those around desert city of al ain have been cited as earliest evidence of construction of these waterways it is thought nearby bidaa bint saud became an important site during iron age both as a caravan stop and as a settled community of farmers that used falaj irrigation system there two of these irrigation passages have been partly excavated at bidaa bin saud with a number of sections remaining in reasonable condition in one of excavations a number of sandstone lined shaft holes were discovered as well as a stepped underground access point and a large open cistern evidence of formerly irrigated land has also been found at site thumb snake decoration on a pot from rumailah important iron age centres in uae have rendered an unusual richness in finds to archaeologists particularly spectacular metallurgical centre of saruq al hadid in what is today dubai other important iron age settlements in country include al thuqeibah madam bidaa bint saud ed dur and tell abraq p hellyer new finds at tell abraq journal of emirates natural history group vol 2 no 1 pp 15 17 1992 iron age burials at jebel buhais particularly group of graves defined as 85 are thought to be linked to nearby iron age settlement site of al thuqeibah site was originally excavated by teams from autonomous university of madrid in mid 1990s thuqeibah has been dated from iron age ii and iii periods 1100 400 bc a settlement consisting of a number of houses and a well it has been associated with a nearby iron age falaj system thought to date from iron age ii era 1st millennium aflaj have also been unearthed at nearby al madam left thumb iron age dagger from qattara site of rumailah in al ain like many in uae spans a wide period with finds dating back to umm al nar period but shows a flourishing during iron age finds at rumailah include distinctive pottery adorned with snake patterns similar to finds at qusais and major iron and bronze ages metallurgical production centre at saruq al hadid as well as chlorite vessels decorated with turtles alternating with trees similar to finds from in fujairah qusais in dubai and al hajar in bahrain a number of iron age swords and axe heads as well as distinctive seal moulds were also recovered from site a number of bronze arrowheads were also found at site iron age buildings found at rumailah are typical of those found in region at iron age i and ii sites such as al thuqeibah and muweilah with a number of row dwellings although lacking perimeter walls found at thuqeibah a columned hall at rumailah provides a further link to muweilah while a number of pyramidal seals found at rumailah find an echo with similar objects discovered at bidaa bint saud one of most significant iron age sites in uae is muweilah located in sharjah suburb of al near sharjah university city a large fortified settlement thought to have been occupied during iron age ii period 1100 site has been explored by archaeologists since an australian expedition started work there in 1994 after discovery of pottery shards by a local resident it has yielded oldest known example of writing found to date in uae a pottery shard with an inscription thought to be sabean with letters saruq al hadid saruq al hadid site in desert south of dubai was a centre of constant human habitation trade and metallurgy from umm al nar period 2600 2000 bce to 1 000 bce when it was a major location for smelting bronze copper and iron arguably its most important period of flourishing was as a metallurgical centre in iron age ii period 1100 600 bce one of many thousands of finds to be documented at site was an ornate gold ring which became inspiration for dubai s expo 2020 logo thumb gold jewelry from saruq al hadid some of many enigmas surrounding site are its location far from sources of water ore or firewood all critical elements to a metallurgical centre an abundance of pottery and metal artifacts have given rise to speculation of possibly identifying site as a centre of snake worship in all over 12 000 unique objects have been unearthed at site a number of key finds are on public display at dubai s saruq al hadid archaeology museum in al housed in a traditional wind tower building constructed in 1928 by sheikh juma bin maktoum al maktoum post islamic finds archaeologists have worked on post islamic era sites across uae particularly in ras al khaimah coastal settlement of and east coast on east coast in fujairah village of bidayah has been focus of a number of explorations of its mosque and remains of a portuguese fort discovered in village by a team of australian archaeologists fort originally called was identified from a 16th century map its walls were constructed using rock recovered from a nearby tower dated back to third millennium bce these walls some 60 metres in length are joined in a square with towers on each corner and stand today at a height of up to a meter finds at site of fort include locally made pottery dating back to 17th and 18th centuries and charcoal samples unearthed were carbon dated to 1450 1600 within context of portuguese presence in gulf bidayah mosque s date of construction is uncertain and because mud and stone built structure uses no wood radiocarbon dating is not possible it is estimated to date to 15th century however some much earlier estimates have been proposed site was investigated by archaeological center of fujairah in co operation with university of sydney from 1997 98 and fujairah archaeology and heritage department came up with conclusion that mosque was believed to be built in 1446 ad along with two watch towers overlooking mosque and village see also list of ancient settlements in uae references category archaeology of united arab emirates category history of united arab emirates by
