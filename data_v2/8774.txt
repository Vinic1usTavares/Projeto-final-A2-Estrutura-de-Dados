street eventually discovered an available building at 312 azusa street in downtown los angeles which had originally been constructed as an african methodist episcopal church in what was then an impoverished part of town rent was 8 00 per month a newspaper referred to downtown los angeles building as a tumble down shack since church had moved out building had served as a wholesale house a warehouse a lumberyard stockyards a tombstone shop and had most recently been used as a stable with rooms for rent upstairs it was a small rectangular flat roofed building approximately long and wide totaling sided with weathered whitewashed clapboards only sign that it had once been a house of god was a single gothic style window over main entrance discarded lumber and plaster littered large barn like room on ground floor nonetheless it was secured and cleaned in preparation for services they held their first meeting on april 14 1906 church services were held on first floor where benches were placed in a rectangular pattern some of benches were simply planks put on top of empty nail kegs there was no elevated platform as ceiling was only eight feet high initially there was no pulpit frank

black members who translated languages into english by supernatural ability singing was sporadic and in a cappella or occasionally there would be singing in tongues there were periods of extended silence attenders were occasionally slain in spirit visitors gave their testimony and members read aloud testimonies that were sent to mission by mail there was prayer for gift of tongues there was prayer in tongues for sick for missionaries and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in there was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation sanctification and baptism of holy spirit lawrence catley whose family attended revival said that in most services preaching consisted of seymour opening a bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by holy spirit many people would continually shout throughout meetings members of mission never took an offering but there was a receptacle near door for anyone who wanted to support revival core

largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups southeast united states was a particularly prolific area of growth for movement since seymour s approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate that had already been taking root in those areas other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and poor many existing wesleyan holiness denominations adopted pentecostal message such as church of god cleveland tennessee church of god in christ and pentecostal holiness church formation of new denominations also occurred motivated by doctrinal differences between wesleyan pentecostals and their finished work counterparts such as assemblies of god formed in 1914 and pentecostal church of god formed in 1919 an early doctrinal controversy led to a split between trinitarian and oneness pentecostals latter founded pentecostal assemblies of world in 1916 and united pentecostal church in 1945
