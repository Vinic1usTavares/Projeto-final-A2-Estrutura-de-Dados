thomas is first known bishop of finland only a few facts are known about his life he resigned in 1245 and died in visby three years later biography only reference to bishop thomas during his episcopate in finland is a letter signed by him in nousiainen in 1234 which granted certain lands around parish to his chaplain wilhelm in latin hosted by national archive of finland see and diplomatarium fennicum from menu lands may be related to papal permission from pope gregory ix in early 1229 that authorized church to take over all non christian places of worship in finland in latin letter is oldest surviving letter written in finland no further information on bishop s activities has survived before he was granted resignation by pope innocent iv on 21 february 1245 in latin according to pope thomas had admitted committing several felonies such as torturing a man to death and forging a papal letter a mid 15th century chronicle chronicon episcoporum finlandensium by an unknown writer claimed that reason for bishop s resignation was fury of and russians church representatives to oversee resignation were archbishop of uppsala and dominican prior of dacian province dominican dacian province covered denmark and other scandinavia see thomas donated his books to newly established dominican convent in sigtuna in latin one of books cod ups c 134 still survives with a curse written on it by monks in case someone steals it see also and went on to live his last years in dominican convent in visby gotland he died there in 1248 year of his death is from chronicon episcoporum finlandensium shortly before second swedish crusade which cemented swedish rule in finland for more than 550 years thumb 180px left finland was briefly under same papal legate as teutonic knights during thomas episcopate finland is listed among lands under papal legate in baltic region originally bishop of baldwin and then william of modena first on 28 january 1232 and last on 15 july 1244 see finland mentioned among lands under legate and all in latin this was a radical realignment of bishopric s position since pope had earlier used swedish bishops to assist finnish church as evident from papal letters from 1171 or 1172 1221 and 1229 on 24 november 1232 pope even asked livonian brothers of sword to provide forces for unnamed bishop of finland to defend country against novgorodian attacks in latin after thomas had resigned in 1245 there was no immediate successor to him diocese was overseen by william at least until 5 june 1248 in latin finland is not listed among swedish dioceses in surviving documents from 1241 and 1248 but appears among them in 1253 suomen 1989 even though thomas is first known bishop of finland it is certain that he was not first bishop overall an unnamed bishop of finland is mentioned dead in a letter by pope innocent iii already in 1209 to archbishop of lund in latin a 15th century chronicle names bishops henry and before him but no indisputable records survive of them speculations being first historical figure of importance in finland historians have tried to attribute more significance to thomas than what is evident from existing sources see ja risto kari 2004 pages 103 108 book is in finnish unknown bishop in 1220s most commonly thomas is speculated to have been unnamed bishop of finland to whom pope gregory ix replied in january 1229 with several letters of great importance to church bishop s original letters have not survived see pope s letters all in latin in aftermath of major finnish losses in battle against republic of novgorod church representatives ordered by pope to assist unnamed bishop were bishop of linkoping and cistercian abbot in gotland complementing orders for blocking harbours from russian merchants were also given to a cistercian abbot in and a benedictine abbot in lubeck left thumb 150px cistercians dominated northern missionary work until early 1230s thomas identification with bishop remains doubtful a surviving letter by pope gregory ix directly to chaplain of nousiainen on 20 october 1232 makes finnish see appear vacant in latin letter handled same land dispute that thomas himself addressed two years later in some copies of letter bishop of finland is also referred to as n letter may originally have also been h or w easily mistaken by later copyists while not directly saying whether he was still in office or not a papal letter to an unknown bishop of finland was also sent already in 1221 in latin uprising in tavastia violent anti church clashes in tavastia central finland mentioned in a letter by pope gregorius ix in 1237 have been attributed to thomas harsh methods of christianization but without direct evidence for that conjecture in latin letter addressed to archbishop of uppsala does not mention bishop or diocese of finland in any way information about uprising had also originated from temporarily sidelined archbishop who seems to have used occasion to remind pope about uppsala s earlier contributions to missionary work in north pope had clearly not known where tavastia exactly was and eloquently urged archbishop to send in a crusade livonian brothers of sword had been all but annihilated in battle of saule in 1236 even if there is no other evidence of their presence in finland than earlier papal letter from 1232 both archbishop and tavastians seem to have been on move right after their demise there had also been a revolt against germans in estonia in 1236 based on letter some historians have tried to date so called second swedish crusade to 1238 or 1239 listing it as thomas accomplishments as well battle of neva thomas is also speculated to have been one of driving forces behind battle of neva a disputed swedish novgorodian conflict that took place in 1240 speculation is based on 14th century russian primary chronicle mention of finns and tavastians fighting on swedish side which according to some historians would have been organized by bishop however as chronicle also lists very unlikely norwegians as allies norway and sweden were on brink of war from 1225 until treaty of in 1249 information is often regarded as mid 14th century propaganda depicting sweden as being in control of norway finland and tavastia see also diocese of finland bishop henry list of bishops of turku references category
