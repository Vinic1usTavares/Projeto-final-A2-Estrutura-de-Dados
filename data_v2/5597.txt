images that transform into something dark then into calm series premiered adult swim on january 1st 2011 4 00 am new year s day hughes a former employee of mtv animation first pitched it to mike lazzo at adult swim after producing a video mixtape for network s 2010 carnival tour event as a result of its 4 a m graveyard slot and small selection of episodes series remains relatively unknown on

footage and morphing psychedelic imagery arranged around a single loose theme expressed in episode title and blended without pause into a single continuous presentation production series creator dave hughes first started working for adult swim in 2003 after an eight year stint with mtv animation where he had edited series such as beavis and butt head and celebrity deathmatch hughes who saw adult swim slipping away from its more experimental roots as it got popular had concept for off air in mind before but never thought he would be one to make it while living in new york 120 minutes concrete tv liquid television and night flight were among some of experimental programming that exposed him to a whole new world of ideas music and people that i just didn t see anywhere else on television hughes first pitched series to network through mike lazzo at adult swim sometime after late 2009 after producing a video mixtape that would be projected behind musical performers for network s 2010 carnival tour event he compiled footage for mixtape using archives as well as various online sources and applied visual effects to them until you didn t quite know what you were looking at he originally imagined for it to exist as a bizarre collection of internet and archival footage intertwined with clips from adult swim shows set to good music he ultimately had to omit latter material however as network would still have to acquire licenses for their own series in derivative works he found that once they were gone show really opened up in putting an episode together hughes seeks clips with some kind of truth or integrity to them opting for both viral videos in addition to ones with fewer view counts tracking down licensees for clips proves to be most difficult aspect of process he stated with co producers cody and alan steadman assisting him in pursuit of material hard to obtain when asked if getting consent for other s work posed a challenge hughes noted it to be helpful working under adult swim banner with only a few artists responding with reluctance he wrote that each piece of episode is treated with protection not trying to exploit anyone or make fun of anything or anybody each episode is edited using final cut pro along with adobe photoshop and adobe after effects for further manipulation often employing data moshing techniques hughes observed a large portion of producing episodes to stem from finding right music to go with visuals or vice versa and found transitions to really help keep it moving likewise hughes digressed from liquid television use of longer segments in order to make series a larger event rather than a series of smaller events and found visual effects and transitions to be a huge part of his theory in making an episode starting in season 7 series began airing episodes produced by guest curators a compilation of videos that were once considered to be featured in first season had been published on network s official blog these videos extending into its second season as well as hosting various other supplemental material have since been published onto network awesome a compilation of material from first season and additional shorts was given a theatrical release at cinefamily on august 25 2012 which hughes attended broadcast and reception its pilot episode animals premiered on adult swim on new year s day 2011 at 4 a m it was broadcast twice in a row back to back episodes have continued to air in this time slot considered a graveyard slot in broadcast programming and as a result of this and its small selection of episodes series remains relatively unknown on network however austin mcmanus of juxtapoz noted word of mouth to be gradually spreading about it he and network also described show as a cult phenomenon three specials have been produced dan deacon u s a broadcast july 6 2013 consists of surreal footage of american landscapes with music from last four tracks of album america by dan deacon a second special second season episode nightmares played in literal reverse aired after halloween night on november 1 2014 third special is a music video of deacon s song when i was done dying from his album animated by nine directors featured previously in off air that broadcast march 24 2015 it has received positive critical reception with mcmanus conducting an eight page interview and profile of hughes in appreciation of series magazine had previously published a special issue centered on network and its shows in july 2012 but overlooked off air presenting an opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show speaking from first time he watched it mcmanus praised it for not being your typical try too hard to be weird production in adweek sam ranked it second place out of 18 other programs on network he tied it with network s parody infomercial specials and wrote that it was in same category as king star king among things that are so cool and strange that they look like they should probably be part of a video installation in an art gallery somewhere for neon tommy jeremy called it a dark unspeakable corner of television where no light can reach and only sleepless and drug addled dare to venture amanda of miami new times joked that for artists featured on show nothing compares to prestige of sharing a network with tim eric and brak right ultimately she saw it as already bizarre network s foray into out there visual experimentation writing for fader matthew trammell regarded it as when things get really interesting pq of underground dubbed series a modern version of liquid television and called it really kinda spiffy and trippy and cool casper kelly sought inspiration from show during production of his short film for network too many cooks ratings wise several episodes have surpassed one million views according to nielsen media research hughes added that he follows series ratings when it occurs to him but does not receive further analytics he found it to trend on twitter during weeks of its airing and likes viewing user s statuses regarding it in particular he enjoys reactions from people who wake up to it after falling asleep to network and judged from online response that its audience would be pretty young late teens early 20s and strangely positive and engaged network has broadcast praise of show written by viewers in form of bumpers often hinting at further episodes being produced episodes have been distributed to sites like youtube while a continuous online stream of show was launched by network on september 5 2014 on december 19 2014 show s facebook page announced that additional exclusive material will be added to livestream episodes explanatory notes references further reading
