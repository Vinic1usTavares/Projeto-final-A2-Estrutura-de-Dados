guepinia is a genus of fungus in auriculariales order it is a monotypic genus containing single species guepinia helvelloides commonly known as apricot jelly fungus produces salmon pink ear shaped gelatinous fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in small tufted groups on soil usually associated with buried rotting wood fruit bodies are tall and up to wide stalks are not well differentiated from cap fungus although rubbery is edible and may be eaten raw with salads pickled or candied it has a white spore deposit and oblong to ellipsoid spores measure 9 11 by 5 6 micrometers fungus is widely distributed in northern hemisphere and has also been collected from south america taxonomy species was first described and illustrated as tremella rufa by nicolaus joseph von jacquin in 1778 elias magnus fries later 1828 called it guepinia helvelloides in his elenchus fungorum based on augustin pyramus de candolle s tremella helvelloides both being names he sanctioned this has made tremella rufa and all names based on it unavailable for use as they are conserved later lucien quelet erected a separate monotypic genus for jacquin s species whereas julius oscar placed it as gyrocephalus rufa in persoon s small genus gyrocephalus rejected name for proper name for fungus was debated for some time as name guepinia is a homonym pointed out by fries in 1828 because it had been used by toussaint bastard in 1812 for a genus of flowering plants in cruciferae family to further complicate matters generic name teesdalia originally considered to have priority over name guepinia for plant genus was later determined to have been validly published after guepinia rendering teesdalia an illegitimate name in 1982 changes in international code for botanical nomenclature gave protected status to all names adopted by fries in elenchus fungorum and established guepinia as correct genus name guepinia is variously classified in auriculariales order with uncertain familial position incertae sedis or as part of family genus is named after french mycologist jean pierre 1779 1858 mushroom is commonly known as red jelly fungus or apricot jelly description thumb left in germany fruit bodies of guepinia helvelloides grow singly or in small clumps although they can appear to be growing in soil their mycelium lives in buried wood they are tall and wide spoon or tongue shaped and twisted like a cornet or horn so that they look like a slender funnel cut out on one side and often with a wavy margin fruit bodies are flexible thick and smooth on outer side which they are usually attenuated on underside into a cylindrical or depressed stem that is up to high and about thick stem is normally covered with a white tomentum at base upper side inside of fruit body is usually quite sterile or with a few isolated basidia and is slightly as a result of densely crowded protruding ends of hyphae sterile and fertile surfaces of fruit body are almost same color transparent reddish orange to flesh pink or flesh orange at other times more purplish red fruit bodies usually develop a slightly brownish tinge when they are old underside is usually slightly more vividly colored than upper side flesh is gelatinous softly so in upper part of fruit body and with a more cartilage like consistency in stem it has a nondescript odor and a watery insignificant taste hymenium is developed on under outer side of fruit body basidia spore bearing cells consist of a globular part hypobasidia to which inflated or elongated epibasidia are attached in guepinia hypobasidia are egg shaped to ellipsoid measuring 12 16 by 9 12 mm and attached to like epibasidia that are 20 45 by 3 4 mm spore deposit is white while spores are 9 11 by 5 6 mm hyaline translucent cylindrical to elongated ellipsoid in shape and have a large oil drop edibility guepinia helvelloides is an edible but bland fungus older specimens are usually tough and indigestible it can be used raw in salads for pickling in vinegar and also for preserving in sugar like candied fruit one source reports using it to prepare a wine by fermenting with wine yeast similar species thumb right red chanterelle cantharellus cinnabarinus has gills on undersurface guepinia helvelloides has a rather unusual appearance and is not likely to be mistaken for other fungi however red chanterelle species cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar unlike g helvelloides however it does not have a rubbery and gelatinous texture and its undersurface is wrinkled not smooth habitat and distribution guepinia helvelloides is saprobic deriving nutrients by breaking down organic matter fruit bodies of g typically grow solitarily or in small tufts on soil usually in association with buried rotting wood although fruit bodies sometimes appear in spring they are more commonly found in summer and autumn months in north america it is associated with coniferous forests it is also found throughout temperate north america from canada to mexico europe iran and turkey it is also known from brazil and puerto rico fungus has also been collected from qinling region of china references external links category auriculariales
