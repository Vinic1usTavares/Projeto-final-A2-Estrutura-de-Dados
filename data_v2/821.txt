thumb lilium candidum alt flowers of lilium candidum lilioid monocots lilioids monocots petaloid monocots petaloid lilioid monocots is an informal name used for a grade grouping of taxa with common characteristics of five monocot orders petrosaviales dioscoreales pandanales liliales and asparagales in which majority of species have flowers with relatively large coloured tepals this characteristic is similar to that found in lilies lily like petaloid monocots refers to flowers having tepals which all resemble petals petaloid taxonomic terms lilianae or liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times from early nineteenth century many of species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family liliaceae sensu lato or s l lily family these classification systems are still found in many books and other sources within monocots liliaceae s l were distinguished from glumaceae development of molecular phylogenetics cladistic theory and phylogenetic methods in 1990s resulted in a dismemberment of liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders liliales asparagales and dioscoreales subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders petrosaviales and pandanales also segregate with this group resulting in modern concept of five constituent orders within lilioid monocot assemblage this has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups alismatid lilioid and commelinid monocots lilioids are paraphyletic in sense that commelinids form a sister group to asparagales description true lilioids descriptive term petaloid lilioid monocot relates to conspicuous petal like petaloid tepals which superficially resemble true lilies lilium morphologically petaloid or lilioid monocots can be considered to possess five groups of three fold trimerous whorls lilioid monocots all have flowers which can be considered to have been derived from a lily like flower with six relatively similar tepals and six stamens typical lilioid gynoecium has three carpels fused into a superior trilocular three chambered superior ovary axile placentation a single hollow style and several ovules with anatropous orientation in one or two rows per locule and nectaries at base however floral synapomorphy shared characteristics is rare since most conform to general monocot pattern this pattern is ancestral plesiomorphic for lilioid monocots structural is rare except for orchidaceae various trends are apparent among lilioids notably a change to an inferior ovary and a reduction of number of stamens to three in some groups such as genus trillium in liliaceae tepals have become clearly differentiated so that flower has three coloured petals and three smaller green sepals almost all lilioid monocots retain at least three petal like tepals since some commelinids e g in and have petaloid flowers term lilioid is a more accurate one for group which excludes them since term petaloid monocot is still occasionally used in describing commelinids morphological concept of petaloid monocots has been equated with animal attracting that is for pollination as opposed to wind pollinating plants such as grasses that have evolved very different floral structures pollen structure shows that of two main tapetum types secretory and lilioid monocots are nearly all secretory comparison with other monocot orders in orders that branched off before lilioid monocots acorales and alismatales flowers differ in several ways in some cases like acorus acorales they have become insignificant in others like alismatales they have six coloured tepals and so could be called petaloid but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in lilioid monocots later evolved commelinids have various kinds of flower few of which are lily like in order comprising grasses rushes and sedges flowers are either petal less or have small unshowy petals many species have brightly coloured and showy flowers however their apparent structure is misleading for example six tepals of are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them taxonomy early history thumb john lindley vegetable kingdom 1846 in one of earliest monocot taxonomies that of john lindley 1830 grouping corresponding to lilioid monocots was tribe petaloideae in lindley s system monocots consisted of two tribes petaloideae and glumaceae grasses and sedges lindley divided petaloideae into 32 orders roughly corresponding to families and glumaceae into two further orders various successive taxonomies of monocots also emphasized grouping of species with petaloid undifferentiated perianths such as bentham and hooker s and hutchinson s corolla bearing 1936 hence concept that there was a natural grouping of monocots whose flowers were predominantly petaloid gave notion to term petaloid monocots core group of were liliaceae hence lilioid monocots term lilioid monocot or lilioid has had widely varying interpretations one of narrower applications is lily like monocots meaning two orders asparagales and liliales but term has also been applied to s superorder lilianae whole of liliales or restricted to cronquist s broadly defined liliaceae although petaloid and lilioid have often been used interchangeably as heywood points out some usages of petaloid monocot particularly in horticulture are so broad as to be almost meaningless in that it had been used to refer to all species with conspicuous petals or perianth segments tepals which would cover a broad swathe of families he estimated three dozen across many orders other authors have defined it equally broadly as having two whorls of tepals sepals and petals that are petal like as kron and chase stated in 1995 this taxonomic unit had been in a considerable state of flux with significant variation between systems of cronquist 1981 thorne 1983 1992 and dahlgren 1985 when classification systems were based on morphological characters alone lilioid species which clearly departed from lily pattern were easily placed into separate families for example amaryllidaceae contained species whose flowers had six stamens and an inferior ovary iridaceae contained those with three stamens and an inferior ovary remaining taxa were put together in a very broadly defined liliaceae usually refereed to as liliaceae sensu lato s l cronquist system s definition for example is broadest of all rolf dahlgren and colleagues were responsible for one of most radical reorganisation of families and in their 1985 monocot monograph defined two orders asparagales and liliales which contain bulk of monocot geophytes as constituting lilioid monocots development of dna sequencing and use of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots confirmed what many taxonomists had long suspected liliaceae s l was highly polyphyletic family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups which belonged to quite separate families and even orders for instance some genera such as hyacinthus previously placed in liliaceae s l were reclassified in families within asparagales in this case in 1995 chase et al reviewed understanding of lilioids and equated them to s liliiflorae which they designated as superorder lilianae they pointed out that understanding of phylogenetics of this group was critical for establishment of a monocot classification they also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic having a common ancestor a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly excluding some descendants of a common ancestor for instance dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy that of a petaloid perianth yet in discussing his admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic dahlgren treated monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders dioscoreales asparagales liliales melanthiales burmanniales and in his liliiflorae phylogenetic era in 1995 study by chase et al referred to above which was largest yet to use purely molecular data results demonstrated paraphyly of lilioids however because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to monophyly of this group they identified four major clades of monocots they named these alismatids aroids stemonoids and dioscoreoids in addition to acorus and a core group of asparagales liliales and commelinoids they based names of these groups on closest corresponding superorders and orders of dahlgren with exception of stemonoids based on stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent there was no clear clade corresponding to dahlgren s liliiflorae whose families were distributed amongst aroids and dioscoreoids of dahlgren s liliiflorae dioscoreales largely grouped into dioscoreoids with exception of stemonaceae asparagales formed two major groupings which they labelled higher and lower and included both iridaceae and orchidaceae from dahlgren s liliales on other hand a number of families from three other orders asparagales dioscoreales melanthiales segregated together with remaining liliales families genera from dahlgren s melanthiales were found in both dioscoreoids and redefined liliales finally dahlgren s burmanniales were found to belong with dioscoreoids some asparagales taxa were also found amongst commelinoids stemonoids were formed from stemonaceae and other families from a variety of orders including pandanaceae which alone formed dahlgren s in an attempt to resolve apparent differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder liliiflorae as monophyletic provided that a few modifications were undertaken these included removal of two tribes of melanthiales and inclusion of three additional families pandanaceae and from other superorders this newly and more narrowly redefined lilianae liliiflorae contained three orders aparagales liliales and dioscoreales which now included stemonoids this analysis also allowed for establishment of a single synapomorphy although this time by presence of an inferior ovary significantly authors noted that it was no wonder authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by lilianae angiosperm phylogeny group these findings presented at first monocot conference in 1993 with addition of several studies that had become available in interim formed basis of 1998 consensus angiosperm phylogeny group apg ordinal scheme among other things alismatales were expanded and new orders such as acorales a placement for acorus and pandanales which now represented stemonoids as well as new families added while not formally assigning any supraordinal ranks classification did recognize an informal grouping of monocot orders as commelinoids otherwise apg recognized only six monocot orders acorales alismatales asparagales dioscoreales liliales and pandanales last four were however grouped together in resulting cladogram and most closely represent concept of lilioids although this left some unplaced monocot families including and petrosaviaceae simultaneous with release of 1998 apg classification were two events publication of kubitzki s major monograph on monocots and second monocot conference kubitzki defined superorder lilianae as all monocots except superorders and that is four orders asparagales liliales dioscoreales and pandanales monocot conference devoted an entire section to systematics of lilioids and included an update of their previous research by chase and colleagues on this occasion latter felt that there was now enough data to put forward a definitive classification defining lilioids as comprising four orders placed in lilianae by kubitzki and colleagues 2002 followed chase 2000 in using term lilioid monocots and again noting unresolved polytomy between these four orders and remaining monocot clades commelinids and petrosaviaceae although at that time petrosaviaceae were still unplaced there was now enough new data to justify revising apg system and a new classification was issued in 2003 although this resulted in changes within orders it did not affect relationship between them lilioid monocots were discussed but not formally recognized commelinids renamed from commelinoids being only supraordinal grouping in monocots to be named and petrosaviaceae remained unplaced second version of apg coincided with third monocot conference 2003 findings from which using additional molecular markers helped to resolve some of remaining questions regarding relationships within this assemblage petrosaviaceae was shown to be included in what chase refers to as and placed in order petrosaviales while dioscoreales and pandanales were demonstrated to be sister clades rapid advances in understanding monocot relationships necessitated release of another revision of apg classification 2009 which incorporated these advances further definition of relationships between lineages using multiple markers is continuing textbooks and other sources produced in last century are inevitably based on older classifications publications using versions of apg system are now appearing and world checklist of selected plant families from royal botanic gardens kew now uses apg iii system as does angiosperm phylogeny website and hence classification of lilioid monocots shown in cladogram below kew botanists treat monocots as falling into three major groupings alismatid monocots acorales alismatales lilioid monocots five other non commelinid monocots and commelinid monocots they also organize their monocot research into two teams i alismatids and lilioids and ii commelinids a similar approach is taken by judd in his plant systematics phylogeny and evolution cladogram shown below displays orders of lilianae sensu chase reveal monocots based on molecular phylogenetic evidence lilioid monocot orders are bracketed namely petrosaviales dioscoreales pandanales liliales and asparagales these constitute a paraphyletic assemblage that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants in this case commelinids which are a sister group to asparagales to form a clade all groups joined by thick lines would need to be included while acorales and alismatales have been collectively referred to as alismatid monocots remaining clades lilioid and commelinid monocots have been referred to as core monocots relationship between orders with exception of two sister orders is pectinate that is diverging in succession from line that leads to commelinids numbers indicate crown group most recent common ancestor of sampled species of clade of interest divergence times in mya million years ago while this is most commonly understood relationship davis et al 2013 using a combination of plastid genomes have suggested that if asparagales is treated sensu stricto by excluding its largest and most atypical family orchidaceae then aparagales sensu apg may not be monophyletic and that orchidaceae and liliales may be sister groups and in turn are sister of asparagales however their data produced conflicting models zeng et al 2014 using nuclear genes also found evidence for a sister relationship between asparagales and liliales although divergence time estimates within lilioids have varied considerably they were also able to obtain molecular clock estimates for origin of lilioids at approximately 125 mya cretaceous period on other hand a large data set using a combined analysis of nuclear mitochondrial and plastid genes together with nuclear c was in agreement with earlier apg relationships subdivision five orders make up lilioid monocots petrosaviales 1997 dioscoreales r br 1835 pandanales r br ex j 1820 liliales 1826 asparagales link 1829 thumb
