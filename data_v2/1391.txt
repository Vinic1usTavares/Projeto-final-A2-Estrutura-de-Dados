for almost a week inflicting heavy casualties on it while suffering few casualties of their own north koreans eventually were able to overwhelm us forces with sheer numbers capturing hwanggan and pushing american units further south however action solidified 27th infantry s position as a valuable reserve unit for us eighth army during battle of pusan perimeter 27th distinguished itself in several critical battles including battle of bowling alley background outbreak of war following invasion of south korea by north korea and subsequent outbreak of korean war united nations decided to commit troops to conflict on behalf of south korea united states sent ground forces to korean peninsula with goal of fighting back north korean invasion and to prevent south korea from collapsing however us forces in far east had been steadily decreasing since end of world war ii in 1945 and at time closest forces were 24th infantry division of eighth army which was headquartered in japan division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending regardless 24th infantry division was ordered into south korea thumb left alt a city square

to take initial shock of north korean advances delaying much larger north korean units to buy time to allow follow on forces to arrive division was consequently outnumbered and outgunned for several weeks as it attempted to delay north koreans making time for 7th infantry division 25th infantry division 1st cavalry division and other eighth army supporting units to move into position republic of korea army rok forces in meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along korea s east coast with entire divisions being overrun by kpa superior firepower and equipment advance elements of

chonan and pyongtaek 24th infantry division made a final stand in battle of taejon being almost completely destroyed in process but delaying north korean forces from advancing until july 20 by that time eighth army s force of combat troops was roughly equal to north korean forces attacking region at around 70 000 for each side with new un units arriving every day north korean advance in east north koreans advanced immediately after taking taejon four north korean divisions split up and approached un lines along separate routes kpa 15th division was first to move against us 25th infantry division in battle of sangju on july 20 where division s us 24th infantry would be quickly pushed back by north korean advance in meantime kpa 3rd division engaged newly arrived us 1st cavalry at battle of yongdong on july 22 where that division would also perform poorly kpa 6th division moved further south where it would confront us 29th infantry regiment at hadong ambush on july 27 effectively destroying one of regiment s battalions us units were performing extremely poorly in their first engagements against north korean units as a combination of shortages of supplies and lack of experienced soldiers and officers plagued un forces at this stage of war battle 27th infantry advance as other north korean forces were closing on yongdong kpa 2nd division continued its advance down road from hwanggan to poun having arrived in taejon too late for fight there its orders were to pass through that town and come out on main seoul pusan highway at hwanggan about east of yongdong placing it in rear of 1st cavalry division and on its main supply road responding to threat eighth army ordered us 27th infantry regiment 25th infantry division to block advance after arriving in korea regiment went to area north of taegu on july 13 it moved from there to andong to support rok troops but before it entered action in fight in that city it suddenly received orders to move to sangju to assist 25th infantry division s other two regiments in that battle en route it received still other orders to change its destination to hwanggan and it closed there in an assembly area on night of july 22 23 27th infantry s mission at hwanggan was to relieve exhausted and decimated rok units retreating down poun road in meantime it lost large numbers of its experienced officers as they were shifted to us 24th infantry in carrying out eighth army s orders to block poun road regimental commander colonel john h michaelis a west point graduate known as an effective commander assigned 1st battalion 27th infantry to make contact with first north korean attacks on morning of july 23 lieutenant colonel gilbert j check moved 1st battalion northward toward poun from hwanggan assembly area he took up defensive positions in evening near village of ni south of poun battalion assumed responsibility for that sector at 17 00 after south korean troops fell back through its position however battalion was unable to ascertain from retreating soldiers kpa 2nd division s status or threat north korean attack in evening of july 23 1st battalion sent a 30 man patrol northward to locate north koreans near poun patrol spotted a kpa column approaching platoon took up superior positions and ambushed column as it passed with all its weapons north koreans halted their advance thinking they had encountered a major position and held back until daylight when they turned back us patrol returned to 1st battalion lines at 04 00 on july 24 it suffered six men missing to an unknown number of north korean casualties check s 1st battalion was not attacked until 06 30 on july 24 shortly after daybreak in a heavy fog that allowed north koreans to approach very close to us positions before they were observed two us infantry companies on either side of road on low ridges held forward positions kpa mortar fire fell on men there and then t 34 tanks appeared at bend in road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached kpa infantry followed tanks although two rifle companies stopped kpa infantry tanks penetrated their positions and fired into battalion command post which was behind b company this tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed medical officer a company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in process on right flank north of road north koreans overran battalion observation post and b company s outpost line this high ground changed hands three times during day while infantry fight was in progress and shortly after first tank penetration five more t 34s came around road bend toward us 71st tank battalion check had called for an air strike when first tanks appeared three f 80 shooting stars arrived and immediately dived on approaching group of tanks destroying three of them with 5 inch rockets altogether bazooka artillery and air strikes knocked out six north korean tanks during morning either within or on edge of 1st battalion position in its first engagement with american troops kpa 2nd division lost all but two of eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at chongju us withdrawal to hwanggan fight continued into evening and after dark 1st battalion disengaged and withdrew through 2nd battalion immediately behind it both check and regimental commander michaelis expected north koreans to encircle 1st battalion position during night if it stayed where it was north koreans were apparently unaware of 1st battalion withdrawal because next morning july 25 two north korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind positions 1st battalion held night before but in front of major gordon e murch s 2nd battalion there kpa were caught in open by combined fire of american tanks artillery and mortar and 2nd battalion s automatic and small arms fire kpa suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack surviving remnants of two kpa battalions withdrew in confusion 2nd battalion took about 30 prisoners kpa 2nd division pushed forward in spite of casualties and that afternoon elements of it were flanking 27th infantry s main position michaelis issued an order about 22 00 for another withdrawal to high ground near hwanggan withdrawal started near midnight with heavy fighting still in progress on right flank murch took control of all nine us tanks and put them on line facing north where they attacked north korean troops approaching on road mortar fire fell along battalion line and road behind it f company and nine tanks covered 2nd battalion withdrawal second defensive line on july 26 us 1st battalion 35th infantry regiment arrived on 27th infantry s right flank however next day regimental left flank came under attack where a large gap existed between c company westernmost unit of 27th infantry and us 7th cavalry regiment nearest unit of 1st cavalry division c company lost and regained a peak three times during day more than 40 casualties reduced its strength to approximately 60 men b company also lost heavily in action falling to a strength of about 85 men by morning of july 28 north koreans had penetrated 1st battalion s line forcing c company to withdraw in face of heavy kpa infantry attack at this point colonel michaelis went to 1st cavalry division command post in hwanggan and asked division commander major general hobart r gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division gay telephoned eighth army headquarters and asked if he should attack in an effort to relieve pressure on 27th infantry or if that regiment should withdraw into 1st cavalry division s area move south to kumch on and then turn toward sangju to rejoin 25th division eighth army decided 27th regiment should withdraw as gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position before dawn on july 29 27th infantry regiment withdrew through 1st cavalry division lines at hwanggan to a position about east of kumch on that afternoon michaelis received orders from eighth army to move to waegwan on naktong river near daegu as army reserve instead of joining 25th division in sangju area aftermath thumb alt a tank advances into a valley tanks of 27th infantry advance into bowling alley august 21 27th infantry regiment lost 53 men killed 221 wounded and 49 missing a total of 323 battle casualties during battles along hwanggan road however it was able to delay north korean division for five days in this effort kpa 2nd division suffered heavily during this time to us artillery and armor some estimates placing its losses above 3 000 men in battles along road us 1st cavalry division initially took 27th infantry s place on line but retreated without engaging kpa 2nd division after movement by kpa 3rd division threatened to take kumch on and block 1st cavalry s route of supply division was driven to naktong river by july 31 having taken 916 casualties at hwanggan and sangju in its first ten days on line tactically north koreans had been successful in pushing us forces south and capturing ground but american units had bought strategically valuable time to set up pusan perimeter battle set standard for 27th infantry which performed unusually well in fight in contrast other units of both 25th infantry and 1st cavalry divisions in their first engagements at yongdong and sangju performed very poorly prompting walker to order us forces to stop retreating and stand or die us 27th infantry was used as an emergency reserve during battle of pusan perimeter where it particularly distinguished itself at battle of bowling alley regiment s quality performance in hwanggan fight was crucial in decision to make it a fire brigade references citations sources category conflicts in
