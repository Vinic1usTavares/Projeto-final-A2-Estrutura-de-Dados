them but we re extremely private people and we re all still processing our grief in our own way and on our own time but we definitely are thinking of our fans and love them very much in september 2018 guitarist kim thayil told billboard that he and other surviving members of soundgarden were still unsure about future of band he was quoted as saying we often reference rock history and we ve often commented on what other bands in similar situations have done not as a plan or anything but just commenting on how bands have handled situations like this and what bands seem to have been graceful and dignified in how they manage their future musical endeavors and how some maybe were clumsy and callous we think about those things we try not to go too deep into these conversations but stuff comes up after a few beers a month later cameron told rolling stone that surviving members of soundgarden would certainly love to try to continue to do something figure out something to do together bassist ben shepherd added we haven t even gotten a chance to hang out just us three yet we re going through natural healing then thinking about natural next step in an october 2018 interview with seattle times thayil stated that soundgarden band name would be retired he explained i don t know really what kind of thing is possible or what we would consider in future it s likely nothing four of us were that there were four of us and now there s three of us so it s just not likely that there s much to be pursued other than catalog work at this point thayil also stated that while he does not rule out possibility of working with cameron and shepherd in a different capacity writing or touring under soundgarden banner again was unlikely no i don t think that s anything we d give reasonable consideration to at this point when i say at this point i mean perhaps ever in january 2019 remaining members of band reunited in a tribute concert and fundraiser in forum in inglewood california

working on with cornell however master files of cornell s vocal recordings are currently being withheld and when thayil sought permission to use these files he was denied musical style and influences soundgarden were pioneers of grunge music genre which mixed elements of punk rock and metal to make a sludgy murky sound through use of fuzzy sounding distortion in guitars soundgarden are quite good

soundgarden usually did not consider time signature of a song until after band wrote it and said use of odd meters was a total accident he also used meters as an example of band s anti commercial stance saying that if soundgarden were in business of hit singles we d at least write songs in 4 4 so you could dance to them legacy development of seattle independent record label sub pop is tied closely to soundgarden since sub pop co founder jonathan poneman funded soundgarden s early releases and band s success led to expansion of sub pop as a serious record label nirvana frontman kurt
