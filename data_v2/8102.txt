upper right corner as in final fantasy xii enemies are integrated into open field and can be approached or avoided by player when player s character touches an enemy screen transitions from regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous final fantasy titles a maximum of three characters may be used in battles which use a variant on series traditional active time battle atb system first featured in final fantasy iv under this system player selects an action from menus such as attack magic and item unlike previous games in series player only controls lead character while remaining two characters are controlled by game s artificial intelligence ai each action requires a specific number of slots on atb bar which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots atb bar gradually increases in size throughout game from two slots to six player may select less than maximum number of possible actions or may stop filling of atb bar and perform as many actions as can be done with current atb amount player may select an command which fills atb slots with actions chosen automatically actions cannot be performed outside of battle and characters health is fully restored after each battle each enemy has a meter called a chain counter consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when enemy is struck by attacks or spells attacks by different roles have different effects some raise chain by a larger amount while others give player longer before chain counter resets amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by chain percentage before it is applied to enemy when chain counter reaches a preset amount different for each enemy enemy is placed into stagger state in this mode enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into air paradigm system allows player to program six different roles which characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to specific conditions roles consist of commando a warrior type role ravager a black mage type role which uses damage dealing magic medic a white mage type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments saboteur which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses and sentinel which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin each of characters can initially take on only three roles but player has access to all of them later in game although other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them player can select which roles controlled character and ai characters are using both outside and during battle which is only way that player can control ai characters during battle player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that player has set up beforehand outside of battle each leader or controlled character can summon a specific eidolon into battle these summoned creatures include series staples odin shiva alexander and bahamut and newcomers and brynhildr when summoned eidolon stays in combat while characters accompanying summoner leave party while an eidolon is summoned player can trigger a feature called gestalt mode in which eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while summoning character rides them crystarium crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles sphere grid from final fantasy x each crystal in crystarium represents one of six paradigms and is divided into ten levels each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health strength or magic or provide new abilities and accessory slots these nodes are connected by a semi linear path player may advance down path by acquiring crystarium points which are awarded after defeating enemies full crystarium is not available to player at beginning of game at specific points in game s plot player gains access to new crystals or levels synopsis setting final fantasy xiii is set on world of gran pulse often simply called pulse central to story is cocoon a massive artificial sphere that floats above pulse s surface

final fantasy xiii began in february 2004 shortly after release of final fantasy x 2 international last mission in japan at time project was internally referred to by codename colors world over first year director motomu toriyama and scenario kazushige nojima conceived ideas for plot nojima thought up crystal mythology that became basis for fabula nova crystallis series including concepts such as fal cie and l cie toriyama then created a story premised on this mythology he wanted to portray characters at mercy of a predetermined unjust fate who belong together but collide heavily in order to achieve this each of story s thirteen chapters was made to focus on different protagonists chapters seven and eight were to mark a turning point in interpersonal relationships of party in march 2006 when structural part of narrative started to come together lead scenario writer daisuke watanabe joined team toriyama gave him a rough outline of first eight chapters which included several cornerstone scenes that needed to be kept like when party members were separated or reunited he told watanabe what he wanted to express with scenario and asked him to flesh out story and to strengthen how points in his outline connected for example toriyama s rudimentary instructions in document would say snow and hope reconcile watanabe had to decide about how scenes with this reconciliation would play out then write scenario that way to emphasize what story tried to express watanabe adjusted personalities toriyama had given to each character for example he felt that party should not have a reliable and calm leader type at beginning of story in order to more accurately show confusion and unease after protagonists transform into l cie toriyama has said that one of storytelling challenges was despair of characters and many points at which they are seemingly cornered he mentioned scene where sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example although toriyama felt it was almost a little too dark he wanted to include something like it in game in contrast he said that lighthearted elements such as sazh s chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance at beginning of development game was intended to be released on playstation 2 in may 2005 however after positive reception of tech demo of final fantasy vii team decided to move game to playstation 3 and developed it with new crystal tools engine a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by square enix for its next generation games square enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in project though it would initially cause a delay in game s development however delay was longer than originally anticipated as engine had to accommodate requirements of several other games in addition to xiii another factor in platform move was delayed release of final fantasy xii which came out a very short time before release of playstation 3 a pc port was considered during development but was decided against due to how square enix saw video game market situation at time as well as additional complexities that square enix did not have experience with related to pc platform such as security issues final fantasy xiii was first shown at 2006 e3 convention trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent final concept for game since at time there was no playable form of game announced alongside game was final fantasy versus xiii later retitled as final fantasy xv and playstation portable game final fantasy type 0 originally titled final fantasy agito xiii three of which form fabula nova crystallis final fantasy series square enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked they are not directly related in terms of story developers for final fantasy xiii were divided into multiple areas with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in game area or modeling characters each physical area of game was developed separately after an initial design was approved teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas several of game s developers had worked on previous installments of series director motomu toriyama had worked on final fantasy x and x 2 producer yoshinori kitase had worked on v through viii and as producer for x and x 2 main character designer tetsuya nomura had performed same role for vii viii x and x 2 and battle system director toshiro tsuchida reprised that role from final fantasy x as xiii was first final fantasy game for playstation 3 development team s internal goal was for game to have same gameplay and craftmanship impact that final fantasy vii and x had as first games of series on their respective consoles they aimed to sell five million copies of game toriyama wanted game to be ultimate single player rpg tsuchida s concept for battle system was to maintain strategic nature of command based battles system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in film final fantasy vii advent children magic points mp which had been a part of battle system in previous final fantasy titles were removed in game s battle system as tsuchida and other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to mp cost in turn making battles less interesting paradigm system was designed early in battle system s development with intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast moving originally there were only five roles but saboteur was later added as designers felt that its abilities were missing from game and did not fit with other roles together with maximum of three characters in a combat situation groupings of enemies were designed to force player to switch paradigms to keep them engaged in battles toriyama wanted lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete s body and a less feminine nature than some of previous female characters of series his guideline to nomura was to make her strong and beautiful and she was intended to be reminiscent of final fantasy viis cloud strife fang was initially meant to be a male character but gender was changed to coincide with updated character designs during latter part of development graphics capabilities of ps3 and xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed nomura to use more complex elements in character designs than before such as lightning s cape and detailed facial features this in turn meant that art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games nomura did not take an involved role in creation of non playable characters unlike previous games in series which were more inspired by asian locations and culture final fantasy xiii was intended by art team to be reminiscent of united states pulse was based on landscape photographs team took from across country and cocoon was intended to be a melting pot of different ethnicities setting was also given a science fiction aesthetic to make it stand out more in comparison with other entries in series art director isamu kamikokuryo revealed that many additional scenarios such as lightning s home which were functioning in an unreleased build during development were left out of final version due to concerns about game s length and volume kamikokuryo said content they cut was in itself enough to make another game according to toriyama cuts were made in various stages of game s development and that some of content was removed just before game s completion game unlike previous titles in series includes no explorable town areas toriyama said in an interview that team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as rest of game and chose to eliminate them toriyama intended to have a piece of downloadable content available for game that would include a new area weapons and quests but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in project and difficulties with different systems for extra content on two gaming consoles a playable demo of final fantasy xiii was included in japanese version of final fantasy vii advent children complete released on april 16 2009 toriyama stated that release of demo which was not in original development schedule helped team recognize a shared vision for what game should look and feel like a problem which had been plaguing development team up until then it helped team prioritize work that still needed to be done which increased development speed for remainder of project game was intended to appeal to both western and japanese audiences and focus groups from both regions were used english localization began while development was still in progress to lessen delay between japanese and worldwide releases game was initially going to be released solely for playstation 3 but an xbox 360 version was announced late in game s development cycle xbox version due to technical limitations runs at a lower resolution 720p maximum than playstation version and is spread across 3 discs music masashi hamauzu composed game s soundtrack his previous work on series was as a co composer for final fantasy x and as main composer for dirge of cerberus final fantasy vii game was first main series final fantasy game to not

japanese gaming magazine famitsu dengeki praised game for battle system stating that battles are by far most exciting in series and concluded final fantasy xiii deserved a score of 120 as 100 would

nomination at spike video game awards but lost to mass effect 2 it won future division award at japan game awards 2009 and later won a game designers award at japan game awards 2010 universal praise was given to technical milestones achieved by game s graphics and presentation edge felt that cocoon in particular was an inspired setting blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open mouthed gamespot called art design magnificent further praise was given to pre rendered animation sequences and almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and realtime gameplay many also appreciated game s soundtrack with masashi hamauzu providing a score with catchy hooks and blood pumping battle melodies according to wired battle system of final fantasy xiii received widespread praise increased pace of battles was appreciated with several reviews describing it as thrilling edges description of battle system summarized it as among genre s finest 1up com said that despite fact that two thirds of your party is ai controlled ffxiii s battles may be most involving series has ever seen story got a mixed reception with wired remarking that plot was a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games 1up com felt that story was hardly world class writing but that writers clearly knew medium well and had attempted to avoid cliches reviewers felt that characters worked well together and that interactions among them as game progressed made up for shortcomings in story linearity while critics generally praised square enix s attempt to revitalize final fantasy series formula many reacted negatively to linear nature of game especially in first ten chapters on cocoon an issue which many felt was compounded by large reduction of towns free roaming capabilities and interaction with non player characters gamepro described gameplay as a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini map that triggers a cutscene a boss fight or both and 1up com criticized linear aspect as game s biggest shortcoming and felt first section was superficial edge and others awarded game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects with edge in particular lowering score they awarded game to a five out of ten primarily due to game s linear nature in contrast reviewers from gamesradar and computer and video games appreciated linear nature former stated that streamlined focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down while latter felt it was a clever move and kept player from being bogged down with mundane number crunching and finicky and repetitive leveling up many negatively noted gradual unfurling of player s abilities over this first part of game from battle gameplay to selecting party leader combined with game s linear nature some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as boring until world of gran pulse was revealed edge noted that while it did not do enough to make up for opening chapters at gran pulse game hits a sweet spot as narrative offers hunting side quests and simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around next corner response to criticism after release director motomu toriyama felt that lower than expected review scores for a main final fantasy series game came from reviewers who approached game from a western point of view these reviewers were used to games in which player was given an open world to explore he said noting that this expectation contrasted with vision team set out to create he noted that it becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you re given that much freedom yoshinori kitase stated that they didn t really intend to work within rpg template but wanted to create a new game even a new genre he stated that in a lot of senses ffxiii is more like an fps than an rpg toriyama and kitase later said in july 2011 that biggest complaints about game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between player and world which they described as a lack of towns and minigames compared to previous final fantasy games they also named amount of time it took to access all of gameplay elements as a common criticism saying that people interpreted it as a lengthy tutorial yoichi wada then president of square enix made his thoughts about reception of game known to gamasutra he said some value it highly and some are not very happy with it he added should final fantasy become a new type of game or should final fantasy not become a new type of game customers have different opinions it s very difficult to determine which way it should go windows port square enix released a microsoft windows port of game in october 2014 where it was met with a more critical reception than original versions pc gamers samuel roberts when reviewing port criticized not only original gameplay but heavily criticized quality of port itself decrying low resolution limited graphical options and low framerate he was especially critical of time taken for port given that an unofficial patch was produced by modder peter thoman within a day of release that fixed many of issues michael mcwhertor of polygon also noted a similar critical response by consumers a patch was released by square enix in december 2014 which was noted by thoman as adding only graphical features that his external patch had with no other additions or performance improvements sequels at square enix first production department conference held on january 18 2011 square enix announced that they were developing a direct sequel to final fantasy xiii entitled final fantasy xiii 2 which they intended to build on game s story and characters while taking on board criticism and other feedback about
