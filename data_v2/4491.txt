church of holy mother of god crkva svete tsarkva sveta is a medieval eastern orthodox church in village of donja kamenica in knjazevac municipality zajecar district eastern serbia church is generally considered to have been built in 14th century when this area was part of second bulgarian empire s vidin appanage though alternative datings have been proposed while small church of holy mother of god is notable for its unusual architectural style in particular for its high narthex flanked by two sharp pointed towers these features which hint at hungarian or transylvanian influences are highly atypical for medieval bulgarian church architecture church is richly decorated on inside with as many as eleven frescoes of historical figures one of these portraits captioned as a despot is variously identified as an eponymous son of bulgarian tsar michael shishman or as an undocumented son of co tsar michael asen iv earlier speculation that image depicted serbian noble mihailo andelovic or michael shishman himself have since fallen out of favor with art historians in addition to these early portraits interior walls of church were painted with canonical murals which can stylistically be assigned to 14th 15th century church was reconstructed in 1958 and has been under serbian state protection since 1982 history and architecture church of holy mother of god lies in eastern serbian village of donja kamenica some southeast of knjazevac northeast of nis and not far from bulgarian border nikolova p p 1 church is located at square in centre of village by left bank of timok p 146 and along an old military road from pirot to vidin frfulanovic church acquired its name due to its abundance of frescoes featuring mary mother of jesus popovitsh p 54 prevalent opinion is that church was constructed and painted in early 14th century which coincides with lifetimes of individuals most widely accepted as represented by figures depicted in church s frescoes kulture u at time village of donja kamenica along with much of timocka krajina region belonged to vidin appanage of second bulgarian empire however alternative theories place construction of church in mid 14th century mid 15th century or even 16th century church and its frescoes were restored in 1958 church was declared a monument of culture of great importance in 1982 and it is protected by republic of serbia thumb left backside in terms of architecture church features a round dome and a single apse naos or cella has shape of a cross in line with popular byzantine cross in square design bozhilov p p 2 of particular interest is formerly two storey narthex which is notable for its unusual verticality and towers on either side of entrance judging by models depicted in donor s portraits inside church it is clear that towers were originally further apart and west facade with narthex included much woodwork popovitsh p 55 towers are topped off by sharp pointed pyramidal elements with additional sharp pointed details in each of pyramids four corners towers and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval bulgarian church architecture art historian nikola mavrodinov believes these resemble gothic architecture though a more modern researcher bistra nikolova dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from hungary or transylvania despite its monumental appearance church is rather small in size it measures according to nikolova or per mavrodinova mavrodinova p 6 materials employed in church s construction were chiefly chiseled stones welded together using mortar masonry several rows of bricks were added in order to even out structure and to serve as decoration particularly in dome which features more elaborate brickwork decoration frescoes inside church are commonly dated to 14th 15th century though they follow a standard compositional model which had been established in bulgarian church decoration since 13th century unusually most of captions which accompany images are in byzantine greek though a few are in old church slavonic in terms of style murals have much in common with churches from southwestern bulgarian lands nikolova p 117 biblical scenes and figures depicted in church of holy mother of god include worshiping of christ child as eucharistic victim in lower part of apse raising of lazarus annunciation jesus triumphal entry into jerusalem judas iscariot s betrayal of jesus passion of christ in upper part of cella descent from cross mourning of jesus and dormition of theotokos on west wall north and south walls of cella as well as wall piers bear frescoes of saints including rare images of military saints on horseback murals of saint petka and saint nicholas were painted in upper reaches of narthex in south and north tower respectively besides religious imagery frescoes of donja kamenica church also include eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures separated into four compositions three of compositions are uncaptioned making identification of people practically impossible first composition is located in cella and depicts two men preserved from waist up of which one holds a model of church and a child of which only head is visible today second composition was painted on upper west wall of narthex and portrays a man a woman a boy and a girl with man also holding a model of church a common symbol of art historian frfulanovic believes that images of men holding models in both compositions depict same person main donor third composition is in cella and depicts two men a monk and a priest despot and despotissa s portraits of greatest interest is fourth composition of historical figures a young man and a woman which was painted on lowest west wall of narthex and includes inscriptions in old church slavonic figures are painted facing viewer man s red clothing is covered in pearls and double headed eagles and he wears an archaic looking despot s crown on his head in his right hand man holds a sceptre with a cross he extends his hand to a woman clad in a despotissa s attire and wearing a fitting crown thumb fourth fresco composition inscription next to figure of man has been deciphered either as michael despot in christ our god faithful or michael despot in christ our god faithful son of tsar michael either reading presents significant challenges as to proper identification of portrayed person who was clearly a despot bore name michael and if latter reading is correct was son of an eponymous tsar as a result various theories have been proposed by bulgarian and serbian researchers alike early bulgarian historian petar suggested that despot michael of donja kamenica church is identical with bulgarian tsar michael shishman r 1323 1330 who before his accession to throne was despot of vidin however michael shishman s father was named shishman not michael and was usually titled despot rather than tsar in turn mavrodinov proposed theory that despot michael is an otherwise unknown son of michael shishman who was installed as despot of vidin by his father after his coronation in 1323 in any case this unknown son of michael shishman was probably dead by 1331 because belaur is mentioned as ruler of vidin shortly thereafter latter theory is most established identification of despot michael in bulgarian historiography bozhilov pp 145 146andreev p 269 a third theory supported by both serbian and bulgarian researchers is that despot michael is an unknown son of michael asen iv first born son of bulgarian tsar ivan alexander r 1331 1371 who was proclaimed co tsar shortly after his father s accession and died in a battle against ottomans before 1354 1355 against this identification is account of nikephoros gregoras who mentions that michael asen s widow returned childless to constantinople after his death another issue with this theory is that no source mentions michael asen as a despot andreev pp 273 274 another theory which was put forward by early serbian historians and has subsequently lost support in serbian scholarship is that despot michael is to be identified with mid 15th century serbian noble mihailo andelovic a brother of ottoman statesman mahmud pasha however in depth research of frescoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to 1450s as artistic style clothing and hairstyles in portraits are uncommon for this period furthermore church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of morava school which dominated 15th century serbian architecture it has also been revealed that in 1454 1455 donja kamenica was controlled by ottomans and in possession of a certain yusuf rather than part of serbian despotate and mihailo andelovic was never titled despot identity of woman has also been a matter of debate inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title despotissa as well as word daughter based on a possible reading of her name as anna she has been identified as anna neda serbian wife of michael shishman which is in line with first identification of despot nikolova believes that it is possible that woman is anna neda even if despot is her son rather than her husband she theorises that anna neda settled in vidin after michael shishman s second marriage and owned a personal domain which included donja kamenica nikolova pp 116 117 another reading of inscription name of despotissa as elena see also monuments of culture of great importance tourism in serbia further reading notes references external links photo gallery of church of holy mother of god category 14th
