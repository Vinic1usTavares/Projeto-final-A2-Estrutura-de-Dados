tyrannosauroidea meaning tyrant lizard forms is a superfamily or clade of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs that includes family tyrannosauridae as well as more basal relatives tyrannosauroids lived on laurasian supercontinent beginning in jurassic period by end of cretaceous period tyrannosauroids were dominant large predators in northern hemisphere culminating in gigantic tyrannosaurus fossils of tyrannosauroids have been recovered on what are now continents of north america europe asia south america and australia tyrannosauroids were bipedal carnivores as were most theropods and were characterized by numerous skeletal features especially of skull and pelvis early in their existence tyrannosauroids were small predators with long three fingered forelimbs late cretaceous genera became much larger including some of largest land based predators ever to exist but most of these later genera had proportionately small forelimbs with only two digits primitive feathers have been identified in fossils of two species and may have been present in other tyrannosauroids as well prominent bony crests in a variety of shapes and sizes on skulls of many tyrannosauroids may have served display functions description thumb left size of some small genera compared to a human tyrannosauroids varied widely in size although there was a general trend towards increasing size over time early tyrannosauroids were small animals one specimen of dilong almost fully grown measured 1 6 meters 5 3 ft in length and a fully grown guanlong measured 3 meters 10 ft long teeth from lower lower cretaceous rocks 140 to 136 million years old of hyogo japan appear to have come from an approximately long animal possibly indicating an early size increase in lineage an immature eotyrannus was over 4 meters 13 ft in length and a subadult appalachiosaurus was estimated at more than 6 meters 20 ft long indicating that both genera reached larger sizes late cretaceous tyrannosaurids ranged from 9 meter 30 ft albertosaurus and gorgosaurus to tyrannosaurus which exceeded 12 meters 39 ft in length and may have weighed more than 6400 kilograms 7 short tons a 2010 review of literature concluded that tyrannosaurs were small to mid sized for their first 80 million years but were some of largest terrestrial carnivores to ever live in their last 20 million years thumb left skull and neck of daspletosaurus from field museum of natural history in chicago skulls of early tyrannosauroids were long low and lightly constructed similar to other coelurosaurs while later forms had taller and more massive skulls despite differences in form certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids premaxillary bone is very tall blunting front of snout a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids nasal bones are characteristically fused together arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their upper surface premaxillary teeth at front of upper jaw are shaped differently from rest of teeth smaller in size and with a d shaped cross section in lower jaw a prominent ridge on surangular bone extends sideways from just below jaw joint except in basal guanlong tyrannosauroids had s shaped necks and long tails as did most other theropods early genera had long forelimbs about 60 length of hindlimb in guanlong with typical three digits of coelurosaurs long forelimb persisted at least through early cretaceous eotyrannus but is unknown in appalachiosaurus derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs strongly reduced in size most extreme example being tarbosaurus from mongolia where humerus was only one quarter length of femur third digit of forelimb was also reduced over time this digit was unreduced in basal guanlong while in dilong it was more slender than other two digits eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand tyrannosaurids had only two although vestigial metacarpal of third are preserved in some well preserved specimens abstract only as in most coelurosaurs second digit of hand is largest even when third digit is not present characteristic features of tyrannosauroid pelvis include a concave notch at upper front end of ilium a sharply defined vertical ridge on outside surface of ilium extending upwards from acetabulum hip socket and a huge boot on end of pubis more than half as long as shaft of pubis itself these features are found in all known tyrannosauroids including basal members guanlong and dilong pubis is not known in aviatyrannis or stokesosaurus but both show typical tyrannosauroid characters in ilium hindlimbs of all tyrannosauroids like most theropods had four toes although first toe hallux did not contact ground tyrannosauroid hindlimbs are longer relative to body size than almost any other theropods and show proportions characteristic of fast running animals including elongated tibiae and metatarsals these proportions persist even in largest adult tyrannosaurus despite its probable inability to run third metatarsal of tyrannosaurids was pinched at top between second and fourth forming a structure known as arctometatarsus arctometatarsus was also present in appalachiosaurus but it is unclear whether it was found in eotyrannus or dryptosaurus this structure was shared by derived ornithomimids troodontids and caenagnathids but was not present in basal tyrannosauroids like dilong indicating convergent evolution classification tyrannosaurus was named by henry fairfield osborn in 1905 along with family tyrannosauridae name is derived from ancient greek words turannos tyrannos tyrant and sauros sauros lizard superfamily name tyrannosauroidea was first published in a 1964 paper by british paleontologist alick walker suffix commonly used in name of animal superfamilies is derived from greek eidos eidos form thumb skull of proceratosaurus a proceratosaurid from middle jurassic of england thumb 180x180px skeleton of appalachiosaurus a non tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroid from late cretaceous of eastern north america scientists have commonly understood tyrannosauroidea to include tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors with advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology however clade has received several more explicit definitions first was by paul sereno in 1998 where tyrannosauroidea was defined as a stem based taxon including all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with tyrannosaurus rex than with birds to make family more exclusive thomas holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species more closely related to tyrannosaurus rex than to ornithomimus velox deinonychus antirrhopus or allosaurus fragilis sereno published a new definition in 2005 using ornithomimus edmontonicus velociraptor mongoliensis and troodon formosus as external specifiers sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review some studies have suggested that clade usually considered to be allosauroids are basal tyrannosauroids however other authors disputed placement of within tyrannosauroidea and a study of hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to at least partly reject their prior conclusion phylogeny while paleontologists have long recognized family tyrannosauridae its ancestry has been subject of much debate for most of twentieth century tyrannosaurids were commonly accepted as members of carnosauria which included almost all large theropods within this group were often considered to be ancestral to tyrannosaurids in early 1990s cladistic analyses instead began to place tyrannosaurids into coelurosauria echoing suggestions first published in 1920s tyrannosaurids are now universally considered to be large coelurosaurs in 1994 holtz grouped tyrannosauroids with ornithomimosaurs and troodonts into a coelurosaurian clade called arctometatarsalia based on a common ankle structure where second and fourth metatarsals meet near tarsal bones covering third metatarsal when viewed from front basal tyrannosauroids like dilong however were found with non arctometatarsalian ankles indicating that this feature evolved convergently arctometatarsalia has been dismantled and is no longer used by most paleontologists with tyrannosauroids usually considered to be basal coelurosaurs outside maniraptoriformes one recent analysis found family coeluridae including late jurassic north american genera coelurus and tanycolagreus to be sister group of tyrannosauroidea most basal tyrannosauroid known from complete skeletal remains is guanlong a representative of family other early taxa include stokesosaurus and aviatyrannis known from far less complete material better known dilong is considered slightly more derived than guanlong and stokesosaurus dryptosaurus long a difficult genus to classify has turned up in several recent analyses as a basal tyrannosauroid as well slightly more distantly related to tyrannosauridae than eotyrannus and appalachiosaurus alectrosaurus a poorly known genus from mongolia is definitely a tyrannosauroid but its exact relationships are unclear other taxa have been considered possible tyrannosauroids by various authors including bagaraatan and siamotyrannus from early cretaceous of thailand was originally described as an early tyrannosaurid but is usually considered a carnosaur today has a vertical ridge on ilium reminiscent of tyrannosauroids and may in fact be earliest known member of superfamily but not enough material is known to be sure below is a cladogram by loewen et al in 2013 that included most tyrannosauroid species known at time of its publication phylogeography in 2018 authors rafael and orlando nelson grillo published a phylogenetic analysis of tyrannosauroidea which incorporated taxa from ancient continent of gondwana which is today consist of southern hemisphere such as santanaraptor and timimus whose placement in group has been controversial they have found that not only santanaraptor and timimus were placed as tyrannosaurs more derived than dilong but they have found in their analysis that tyrannosauroids were widespread in laurasia and gondwana since middle jurassic they have proposed new subclade names for first is referring to all non proceratosaurid members of group while for larger tyrannosaur taxa found in northern hemisphere such as dryptosaurus appalachiosaurus bistahieversor and tyrannosauridae below is their phylogeographic tree they have recovered in which displays phylogenetic relationships of taxa as well as continents those taxa have been found distribution tyrannosauroids lived on supercontinent laurasia which split from gondwana in middle jurassic as well as on northern continents which separated from laurasia later in mesozoic era earliest recognized tyrannosauroids lived in middle late jurassic including guanlong and from far east stokesosaurus from western united states and aviatyrannis and proceratosaurus from europe thumb right 450px confirmed tyrannosauroid fossils have only been discovered in northern continents with possible basal tyrannosauroid fossils reported from australia late cretaceous tyrannosauroids are known only from north america and asia early cretaceous tyrannosauroids are known from laurasia being represented by eotyrannus from england and dilong and yutyrannus from northeastern china early cretaceous tyrannosauroid premaxillary teeth are known from cedar mountain formation in utah and group of japan middle cretaceous record of tyrannosauroidea is rather patchy teeth and indeterminate of this interval are known from cenomanian age dakota formation of western north america and potomac formation of new jersey as well as formations in kazakhstan and tajikistan two genera and have been found in asia while brazilian santanaraptor may belong to this group has been found in moreno hill formation of zuni basin of western new mexico first unquestionable remains of tyrannosaurids occur in campanian stage of late cretaceous in north america and asia two subfamilies are recognized albertosaurines are only known from north america while tyrannosaurines are found on both continents tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in alaska which may have served as a land bridge allowing dispersal between two continents non tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroids like alectrosaurus and possibly bagaraatan were contemporaneous with tyrannosaurids in asia while they are absent from western north america eastern north america was divided by western interior seaway in middle of cretaceous and isolated from western portion of continent absence of tyrannosaurids from eastern part of continent suggests that family evolved after appearance of seaway allowing basal tyrannosauroids like dryptosaurus and appalachiosaurus to survive in east as a relict population until end of cretaceous basal tyrannosauroids may have also been present in what is now southeastern australia during aptian of early cretaceous nmv a partial pubis a hip bone with a distinctive tyrannosauroid like form was discovered in dinosaur cove in victoria indicating that tyrannosauroids were not limited to northern continents as previously thought paleobiology feathers long filamentous structures have been preserved along with skeletal remains of numerous coelurosaurs from early cretaceous yixian formation and other nearby geological formations from liaoning china these filaments have usually been interpreted as protofeathers homologous with branched feathers found in birds and some non avian theropods although other hypotheses have been proposed a skeleton of dilong was described in 2004 that included first example of feathers in a tyrannosauroid similarly to down feathers of modern birds feathers found in dilong were branched but not pennaceous and may have been used for insulation even large tyrannosauroids have been found with evidence of feathers yutyrannus also from yixian formation is known from three specimens each preserving traces of feathers on various parts of body while not all areas of body preserve impressions across all three specimens these fossils demonstrate that even in this medium sized species most of body was covered in feathers presence of feathers in basal tyrannosauroids is not surprising since they are now known to be characteristic of coelurosaurs found in other basal genera like as well as all more derived groups rare fossilized skin impressions of some late cretaceous tyrannosaurids lack feathers however instead showing skin covered in fine non overlapping scales it is possible that feathers were present on other areas of body preserved skin impressions are very small and come primarily from legs pelvic region and underside of tail which either lack feathers or only covered in a light down in some modern larger ground dwelling birds alternatively secondary loss of feathers in large tyrannosaurids may be analogous with similar loss of hair in largest modern mammals like elephants where a low surface area to volume ratio slows down heat transfer making insulation by a coat of hair unnecessary or even detrimental a precedent can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians in which filamentous structures were lost and scales reappeared head crests thumb right elaborate head crest of guanlong a basal tyrannosauroid from china bony crests are found on skulls of many theropods including numerous tyrannosauroids most elaborate is found in guanlong where nasal bones support a single large crest which runs along midline of skull from front to back this crest was penetrated by several large foramina openings which reduced its weight a less prominent crest is found in dilong where low parallel ridges run along each side of skull supported by nasal and lacrimal bones these ridges curve inwards and meet just behind nostrils making crest y shaped fused nasals of tyrannosaurids are often very rough textured alioramus a possible tyrannosaurid from mongolia bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on nasal bones a similar row of much lower bumps is present on skull of appalachiosaurus as well as some specimens of daspletosaurus albertosaurus and tarbosaurus in albertosaurus gorgosaurus and daspletosaurus there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on lacrimal bone lacrimal horn is absent in tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus which instead have a crescent shaped crest behind each eye on postorbital bone these head crests may have been used for display perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior an example of handicap principle may be case of guanlong where large delicate crest may have been a hindrance to hunting in what was presumably an active predator if an individual was healthy and successful at hunting despite fragile crest it would indicate superior quality of individual over others with smaller crests similarly to unwieldy tail of a male peacock or outsized antlers of an irish elk crest of guanlong may have evolved via sexual selection providing an advantage in courtship that outweighed any decrease in hunting
