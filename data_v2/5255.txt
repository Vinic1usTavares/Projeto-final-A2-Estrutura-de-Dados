chronicling history of anglo saxons original manuscript of chronicle was created late in 9th century probably in wessex during reign of alfred great r 871 899 multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across england where they were independently updated in one case chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154 nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is original version oldest seems to have been started towards end of alfred s reign while most recent was written at peterborough abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116 almost all of material in chronicle is in form of annals by year earliest are dated at 60 bc annals date for caesar s invasions of britain and historical material follows up to year in which chronicle was written at which point contemporary records begin these manuscripts collectively are known as anglo saxon chronicle chronicle is not unbiased there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one sided versions of stories there are also places where different versions contradict each other taken as a whole however chronicle is single most important historical source for period in england between departure of romans and decades following norman conquest much of information given in chronicle is not recorded elsewhere in addition manuscripts are important sources for history of english language in particular later peterborough text is one of earliest examples of middle english in existence seven of nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in british library remaining two are in bodleian library at oxford and parker library of corpus christi

date of composition but it is generally thought that chronicles were composed during reign of alfred great 871 99 as alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign and encouraged use of english as a written language chronicle as well as distribution of copies to other centres of learning may be a consequence of changes alfred introduced hunter blair roman britain p

unknown author wrote a latin chronicle known as annals of st neots this work includes material from a copy of chronicle but it is very difficult to tell which version because annalist was selective about his use of material it may have been a northern recension or a latin derivative of that recension swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp xix xx all manuscripts described above share a chronological error between years 756 and 845 but it is apparent that composer of annals of st neots was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have preceded them aethelweard s copy did have chronological error but it had not lost a whole sentence from annal 885 all surviving manuscripts have lost this sentence hence error and missing sentence must have been introduced in separate copying

to have been worked on at intervals text includes material from bede s ecclesiastical history and from a set of 8th century northumbrian annals it is thought that some of entries may have been

from 972 to 1016 sees of york and worcester were both held by same person oswald from 972 ealdwulf from 992 and wulfstan from 1003 and this may explain why a northern recension was to be found at

seems likely that this was taken by scribe from existing saga material greenfield a new critical history p 60 early entries up to year 110 probably came from one of small encyclopedic volumes of world history in circulation at time chronicle was first written chronological summary to bede s ecclesiastical history was used as a source chronicle gives dates and genealogies for northumbrian and mercian kings and provides a list of wessex bishops these are likely to have had separate sources entry for 661 records a battle fought by that is said to have been fought at easter this precision implies a contemporary record which survived and was re used by chronicle scribe swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp xviii xix contemporary annals began to be kept in wessex during 7th century yorke kings and kingdoms p 128 material compiled in alfred s reign included annals relating to kentish south saxon mercian and particularly west saxon history but with exception of cynewulf entry does not gather momentum until it comes to nordic invasions of late 8th century onwards lapidge encyclopedia of anglo saxon england p 35 chronicle grew out of tradition of easter tables drawn up to help clergy determine dates of feasts in future years a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another as chronicle developed it lost its list like appearance and such notes took up more space becoming more like historical records many later entries especially those written by contemporaries contained a great deal of historical narrative under year headings crystal cambridge encyclopedia 15 as with any historical source chronicle has to be treated with some caution for example between 514 and 544 chronicle makes reference to wihtgar who is supposedly buried on isle of wight at wihtgar s stronghold which is in original and purportedly gave his name to island however name of isle of wight derives from latin not from wihtgar actual name of fortress was probably stronghold of inhabitants of wight and either chronicler or an earlier source misinterpreted this as referring to wihtgar ekwall dictionary of english place names swanton anglo saxon chronicle p 16 dating of events recorded also requires care in addition to dates that are simply inaccurate scribes occasionally made mistakes that caused further errors for example in d manuscript scribe omits year 1044 from list on left hand side annals copied down are therefore incorrect from 1045 to 1052 which has two entries a more difficult problem is question of date at which a new year began since modern custom of starting year on 1 january was not universal at that time entry for 1091 in e begins at christmas and continues throughout year it is clear that this entry follows old custom of starting year at christmas some other entries appear to begin year on 25 march such as year 1044 in c manuscript which ends with edward confessor s marriage on 23 january while entry for 22 april is recorded under 1045 there are also years which appear to start in september swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp xiv xvi manuscripts were produced in different places and each manuscript reflects biases of its scribes it has been argued that chronicle should be regarded as propaganda produced by alfred s court and written with intent of glorifying alfred and creating loyalty campbell anglo saxon state p 144 this is not universally accepted but origins of manuscripts clearly colour both description of interactions between wessex and other kingdoms and descriptions of vikings depredations an example can be seen in entry for 829 which describes egbert s invasion of northumbria according to chronicle after egbert conquered mercia and essex he became a bretwalda implying overlordship of all of england then when he marched into northumbria northumbrians offered him submission and peace northumbrian chronicles incorporated into roger of wendover s 13th century history give a different picture when egbert had obtained all southern kingdoms he led a large army into northumbria and laid waste that province with severe pillaging and made king eanred pay tribute swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp 60 61 p wormald ninth century p 139 in campbell et al anglo saxons occasionally scribes biases can be seen by comparing different versions of manuscript they created for example aelfgar earl of east anglia and son of leofric earl of mercia was exiled briefly in 1055 c d and e manuscripts say following translations from swanton anglo saxon chronicle pp 184 18 campbell et al anglo saxons p 222 c earl aelfgar son of earl leofric was outlawed without any fault d earl aelfgar son of earl leofric was outlawed well nigh without fault e earl aelfgar was outlawed because it was thrown at him that he was traitor to king and all people of land and he admitted this before all men who were gathered there although words shot out against his will another example that mentions aelfgar shows a different kind of unreliability in chronicle that of omission aelfgar was earl of mercia by 1058 and in that year was exiled again this time only d has anything to say here earl aelfgar was expelled but he soon came back again with violence through help of gruffydd and here came a raiding ship army from norway it is tedious to tell how it all happened in this case other sources exist to clarify picture a major norwegian attempt was made on england but e says nothing at all and d scarcely mentions it it has sometimes been argued that when chronicle is silent other sources that report major events must be mistaken but this example demonstrates that chronicle does omit important events use by latin and anglo norman historians three main anglo norman historians john of worcester william of malmesbury and henry of huntingdon each had a copy of chronicle which they adapted for their own purposes lapidge encyclopedia of anglo saxon england p 36 symeon of durham also had a copy of chronicle some later medieval historians also used chronicle and others took their material from those who had used it and so chronicle became central to mainstream of english historical tradition henry of huntingdon used a copy of chronicle that was very similar to e there is no evidence in his work of any of entries in e after 1121 so although his manuscript may actually have been e it may also have been a copy either one taken of e prior to entries he makes no use of or a manuscript from which e was copied with copying taking place prior to date of last annal he uses henry also made use of c manuscript waverley annals made use of a manuscript that was similar to e though it appears that it did not contain entries focused on peterborough manuscript of chronicle translated by geoffrey gaimar cannot be identified accurately though according to historian dorothy whitelock it was a rather better text than e or f gaimar implies that there was a copy at winchester in his day middle of 12th century whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to present day was at winchester in mid tenth century if it survived to gaimar s time that would explain why a was not kept up to date and why a could be given to monastery at canterbury john of worcester s chronicon ex chronicis appears to have had a manuscript that was either a or similar to it he makes use of annals that do not appear in other versions such as entries concerning edward elder s campaigns and information about winchester towards end of chronicle his account is often similar to that of d though there is less attention paid to margaret of scotland an identifying characteristic of d he had mercian register which appears only in c and d and he includes material from annals 979 982 which only appears in c it is possible he had a manuscript that was an ancestor of d he also had sources which have not been identified and some of his statements have no earlier surviving source a manuscript similar to e was available to william of malmesbury though it is unlikely to have been e as that manuscript is known to have still been in peterborough after time william was working and he does not make use of any of entries in e that are specifically related to peterborough it is likely he had either original from which e was copied or a copy of that original he mentions that chronicles do not give any information on murder of alfred aetheling but since this is covered in both c and d it is apparent he had no access to those manuscripts on occasion he appears to show some knowledge of d but it is possible that his information was taken from john of worcester s account he also omits any reference to a battle fought by cenwealh in 652 this battle is mentioned in a b and c but not in e he does mention a battle fought by cenwealh at which is not in any of extant manuscripts so it is possible he had a copy now lost importance anglo saxon chronicle is single most important source for history of england in anglo saxon times without chronicle and bede s historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum ecclesiastical history of english people it would be impossible to write history of english from romans to norman conquest hunter blair an introduction p 355 nicholas howe called them two great anglo saxon works of history it is clear that records and annals of some kind began to be kept in england at time of earliest spread of christianity but no such records survive in their original form instead they were incorporated in later works and it is thought likely that chronicle contains many of these history it tells is not only that witnessed by its compilers but also that recorded by earlier annalists whose work is in many cases preserved nowhere else hunter blair roman britain p 11 its importance is not limited to historical information it provides however it is just as important a source for early development of english peterborough chronicle changes from standard old english literary language to early middle english after 1131 providing some of earliest middle english text known howe notes in rome capitol of anglo saxon england that many of entries indicate that rome was considered a spiritual home for anglo saxons rome and roman history being of paramount importance in many of entries he cites one for ad 1 for instance which lists reign of octavian augustus before it mentions birth of christ chronicle is not without literary interest inserted at various points since 10th century are old english poems in celebration of royal figures and their achievements battle of brunanburh 937 on king aethelstan s victory over combined forces of vikings scots and strathclyde britons and five shorter poems capture of five boroughs 942 coronation of king edgar 973 death of king edgar 975 death of prince alfred 1036 and death of king edward confessor 1065 history of editions and availability an important early printed edition of chronicle appeared in 1692 by edmund gibson an english jurist and divine who later 1716 became bishop of lincoln titled chronicon saxonicum it printed old english text in parallel columns with gibson s own latin version and became standard edition until 19th century gibson used three manuscripts of which chief was peterborough chronicle title in full is chronicon saxonicum seu annales rerum in anglia praecipue gestarum a christo nato ad annum usque ac jam donati cum rerum accedunt ad nominum locorum origines et nominum locorum ac virorum in a detailed description of a first edition is listed at it was superseded in 1861 by benjamin thorpe s rolls edition which printed six versions in columns labelled a to f thus giving manuscripts letters which are now used to refer to them john earle wrote two of saxon chronicles parallel 1865 charles plummer edited this book producing a revised text with notes appendices and glossary in two volumes in 1892 and 1899 whitelock english historical documents p 129 this edition of a and e texts with material from other versions was widely used it was reprinted in 1952 editions of individual manuscripts beginning in 1980s a new set of scholarly editions have been printed under series title anglo saxon chronicle a collaborative edition some volumes are still projected such as a volume focusing on northern recension but existing volumes such as janet s edition of a are now standard references a recent translation of chronicle is michael swanton s anglo
