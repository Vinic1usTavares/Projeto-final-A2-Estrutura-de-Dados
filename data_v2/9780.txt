day of thirst yawm al is name traditionally given in arabic historiography to a battle fought in 724 between turkic turgesh khaganate and umayyad caliphate on banks of river jaxartes in transoxiana in modern tajikistan central asia umayyad army under muslim ibn sa id al kilabi was campaigning in ferghana valley when it learned of turgesh advance immediately arabs began a hasty retreat to jaxartes pursued and harassed by turgesh cavalry finally after 11 days umayyad army reached jaxartes where it was caught between turgesh and forces of native transoxianian principalities nevertheless arabs managed to break through and cross river to khujand umayyad defeat led to collapse of muslim rule over much of region which until ca 740 remained disputed territory with both arabs and turgesh fighting for control over it background region of transoxiana arabic ma wara al nahr had been conquered by umayyad leader qutayba ibn muslim in reign of al walid i r 705 715 following muslim conquests of persia and khurasan in mid 7th century loyalties of transoxiana s native iranian and turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable however as demonstrated in 719 when transoxianian princes sent a petition to chinese and their turgesh vassals for military aid against caliphate s governors turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against muslims in transoxiana beginning in 720 these incursions were coupled with uprisings against caliphate among local sogdians umayyad governor of khurasan sa id ibn amr al harashi harshly suppressed unrest and restored muslim position almost to what it had been during time of qutayba except for ferghana valley control over which was lost expedition against ferghana and day of thirst in 723 al harashi was replaced as governor by muslim ibn sa id al kilabi who resolved late next year to launch an expedition with goal of seizing ferghana campaign faced difficulties already in its early stages when news arrived of accession of a new caliph hisham ibn abd al malik and appointment of a new governor of iraq khalid al qasri this brought long simmering tribal rivalries of arabs of khurasan came to fore yemeni southern arab troops in balkh initially refused to join campaign as they expected imminent recall of al kilabi who was of northern arab stock by new regime khalid al qasri replaced a staunch pro qays northern arab governor umar ibn and was considered as pro yemeni hawting 2000 p 82 only after nasr ibn sayyar led a force of mudaris northern arabs against them and defeated them at baruqan did yemenis join al kilabi s army campaign eventually went ahead as khalid al qasri wrote to al kilabi urging him to proceed with it until his replacement khalid s brother asad arrived in khurasan nevertheless 4 000 troops from yemeni azd tribe withdrew from army al kilabi led his army along jaxartes valley to ferghana and laid siege to it while devastating surrounding countryside at this point umayyad army became aware that turgesh khagan suluk was advancing against them with an army stronger than their own abandoning siege muslim army retreated so hastily towards south that it was claimed they covered a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel on second day after arabs crossed river wadi al subuh turgesh army caught up with them and attacked a secondary camp pitched by abdallah ibn abi abdallah separately from main arab force arabs and their sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties brother of ruler of samarkand ghurak being among slain but managed to repel attack arabs continued their retreat for eight more days during which they were constantly harassed by turgesh cavalry on ninth day arabs reached jaxartes only to find their path blocked by their enemies troops of native principalities of shash and and remnants of sogdian rebellion that sa id al harashi had suppressed arabs made camp for night and burned all their baggage allegedly worth one million dirhams in preparation for battle on next day despite suffering from thirst and being hemmed in between turgesh on their rear and transoxianian forces in front desperate arabs managed to break through enemy lines and cross jaxartes as al tabari writes when they reached relative safety of khujand suffering from hunger and exhaustion troops spread out in disorder there leadership of army was formally transferred to abd al rahman ibn na im al who led remnants of army back to samarkand aftermath and impact defeat of arab army and casualties suffered was a catalyst for almost complete collapse of muslim rule in transoxiana over next few years in words of british scholar h a r gibb it was practically last aggressive expedition of arabs into transoxania for fifteen years but of much greater importance was blow which it struck at arab prestige roles were reversed from now onwards arabs found themselves on defensive and were gradually ousted from almost every district across oxus new umayyad governor asad al qasri campaigned incessantly over next few years but without achieving any major result asad also tried to secure cooperation of local elites by abolishing for a time payment of taxes by native converts mawali but this policy was opposed by khurasani arabs themselves and was reversed by asad s successor ashras ibn abdallah al sulami this led to a general uprising of transoxiana in 728 and with turgesh military aid arabs were evicted from almost entire region transoxiana thereafter remained contested and arabs did not recover their previous position until campaigns of nasr ibn sayyar in 739 741 who took advantage of collapse of turgesh khaganate into civil wars after murder of suluk in 738 references sources category 720s conflicts category 724
