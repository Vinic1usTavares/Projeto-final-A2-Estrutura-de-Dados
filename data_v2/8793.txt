moved to perth he began publishing his first papers discussing history of entomology in western australia in 1921 and also basic articles about ants insect pests in australian forests and myrmecophilous beetles three years after his articles were first published clark was promoted to assistant entomologist scientists attending 1926 australasian association for advancement of science suggested that clark should apply for a position as entomologist at national museum of victoria in which he was appointed in late 1926 and began working there in 1927 after working for museum he found museum work not to his liking and tried to apply for post of economic entomologist in new guinea which at time was an australian administered territory however this was unsuccessful for clark who

superiors and lack of qualifications bedevilled his career although he was welcoming to amateurs in 1944 clark resigned from national museum of victoria after australian botanist richard became director of museum as a result he moved to mooroolbark and lived in poverty losing all of his entitlements due to his reputable view as an authority on ants clark worked on a monograph of ants in australia supported by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation through grants his first volume was published in 1951 which covered australian bulldog ants subfamily myrmeciinae however first volume received poor reviews and no further volume was released in fact it is unknown whether or not any further volume will be released research thumb left nothomyrmecia was described by clark in 1934 and is considered to be most primitive ant alive aside from some papers published discussing myrmecophilous beetles and insect pests in forests clark predominately researched and published articles about taxonomy of australian ants all of his articles and monographs were published in australia throughout his career clark described around 200 different species of ants but half of these may be synonyms he worked and researched with all of main groups of australian ants but his research and revisionary efforts were extensive with members of former subfamily now dorylinae especially those of myrmeciinae rhytidoponera and members of tribe clark is most notable for describing dinosaur ant nothomyrmecia macrops which is most primitive living ant in world and second most primitive when fossil record is included first collection of nothomyrmecia was made in december 1931 by amy crocker who collected specimens of two worker ants reportedly near russell range from israelite bay in western australia crocker sent two specimens to clark at museum for study in 1934 clark published a formal description of nothomyrmecia as a completely new genus of myrmeciinae he did so because two specimens which then became syntypes bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of although they did share similar morphological characteristics with extinct genus prionomyrmex this unusual ant remained unknown to scientists causing intense scientific interest in early 1950s over three decades however teams of australian and american collectors failed to re find it after they initiated a series of searches then in 1977 entomologist robert taylor and his party of entomologists from canberra found a solitary worker ant at poochera southeast of ceduna some from reported site of 1931 discovery after 46 years of searching for it entomologists have dubbed ant holy grail of myrmecology such discovery of nothomyrmecia and its general nature marks it as one of clark s most notable achievements death and recognition clark died at his mooroolbark home on 1 june 1956 at age of 71 american entomologist william brown jr notes that clark was living life of a recluse during
