interchange itself was roughly complete with only ramps to and from future ny 390 north of interchange missing ny 47 followed modern ny 390 alignment south to i 490 where ny 47 continued onto what is now i 390 routings of ny 47 and current i 390 were identical to ny 383 scottsville road in chili where ny 47 was forced to grade level via a partially constructed interchange as modern i 390 had yet to be constructed in area southeast of ny 383 at grade thumb right ny 47 s final eastern terminus was at this intersection with culver road in irondequoit shown as it was in march 2008 this part of ny

winton road to i 490 it had no signed designation between winton and elmwood eastern expressway ny 47 followed modern i 590 northward through brighton to can of worms where ny 47 met i 490 for second time due to way interchange was designed at time traffic continuing on ny 47 across i 490 had to merge with i 490 traffic for roughly before exiting i 490 onto other portion of ny 47 north of i 490 ny 47 followed length of what is now ny 590 through brighton rochester and irondequoit to culver road at lake ontario shoreline history original alignment 290px thumb right map of rochester with original

transportation owned rochester subdivision at grade route remained on howard road until intersection of howard road and chili avenue ny 33a which also included brooks avenue at this juncture of time ny 47 turned east onto brooks avenue and proceeded toward greater rochester international airport joining current routing of ny 204 at beahan road now old beahan road thumb left intersection of elmwood avenue and winton road at twelve corners in brighton ny 47 entered on elmwood from left and turned north here onto winton ny 47 followed entire alignment of ny 204 to what is now i 390 and continued on brooks avenue into rochester to genesee park boulevard route 47 turned south onto street which circles around southwestern quadrant of city and followed its length to genesee street where it turned south for a short distance before resuming its eastward alignment on elmwood avenue route remained on elmwood avenue into brighton where it turned north onto south winton road at twelve corners at highland avenue ny 47 reentered rochester and became north winton road at east avenue ny 96 route remained on winton through rochester and irondequoit before terminating at empire boulevard then us 104 now ny 404 just west of irondequoit bay expressway realignments east of rochester in early 1950s construction began on sea breeze expressway a mostly limited access highway linking lake ontario shoreline to proposed i 490 east of rochester first portion of road a divided highway extending from east ridge road in irondequoit to culver road just west of irondequoit bay outlet was opened to traffic by 1954 as a realignment of ny 18 construction on a limited access extension south to empire boulevard three blocks west of ny 47 s western terminus began at some point between 1956 and 1958 and was completed by 1960 as a realignment of us 104 another extension of highway south to partially complete i 490 in brighton was completed and largely became part of a rerouted ny 47 by following year at time ny 47 left expressway at blossom road and followed it west to winton road where it rejoined its original routing thumb winton road former ny 47 at ny 96 in rochester by 1964 construction was underway on a new expressway leading south from i 490 at can of worms to elmwood avenue east of twelve corners highway was completed at which time ny 47 was realigned to follow sea breeze expressway and new expressway south through can of worms to its end at a partial interchange with elmwood avenue now i 590 exit 3 it continued west on elmwood avenue to twelve corners where it reconnected to its old alignment at winton road west of rochester first realignment of ny 47 west of city occurred when it was rerouted between chili and elmwood avenues to bypass then rochester monroe county airport to south instead of turning east onto brooks avenue as it did prior to 1962 route continued south on beahan road to scottsville road ny 383 where it turned to overlap ny 383 north to elmwood avenue at time beahan road connected directly to scottsville road via modern old beahan road as primary runway southwest of airport had yet to be extended to its present length by 1962 construction was underway on a new limited access highway paralleling ny 47 howard road to east between ny 31 and ny 33 within two years work had begun on an extension of highway south along erie canal to scottsville road farther east construction was underway on a new highway leading south from i 490 to elmwood avenue east of twelve corners thumb left reference marker for ny 47 on ny 590 in irondequoit all of limited access highway between ny 31 and ny 383 opened to traffic ny 47 was reconfigured to begin a half mile 0 8 km to east of howard road at modern ny 390 exit 21 and follow new highway southeastward to its temporary end at what is now i 390 exit 17 east of airport at this point ny 47 joined its pre 1965 routing and followed ny 383 northeastward into city limits by 1968 construction was underway on a northward extension of expressway to us 104 in greece it was completed and opened to traffic by 1971 extensions and deletion ny 47 was officially extended on both ends on january 1 1970 to terminate at lake ontario on opposite sides of rochester in greece designation officially followed what is now ny 390 north to lake ontario state parkway however portion between us 104 and parkway had yet to be constructed to east in irondequoit ny 47 was stretched northward along sea breeze expressway to culver road resulting in overlaps with both us 104 and ny 18 at time overlap with us 104 existed only between empire boulevard and keeler street expressway which became new alignment of route through irondequoit after its completion in 1969 national bridge inventory a database compiled by united states department of transportation federal highway administration available at www nationalbridges com accessed december 9 2007 overlap with us 104 was eliminated entirely following year when that route was realigned onto a new expressway alignment between ny 47 and webster that traversed irondequoit bay via newly built irondequoit bay bridge overlap with ny 18 was eliminated when ny 18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in kodak park thumb old rusted reference marker for ny 940l along howard road former ny 47 in gates on march 18 1980 ny 47 designation was eliminated and split into four other routes from ny 104 in greece to i 490 ny 47 became ny 390 section from i 490 south to ny 383 was designated as part of i 390 however it would not connect to existing portion of i 390 south of rochester until 1981 when interchange between i 390 and i 590 was completed segment of ny 47 from elmwood avenue north to can of worms became part of i 590 which continued southwest along freeway to winton road from can of worms to lake ontario ny 47 was redesignated ny 590 off expressways former alignments of ny 47 now carry several designations howard road bypassed by 1960s realignment in gates is still maintained by new york state department of transportation as ny 940l an unsigned reference route in length beahan road also bypassed by same 1960s rerouting was reconfigured into its current alignment by 1971 due to an expansion by airport section of beahan road that carried ny 47 is currently maintained by monroe county as part of county
