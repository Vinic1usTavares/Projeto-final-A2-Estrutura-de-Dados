first observed over northwestern caribbean sea on june 12 sixth and final storm was last noted on october 26 these dates fall within period with most tropical cyclone activity in atlantic three tropical cyclones during season existed simultaneously two of cyclones have only a single known point in its track due to a sparsity of data operationally another tropical cyclone was believed to have existed over eastern atlantic between september 17 and september 18 but hurdat official atlantic hurricane database excludes this system however in absence of modern satellite and other remote sensing technologies only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known so actual total could be higher an undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated of six known 1858 atlantic cyclones five were first documented in 1995 by jose fernandez partagas and henry diaz first system was spotted over western
