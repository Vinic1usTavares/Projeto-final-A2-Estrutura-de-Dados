song that appear next to those of 070 shake prior to nicki minaj s outro piercing silence as song begins to wind down nicki minaj s vocals on outro consist of a voice recording in which she semi speaks paying reference to lyrics rapped by west in reference to her earlier in song it had been rumored for west to be shading taylor swift by including voice recording since outro suggests that nicki minaj had already approved west s lyrics about her before being featured on song voice recording was interpreted as shade by some because a phone conversation posted by kardashian between west

saying nobody needed to know i hit him about that like that s not why i do that for he elaborated explaining that due to wanting to be known as an artist not just a writer pardison fontaine only writes for people who have his respect such as west because he considers him as his idol two became involved with each other after west tracked down pardison fontaine and brought him to wyoming due to

being where west explained his total lack of understanding about way women see world it was viewed as a song where with right software you could very easily remove west s part and have a perfectly fine song by jordan sargent of spin rob sheffield in his review for rolling stone looked at song as being a very clumsy end for album hannah giorgis of atlantic noted song s dissonance and described it as phil collins esque while panning song s voyeuristic tone and lyrical content simon miraudo from student edge wrote that it inches uncomfortably towards racial respectability politics which he looked at as being a possible influence from american conservative candace owens that west is a fan of miraudo continued claiming that song calls on regressive idea that men can only appreciate women after they ve sired their own in a more mixed review west s performance was described by rodney carmichael and ann powers of npr as what shows him reaching out to his young daughters in love but ultimately getting distracted by idea that other men might hurt them however violent crimes has garnered some positive reviews from critics who were generally not as focused on rapping sam moore writing for metro characterized it as a blissful climax to ye and viewed song as continuing good vibes on album billboard ranked it as third best track and complemented voice recording from nicki
