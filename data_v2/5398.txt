travel back in time retaining their memories of past six days makoto accepts that he has traveled through time and izumi reveals that she is professor in charge of seminar camp and that events of past week were a science experiment she attempted to test phenomenon known as cure syndrome where if multiple people believe in a delusion and delusion is spread to others delusion becomes reality makoto was test subject of experiment which was meant to involve him having delusion that he could have premonitions unexpectedly he turned out to have real premonitions izumi suggests that in first six days makoto had been deceived by her and okuhiko but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time when izumi died on april 6 and makoto had desired to travel back in time cure syndrome manifested she suggests that while he had thought that he was traveling back in time he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently as part of a delusion and that he had given himself partial memories in form of premonitions in each loop in last loop he would have given himself all his memories other than knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion she says that once makoto succeeds in saving her he will break out of delusion and six days in his delusion will become reality makoto refuses to believe her claiming that everything around him is reality but starts to doubt throughout week depending on player s choices route branches into two endings in one delusions appear to be changing reality but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences in other delusions do change reality and makoto wakes up at bottom of cliff he fell down at end of last loop badly wounded from having protected izumi during fall it is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion and whether makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion development thumb upright 8 game was written by kotaro uchikoshi as his second visual novel after memories off alt a 2016 photograph of kotaro uchikoshi game was directed by takumi nakazawa while kotaro uchikoshi was planner and scenario writer development began immediately after uchikoshi s first visual novel memories off was finished he was unable to make heavy use of science fiction themes in never 7 as his superiors at kid told him that game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell he kept science fiction themes light and game was designed with a focus on dating game elements with main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl dreamcast version included new scenarios not available in playstation version development team depicted reality in world of never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute as such for each route that route s history is only one makoto knows and only one that is real to him cure syndrome only exists to him in routes where it is mentioned bells were used as symbols for reality being relative and were described by development team as vague existences saying that one cannot know if they exist or not in bad ending to izumi s route bells which should be fictional remain while something that should exist disappears this was a metaphor for idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion game s title comes from how makoto is unable to escape infinite loop and reach april 7 and how most of seven characters die at some point during game it is also based on belief that 7 is a lucky number game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in series and was part of what led to infinity being chosen as series title one example of openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether game s world was connected to that of memories off series saying that while characters with similar names may appear they wanted to leave player to decide for themselves what answer would be game s soundtrack was composed by takeshi abo and features geometric music because of game s theoretical and science fiction elements prior to composing music he read through game s story to understand setting and each character s personality as much as possible he would write his impressions of plot with a focus on emotional flow and events that occur throughout story he valued his first impressions as very important for this according to abo this method takes longer time but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to game s world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of game because he enjoyed story music strongly reflects abo s own musical tastes opening and ending themes of playstation portable version titled sen oku no yoru no sora and hana respectively were performed by band asriel game was originally released by kid for playstation under title infinity on march 23 2000 a neo geo pocket version titled infinity cure was

for ios on september 11 2012 reception in reviews around time of game s release reviewers appreciated science fiction themes of game neal chandran at rpgfan called plot excellent and appreciated how game s story is a personal character driven emotive human tale based around gentle romance rather than an apocalyptic beat bad guy kind of story he also liked how game s interactivity is on a more personal scope than in adventure games and role playing games he had played he found game s pacing and writing quality to be good and liked music finding it to complement mood of game well while he thought game s graphics were not anything special he was impressed by character designs especially that of character haruka a writer at famitsu however called game s mood boring from start to end in
