principes singular princeps were spearmen and later swordsmen in armies of early roman republic they were men in prime of their lives who were fairly wealthy and could afford decent equipment they were heavier infantry of legion who carried large shields and wore good quality armor their usual position was second battle line they fought in a quincunx formation supported by light troops they were eventually disbanded after marian reforms of 107 bc history and deployment according to pat southern principes appear to have been born from remnants of old second class of army under etruscan kings when it was reformed by marcus furius camillus second class stood in some of first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes they would support heavier first class in front ranks it is probable that engagements with samnites and a crushing defeat at hands of gallic warlord brennus who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones taught romans importance of flexibility and inadequacy of phalanx on rough hilly ground of central italy camillan system in early camillan system of organisation of 3rd and 4th centuries bc men were sorted into classes based on wealth principes being wealthiest after triarii principes were armed with short spears or hastae up to 1 8 metres 6 ft long they fought in a quincunx formation usually carrying scuta large rectangular shields and bronze helmets often with a number of feathers fixed onto top to increase stature they wore heavier armour types most common form being chainmail which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement in this type of legion 900 principes formed 15 maniples military units of 60 men each principes stood in second battle line behind hastati of first line and in front of triarii in third in a pitched battle leves javelin armed light infantry would form up at front of legion and harass enemy with javelin fire to cover advance of hastati light spearmen if hastati failed to break enemy during their engagement they would fall back and let heavier principes take over if principes could not break through they would retire behind heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage enemy in turn equites cavalrymen were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies rorarii and accensi in final battle line were some of least dependable troops and were used in a support role providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of line polybian system thumb by time of punic wars of 2nd century bc this form of organisation was found to be inefficient in a new polybian system infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience their equipment and role was very similar to previous system except they now carried swords or gladii instead of spears each princeps also carried two pila heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from victim or thrown back principes had been increased in number to 1 200 per legion and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each rorarii and accensi had been disbanded leves had been replaced with velites who had a similar role with forty of them being attached to each maniple in legion pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion velites would gather at front and fling javelins to cover advance of hastati who had also been re armed with swords if hastati failed to break enemy they would fall back on principes if principes could not break them they would retire behind triarii who would then engage enemy this order of battle was almost always followed battle of great plains and battle of zama being among few notable exceptions at great plains scipio roman general formed his men up in usual manner but once hastati had begun to engage enemy he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force routing opposing carthaginians at zama scipio arranged his men into columns side by side with large lanes in between opposing carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on romans once surviving elephants had been routed he formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in centre and hastati on flanks ready to engage carthaginian infantry marian reforms with formal military reforms of gaius marius in 107 bc intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against numidian king jugurtha in north africa and germanic tribes to north different classes of units were disbanded entirely with uniformly armed with gladius and two pilum wealth and age requirements were scrapped soldiers would join as a career rather than as service to city and would all be equipped as miles or soldiers with same state purchased equipment auxiliaries local irregular troops would fulfill other roles serving as archers skirmishers and cavalry see also structural history of
