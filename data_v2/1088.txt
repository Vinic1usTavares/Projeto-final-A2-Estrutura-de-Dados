acne also known as acne vulgaris is a long term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from skin it is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads pimples oily skin and possible scarring it primarily affects areas of skin with a relatively high number of oil glands including face upper part of chest and back resulting appearance can lead to anxiety reduced self esteem and in extreme cases depression or thoughts of suicide genetics is thought to be primary cause of acne in 80 of cases role of diet and cigarette smoking is unclear and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part in both sexes hormones called androgens appear to be part of underlying mechanism by causing increased production of sebum another frequent factor is excessive growth of bacterium cutibacterium acnes which is normally present on skin many treatment options for acne are available including lifestyle changes medications and medical procedures eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help treatments applied directly to affected skin such as azelaic acid benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are commonly used antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to skin and taken by mouth for treatment of acne however resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy several types of birth control pills help against acne in women isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in medical community to decrease overall long term impact to individuals in 2015 acne was estimated to affect people globally making it eighth most common disease worldwide acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80 90 of teenagers in western world lower rates are reported in some rural societies children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty although acne becomes less common in adulthood it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties classification severity of acne vulgaris gr point l vulgaris common can be classified as mild moderate or severe as this helps to determine an appropriate treatment regimen there is no universally accepted scale for grading acne severity mild acne is classically defined by presence of clogged skin follicles known as comedones limited to face with occasional inflammatory lesions moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on face compared to mild cases of acne and are found on trunk of body severe acne is said to occur when nodules painful bumps lying under skin are characteristic facial lesions and involvement of trunk is extensive large nodules were previously referred to as cysts and term has been used in medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne true cysts are in fact rare in those with acne and term severe nodular acne is now preferred terminology acne l upside down and acne rosacea rosa rose colored forming are not true forms of acne and respectively refer to skin conditions hs and rosacea although hs shares certain common features with acne vulgaris such as a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris condition otherwise lacks defining features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disorder signs and symptoms typical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by skin microcomedones comedones papules nodules large papules pustules and often results in scarring appearance of acne varies with skin color it may result in psychological and social problems scars acne scars are caused by inflammation within dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95 of people with acne vulgaris scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation scarring is most likely to take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris acne scars are classified based on whether abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at site of acne lesion atrophic acne scars have lost collagen from healing response and are most common type of acne scar account for approximately 75 of all acne scars they may be further classified as ice pick scars boxcar scars and rolling scars ice pick scars are narrow less than 2 mm across deep scars that extend into dermis boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1 5 4 mm across rolling scars are wider than and boxcar scars 4 5 mm across and have a wave like pattern of depth in skin hypertrophic scars are uncommon and are characterized by increased collagen content after abnormal healing response they are described as firm and raised from skin hypertrophic scars remain within original margins of wound whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin and usually occur on trunk of body pigmentation postinflammatory hyperpigmentation pih is usually result of nodular acne lesions these lesions often leave behind an inflamed darkened mark after original acne lesion has resolved this inflammation stimulates specialized pigment producing skin cells known as melanocytes to produce more melanin pigment which leads to skin s darkened appearance people with darker skin color are more frequently affected by this condition pigmented scar is a common term used for pih but is misleading as it suggests color change is permanent often pih can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of nodule and can fade with time however untreated pih can last for months years or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected even minimal skin exposure to sun s ultraviolet rays can sustain hyperpigmentation daily use of spf 15 or higher sunscreen can minimize such a risk causes risk factors for development of acne other than genetics have not been conclusively identified possible secondary contributors include hormones infections diet and stress studies investigating impact of smoking on incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive sunlight and cleanliness are not associated with acne genes acne appears to be strongly inherited with 81 of variation in population explained by genetics studies performed in affected twins and first degree relatives further demonstrate strongly inherited nature of acne acne susceptibility is likely due to influence of multiple genes as disease does not follow a classic mendelian inheritance pattern several gene candidates have been proposed including certain variations in tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf alpha il 1 alpha and genes among others 308 g a single nucleotide polymorphism variation in gene for tnf is associated with an increased risk for acne acne can be a feature of rare genetic disorders such as s syndrome severe acne may be associated with syndrome hormones hormonal activity such as occurs during menstrual cycles and puberty may contribute to formation of acne during puberty an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum several hormones have been linked to acne including androgens testosterone dihydrotestosterone and dhea high levels of growth hormone gh and insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 have also been associated with worsened acne both androgens and igf 1 seem to be essential for acne to occur as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais or syndrome insensitivity to gh resulting in very low igf 1 levels medical conditions that commonly cause a high androgen state such as polycystic ovary syndrome congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen secreting tumors can cause acne in affected individuals conversely people who lack androgenic hormones or are insensitive to effects of androgens rarely have acne an increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis may be seen during pregnancy acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use over counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids infections it is widely suspected that anaerobic bacterial species cutibacterium acnes formerly acnes contributes to development of acne but its exact role is not well understood there are specific sub strains of c acnes associated with normal skin and moderate or severe inflammatory acne it is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on site or are acquired or possibly both depending on person these strains have capability of changing perpetuating or adapting to abnormal cycle of inflammation oil production and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores infection with parasitic mite demodex is associated with development of acne it is unclear whether eradication of mite improves acne diet relationship between diet and acne is unclear as there is no high quality evidence that establishes any definitive link between them high glycemic load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity multiple randomized controlled trials and studies have found a lower glycemic load diet to be effective in reducing acne there is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine igf 1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone these components are hypothesized to promote effects of insulin and igf 1 and thereby increase production of androgen hormones sebum and promote formation of comedones available evidence does not support a link between eating chocolate or salt and acne severity chocolate does contain varying amounts of sugar which can lead to a high glycemic load and it can be made with or without milk few studies have examined relationship between obesity and acne vitamin b12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne acneiform eruptions or worsen existing acne when taken in doses exceeding recommended daily intake eating greasy foods does not increase acne nor make it worse stress few high quality studies have been performed which demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne while connection between acne and stress has been debated some research indicates that increased severity is associated with high stress levels in certain contexts such as hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndrome environmental factors mechanical obstruction of skin follicles with helmets or can worsen pre existing acne medications several medications can worsen pre existing acne with examples being lithium isoniazid glucocorticoids iodides bromides and testosterone pathophysiology thumb upright 1 3 simplistic representation of formation of acne comedones thumb upright 1 3 hair follicle anatomy demonstrating a healthy hair follicle pictured left a whitehead or closed comedo middle picture and a blackhead or open comedo pictured right alt three images illustrating hair follicle anatomy thumb upright 1 3 flowchart of pathological sequence of events leading to acne alt image illustrating flowchart of pathophysiology of acne acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of unit and develops due to blockages in skin s hair follicles these blockages are thought to occur as a result of following four abnormal processes a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production influenced by androgens excessive deposition of protein keratin leading to comedo formation colonization of follicle by cutibacterium acnes c acnes bacteria and local release of pro inflammatory chemicals in skin earliest pathologic change is formation of a plug a microcomedone which is driven primarily by excessive growth reproduction and accumulation of skin cells in hair follicle in normal skin skin cells that have died come up to surface and exit pore of hair follicle however increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes dead skin cells to stick together accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks pore of hair follicle thus forming microcomedone this is further exacerbated by biofilm created by c acnes within hair follicle if microcomedone is superficial within hair follicle skin pigment melanin is exposed to air resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance known as a blackhead or open comedo in contrast if microcomedone occurs deep within hair follicle this causes formation of a whitehead known as a closed comedo main hormonal driver of oily sebum production in skin is dihydrotestosterone another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is dhea s higher amounts of dhea s are secreted during a stage of puberty and this leads to an increase in sebum production in a sebum rich skin environment naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium c acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around follicle due to activation of innate immune system c acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing production of several pro inflammatory chemical signals such as il 1a il 8 tnf a and ltb4 il 1a is known to be essential to comedo formation a major mechanism of acne related skin inflammation is mediated by c acnes ability to bind and activate a class of immune system receptors known as toll like receptors especially tlr2 and tlr4 activation of tlr2 and tlr4 by c acnes leads to increased secretion of il 1a il 8 and tnf a release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to hair follicle including neutrophils macrophages and th1 cells il 1a stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction which in turn fuels comedo development furthermore sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides such as hbd1 and hbd2 in response to binding of tlr2 and tlr4 c acnes also provokes skin inflammation by altering fatty composition of oily sebum oxidation of lipid squalene by c acnes is of particular importance squalene oxidation activates nf kb a protein complex and consequently increases il 1a levels additionally squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of 5 enzyme responsible for conversion of acid to leukotriene b4 ltb4 ltb4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha ppara protein ppara increases activity of activator protein 1 ap 1 and nf kb thereby leading to recruitment of inflammatory t cells inflammatory properties of c acnes can be further explained by bacterium s ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of enzyme lipase these free fatty acids spur production of hbd1 and hbd2 thus leading to further inflammation this inflammatory cascade typically leads to formation of inflammatory acne lesions including papules infected pustules or nodules if inflammatory reaction is severe follicle can break into deeper layers of dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause formation of deep nodules involvement of ap 1 in aforementioned inflammatory cascade leads to activation of matrix which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation diagnosis acne vulgaris is diagnosed based on a medical professional s clinical judgment evaluation of a person with suspected acne should include taking a detailed medical history about a family history of acne a review of medications taken signs or symptoms of excessive production of androgen hormones cortisol and growth hormone comedones blackheads and whiteheads must be present to diagnose acne in their absence an appearance similar to that of acne would suggest a different skin disorder microcomedones precursor to blackheads and whiteheads are not visible to naked eye when inspecting skin and can only be seen with a microscope there are many features that may indicate a person s acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30 worsening week before a woman s period acne lesions predominantly over jawline and chin and inflammatory nodular acne lesions several scales exist to grade severity of acne vulgaris but no single technique has been universally accepted as diagnostic standard cook s acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 0 being least severe and 8 being most severe this scale was first to use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity since its creation in 1979 scale has undergone several revisions leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on face back and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non inflammatory leeds scores range from 0 least severe to 10 most severe though modified scales have a maximum score of 12 pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies severity of acne from grade 1 least severe to grade 4 most severe differential diagnosis many skin conditions can mimic acne vulgaris and these are collectively known as acneiform eruptions such conditions include epidermal cysts flat warts folliculitis keratosis pilaris milia perioral dermatitis and rosacea among others age is one factor which may help distinguish between these disorders skin disorders such as perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood whereas rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults facial redness triggered by heat or consumption of alcohol or spicy food is suggestive of rosacea presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance due to exposure to certain chemicals may look very similar to acne vulgaris management many different treatments exist for acne these include alpha hydroxy acid anti androgen medications antibiotics medications azelaic acid benzoyl peroxide hormonal treatments keratolytic soaps nicotinamide retinoids and salicylic acid they are believed to work in at least four different ways including following reducing inflammation hormonal manipulation killing c acnes and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in pore to prevent blockage common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics benzoyl peroxide and retinoids and systemic therapies including antibiotics hormonal agents and oral retinoids recommended therapies for first line use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids benzoyl peroxide and topical or oral antibiotics procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not considered to be first line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy medications for acne work by targeting early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions improvement in appearance of acne is typically expected between eight and twelve weeks after starting therapy skin care in general it is recommended that people with acne do not wash affected skin more than twice daily for people with acne and sensitive skin a fragrance free moisturizer may be used to reduce irritation skin irritation from acne medications typically peaks at two weeks after onset of use and tends to improve with continued use cosmetic products that specifically say non comedogenic oil free and won t clog pores are recommended diet a diet low in simple sugars is recommended as a method of improving acne as of 2014 evidence is insufficient to recommend milk restriction for this purpose medications benzoyl peroxide thumb upright 1 3 common acne vulgaris treatment benzoyl peroxide cream alt a tube of benzoyl peroxide gel benzoyl peroxide bpo is a first line treatment for mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild side effects mainly skin irritation in skin follicle benzoyl peroxide kills c acnes by oxidizing its proteins through formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid these free radicals are thought to interfere with bacterium s metabolism and ability to make proteins additionally benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide adapalene respectively side effects include increased skin photosensitivity dryness redness and occasional peeling sunscreen use is often advised during treatment to prevent sunburn lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are just as effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects unlike antibiotics benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial antibiotic resistance retinoids retinoids are medications which reduce inflammation normalize follicle cell life cycle and reduce sebum production they are structurally related to vitamin a studies show they are by primary care doctors and dermatologists retinoids appear to influence cell life cycle in follicle lining this helps prevent accumulation of skin cells within hair follicle that can create a blockage they are a first line acne treatment especially for people with dark colored skin and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation topical retinoids include adapalene isotretinoin retinol tazarotene and tretinoin they often cause an initial flare up of acne and facial flushing and can cause significant skin irritation generally speaking retinoids increase skin s sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night tretinoin is least expensive of topical retinoids and is most irritating to skin whereas adapalene is least irritating to skin but costs significantly more most formulations of tretinoin cannot be applied at same time as benzoyl peroxide tazarotene is most effective and expensive topical retinoid but is not as well tolerated retinol is a form of vitamin a that has similar but milder effects and is used in many over counter moisturizers and other topical products isotretinoin is an oral retinoid that is very effective for severe nodular acne and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments one to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4 6 month course of oral isotretinoin after a single course about 80 of people report an improvement with more than 50 reporting complete remission about 20 of patients require a second course there are concerns that isotretinoin is linked with adverse effects like depression anemia although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims isotretinoin has been found in some studies to be superior to antibiotics or placebo in reducing acne lesions however a 2018 review comparing inflammatory lesions after treatment with antibiotics versus isotretinoin found no difference frequency of adverse events was about twice as high with isotretinoin although these were mostly dryness related events no increased risk of suicide or depression was conclusively found isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy for such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control in 2008 united states started ipledge program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy ipledge requires woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete effectiveness of ipledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception antibiotics antibiotics are frequently applied to skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against c acnes and their ability to reduce inflammation with widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic resistant c acnes worldwide antibiotics are becoming less effective especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin therefore they are not recommended for use alone but are preferred as part of combination therapy commonly used antibiotics either applied to skin or taken orally include clindamycin erythromycin metronidazole and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline doxycycline 40 milligrams daily low dose appears to have similar efficacy to doxycycline 100 milligrams daily and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects when antibiotics are applied to skin they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together oral antibiotics are recommended for no longer than three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration are associated with development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses furthermore if long term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and or a retinoid be used at same time to limit risk of c acnes developing antibiotic resistance dapsone has shown efficacy against inflammatory acne but is generally not a first line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics it is sometimes a preferred therapy in women or for people with sensitive or darker toned skin topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow orange skin discoloration with this combination while minocycline is shown to be an effective acne treatment it is no longer recommended as a first line antibiotic due to a lack of evidence that it is better than other treatments and concerns of safety compared to other tetracyclines hormonal agents in women acne can be improved with use of any combined birth control pill these medications contain an estrogen and a progestin they work by decreasing production of androgen hormones by ovaries and by decreasing free and hence biologically active fractions of androgens resulting in lowered skin production of sebum and consequently reduced acne severity first generation progestins such as and have androgenic properties and can worsen acne although oral estrogens can decrease igf 1 levels in some situations and this might be expected to additionally contribute to improvement in acne symptoms combined birth control pills appear to have no effect on igf 1 levels in fertile women however cyproterone acetate containing birth control pills have been reported to decrease total and free igf 1 levels combinations containing third or fourth generation progestins including or as well as birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate or acetate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects studies have shown a 40 to 70 reduction in acne lesions with combined birth control pills a 2014 review found that antibiotics by mouth appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months however two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing number of inflammatory non inflammatory and total acne lesions authors of analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first line acne treatment over oral antibiotics in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone have been used successfully to treat acne especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum or baldness spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women but unlike combined birth control pills is not approved by united states food and drug administration for this purpose medication is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and is thought to be a useful acne treatment due to its ability to additionally block androgen receptor at higher doses alone or in combination with a birth control pill spironolactone has shown a 33 to 85 reduction in acne lesions in women effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dose dependent high dose cyproterone acetate alone has been found to decrease symptoms of acne in women by 75 to 90 within 3 months it is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency medication has also been found to be effective in treatment of acne in males with one study finding that a high dosage reduced inflammatory acne lesions by 73 however side effects of cyproterone acetate in males such as sexual dysfunction and decreased bone mineral density make its use for acne in this sex impractical in most cases hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias and feminization of male babies in addition women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking an antiandrogen antiandrogens are often combined with birth control pills for this reason which can result in additive efficacy flutamide a pure antagonist of androgen receptor is effective in treatment of acne in women it has generally been found to reduce symptoms of acne by 80 or 90 even at low doses with several studies showing complete acne clearance in one study flutamide decreased acne scores by 80 within 3 months whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40 in same time period in a large long term study 97 of women reported satisfaction with control of their acne with flutamide although effective flutamide has a risk of serious liver toxicity and cases of death in women taking even low doses of medication to treat androgen dependent skin and hair conditions have occurred as such use of flutamide for acne has become increasingly limited and it has been argued that continued use of flutamide for such purposes is unethical a pure androgen receptor antagonist with same mechanism as flutamide and with comparable or superior antiandrogenic efficacy but without its risk of liver toxicity is a potential alternative to flutamide in treatment of androgen dependent skin and hair conditions in women clascoterone is a topical antiandrogen which has demonstrated effectiveness in treatment of acne in both males and females and is currently in late stages of clinical development it has shown no systemic absorption or associated antiandrogenic side effects in a direct head to head comparison clascoterone showed greater effectiveness than topical isotretinoin 5a reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and may be useful for treatment of acne in both males and females but have not been thoroughly evaluated for this purpose in addition high risk of birth defects with 5a reductase inhibitors limits their use in women however 5a reductase inhibitors can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy and are frequently used to treat excessive hair in women there is no evidence as of 2010 to support use of or in treatment of acne hormonal treatments for acne such as combined birth control pills and antiandrogens may be considered a first line therapy for acne under a number of circumstances including when contraception is desired when known or suspected is present when acne occurs in adulthood when acne flares and when symptoms of significant sebum production are co present hormone therapy is effective for acne even in women with normal androgen levels azelaic acid azelaic acid has been shown to be effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20 concentration treatment twice daily for six months is necessary and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide 5 isotretinoin 0 05 and erythromycin 2 azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in follicle and its antibacterial and anti inflammatory properties it has a slight skin lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by post inflammatory hyperpigmentation azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe it is less effective and more expensive than retinoids salicylic acid salicylic acid is a topically applied beta hydroxy acid that stops bacteria from reproducing and has keratolytic properties it opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells salicylic acid is known to be less effective than retinoid therapy dry skin is most commonly seen side effect with topical application though darkening of skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types other medications topical and oral preparations of nicotinamide amide form of vitamin b3 have been suggested as alternative medical treatments it is thought to improve acne due to its anti inflammatory properties its ability to suppress sebum production and by promoting wound healing topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production and inhibit c acnes antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production hydroquinone lightens skin when applied topically by inhibiting tyrosinase enzyme responsible for converting amino acid tyrosine to skin pigment melanin and is used to treat acne associated post inflammatory hyperpigmentation by interfering with new production of melanin in epidermis hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as dermis use of a sunscreen with spf 15 or higher in morning with every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone its application only to affected areas lowers risk of lightening color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around area hydroquinone is generally well tolerated side effects are typically mild e g skin irritation and occur with use of a higher than recommended 4 concentration most preparations contain preservative sodium which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people in extremely rare cases repeated improper topical application of high dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of acid in connective tissues a condition known as exogenous combination therapy combination therapy using medications of different classes together each with a different mechanism of action has been demonstrated to be a more efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together has been shown to be more effective than antibiotics alone similarly using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than use of antibiotics alone frequently used combinations include following antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide antibiotic and topical retinoid or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance pregnancy although late stages of pregnancy are associated with an increase in sebaceous gland activity in skin pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity in general topically applied medications are considered first line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide category c and azelaic acid category b salicylic acid carries a category c safety rating due to higher systemic absorption 9 25 and an association between use of anti inflammatory medications in third trimester and adverse effects to developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in uterus and early closure of babies ductus arteriosus blood vessel prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and potential for fetal harm tretinoin category c and adapalene category c are very poorly absorbed but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in first trimester due to persistent safety concerns topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy in studies examining effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy fetal harm has not been seen in second and third trimesters retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include topical retinoid tazarotene and oral retinoids isotretinoin and all category x spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic topical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin erythromycin and metronidazole all category b due to negligible systemic absorption and dapsone category c are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women but have received less study no adverse fetal events have been reported from topical use of dapsone if retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in developing fetus women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy all category b include azithromycin cephalosporins and tetracyclines category d are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason procedures comedo extraction is supported by limited evidence but is recommended for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment another procedure for immediate relief is injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed acne comedo and have also been reported as effective treatments for comedones light therapy is a treatment method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths of light to an area of skin affected by acne both regular and laser light have been used evidence for light therapy as a treatment for acne is weak and inconclusive various light therapies appear to provide a short term benefit but data for long term outcomes and for outcomes in those with severe acne are sparse it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications a 2016 meta analysis was unable to conclude whether light therapies were more beneficial than placebo or no treatment nor how long potential benefits lasted pdt has most supporting evidence of all light therapies when regular light is used immediately following application of a sensitizing substance to skin such as acid or methyl treatment is referred to as therapy pdt many different types of lasers i e lasers that do not vaporize top layer of skin but rather induce a physiologic response in skin from light have been used to treat acne including those that use infrared wavelengths of light ablative lasers such as co2 and fractional types have also been used to treat active acne and its scars when ablative lasers are used treatment is often referred to as laser resurfacing because as mentioned previously entire upper layers of skin are vaporized ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with non ablative lasers with examples being post inflammatory hyperpigmentation persistent facial redness and persistent pain physiologically certain wavelengths of light used with or without accompanying topical chemicals are thought to kill bacteria and decrease size and activity of glands that produce sebum disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost need for multiple visits time required to complete procedure s and pain associated with some of treatment modalities typical side effects include skin peeling temporary reddening of skin swelling and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation dermabrasion is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing appearance of superficial atrophic scars of boxcar and rolling varieties ice pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight redness and decreased pigmentation of skin dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with introduction of laser resurfacing unlike dermabrasion there is no evidence that is an effective treatment for acne dermal or subcutaneous fillers are substances injected into skin to improve appearance of acne scars fillers are used to increase natural collagen production in skin and to increase skin volume and decrease depth of acne scars examples of fillers used for this purpose include acid poly methyl methacrylate with collagen human and bovine collagen derivatives and fat harvested from person s own body autologous fat transfer microneedling is a procedure in which an instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over skin to elicit a wound healing response and stimulate collagen production to reduce appearance of atrophic acne scars in people with darker skin color notable adverse effects of microneedling include post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and tram track scarring described as discrete slightly raised scars in a linear distribution similar to a tram track latter is thought to be primarily attributable to improper technique by practitioner including use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needles is useful for treatment of superficial atrophic acne scars and involves use of a small needle to loosen adhesions that result in depressed appearance of scar chemical peels can be used to reduce appearance of acne scars mild peels include those using acid lactic acid salicylic acid s solution or a lower concentrations 20 of trichloroacetic acid these peels only affect epidermal layer of skin and can be useful in treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid 30 40 are considered to be medium strength peels and affect skin as deep as papillary dermis formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50 or more are considered to be deep chemical peels medium strength and deep strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes infection and small white superficial cysts known as milia alternative medicine complementary therapies have been investigated for treating people with acne low quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce total number of skin lesions in those with acne tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil s anti acne effects include antibacterial action against c acnes and anti inflammatory properties numerous other plant derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne e g basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed however few studies have been performed and most have been of lower methodological quality there is a lack of high quality evidence for use of acupuncture herbal medicine or cupping therapy for acne self care many over counter treatments in many forms are available which are often referred to as certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne in those with oily skin a water based product is often preferred prognosis acne usually improves around age of 20 but may persist into adulthood permanent physical scarring may occur there is good evidence to support idea that acne and associated scarring negatively affect a person s psychological state worsen mood lower self esteem and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders depression and suicidal thoughts another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples irrespective of severity of their acne this can lead to significant scarring changes in affected person s skin pigmentation and a cyclic worsening of affected person s anxiety about their appearance rare complications from acne or its treatment include formation of osteoma cutis and solid facial edema early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in medical community to reduce chances of these poor outcomes epidemiology globally acne affects approximately 650 million people or about 9 4 of population as of 2010 it affects nearly 90 of people in western societies during their teenage years but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood while acne that first develops between ages of 21 and 25 is uncommon it affects 54 of women and 40 of men older than 25 years of age and has a lifetime prevalence of 85 about 20 of those affected have moderate or severe cases it is slightly more common in females than males 9 8 versus 9 0 in those over 40 years old 1 of males and 5 of females still have problems rates appear to be lower in rural societies while some research has found it affects people of all ethnic groups acne may not occur in non westernized peoples of papua new guinea and paraguay acne affects 40 50 million people in united states 16 and approximately 3 5 million in australia 23 severe acne tends to be more common in people of caucasian or hispanic descent than in people of african descent history thumb domolene ointment a mid 1900s medication that was claimed to cure acne alt a jar of ointment with a box and a poster box has words domolene brand stops all skin troubles rashes and irritation miracle ointment pharaohs are recorded as having had acne which may be earliest known reference to disease since at least reign of cleopatra 69 30 bce application of sulfur to skin has been recognized as a useful treatment for acne sixth century greek physician aetius of amida is credited with coining term or which is believed to have been a reference to facial skin lesions that occur during acme of life puberty in 16th century french physician and botanist francois de sauvages de lacroix provided one of earlier descriptions of acne he used term to describe small red and hard tubercles that altered a person s facial appearance during adolescence and were neither itchy nor painful recognition and characterization of acne progressed in 1776 when josef plenck an austrian physician published a book that proposed novel concept of classifying skin diseases by their elementary initial lesions in 1808 english dermatologist robert willan refined plenck s work by providing first detailed descriptions of several skin disorders using a morphologic terminology that remains in use today thomas bateman continued and expanded on robert willan s work as his student and provided first descriptions and illustrations of acne accepted as accurate by modern dermatologists erasmus wilson in 1842 was first to make distinction between acne vulgaris and rosacea first professional medical monograph dedicated entirely to acne was written by lucius duncan bulkley and published in new york in 1885 scientists initially hypothesized that acne represented a disease of skin s hair follicle and occurred due to blockage of pore by sebum during 1880s bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as causal agents of comedones sebum production and ultimately acne during mid twentieth century dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor sebum bacteria or excess keratin could completely explain disease this led to current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events beginning with blockage of skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells followed by bacterial invasion of hair follicle pore changes in sebum production and inflammation approach to acne treatment underwent significant changes during twentieth century retinoids were introduced as a medical treatment for acne in 1943 benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and has been routinely used for this purpose since 1960s acne treatment was modified in 1950s with introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics such as minocycline these reinforced idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on skin plays an important role in causing acne subsequently in 1970s tretinoin original trade name a was found to be an effective treatment development of oral isotretinoin sold as and followed in 1980 after its introduction in united states it was recognized as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy in united states more than 2 000 women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003 with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage about 160 babies were born with birth defects treatment of acne with topical crushed dry ice termed was first described in 1907 but is no longer performed commonly prior to 1960 use of x rays was also a common treatment society and culture costs and social impact of acne are substantial in united states acne vulgaris is responsible for more than 5 million doctor visits and costs over billion each year in direct costs similarly acne vulgaris is responsible for 3 5 million doctor visits each year in united kingdom sales for top ten leading acne treatment brands in us in 2015 have been reported as amounting to about acne s causative and aggravating factors are common and those affected by it are often blamed for their condition such blame can worsen affected person s sense of self esteem until 20th century even among dermatologists list of causes was believed to include excessive sexual thoughts and masturbation dermatology s association with sexually transmitted infections especially syphilis contributed to stigma acne vulgaris and its resultant scars have been associated with significant social and academic difficulties that can last into adulthood including difficulties obtaining employment until 1930s it was largely seen as a trivial problem among middle class girls a trivial problem because unlike smallpox and tuberculosis no one died from it and a feminine problem because boys were much less likely to seek medical assistance for it during great depression dermatologists discovered that young men with acne had difficulty obtaining jobs and during world war ii some soldiers in tropical climates developed such severe and widespread tropical acne on their bodies that they were declared medically unfit for duty research efforts to better understand mechanisms of sebum production are underway aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with hormones that are known to increase sebum production e g igf 1 and alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone additional sebum lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor modulators another avenue of early stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum producing glands in skin s hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance use of antimicrobial peptides against c acnes is under investigation as a treatment for acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance in 2007 first genome sequencing of a c acnes bacteriophage pa6 was reported authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome problems associated with long term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing skin s ceramide content as of 2014 studies examining effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited decreased levels of retinoic acid in skin may contribute to comedo formation to address this deficiency methods to increase skin s production of retinoid acid are being explored a vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms other animals acne can occur on cats dogs and horses references further reading external links questions and answers about acne
