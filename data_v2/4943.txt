engineering schools in united states rivalry is unusual given geographic distance between schools their campuses are separated by about 3000 miles and are on opposite coasts of united states as well as its focus on elaborate pranks rather than sporting events most recent pranking war was instigated in april 2005 when caltech students pulled multiple pranks during mit s campus preview weekend for

of wright flyer and a firetruck on top of it to acknowledge anniversaries of first powered controlled flight and september 11th attacks respectively and converting it into r2 d2 and a large yellow ring to acknowledge release of star wars episode i and lord of rings respectively a famous off campus hack involved mit students inflating a weather balloon labeled mit at 50 yard line at harvard yale football game in 1982 pranks at two institutions are seen as a way to relax from stress of notoriously rigorous academics of each both caltech and mit have a set of pranking ethics stating that pranks should be reversible and not cause permanent damage and emphasize creativity and originality in recent years pranking has been officially encouraged by tom mannion caltech s assistant vice president for student affairs and campus life grand old days of pranking have gone away at caltech and that s what we are trying to bring back reported boston globe which noted that security has orders not to

were packaged so that mit was visible on front but reverse design words because not everybody can go to caltech and a drawing of a palm tree were obscured until package was opened inflatable palm

facing massachusetts avenue was changed to read that other institute of technology instead of massachusetts institute of technology letters caltech were written on green building with a green laser group responsible for laser dedicated entire weekend to completing it working on electronics for three designs operating on different principles which yielded one working device caltech students intended to upgrade laser to show three dimensional rotating and animated letters by using stereo sound signals encoded on a compact disc to control mirrors to deflect laser beam mit campus police and students were initially frustrated in their attempts to locate source of laser but students were eventually able to trace it and caltech students turned it off just before upgraded electronics could be installed caltech students had also produced genuine looking mit id cards featuring their real names and photographs but did not need to use them mit students lobby 7 dome to read only institute of technology and had to resort to pulling blimp down using helium balloons covered in sticky tape one student unsuccessfully attempted to caltech students website documenting pranks pranks were seen as a way to merge caltech and mit s independent but similar pranking cultures campus preview weekend was chosen because caltech students would blend in with unfamiliar prospective freshmen and to increase pranks visibility mit dean of admissions jones said i think it s hilarious i consider hacks a performance art and i like concept of inter institute rivalry 2006 fleming cannon heist thumb 300px fleming cannon pictured here at caltech is routinely fired to mark end of academic terms ditch day end of rotation and graduation of fleming house president during commencement caltech is home to 1 7 ton 130 year old fleming cannon origins and exact age of fleming cannon are not known with certainty it is believed to have been cast during franco prussian war era but completed in 1878 after war was over it was then given by french to united states where it was re bored to fit american shells and carriage constructed but this work was completed too late for it to see use in spanish american war cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to southwestern academy in san marino california where it was displayed on front lawn starting in 1925 by 1972 school was seeking to discard cannon and a group of caltech students from fleming house took possession of cannon and laboriously restored it to working condition cannon was returned to southwestern in 1975 at insistence of caltech administration but it was permanently restored to caltech in 1981 cannon is one of few objects at caltech that is designated as given its age fragility and irreplaceable nature on march 28 2006 cannon disappeared from caltech campus having been taken by people posing as contractors fooling a security guard with a phony work order at time cannon was not at its normal location outside fleming house where it is normally locked to ground due to ongoing renovations identity of perpetrators was initially unknown and there was speculation that it had been stolen by nearby harvey mudd college who had been responsible for a well known theft of cannon almost twenty years prior however it was soon revealed that cannon had been appropriated by mit in retaliation for previous year s pranks and relocated to cambridge mit team consisted of about 30 hackers of which two flew to pasadena and five drove cross country while acquiring cannon disguised as construction contractors hackers had run ins with a caltech security guard and physical plant worker to whom they explained that they were moving cannon in preparation for pouring of a concrete pedestal once off caltech s campus a local resident called in a noise complaint and pasadena police arrived but did not recognize then disguised cannon on way to shipping company trailer s hitch cracked necessitating a slow trip on surface roads and on arrival they were unable to physically remove cannon from trailer causing them to spend an extra 1000 for services of a company that specialized in moving large film props on april 6 cannon appeared in front of green building sporting a giant 21 pound gold plated aluminum brass rat around its barrel which was positioned to point towards pasadena and female mit students mockingly posted pictures of themselves posing in bikinis with cannon it was revealed that preparations for heist had been underway since december mit was softly criticized for not leaving a note explaining that theft was a prank as required by caltech s pranking ethics which were said to be more stringent than mit s but prank was largely taken in good humor at both campuses fleming house students and alumni quickly began plotting for return of cannon setting up a command center in a trailer on campus and soliciting donations from alumni their initial plan was to use a helicopter to fly cannon out of mit campus initial arrangements were made with a helicopter company but federal aviation administration rules ultimately made this untenable students instead decided to surreptitiously steal back cannon under cover of darkness on morning of april 10 about two dozen fleming students dressed in their signature red fleming jerseys descended upon cannon to reclaim it and begin its journey back to pasadena however mit students had been tipped off and were waiting for caltech students with a friendly barbecue prepared and played wagner s ride of valkyries a forbidden song at caltech due to its association with final exams as entered fleming students left a miniature toy cannon with a note reading here s something a little more your size later developments thumb mit students unsuccessfully tried to place a life sized model of tardis time machine from doctor who television series on top of baxter hall at caltech a few months later students from both schools collaborated in erecting model during mit s cpw in 2007 caltech distributed a sixteen page fake edition of mit s student newspaper tech containing articles such as math dept hires rising star matt damon referring to 1997 film good will hunting and infinite corridor not actually infinite referring to mit s iconic main thoroughfare and a mock advertisement for sperm donation offering more money for caltech students than mit students prank was inspired by suggestion that a similar fake newspaper caper had been perpetrated by university of southern california against university of california los angeles in past and paper was prepared in just two weeks with 15 000 issues printed three caltech students sent to distribute papers at mit initially tried to drop papers at techs normal distribution points but these were quickly discovered and removed by mit students caltech students then turned to distributing papers individually on sidewalk outside of lobby 7 a location outside jurisdiction of mit police in 2008 caltech students provided a puzzle zero in mit mystery hunt that when solved told solvers to call a specific number in 626 area code immediately when mit students dialed number they heard thank you for calling caltech admissions office if you are another mit student wishing to transfer to caltech please download our transfer application form from www caltech

involving transforming mit into caltech east school of humanities pranks were planned over course of six months caltech students intended to deploy two large banners that were designed to be easy to place but removal would require a cherry picker or a rappel however design of mit s killian court prevented placement of one of them and another was intercepted by mit security before its deployment could be completed another fake edition of tech was released stating that students would be required to take a core of literature history philosophy and economics but science subjects would be eliminated although failure of pranks was considered to be a disappointment caltech and mit students afterwards shared breakfast at a local diner in september 2010 mit hackers attempted to place a tardis time machine on roof of baxter hall at caltech but were foiled by caltech security it was stated that this was due to mit students failure to tell caltech administration about prank in advance however in january 2011 caltech and mit students cooperated in placing tardis on roof tardis had previously been seen on mit great dome in august 2010 and was subsequently transported to buildings at university of california berkeley and then stanford university caltech pranksters again visited mit s campus preview weekend in april 2014 this time distributing mugs that displayed mit logo when cold but when filled with hot liquid turned orange and changed to read caltech hotter institute of technology caltech students handed out mugs to prospective students outside mit s formal welcoming event mit admissions officers tried to stop caltech students unless they could prove they were a registered event but caltech prank club president julie jester stalled them for 20 minutes by claiming they were registered through mit alumni association pretending to have problems connecting to mit s wifi on her smartphone and calling caltech student activities director tom mannion to get a name of an mit alumni association member mit admissions officers reportedly resorted to ripping mugs out of s hands mit admissions officer chris peterson later tweeted that mugs were snake oil by charlatans from other coasts jester later said that it s been a couple years since we had a good mit prank we wanted to rekindle that relationship and pranks are a big element of caltech culture we re just a small institution but we feel that our impact is really bigger than our size we do cool stuff because we can see also list of practical joke topics references external links howe ser moving co fake issue of
