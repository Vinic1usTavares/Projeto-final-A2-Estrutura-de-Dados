kenneth tompkins bainbridge july 27 1904 july 14 1996 was an american physicist at harvard university who did work on cyclotron research his precise measurements of mass differences between nuclear isotopes allowed him to confirm albert einstein s mass energy equivalence concept he was director of manhattan project s trinity nuclear test which took place july 16 1945 bainbridge described trinity explosion as a foul and awesome display he remarked to j robert oppenheimer immediately after test now we are all sons of bitches this marked beginning of his dedication to ending testing of nuclear weapons and to efforts to maintain civilian control of future developments in that field early life kenneth tompkins bainbridge was born in cooperstown new york second of three sons of william warin bainbridge and mary grinnell tompkins he was educated at horace mann school in new york while at high school he developed an interest in ham radio which inspired him to enter massachusetts institute of technology mit in 1921 to study electrical engineering in five years he earned both bachelor of science s b and master of science s m degrees during summer breaks he worked at general electric s laboratories in lynn massachusetts and schenectady new york while there he obtained three patents related to photoelectric tubes normally this would have been a promising start to a career at general electric but it made bainbridge aware of how interested he was in physics upon graduating from mit in 1926 he enrolled at princeton university where karl t compton a consultant to general electric was on faculty in 1929 he was awarded a ph d in his new field writing his thesis on a search for element 87 by analysis of positive rays under supervision of henry dewolf smyth early career bainbridge enjoyed a series of prestigious fellowships after graduation he was awarded a national research council and then a bartol research foundation fellowship at time franklin institute s bartol research foundation was located on swarthmore college campus in pennsylvania and was directed by w f g swann an english physicist with an interest in nuclear physics bainbridge married margaret peg pitkin a member of swarthmore teaching faculty in september 1931 they had a son martin keeler and two daughters joan and margaret tomkins in 1932 bainbridge developed a mass spectrometer with a resolving power of 600 and a relative precision of one part in 10 000 he used this instrument to verify albert einstein s mass energy equivalence e mc2 francis william aston wrote that in 1933 bainbridge was awarded a prestigious guggenheim fellowship which he used to travel to england and work at ernest rutherford s cavendish laboratory at cambridge university while there he continued his work developing mass spectrograph and became friends with british physicist john cockcroft when his guggenheim fellowship expired in september 1934 he returned to united states where he accepted an associate professorship at harvard university he started by building a new mass spectrograph that he had designed with at cavendish laboratory working with j curry street he commenced work on a cyclotron they had a design for a cyclotron provided by ernest lawrence but decided to build a cyclotron instead bainbridge was elected a fellow of american academy of arts and sciences in 1937 his interest in mass spectroscopy led naturally to an interest in relative abundance of isotopes discovery of nuclear fission in uranium 235 led to an interest in separating this isotope he proposed using a pump to produce vacuum necessary for this work and enlisted george b kistiakowsky and e bright wilson to help there was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere in 1943 their cyclotron was requisitioned by edwin mcmillan for use by u s army it was packed up and carted off to los alamos new mexico world war ii in september 1940 with world war ii raging in europe british tizard mission brought a number of new technologies to united states including a cavity magnetron a high powered device that generates microwaves using interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field this device which promised to revolutionize radar demolished any thoughts americans had entertained about their technological leadership alfred lee loomis of national defense research committee established radiation laboratory at massachusetts institute of technology to develop this radar technology in october bainbridge became one of first scientists to be recruited for radiation laboratory by ernest lawrence scientists divided up work between them bainbridge drew pulse modulators working with navy he helped develop high powered radars for warships thumb right video of trinity nuclear test in may 1943 bainbridge joined robert oppenheimer s project y at los alamos he initially led e 2 instrumentation group which developed x ray instrumentation for examining explosions in march 1944 he became head of a new group e 9 which was charged with conducting first nuclear test in oppenheimer s sweeping reorganization of los alamos laboratory in august 1944 e 9 group became x 2 on july 16 1945 bainbridge and his colleagues conducted trinity nuclear test my personal nightmare he later wrote was knowing that if bomb didn t go off or i as head of test would have to go to tower first and seek to find out what had gone wrong to his relief explosion of first atomic bomb went off without such drama in what he later described as a foul and awesome display he turned to oppenheimer and said now we are all sons of bitches bainbridge was relieved that trinity test had been a success relating in a 1975 bulletin of atomic scientists article i had a feeling of exhilaration that gadget had gone off properly followed by one of deep relief i wouldn t have to go to tower to see what had gone wrong for his work on manhattan project bainbridge received two letters of commendation from project s director major general leslie r groves jr he also received a presidential certificate of merit for his work at mit radiation laboratory postwar bainbridge returned to harvard after war and initiated construction of a 96 inch synchro cyclotron which has since been dismantled from 1950 to 1954 he chaired physics department at harvard during those years he drew ire of senator joseph mccarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia as chairman he was responsible for renovation of old jefferson physical laboratory and he established morris loeb lectures in physics he also devoted a good deal of his time to improving laboratory facilities for graduate students throughout 1950s bainbridge remained an outspoken proponent of civilian control of nuclear power and abandonment of nuclear testing in 1950 he was one of twelve prominent scientists who petitioned president harry s truman to declare that united states would never be first to use hydrogen bomb bainbridge retired from harvard in 1975 bainbridge s wife margaret died suddenly in january 1967 from a blood clot in a broken wrist he married helen brinkley king an editor at william morrow in new york city in october 1969 she died in february 1989 a scholarship was established at sarah lawrence college in her memory he died at his home in lexington massachusetts on july 14 1996 he was survived by his daughters from his first marriage joan bainbridge safford and margaret bainbridge robinson he was buried in abel s hill cemetery on martha s vineyard in a plot with his first wife margaret and his son martin his papers are in harvard university archives see also bainbridge mass spectrometer notes references category 1904 births category 1996 deaths category american nuclear physicists
