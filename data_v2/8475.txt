squadron s second in command rear admiral prince pavel ukhtomsky mclaughlin 2003 p 115 battle of port arthur after japanese victory in first sino japanese war of 1894 95 tensions had arisen between russia and japan over their ambitions to control both manchuria and korea a further issue was russian failure to withdraw its troops from manchuria in october 1903 as promised japan had begun negotiations to ease situation in 1901 but russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve problems japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete russian armament programs final straws were news of russian timber concessions in northern korea and russian refusal to acknowledge japanese interests in manchuria while continuing to place conditions on japanese activities in korea these led japanese government to decide in december 1903 that war was now inevitable pacific squadron began mooring in outer harbor at night as tensions with japan increased in order to react more quickly to any japanese attempt to land troops in korea westwood pp 15 21 on night of 8 9 february 1904 ijn launched a surprise attack on russian fleet at port arthur peresvet was not hit by initial torpedo boat incursion and sortied following morning when combined fleet commanded by vice admiral togo heihachiro attacked togo had expected surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was anticipating that russians would be badly disorganized and weakened but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his assault japanese vessels had been spotted by protected cruiser which was patrolling offshore and alerted russian defenses togo chose to attack russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage ships with his secondary guns splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as japanese and six inch guns inflicted inconsequential damage on russian ships which concentrated all their fire on their opponents with some effect forczyk pp 41 43 peresvet was hit three times with little effect during battle on 22 march peresvet joined several other battleships firing indirectly at japanese ships bombarding port arthur s harbor while training outside port arthur on 26 march she accidentally collided with battleship and sustained minor damage peresvet participated in action of 13 april when togo successfully lured out a portion of pacific squadron including vice admiral stepan makarov s flagship battleship when makarov spotted five japanese battleships he turned back for port arthur and petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by japanese previous night ship sank in less than two minutes following explosion of one of her magazines and makarov was one of 677 killed emboldened by his success togo resumed long range bombardment missions forczyk pp 45 46 two days later peresvet hit armored cruiser once as latter ship was bombarding port arthur peresvet sailed with rest of pacific squadron on 23 june in an abortive attempt to reach vladivostok new squadron commander rear admiral wilgelm vitgeft ordered squadron to return to port arthur when it encountered japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle warner warner pp 305 06 peresvet bombarded japanese

millimeter and four 37 millimeter guns mclaughlin 2003 pp 115 163 she was hit on 9 august by two shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of harbor but they caused only slight damage mclaughlin 2008 p 46 battle of yellow sea thumb left peresvet after having been scuttled japanese bombardment coupled with a direct order from tsar nicholas ii forced vitgeft to make an attempt to reach vladivostok squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to vladivostok in morning of 10 august at 12 25 it was spotted by japanese cruisers and intercepted by combined fleet in what became battle of yellow sea peresvet was fourth in line during battle forczyk p 48 and was not seriously damaged during early long range stage of action around 18 00 her topmasts were destroyed and two 12 inch shells from battleship penetrated conning tower of russian flagship killing vitgeft and helmsman severely wounding captain and causing ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn thinking that this was a maneuver planned by vitgeft russian battleline started to execute same turn causing all of ships directly behind tsesarevich including peresvet to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting stationary flagship as japanese ships continued to pound tsesarevich battleship followed shortly afterward by peresvet boldly charged togo s battleline in an attempt to divert japanese shellfire japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to oncoming ships badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away mclaughlin 2003 p 163 ukhtomsky signaled other russian ships to follow him back to port arthur but signal was hard to discern because flags had to be hung from bridge railings without topmasts and were only gradually recognized peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69 her forward 12 inch turret was knocked out and several hits near waterline caused flooding compartments of double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her

japanese troops attacked 203 hill which overlooked harbor peresvet battleship poltava and gunboat bombarded japanese positions to support successful defense of hill japanese began firing blindly into harbor on 30 september and hit peresvet with at least six and 4 7 inch shells she was struck once more following day on 2 october she was hit by nine shells that failed to penetrate her deck armor but did considerable damage to unprotected portions of ship japanese troops were able to seize hill 203 on 5 december this allowed imperial japanese army s siege guns to fire directly at russian ships and they hit peresvet many times russians scuttled her in shallow water on 7 december 1904 without however seriously damaging her possibly in hope of fooling japanese into switching targets japanese
