constantine first appears in sources in 904 during attempted flight of arab born eunuch samonas one of emperor s most trusted aides to syria constantine captured samonas at monastery of holy cross at siricha near river halys and escorted him back to constantinople where an enquiry into matter was held before senate leo who was still attached to his servant enjoined constantine to maintain that samonas had in fact been making a pilgrimage to shrine of siricha and not arab frontier when senators however asked constantine to verify truth of this claim by swearing on god and emperor s head he refused to hide truth samonas was punished by house arrest and although he was pardoned by leo after only four months and restored to his offices he had conceived a deep enmity towards doukai thumb

however managed to escape baghdad and was warmly welcomed back by leo in a ceremony in throne room of date of his return to byzantium is unclear but must be placed between ca 908 and ca 911 despite his father s revolt doukai remained very popular due to their military successes and prophecies apparently circulated that predicted constantine s rise to throne as a result according to theophanes continuatus leo warned young man from trying to become emperor but this is probably a later interpolation in view of constantine doukas eventual fate in reality leo seems to have trusted him for he showered him with gifts and appointed him to senior military positions initially he was named apparently in succession to eustathios argyros strategos of charsianon theme but by 913 he had risen to
