mantled guereza colobus guereza also known simply as guereza eastern black and white colobus or abyssinian black and white colobus is a black and white colobus a type of old world monkey it is native to much of west central and east africa including cameroon equatorial guinea nigeria ethiopia kenya tanzania uganda and chad species consists of several subspecies that differ in appearance it has a distinctive appearance which is alluded to in its name long white fringes of hair run along each side of its black trunk are known as a mantle its face is framed with white hair and it has a large white tail tuft mantled guereza is diurnal and arboreal found in both deciduous and evergreen forests it is an adaptable species that can cope with habitat disturbance and prefers secondary forest close to rivers or lakes although previously thought only to eat leaves it also eats seeds fruits and arthropods it is able to digest plant material with a high fibre content with its specialised stomach and may only eat from a few plant species at a time it is preyed on by birds of prey and some mammals such as common chimpanzee and leopard mantled guereza lives in social groups of three to fifteen individuals these groups normally include a dominant male several females and offspring of females it has a polygynous mating system and copulation is initiated with vocal communication after a gestation period of just over five months infants are born with pink skin and white fur which darkens to adult coloration by three to four months mantled guereza is well known for its dawn chorus males roar is a method of long distance communication that reinforces territorial boundaries it also makes other vocalization and uses body postures movements and facial expressions to communicate mantled guereza is listed as least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn because it is widespread although it is locally threatened in some areas decline is not great enough to list it in a higher category of threat however one subspecies found in kenya is listed as endangered it can survive well in degraded forests and in some areas it is more common in logged areas than unlogged ones mantled guereza is also threatened by hunting for bushmeat and for its skin etymology mantled guereza has many alternative common names including guereza eastern black and white colobus magistrate colobus or abyssinian black and white colobus name mantled refers to its mantle long silky white fringes of hair that run along its body and guereza is native name of monkey in ethiopia scientific name colobus derives from greek meaning mutilated which refers to its lack of thumbs discovery and taxonomic classification mantled guereza was discovered by eduard ruppell a german naturalist and explorer during his trip to abyssinia between 1830 and 1834 he wrote about species in neue con in 1835 it was first seen in europe in 1890 in berlin zoological garden when three individuals were purchased from a dealer from massawa eritrea thumb distribution map of subspecies of mantled guereza mantled guereza is in colobinae subfamily also known as leaf eating monkeys a group of old world monkeys from asia and africa this subfamily is split into three groups colobus monkeys of africa of which mantled guereza is a part langurs or leaf monkeys of asia and an odd nosed group african colobus monkeys are divided again by distinctions in color behavior and ecology three genera are black and white colobi red colobi and olive colobi there are three black and white colobi mantled guereza colobus guereza king colobus c and angola colobus c groves lists seven subspecies of mantled guereza in mammal species of world msw 2005 validity of djaffa mountain guereza c g gallarum is uncertain although not listed by groves in msw it is recognised in his 2007 colobinae review paper and by international union for conservation of nature iucn assessors and in 2008 western guereza colobus guereza occidentalis occurs from eastern nigeria cameroon and gabon at edge of its western range to south sudan and uganda west of nile omo river guereza or abyssinian black and white colobus c g guereza found in ethiopia in highlands west of rift valley down to reaches of awash river omo river and in blue nile gorge djaffa mountains guereza or neumann s black and white colobus c g gallarum found in ethiopian highlands east of rift valley dodinga hills guereza c g dodingae found in hills in south sudan mau forest guereza c g matschiei occurs from western kenya and uganda south

mount kenya and in aberdare range kilimanjaro guereza c g caudatus found in tanzania and kenya in forests surrounding mount kilimanjaro and mount meru morphological difference between subspecies is most pronounced between southeastern kilimanjaro guereza c g caudatus and northwestern western guereza c g occidentalis intermediate subspecies show a gradual change between two thumb captive mantled guerezas at ueno zoo in tokyo japan physical description thumb close up at binder park zoo in battle creek michigan thumb a skull at museum wiesbaden in wiesbaden germany mantled guereza has a distinctive pelage it is mostly black with long white fringes of silky hair known as a mantle or ornamentation along sides of its body and tail bands that make up mantle start at shoulders and extend along back until they connect at lower torso tail is long and ends in a white tuft which varies in how much it covers tail these features vary in color among subspecies for example tail of c g guereza is gray until white tail tuft which covers half of its length while tail tuft of c g caudatus makes up 80 of tail mantle color ranges from white to cream or yellow its face is framed by white hair and it has bushy cheek hairs thigh has a white stripe infants are born with pink skin and white hair hair and skin darken as they age and by three to four months they attain adult coloration male usually gain their coloration before females male typically weighs and female weighs between head and body length averages for males and for females like most colobi mantled guereza has a small thumb that is vestigial there is dentition sexual dimorphism among subspecies in some males have larger teeth than females in others reverse is true and some have no significant difference distribution and habitat thumb right mantled guerezas are arboreal and prefer secondary forests mantled guereza is distributed throughout equatorial africa it ranges from nigeria and cameroon in west to ethiopia kenya uganda and northern tanzania in east mantled guereza lives in both deciduous and evergreen forests it mainly inhabits forest and savannah woodlands and often extend into highland and montane forests natural history of african colobines pp 75 128 in davies and oates it can be found in other forest habitats both primary and secondary such as riparian near fresh or brackish water gallery and upland forests it is particularly common in forests close to rivers and lakes and at high elevations it can be found in elevations as high as this species prefers secondary forests and selects them over old growth forests if given choice it is likely that mantled guereza prefers these forests due to increased number of food trees and weaker chemical defenses of species within mantled guereza is sometimes found in swamps as well as human made habitats such as eucalyptus plantations which may be frequented when monkey has nutritional deficiencies ecology mantled guereza is primarily arboreal but does sometimes descend on ground to forage and travel perhaps more so than most other colobines it is diurnal and rests for up to half day foraging or travelling are next most common activity sometime after dawn mantled guereza groups leave their sleeping trees and will return to them at dusk during day mantled guereza has long rest periods in between periods of moving and feeding other activities including grooming greeting playing and being vigilant are performed to a lesser extent thumb diet of mantled guereza is predominantly leaves often of only a few tree species despite its reputation as an exclusive leaf eater mantled guereza is not an obligate while it mainly eats leaves and fruit its diet is quite variable it may eat bark wood seeds flowers petioles lianas aquatic plants arthropods soil and even concrete from buildings amount of each food item in its diet varies by area and time of year nutritional factors like protein tannins and sodium levels in leaves influence its food choices it may even intermittently travel longer distances to access plants with higher levels of nutrition leaves usually make up over half of its diet although fruits are occasionally eaten more depending on season when foraging for leaves mantled guereza prefers young ones over old with fleshy fruits mantled guereza prefers to eat them unripe which may serve to reduce competition with primates that eat ripe fruits it consumes a number of plant species but only some make up most of its diet at a specific site like all colobi mantled guereza is able to digest leaves and other plant fibers with a large multi chambered stomach that contains bacteria in certain areas diversity of living colobines pp 45 73 in davies and oates like most colobines it prefers foods with high fiber content that can be easily extracted with its specialized stomach mantled guereza is mostly preyed on by crowned hawk eagle but it is also eaten by other birds of prey such as verreaux s eagle common chimpanzee is known to hunt guereza leopard is another possible predator behaviour social structure thumb left upright social grooming or allogrooming mainly occurs between females and is an important social interaction in mantled guereza groups mantled guereza lives in stable social groups usually containing three to fifteen members groups usually contain one male several females and juveniles in some populations groups containing several males are common in multi male groups males tend to be aggressive with one another with one being dominant some males may be expelled from these groups multi male groups may contain father son pairs or unrelated males males that are not part of groups either live solitarily or with other outside males in bachelor groups females keep groups cohesive and they are related they rarely disperse from their natal groups except possibly when they break apart males on other hand usually leave when they become subadults or adults they may start out being solitary and or in bachelor groups they gain entry into a social group either by being on periphery or displacing a group male because of its low quality diet and dispersed distribution of its food mantled guereza has a resident egalitarian social structure female guerezas living in a group often have an egalitarian dominance style with no formalized rank relations relationships are relaxed and friendly with rare signals of dominance or physical aggression within group is usually not harmful and rarely escalates into a conflict allogrooming is an important part of mantled guereza interactions and mostly occurs between females adult males rarely groom in groups while not strictly territorial mantled guereza groups can be aggressive towards each other in some populations groups may defend core areas which exist as a small part of home range resources and mates during intergroup encounters males can engage in direct or indirect mate defense like defending a female s resources it is males that participate in agonistic inter group encounters but female may do so as well aggressive encounters between groups usually involve chases displays and vocalizations rather than physical contact reproduction and parenting thumb upright infants are born with white fur and are always carried during first months of their life mantled guereza has a polygynous harem based mating system mating solicitations are made by both males and females half of time for each to solicit mating mantled guereza will walk near its potential partner and make low intensity mouth clicks or tough smacks during copulation males hold on female s ankles and body harris t r 2005 roaring intergroup aggression and feeding competition in black and white colobus monkeys colobus guereza at national park uganda ph d thesis yale university most matings take place between individuals of same group but copulations outside of group have been recorded in multi male groups more than one male may mate with females gestation period lasts 158 days with a 16 22 month interbirth interval newborn guereza relies on its mother for support and must cling to her as they grow older infants can move on their own but keep returning to their mothers infants take up most of attention in groups other females in a group may handle an infant although latter are only comfortable with their mothers males normally don t pay much attention to infants until they are four to five weeks old infants can eat solid food at about eight to nine weeks and by fifty weeks they are fully weaned and no longer need to hold on to their mothers communication most notable vocalization of mantled guereza is roar which is made mainly at night or dawn by males sound of a roar can be carried for up to a mile it is normally dominant male who roars when there are multiple males in group roars are used for long distance communication and can regulate inter group spacing without direct physical contact while foraging when one male starts roaring neighboring males will start to roar as well often mantled guereza will respond to calls regardless of caller identity focusing more on collective vocal displays and not familiarity of caller there is variation in roars of males which could signal status of their group and fighting ability with a roar a male can advertise his body size both actual and exaggerated other vocalizations are made as well males may snort possibly as an alarm call purrs are made before group movements females and infants may caw when under mild distress when in more serious distress like if an infant is in danger females and sub adults will squeak or scream tongue clicking is made during mild aggression in addition to vocalizations mantled guereza communicates with several different body postures and movements displaying of fringe fur facial expressions and touches conservation status thumb upright mantled guereza is hunted for its skin and meat because it can live in both dry and gallery forests and move on ground mantled guereza is less threatened than many other colobine species conclusions past present and future of colobines pp 347 358 in davies and oates iucn lists it as least concern because although locally threatened in parts of its range this widespread species is not thought to be declining fast enough to place it in a higher category of threat however some of subspecies are classified under different categories mt uaraguess guereza c g percivali is listed as endangered due to its small range and its risk from hunting while dodinga hills guereza c g dodingae djaffa mountains guereza c g gallarum and mau forest guereza c g matschiei are all listed as data deficient dodinga hills guereza hasn t been recorded since 1960s unlike most other primate species mantled guereza can survive habitat degradation and can even thrive in degraded forests sometimes logging may increase number of preferred food trees for mantled guereza and it is more abundant in logged areas than unlogged ones however complete forest clearance causes dramatic declines in numbers in uganda complete forest clearings caused a decline of 50 over eight years mantled guereza is also threatened by hunting for meat and its skin mantled guereza meat sells as bushmeat for 4 9 us skins have been sold for fashion or in tourist trade references cited sources
