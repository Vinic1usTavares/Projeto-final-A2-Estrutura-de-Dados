skaugum tunnel is a long railway tunnel in asker norway on asker line tunnel runs between asker station and solstad and was built as part of first stage of asker line between asker and sandvika construction started in february 2002 and tunnel opened on 27 august 2005 tunnel was built by mika for norwegian national rail administration using drilling and blasting method with one crosscut during construction there was one blasting accident since tunnel opened there have been problems with leaks damaging infrastructure tunnel has double track is electrified and allows for a maximum speed of cost to build tunnel excluding infrastructure was 450 million norwegian krone nok tunnel has accelerated intercity and regional traffic west of oslo and freed up capacity for oslo commuter rail on old drammen line toc specifications skaugum tunnel is a long tunnel with a cross section varying between it carries double tracked asker line between asker station and solstad tunnel runs mostly through cambrian silurian sedimentary slate nodular limestone and shale with local occurrences of permian igneous rock line is electrified at and allows for maximum speeds of tunnel has frost isolation into tunnel from each end and frost fans which ensure that air stays put in middle of tunnel to hinder cold air from reaching in past frost isolation history thumb left map of railways west of oslo with asker line in red and drammen line in black skaugum tunnel is dotted red line to left asker line runs from lysaker station via sandvika station to asker station in municipalities of baerum and asker line was built to increase traffic on west corridor traditionally only railway west of oslo was drammen line which has limited capacity and a mix of local regional intercity and freight trains this caused many delays and poor utilization of tracks as some trains make many stops and others only a few asker line allows regional and intercity trains to by pass local stations east of asker by running local trains and freight trains on drammen line while faster trains run on new track asker line was built in two stages first from asker to sandvika was built from 2001 to 2005 and second stage from sandvika to lysaker between 2007 and 2011 other two tunnels on asker line are long tanum tunnel and long baerum tunnel work on geological surveys in area started prior to 2001 with surveys being performed by geological survey of norway contract to build tunnel and all other earthwork on section from solstad to was awarded to mika with tunneling costing nok 425 million tunnel was built using drilling and blasting method using two points of entry entrance on asker side and from a crosscut at skaugum work started in february 2002 and was concluded in may 2005 construction involved blasting of earthwork and drilling of holes for pre injection construction used of gunite of concrete 24 000 bolts of water and frost protection of noise and frost isolation and of cable conduit near entrance at asker tunnel is closest to surface and is between below basements of residential houses during construction of this part construction was as slow as per week of which half time was used for injections to choke tunnel during construction there was an accident where a worker driving a wheeled loader was only from a blasting he became disabled but did not receive any compensation because he was working for contractor as a sole proprietor not as a wage earner norwegian labour inspection authority criticized mika for improper safety routines and required them to improve them but concluded that no criminal offenses had been committed a concern from people living along tunnel was that they would be subject to low frequency noise originally municipalities of asker and baerum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel a weighting dba but national rail administration appealed requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dba in march 2004 a test was done in tunnel to insure that requirements would be met as low frequency sound is difficult to predict measurements after opening of tunnel showed background noise of 30 dba that no one was subject to 32 dba or higher and that it was nearly impossible to measure passing of trains among major concerns were leaks during construction on romerike tunnel there was a one year delay and severe cost overruns due to improper construction methods one of main aims in skaugum tunnel project was therefore to avoid similar leaks and criteria were set to per minute per this was achieved by using sufficient time for pre injection as well as continuous through entire tunnel however water still dripped into tunnel which caused several types of damage in some places it dripped onto track causing it to rust while in other places it fell onto electrical equipment there were also issues with water running down walls and collecting in cable conduit and limestone in water mixing with ballast by 2011 emergency lighting system had to be replaced because of high humidity national rail administration has stated that savings made by specifications in water and frost protection methods have caused high maintenance costs because small leaks which are present have done a lot of harm in addition areas with leaks suffer from icing this has been part of a trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance free while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs laying of tracks signaling power supply and other infrastructure was done by baneservice cost for entire section from asker to sandvika was nok 70 million work was done in february and march 2005 opening of tunnel and rest of section from asker to sandvika took place on 27 august 2005 references category railway
