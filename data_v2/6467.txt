and other americans americans worked on sonic spinball while japanese developed sonic hedgehog 3 yuji naka and hirokazu yasuhara were primary creators of sonic 3 design document and project schedule naka selected majority of team while sti director roger hector oversaw development development began in january 1993 with a deadline of february 1994 when sega and mcdonald s would launch a major promotional campaign initially team used new sega virtua processor svp chip allowing for 3d graphics they created a prototype with isometric graphics with working title sonic 3d original special stage featured a polygonal sonic in a figure eight shaped stage however when it became apparent that svp would not be finished by 1994 sonic 3 was restarted from scratch as a more conventional 2d platform game isometric concept was eventually used for sonic 3d blast in 1996 according to naka team felt that they needed a deeper story to expand world of sonic which made project huge thus levels are triple size of those in sonic 2 many elements were conceived during development of sonic 2 but deferred to sonic 3 sonic 3 and sonic knuckles were originally planned as a single game however time was limited and manufacturing costs of a 34 megabit knuckles genesis eu instruction manual p 4 with would have been prohibitively expensive due to game s scope and impending mcdonald s promotion team reluctantly split it in half allowing more time to develop second part and splitting cost between two cartridges sonic knuckles cartridge s lock on technology was implemented so sonic 3 could be experienced as intended sonic 3 features debut of sonic s rival knuckles echidna numerous designs for character were submitted chosen design was submitted by takashi yuda yuda envisioned him as a supporting character for sonic and felt he would make a good playable character whereas sonic symbolizes speed knuckles symbolizes power and emphasis of character was to break walls his shoe coloration was inspired by jamaica s flag original name for character was referring to his dreadlocks design was tested with focus groups of american children hector said sonic 3 had a troubled development he recalled having to prevent rest of sega from bothering team while simultaneously making sure game would be finished in time additionally hector struggled to balance resources between sonic 3 and other projects naka was sometimes seen as a harsh leader and sti staff not on sonic 3 team became jealous of high priority given to game music thumb 259x259px michael jackson composed portions of sonic 3 soundtrack but went uncredited according to some involved in development in 2005 hector stated that sega hired american pop musician michael jackson a fan of series to compose music for sonic 3 according to hector jackson s involvement was terminated following first allegations of sexual abuse against him his music had been already been implemented and had to be quickly reworked by howard drossin website of musician jones who contributed music to sonic 3 under name scirocco credits himself along with jackson and jackson collaborator brad buxer for musical cues for levels 2 3 of sonic hedgehog sonic co creator naoto ohshima said jackson recorded an a cappella demo tape for game but that sega was unable to use compositions due to various incidents he added that sega probably still had demo tape in a 2009 interview with french magazine black white buxer stated that jackson had been involved with some sonic 3 compositions but chose to remain uncredited because he was unhappy with sound capabilities of genesis he also said that sonic 3 credits music became basis for jackson s 1996 single stranger in moscow in 2013 fans discovered that musical theme for icecap zone closely resembles a previously unreleased 1982 track hard times by for which buxer was keyboardist and co songwriter an anonymous source involved in development told gametrailers that jackson s contributions remained such as in theme for carnival night zone and that jackson had chosen to remain uncredited in 2019 gamerevolution alex donaldson noted that sonic 3 had been rereleased less frequently since jackson s death in 2009 and speculated that this was due to legal problems with his estate sega staff including senior producer mike latham marketing director al nilsen sonic 3 marketing director pam kelly and sega of america president tom kalinske stated that any involvement of jackson was arranged without their knowledge and that no contracts nor formal agreements were made in 2013 hector stated that any similarities to jackson s music in sonic 3 were unintentional journalist ken horowitz raised questions about jackson s alleged involvement such as how an agreement between sega and jackson could have been kept secret from media why sega s marketing never mentioned jackson s involvement and why jackson would reuse music originally composed for a video game other tracks were composed by sega sound staff including jun senoue who became a regular composer for series some tracks were replaced in 1997 windows port sonic knuckles collection these tracks also appear in a sonic 3 prototype discovered in 2019 suggesting that they were written for genesis before being replaced by jackson s music release sonic 3 was released in north america on february 2 1994 in

knuckles reception genesis version of sonic 3 is one of bestselling genesis games selling 1 02 million copies in united states like its predecessors sonic 3 received critical acclaim it holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator gamerankings based on five reviews critics generally felt sonic 3 was best game in series so far andrew humphreys of hyper who declared himself not a sonic fan said it was undoubtedly best of series including acclaimed but obscure sonic cd though he admitted having preferred sonic 2 special stages by a small margin sega magazine however stated that sonic 3 has better special stages and was not only superior to sonic 2 as a whole but would be a serious contender for best platform game ever award sega power wrote that despite their skepticism they found it excellent and easily most explorable and playable in series electronic gaming monthly also compared sonic 3 favorably to sonic 1 2 and cd and awarded it their game of month award they later ranked it number 1 in egm hot 50 indicating that it received highest average score of any game they had reviewed in past year lucas m thomas of ign stated that sonic 3 completed trilogy as best of them all dan whitehead of eurogamer however considered sonic knuckles superior lionel vilner of generation 4 believed sonic 3 offered more challenge than its predecessors unknown gamer of gamepro proclaimed that it proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks take that old sonic magic add fun new variations and you have another spectacular game some critics felt that sonic 3 had innovated too little from previous sonic games humphreys of hyper saw only a few new features while sega power thought it was not all that different and nintendo life writer damien mcferran said that there s not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank while deniz ahmet of computer and video games agreed that game was more of same he was placated by new and imaginative ideas frank provo of gamespot stated that most significant addition was its save system however he and electronic gaming monthly also both enjoyed new power ups many aspects of level design were praised electronic gaming monthly and sega power enjoyed expansive stages secret areas much less linear level design and difficulty mean machines agreed describing game as a rollercoaster ride from start to finish and listing carnival night as their favorite level which they described as probably most slickly programmed portion of game in megadrive history humphreys and mean machines felt that game was too short but they and sega magazine felt that its two player mode and emerald collecting would significantly extend replay value on other hand whitehead said that large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed sega magazine also enjoyed having ability to play as knuckles in two player mode unknown gamer felt that while two player mode was less fun than main game it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to change of format from split screen to full screen visuals were very well received humphreys described sonic 3 as one of most beautiful games around and full of flashy new visual tricks highlighting sonic s ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive sega magazine exclaimed that its graphics were brilliant even for a sonic game while provo praised elaborate backgrounds mean machines thought similarly giving special praise to camera s quick scrolling diversity of level themes and more detailed overall aesthetic rik skews of computer and video games stated that graphics were stunning attention to detail is breathtaking ahmet of same publication also noted that graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments unknown gamer described settings as having gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats and was impressed by new obstacles that sonic can traverse at top speeds thomas and provo especially enjoyed use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect zones mcferran however felt that visuals had been downgraded particularly sonic s sprite and infamous dotty textures sound effects and music were also well received though somewhat less so than visuals sega magazine described them as brilliant and far superior to sonic 2 mean machines stated that every level had great tunes and sound effects and particularly praised ending music however humphreys described sound as with emphasis on icky he also found it strikingly similar to first two sonic games soundtracks unknown gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments and described individual tracks as catchy until you ve heard it a hundred times thomas thought music was impressive but not quite on par with sonic 2 reviews of ports have been slightly less positive xbox 360 release has scores of 78 and 79 at gamerankings and metacritic respectively some critics such as adam ghiggino of palgn felt sonic 3 had been insufficiently upgraded for re releases whitehead of eurogamer wished online co op had been implemented provo of gamespot and thomas of ign wished sega had re released sonic 3 and sonic knuckles
