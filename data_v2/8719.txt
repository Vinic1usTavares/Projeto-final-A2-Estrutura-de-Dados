difference between this series and law order and law order special victims unit by scrutinizing motive and intent criminal intent utilizes a more personal style that sets it apart from its brethren wolf s characters are notoriously devoid of detailed personal lives but debut episode hints at a little more introspection on part of characters in entertainment weekly ken tucker wrote that law order criminal intent was best series of year from law order franchise and that while law order suffered from tired wooden performances from actors with poor chemistry acting on law order criminal intent was at other end of spectrum both writers commented on overpowering screen presence that d onofrio commands in first episode criminal intent so far is a one man show with vincent d onofrio at its center he commands most attention tending to overshadow erbe who is reduced in pilot to following goren with an awe struck look wrote fries while tucker also stated d onofrio is so eccentrically entertaining even his costar kathryn erbe seems fascinated but complained that erbe s role was smaller than d onofrio s which jibes with subtle range she showed on hbo s oz and proves her professional generosity he also said sheridan is similarly nonplussed and under utilized but vance is terrific as carver who makes defendants wither in face of his elegantly reasoned cross examinations law order criminal intents first season received four nominations from three award ceremonies faithful and smothered were given commendations at prism awards in category for best tv drama series episode vance
