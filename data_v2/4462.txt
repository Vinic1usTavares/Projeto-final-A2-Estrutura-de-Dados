embassy his advisors sent him to antioch to be educated in court of tancred of antioch ending hostilities between two crusader states tancred granted four important fortresses to pons in principality of antioch since pons held his inherited lands in fief of kings of jerusalem tancred s grant strengthened autonomy of county of tripoli on his deathbed tancred also arranged marriage of his wife cecile of france to pons pons closely cooperated with tancred s successor roger of salerno against muslim rulers in 1110s he refused obedience to baldwin ii of jerusalem in early 1122 but their

of antioch against her brother in law fulk king of jerusalem in late 1132 but they could not prevent him from taking control of antioch a year later pons was only able to defend his county against

native christians captured pons his captors handed him over to bazwaj who had him killed county of tripoli developed into a fully independent crusader state during pons reign early life pons father bertrand was eldest son of raymond iv count of toulouse bertrand s legitimacy was dubious however because his parents were closely related identity of pons mother is uncertain contemporaneous english chronicler orderic vitalis stated that helie of burgundy a daughter of odo i duke of burgundy was his mother william of malmesbury however wrote that pons had been born to an unnamed niece of powerful matilda of tuscany year of pons birth is also uncertain contemporaneous muslim author ibn al qalanisi noted that pons was a small boy when his father died in early 1112 william of malmesbury and william of tyre wrote that pons had been an adolescent when he succeeded his father according to historian kevin james lewis available information suggests pons was born around 1098 pons grandfather raymond iv was first prominent nobleman to join first crusade in 1095 his attempts to secure supreme command of military campaign failed neither could he keep fortresses that he conquered from local muslim rulers in northern syria in 1098 northern syria developed into a crusader state principality of antioch under rule of raymond s rivals norman bohemond and tancred unlike bohemond and tancred raymond accepted byzantine emperor alexios i komnenos s suzerainty and acted as emperor s lieutenant but byzantines could not put an end to normans rule in northern syria after crusaders captured jerusalem raymond refused to rule holy city thus a new crusader state kingdom of jerusalem developed in palestine under rule of two brothers from lower lorraine godfrey of bouillon and baldwin of boulogne or baldwin i raymond iv laid siege to tripoli an important economic and cultural center on northern border of fatimid caliphate with byzantine support in may 1103 although he adopted title of count of tripoli and took control of nearby villages he died on 28 february 1105 without conquering town raymond s troops continued siege but his infant son alfonso jordan was taken back to county of toulouse pons father bertrand renounced toulouse in favor of alfonso jordan for unknown reasons in summer of 1108 he soon sailed to syria to claim lands his father had conquered around tripoli he swore allegiance to baldwin i of jerusalem to secure his support and united armies of crusader states captured tripoli on 12 july 1109 pons most probably had accompanied his father from toulouse to syria he signed one of bertrand s charters issued in tripoli in 1110 or 1111 reign minority right thumb alt a ruined tower made of stone fortress of safita granted to pons by tancred of antioch pons was a minor when his father died on 3 february 1112 anna comnena recorded that bishop albert of tripoli wanted to keep money that a byzantine embassy had deposited with pons father and himself lewis says dispute is evidence bishop exerted a strong influence on government during pons minority money was returned to byzantines only after they had threatened to impose a blockade on tripoli pons could only keep gold and other valuable objects explicitly promised to his father as personal gifts byzantines also persuaded pons to swear fealty to alexios i komnenos as his grandfather and father had done his guardians and lords concluded an agreement with tancred of antioch making pons one of tancred s knights according to ibn al qalanisi historian jean richard associated guardians and lords with most influential noblemen of county of tripoli who ruled county on minor count s behalf their decision helped to reconcile antioch s norman and tripoli s occitan crusaders who had fallen out during siege of antioch conflict with byzantines also contributed to rapprochement between tripoli and antioch tancred granted tortosa now tartus in syria safita and hisn al had been claimed by counts of pons in fief pons held his inherited lands in fief of kings of jerusalem tancred s grant contributed to development of tripoli into an autonomous crusader state he died in december 1112 but only after ordering his wife cecile of france be engaged to pons william of malmesbury wrote that dying prince arranged marriage because he was convinced that pons would be a successful military leader pons remained in antioch during first months or years of rule of tancred s successor roger of salerno baldwin i of jerusalem sent envoys to antioch to seek assistance of roger and pons against seljuk atabeg governor of mosul who had invaded kingdom of jerusalem in late june 1113 however baldwin did not wait until their arrival and attacked invaders near tiberias his army was defeated on 28 june pons accompanied roger during campaign and they sharply criticized baldwin for his impatience after their arrival cooperation walter chancellor of antioch who wrote a chronicle of history of principality never refers to pons presence in antioch this implies he had reached age of majority and returned to tripoli before 29 november 1114 which is starting date of walter s narration pons was certainly in tripoli when bursuq ibn bursuq of hamadan invaded antioch in 1115 because roger of salerno sent envoys from antioch to tripoli to seek his assistance walter of chancellor recorded that pons marched north to aid roger only after baldwin ii of jerusalem had ordered him to join his campaign this shows that pons still acknowledged suzerainty of king after their united armies reached apamea bursuq lifted siege of antiochene fort of kafartab and retreated without fighting baldwin and pons soon returned to their countries enabling bursuq to return and capture kafartab roger of salerno attacked invaders before baldwin and pons returned and defeated bursuq on 14 september ilghazi ortoquid ruler of mardin invaded antioch at end of may 1119 bernard latin patriarch of antioch convinced roger to again seek help from baldwin ii and pons however roger could not wait until their arrival he launched a counter attack against ilghazi leading his principality s whole army roger died fighting and his army was annihilated on 28 june ilghazi tried to prevent baldwin and pons from reaching antioch but baldwin entered town without resistance pons who arrived a day later warded off ilghazi s attack in early august baldwin was acknowledged as ruler of antioch until its absent prince bohemond ii came of age conflicts and alliances baldwin s acquisition of antioch made him most powerful monarch of crusader states which annoyed pons neither pons nor bishops of his county attended synod which was held on 23 january 1120 at nablus although all prelates and secular lords of kingdom of jerusalem were present at assembly he openly refused obedience to king in early 1122 baldwin mustered his army and marched towards tripoli taking true cross from jerusalem with him according to fulcher of chartres report to avoid an armed conflict two rulers vassals mediated a reconciliation making baldwin and pons friends balak ortoquid ruler of harran captured baldwin ii of jerusalem while baldwin was hunting near euphrates on 18 april 1123 during his captivity a venetian fleet under command of doge domenico michele arrived at acre taking advantage of presence of a sizeable army from europe leaders of kingdom of jerusalem decided to capture tyre one of last of two fatimid ports on western coast of mediterranean sea they laid siege to town on 16 february 1124 jerusalemite nobles sent envoys to pons urging him to join siege pons hurried to town accompanied by a large retinue damaging self confidence of town s defenders according to william of tyre although fulcher of chartres and william of tyre emphasized that pons remained always obedient to latin patriarch of jerusalem and other jerusalemite lords during siege their narration is actually evidence that pons was regarded as one of supreme commanders of christian army he led christian troops successful attack against toghtekin emir of damascus who tried to relieve besieged town he was chosen to confer knighthood on messenger of joscelin i of edessa who had brought severed head of balak baldwin s captor to crusaders camp after capture of tyre on 7 july pons banner was one of three flags erected over town s towers balak s relative released baldwin ii in return for 80 000 dinars and antiochene fortresses on 29 july but antiochene lords prevented baldwin from ceding fortresses to him pons activities in late 1120s and early 1130s are poorly documented he supported baldwin ii against bursuq ibn bursuq who had invaded antiochene territory and captured fortress of kafartab in may 1125 united forces of jerusalem antioch tripoli and edessa defeated bursuq at on 11 june forcing him to lift siege of fort next year he sought help from king in attacking rafaniya an important castle once held by pons grandfather but lost to toghtekin in 1115 they besieged fortress for 18 days and captured it on 31 march 1126 pons also participated in an unsuccessful campaign against damascus in november 1129 sedition right thumb alt four crusader states along coast of mediterranean sea and between rivers euphrates and tigris crusader states in 1135 relationships between crusader states became tense after baldwin ii died on 21 august 1131 his successor fulk of anjou seized estates of local lords in both jerusalem and antioch and granted them to his own partisans his sister in law alice dowager princess of antioch wanted to take control of government of antioch she formed an alliance with pons and joscelin ii of edessa in summer of 1132 according to william of tyre alice bribed pons into alliance antiochene lords who opposed alice asked fulk to intervene but pons refused king passage through tripoli fulk was forced to avoid county and travel by sea to antiochene port of saint symeon now in turkey pons hurried to antioch and launched a series of attacks against fulk and his allies from antiochene fortresses chastel rouge and arzghan two castles forming his wife s dowry he captured fort at salamiyah fulk attacked pons near chastel rouge in late 1132 pons suffered a heavy defeat although many of his retainers were captured on battlefield he was able to flee his soldiers were taken in chains to antioch where they were either imprisoned or executed pons lost chastel rouge and arzghan but fulk did not restore suzerainty of kings of jerusalem over tripoli last years pons renounced estates he held in county of velay in france in favor of bishop of le puy in 1132 he had ra is native chief of tripoli murdered for unknown reasons in 1132 or 1133 execution of a native chief at a crusader ruler s order was an unprecedented act lewis argues that it was a sign of growing unrest among local population actually nizari strengthened their hold on mountainous region along northern border of county in 1130s imad ad din zengi atabeg governor of mosul invaded county of tripoli plundering capital and neighboring region in 1133 pons wanted to stop invaders near rafaniya but his army was almost annihilated after this catastrophic defeat he fled first to montferrand and soon to tripoli while zengi laid siege to fort of montferrand pons sought fulk s assistance and arrival of jerusalemite army forced zengi to lift siege and to withdraw his troops from county in march 1137 bazwaj mamluk commander of damascus launched a military campaign against tripoli reaching pilgrims mount near town pons rode out of tripoli to meet enemy but suffered a defeat he fled to nearby mountains but local christians according to lewis most probably jacobites or captured and handed him over to bazwaj who had him killed on 25 march 1137 his son raymund who inherited county of tripoli and his retainers captured local christians from nearby villages and had most of them tortured to death in revenge for raymond s death family according to albert of aix pons married tancred of antioch s widow cecile of france in presence of baldwin i of jerusalem in tripoli in summer of 1115 being a daughter of philip i of france and de montfort she was half sister of fulk of jerusalem pons prestigious marriage strengthened his position and his descendants royal ancestry was a well known fact in crusader states for decades eldest son of pons and cecile raymund was most probably born in late 1110s because he was an adolescent at least fifteen year old when he succeeded pons in 1137 pons younger son philip was last mentioned in 1140s but details of his life are unknown agnes only daughter of pons and cecile was married to rainald ii masoir who was a prominent antiochene
