thumb a contemporary mari lwyd 300px mari lwyd is a wassailing folk custom found in south wales tradition entails use of an eponymous hobby horse which is made from a horse s skull mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth it represents a regional variation of a hooded animal tradition that appears throughout great britain custom was first recorded in 1800 with subsequent accounts of it being produced into early twentieth century according to these mari lwyd was a tradition performed at christmas time by groups of men they would form into teams to accompany horse on its travels around local area and although makeup of such groups varied they typically included an individual to carry horse a leader and individuals dressed as stock characters such as punch and judy team would carry mari lwyd to local houses where they would request entry through medium of song householders would be expected to deny them entry again through song and two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner if householders eventually relented then team would be permitted entry and given food and drink although custom was given various names it was best known as mari lwyd etymology of this term remains subject of academic debate folklorist iorwerth c peate believed that term meant holy mary and thus was a reference to mary mother of jesus while fellow folklorist e c cawte thought it more likely that term had originally meant grey mare thus referring to heads equine appearance a number of earlier folklorists to examine topic such as peate and ellen ettlinger believed that tradition had once been a pre christian religious rite although scholarly support for this interpretation has declined amid a lack of supporting evidence absence of late medieval references to such practices and geographic dispersal of various british hooded animal traditions among them hoodening of kent broad of cotswolds and old ball old tup and old horse of northern england have led to suggestions that they derive from regionalised popularisation of sixteenth and seventeenth century fashion for hobby horses among social elite although tradition declined in early to mid twentieth century in part due to opposition from some local christian clergy and changing social conditions it was revived in new forms in mid to latter part of century tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions appearing for instance in work of painter clive hicks jenkins and poet vernon watkins description thumb upright a mari lwyd during a celebration in 2006 mari lwyd itself consists of a horse s skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole to back of skull is attached a white sheet which drapes down to conceal both pole and individual carrying this device on occasion horse s head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper in some instances horse s jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into eye sockets of some examples representing eyes an observer of tradition as it was performed at llangynwyd during nineteenth century noted that preparation for activity was a communal event with many locals involving themselves in decorating of mari lwyd mari lwyd custom was performed during winter festivities specifically around dates of christmas and new year however precise date on which custom was performed varied between villages and in a number of cases custom was carried out for several consecutive nights there is a unique example provided by an account from gower in which head was kept buried throughout year only being dug up for use during christmas season custom used to begin at dusk and often lasted late into night mari lwyd party consisted of four to seven men who often had coloured ribbons and rosettes attached to their clothes and sometimes wore a broad sash around waist there was usually a smartly dressed leader who carried a staff stick or whip and sometimes other stock characters such as merryman who played music and punch and judy both played by men with blackened faces often brightly dressed punch carried a long metal fire iron and judy had a besom mari lwyd party would approach a house and sing a song in which they requested admittance inhabitants of house would then offer excuses for why team could not enter party would sing a second verse and debate between two sides known as pwnco would continue until house s inhabitants ran out of ideas at which time they were obliged to allow party entry and to provide them with ale and food an account from described such a performance in which punch and judy characters would cause a noise with punch tapping ground to rhythm of music and rapping on door with a poker while judy brushed ground house walls and windows with a broom householders had to make punch promise that he would not touch their fireplace before he entered building otherwise it was local custom that before he left he would rake out fire with his poker in case from llangynwyd however there was no interplay between householders and troupe but rather latter were typically granted entry automatically after singing first verse of their song once inside entertainment continued with mari lwyd running around neighing and snapping its jaws creating havoc frightening children and perhaps even adults while leader pretended to try to restrain it merryman played music and entertained householders folklorist iorwerth peate believed that in recorded examples from glamorgan it was apparent that mari lwyd custom had become indistinguishable from practice of wassailing although added that there were still some examples of wassailing that did not involve mari lwyd he added that links between mari lwyd and wassailing were also apparent from recorded examples in other part of wales thus opining that mari lwyd represented a variant of wider wassailing custom that was found throughout britain early development etymology thumb right at chepstow mari lwyd 2014 most recorded sources term this particular custom mari lwyd jones considered this to be a translation of blessed mary and thus a reference to mary mother of jesus a key religious figure in catholic church although translating it slightly differently as holy mary peate endorsed this viewpoint although some of his acquaintances later suggested that use of mari for mary was unknown in wales prior to protestant reformation he countered these criticisms with observation that term mari was being used in reference to virgin in mid 14th century black book of carmarthen thus attesting to its early usage in welsh he nevertheless accepted that during medieval period term might have been restricted largely to poets given that there is no evidence of its usage among common dialect in this period given that llwyd is usual word for grey in welsh language and that welsh speakers would have been exposed to english word mare an alternative suggestion considered by peate was that term mari lwyd had originally meant grey mare this etymological explanation would have parallels with name of a similar hooded horse tradition found in ireland and isle of man which is known in irish as lair and in manx as vane in both cases meaning white mare initially believing that there is much to be said for this suggestion peate later embraced it fully cawte similarly believed that grey mare was most likely original meaning of term noting that mari lwyd appeared to represent a horse and that similar hobby horse customs in neighbouring england such as hoodening tradition of east kent also made reference to horses with their name peate suggested that even if term mari lwyd had originally referred to a grey mare it could still have come to be associated with mary in popular folk culture following reformation thus explaining why mary is referred to in lyrics of some surviving welsh wassailing songs a further suggestion is that mari lwyd derives from english term merry lude referring to a merry game peate opposed this idea arguing that if latter was converted into welsh then result would be merri or merri peate also dismissed idea that had been suggested to him that term mari in this context had derived from morris a reference to morris dance another reason to doubt this idea is that there is no known historical link between mari lwyd which was found in south wales and morris dance which was concentrated in north of country in other recorded instances mary lwyd custom is given different names with it being recorded as y wassail in parts of carmarthenshire in first half of 19th century it was recorded in pembrokeshire under name of y march horse and y canvas horse one account from west glamorgan has head termed aderyn bee bi y llwyd meaning grey magpie although this may be due to an error on part of recorder who could have confused horse s head for aderyn pica llwyd an artificial bird in a tree that was carried by wassailers in same area origins positing custom to be survival of some ancient popular rite or ceremony in 1888 david jones suggested that its origins were christian and that it had once been part of festivities of feast of ass a commemoration of flight into egypt of mary and saint joseph that was historically marked on 14 january according to jones idea mari lwyd itself represented donkey on which mary rode during story peate was of opinion that mari lwyd was no doubt a survival of a pre christian tradition that had once been spread across britain and other parts of europe and which having survived christianisation of britain had been renamed mari lwyd in reference to virgin mary during middle ages he expressed view that original custom had been horrific in origin and intention and that from an early date it had been connected to wassailing cawte concurred that it was reasonable to accept that mari lwyd head had become attached to an independent wassailing tradition but said that connection to virgin mary was unnecessary pearce also suggested possibility that in parts of glamorgan and monmouthshire mari lwyd tradition came under influence of mystery plays thus explaining why later recorded examples from those counties contained characters known as sergeant and merryman thumb left a mari lwyd at 2013 st david s day festivities in los angeles folklorist m owen also suggested that mari lwyd was a practice which probably had a religious if pre christian origin adding that by time it had been recorded it had become emptied of its religious content also embracing peate s suggestion of ancient origins ellen ettlinger believed that mari lwyd represented a death horse as symbolised by white cloth worn by its carrier suggesting that it was originally employed in a pre christian ritual to mark festival of samhain folklorist christina hole suggested that this ancient character was once a bringer of fertility however after 1970 folkloric trend for interpreting such hobby horse traditions as pre christian survivals had ended as scholars came to express greater caution about proposing origins for such customs mari lwyd was part of a wider hooded animal tradition that folklorist e c cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of britain features common to these customs were use of a hobby horse performance at christmas time a song or spoken statement requesting payment and use of a team who included a man dressed in women s clothing a related example is hoodening custom of east kent in southeastern england in an area along border between derbyshire and yorkshire old tup tradition featured groups knocking on doors around christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat s head hole drew parallels between hoodening and christmas bull tradition recorded in dorset and gloucestershire in south west england there are two extant hobby horse traditions padstow obby oss festival and minehead hobby horse which take place not at christmas time but on may day although origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from documented elite fashion for hobby horses in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in this hooded animal traditions may be comparable to england s morris dance tradition which became a nation wide craze in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into a set of sharply delineated regional traditions regional coverage thumb right modern painting of mari lwyd in mapping distribution of mari lwyd appearances cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with glamorgan with two thirds of instances falling within that county custom stretched east into industrial valleys of monmouthshire with most easterly account coming from monmouth itself this account is also one of earliest a number of examples were also found in carmarthenshire with a single example found in both brecknockshire and ceredigion there is a single record of custom being performed in north wales in an example from wrexham which cawte believed was result of a glamorgan man bringing custom with him as he moved north previously peate had cautioned that comparative absence of recorded examples from mid and north wales was not proof that mari lwyd custom had never been present in those areas cawte opined that there was no clear reason for distribution of mari lwyd custom which cut through various local cultural features those areas where it was found did not correlate with any distinction between english speaking and welsh speaking areas in south wales he acknowledged however that there was a reasonable correspondence between areas in which mari lwyd was recorded and areas which were used for mineral production in 14th century he therefore suggested possibility that it might have been performed by coal and iron miners in western glamorgan carmarthenshire and western monmouthshire and that from there it could have spread into those villages where goods were manufactured using those minerals recorded appearances 18th and 19th centuries earliest published account of mari lwyd appeared in 1800 in j evans a tour through part of north wales in year 1798 and at other times although book itself focused on north wales chapter in which passage was included discussed language and customs of wales more generally in this section evans related that a man on new year s day dressing himself in blankets and other trappings with a factitious head like a horse and a party attending him knocking for admittance this obtained he runs about room with an uncommon frightful noise which company quit in real or pretended fright they soon recover and by reciting a verse of some or in default paying a small gratuity they gain admission evans returned to custom in his 1804 work letters written during a tour through south wales in year 1803 and at other times here he provided a clearer discussion than before making it apparent that teams accompanying a man dressed as a horse or bull toured local area from christmas until after twelfth day and that they were given food or money to leave householders alone mari lwyd next appeared in an 1819 account from west glamorgan where mari lwyd itself was termed an aderyn bee y llwyd roughly grey magpie and was accompanied by three or four partners in profits of expedition who are by turns horse groom or attendants it has been suggested that welsh methodist revival contributed to decline of both mari lwyd and a number of other welsh folk customs in 1802 harpist edward jones of merionethshire published a book in which he lamented destructive impact that christian preachers were having on welsh folk customs which they were criticising as sinful in his view consequence is wales which was formerly one of merriest and happiest countries in world is now becoming one of dullest reflecting such a view in 1852 reverend william roberts a baptist minister at blaenau gwent condemned mari lwyd and other related customs as a mixture of old pagan and popish ceremonies i wish of this folly and all similar follies that they find no place anywhere apart from museum of historian and antiquary owen suggested that custom s decline was also a result of changing social conditions in south wales he argued that mari lwyd wassailing custom gave an approved means of entering houses of neighbours in a culture in which there were few public assemblies at least in heart of winter in which convivial spirit of season could be released further he suggested that gifts of food drink and sometimes money no doubt helped to further feeling of community among country folk while at same time manifesting it he argued that changing social conditions altered ways that people in southern wales celebrated christmas hence contributing to folk custom s decline 20th century revival in a 1935 article on subject of mari lwyd peate stated that tradition is still met with it is practised in cardiff district bridgend llangynwyd neath and other glamorgan districts he highlighted an example from christmas eve 1934 in which a mari lwyd was observed performing alongside at least twelve singers in a chemist s shop in mumbles swansea ettlinger subsequently expressed view that dr peate deserves sincerest gratitude of all folk lore students for having so valiantly penetrated mysteries surrounding mari lwyd thumb left footage of a pwnco on steps of chepstow museum in 2014 historian ronald hutton stated that mari lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in early 20th century in middle of that century it was revived in llangynwyd in 1967 lois blake published a letter in journal english dance and song in which she noted that mari lwyd appeared each christmas eve at barley mow inn at graig near cowbridge where a man named john williams had kept custom alive for past sixty years blake also explained that she believed that custom was still performed at several villages in maesteg area of glamorgan during 1970s hole commented that tradition was still found in glamorganshire and during 1980s further revived forms of mari lwyd tradition emerged in caerphilly llantrisant and st fagans all of which are in same borderland between vale and mountains commenting on example of llantrisant which was inaugurated in 1980 mick noted that custom had re established herself so strongly that there are complaints if she misses any of her regular calls he noted that in 1991 llantrisant mari lwyd was taken to yn a pan celtic festival on isle of man and that it had also been taken to lowender festival at perranporth in cornwall hutton believed that custom re emerged in borderlands between vale and mountains in part because people in glamorgan sought to reaffirm their sense of cultural identity during termination of their traditional industries and partly because welsh folk museum was located in area more widely he believed that revival of mari lwyd was in large part due to forces of local patriotism noting that a similar situation had resulted in resurrection of hoodening tradition in east kent town council of aberystwyth organised world s largest mari lwyd for millennium celebrations in 2000 a mixture of mari lwyd and wassail customs occurs in border town of chepstow south wales every january a band of english wassailers meet with local welsh border morris side on bridge in chepstow in culture mari lwyd has prompted responses from arts in wales poet vernon watkins published his ballad of mari lwyd in 1941 archbishop of canterbury rowan williams has written that this one of outstanding poems of century draws together folk ritual of new year christian eucharist uneasy frontier between living and dead so as to present a model of what poetry itself is frontier work between death and life old year and new bread and body mari lwyd was utilised by artist clive hicks jenkins in a series of drawings from around 2000 that focused on a metamorphosing horse man as a nightmarish harbinger of his father s death catriona urquhart wrote a sequence of poems titled mare s tale which were published alongside hicks jenkins images in 2001 in her 1977 novel silver on tree author susan cooper included an appearance from mari lwyd cooper susan 1977 silver on tree london chatto and windus related welsh customs in 1919 h w evans recorded existence of a similar custom which had existed in pembrokeshire circa 1840 during his mother s childhood he stated that this custom entailed use of what he termed a mari lwyd furthermore providing a drawing of it using his mother s recollections as a basis although was unaware of how this costume had been used according to evans description this mari lwyd consisted of a sheet that had been sewn together along two adjacent sides to make a cone which was then stuffed with hay and decorated with buttons for eyes and harvest gloves for ears thus resembling an animal s snout an individual could conceal themselves under sheet and use a hay fork inserted into hay to hold it up a similar custom appears in an account from 1897 in which an entity known as llwyd grey bogy was described it involved an imitation horse s head being made from canvas and stuffed with hay being carried about using a hay fork on all hallow s eve cawte also noted example of other welsh folk customs featuring head of a horse however he opined that these so not seem to be closely related to mari lwyd a horse s head was prepared in a manner akin to mari lwyd for a spring festival known as or which took place in pembrokeshire circa 1820 as part of this festival young men and women gathered at a mill for a night s entertainment in late nineteenth century a tradition was recorded in north wales that was known as giving a skull in which skull of a horse or donkey was placed over front door of a woman s house on may day as a sign of contempt in parts of wales a horse s head sometimes with horns attached was featured as part of charivari
