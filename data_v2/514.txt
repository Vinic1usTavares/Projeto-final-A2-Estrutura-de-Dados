an expressive and plaintive solo 2 thumb upright 1 7 ground bass of derived movement crucifixus of mass in b minor first choral movement weeping lamentation worry despair is in form first section is built on a as an old style passacaglia in 3 2 time lamento a chromatic fourth ostinato is repeated twelve times musicologist julian mincham notes that henry purcell arrived at a similar motif in dido s lament in opera dido and aeneas which bach probably did not know first four words are each sung by a different vocal part each overlapping next beginning with highest voice each part sings an extended sigh setting is intensified until in seventh repeat all voices continue text simultaneously dread and need or anguish and trouble ninth repeat is similar to first but in more extreme harmonies twelfth repeat is instrumental middle section of line about christians that bear marks of jesus first marked un poco allegro is in a contrasting mood its last section is marked andante
