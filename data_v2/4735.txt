mcglynn simon prescott mike reynolds kevin seymour barry stigler development executive producer hironobu sakaguchi stated that idea for game first came up in february 1997 original idea for brave fencer musashi was having miyamoto musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged while game was conceptualized as action oriented musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer however he was later changed to an itinerant samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters during development team used an action base which was crucial to game s fighting mechanics director yoichi yoshimoto was focused on game s fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from square s previous works development team prioritized movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance thumb climactic battle between musashi miyamoto top and kojiro sasaki bottom character kojiro was based on japanese swordsman kojiro sasaki both musashi and kojiro shared a lengthy account of rivalry hence same frictional relationship that was referenced between two inside game legend says two swordsmen set up to duel each other however musashi reportedly arrived several hours late to purposely anger kojiro and his supporters another nod to kojiro and legendary duel is when musashi found him and princess fillet on shores of island of dragons this loosely referenced island appointed location were long time rivals held their famous duel when developing characters for game sakaguchi did not have a positive opinion of how popular game would become however after staff designed graphics and gameplay he was surprised by work commenting that it was more interesting characters were designed by koji matsuoka and illustrated by tetsuya nomura when game was localized for an english release translators had to change alcohol based names with soda pop names due to problems with rating boards this resulted in several jokes being lost in translation game s english title was changed from brave fencer musashiden to brave fencer musashi in order to avoid confusing non japanese players about title character s name as musashiden means musashi s story game s

positive reviews from critics with metacritic giving it an 81 out of 100 gamespot reviewer james mielke praised graphics calling them very well done and superior to other square rpgs of time ign and gamepros reviews by randy nelson and air hendrix respectively similarly praised game s excellent visual design gamespot and gamepro reviews also praised voice acting quality while nelson noted stellar soundtrack but found voice acting to be annoying next generation reviewed playstation version of game rating it three stars out of five and stated that at heart of brave fencer is an engaging and challenging if somewhat simple journey with some very clever features and an endearing cast gameplay was also positively received for example hendrix from gamepro shared his opinion that game did well with management of game s time nelson and hendrix from ign and gamepro both emphasized their enjoyment of game s action elements gamespot while feeling that action elements were primary focus of game still liked wide variety of role playing elements present nelson from ign however wished that role playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of action parts of game all three reviewers compared game to legend of zelda such as mielke from gamespot who had discussed game to release as a direct competitor to that series both gamespot and ign felt that comparison was invalid as musashi focused much more on action than role playing resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all references external links category 1998 video games category action role playing video games
