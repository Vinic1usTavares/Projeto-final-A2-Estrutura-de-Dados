flagship as battle of trafalgar was about to commence on 21 october 1805 trafalgar was a decisive naval engagement of napoleonic wars it gave united kingdom control of seas removing all possibility of a french invasion and conquest of britain although there was much confusion surrounding wording of signal in aftermath of battle significance of victory and nelson s death during battle led to phrase becoming embedded in english psyche and it has been regularly quoted paraphrased and referenced up to modern day signals during battle as british fleet closed with opposing combined fleets of france and spain lord nelson signalled all necessary battle instructions to his ships aware of of events to come lord nelson felt that something extra was required he instructed his signal officer lieutenant john pasco to signal to fleet as quickly as possible message england confides that every man will do his duty pasco suggested to nelson that expects be substituted for confides i e is confident since former word was in signal book whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter by letter nelson agreed to change even though it produced a less trusting impression reprinted and abridged from thus at around 11 45 a m on 21 october 1805 signal was sent exact time signal was sent is not known one account puts it as early as 10 30 as message was repeated throughout fleet but pasco puts it at about a quarter to noon and logs from other ships of line also put it close to this time thumb right 480px nelson s famous signal relayed using popham s telegraphic signals of marine vocabulary signal was relayed using numeric flag code known as telegraphic signals of marine vocabulary devised in 1800 by rear admiral sir home popham and based on signal books created earlier by admiral lord howe this code assigned digits 0 to 9 to ten signal flags which were used in combination code numbers 1 25 represented letters of alphabet omitting j and with v 20 before u 21 higher numbers were assigned

confides had been so had to be spelt out and whole message required twelve lifts it is believed that it would have taken about four minutes with end of message indicated by an end of code flag blue over yellow diagonally split a team of four to six men led by lt pasco would have prepared and hoisted flags onboard lord nelson s flagship message shows one of shortcomings of popham s code even two letter do required three flags hoisted for signal it is reported that a great cheer went up as signal was hoisted and repeated throughout fleet according to historian john knox laughton it is said that as he saw flags going up collingwood remarked half peevishly to his flag lieutenant i wish nelson would make no more signals we all understand what we have to do when however signal was reported
