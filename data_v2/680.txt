strangways is head of kingston station for british secret service murdered by dr no s henchmen three blind mice uncredited production when harry saltzman gained rights for novel he initially did not go through with project instead albert r cubby broccoli wanted rights to novels and attempted to buy them from saltzman saltzman did not want to sell rights to broccoli and instead they formed a partnership to make films a number of hollywood film studios did not want to fund films finding them too british or too blatantly sexual eventually two received authorisation from united artists to produce dr no to be released in 1962 saltzman and broccoli created two companies danjaq which was to hold rights to films and eon productions which was to produce them partnership between broccoli and saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during filming of man with golden gun led to an acrimonious split and saltzman sold his shares of danjaq to united artists initially broccoli and saltzman had wanted to produce eighth bond novel 1961 s thunderball as first film but there was an ongoing legal dispute between screenplay s co author kevin mcclory and ian fleming as a result broccoli and saltzman chose dr no timing was with claims that american rocket testing at cape canaveral had problems with rockets going astray producers offered dr no to guy green guy hamilton val guest and ken hughes to direct but all of them turned it down they finally signed terence young who had a long background with broccoli s warwick films as director broccoli and saltzman felt that young would be able to make a real impression of james bond and transfer essence of character from book to film young imposed many stylistic choices for character which continued throughout film series young also decided to inject much humour as he considered that a lot of things in this film sex and violence and so on if played straight a would be objectionable and b we re never gonna go past censors but moment you take mickey out put tongue out in cheek it seems to disarm producers asked united artists for financing but studio would only put up 1 million later uk arm of united artists provided an extra 100 000 to create climax where dr no s base explodes as a result of low budget only one sound editor was hired normally there are two for sound effects and dialogue and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways with m s office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather like plastic room where dent meets dr no costing only to build and aquarium in dr no s base being magnified stock footage of goldfish furthermore when art director syd cain found out his name was not in credits broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate saying that he did not want to spend money making credits again production designer ken adam later told uk daily newspaper guardian in 2005 budget for dr no was under 1m for whole picture my budget was ps14 500 i filled three stages at pinewood full of sets while they were filming in jamaica it wasn t a real aquarium in dr no s apartment it was a disaster to tell you truth because we had so little money we decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish what we didn t realise was because we didn t have much money only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish sized fish so we had to blow up size and put a line in dialogue with bond talking about magnification i didn t see any reason why dr no shouldn t have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques we thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used goya s portrait of duke of wellington which was still missing at time i got hold of a slide from national gallery this was on friday shooting began on monday and i painted a goya over weekend it was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but just like real one it got stolen while it was on display writing broccoli had originally hired richard maibaum and his friend wolf mankowitz to write dr nos screenplay partly because of mankowitz s help in brokering deal between broccoli and saltzman an initial draft of screenplay was rejected because scriptwriters had made villain dr no a monkey mankowitz left film and maibaum then undertook a second version of story more closely in line with novel mankowitz eventually had his name removed from credits after viewing early rushes as he feared it would be a disaster johanna harwood and thriller writer berkely mather then worked on maibaum s script terence young described harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a british character harwood stated in an interview in a cinema retro special on making of film that she had been a screenwriter of several of harry saltzman s projects she claimed both her screenplays for dr no and her screenplay for from russia with love had followed fleming s novels closely johanna harwood interview movie classics 4 solo publishing 2012 during series fifty year history only a few of films have remained substantially true to their source material dr no has many similarities to novel and follows its basic plot but there are a few notable omissions major elements from novel that are missing from film include bond s fight with a giant squid and escape from dr no s complex using dragon disguised swamp buggy elements of novel that were significantly changed for film include use of a non venomous tarantula spider instead of a centipede dr no s secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry dr no s plot to disrupt nasa space launches from cape canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting us missile testing on turks island method of dr no s death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano and introduction of spectre an organisation absent from book components absent from novel but added to film include introduction of bond character in a gambling casino introduction of bond s semi regular girlfriend sylvia trench a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur a fight scene to introduce quarrel seduction of miss taro bond s recurring cia ally felix leiter dr no s partner in crime professor dent and bond s controversial cold blooded killing of this character sometimes episodes in novel retained in film s altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into plot bond s escape from his cell via air shaft for instance originally conceived as a ruse of dr no s to test bond s skill and endurance becomes an authentic break out in film features carried over from novel s obstacle course however such as torrent of water and scalding surface have no logical justification in script such incongruities recurred in subsequent bond films casting james bond while producers broccoli and saltzman originally sought cary grant for role they discarded idea as grant would be committed to only one feature film and producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series richard johnson has claimed to have been first choice of director but he turned it down because he already had a contract with mgm and was intending to leave another actor purported to have been considered for role was patrick mcgoohan on strength of his portrayal of spy john drake in television series danger man mcgoohan turned down role another potential bond included david niven who played character in 1967 parody casino royale there are several apocryphal stories as to whom ian fleming personally wanted reportedly fleming favoured actor richard todd in his autobiography when snow melts cubby broccoli said roger moore had been considered but had been thought too young perhaps a shade too pretty in his autobiography my word is my bond moore says he was never approached to play role of bond until 1973 for live and let die moore appeared as simon templar on television series saint airing in united kingdom for first time on 4 october 1962 only one day before premiere of dr no ultimately producers turned to 30 year old sean connery for five films it is often reported that connery won role through a contest set up to find james bond while this is untrue contest itself did exist and six finalists were chosen and screen tested by broccoli saltzman and fleming winner of contest was a 28 year old model named peter anthony who according to broccoli had a gregory peck quality but proved unable to cope with role when connery was invited to meet broccoli and saltzman he appeared scruffy and in clothes but connery put on an act and it paid off as he acted in meeting with a macho devil may care attitude when he left both saltzman and broccoli watched him through window as he went to his car both agreeing that he was right man for bond after connery was chosen terence young took actor to his tailor and hairdresser and introduced him to high life restaurants casinos and women of london in words of bond writer raymond benson young educated actor in ways of being dapper witty and above all cool in secondary cast for first bond girl honey ryder julie christie was considered but discarded as producers felt she was not voluptuous enough just two weeks before filming began ursula andress was chosen to play honey after producers saw a picture of her taken by andress then husband john derek to appear more convincing as a jamaican andress had a tan painted on her and ultimately had her lines redubbed by voice actress nikki van der zyl due to andress heavy swiss german accent for bond s antagonist dr no ian fleming wanted his friend noel coward and coward answered invitation with no no no fleming considered that his step cousin christopher lee would be good for role of dr no although by time fleming told producers they had already chosen joseph wiseman for part harry saltzman picked wiseman because of his performance in 1951 film detective story and actor had special make up applied to evoke no s chinese heritage role as first felix leiter was given to jack lord this is bond and leiter s first time meeting each other on film and leiter does not appear in novel leiter returns for many of bond s future adventures and in 2006 reboot of film series casino royale leiter and bond are seen meeting one another again for first time this was lord s only appearance as leiter as he asked for more money and a better billing to return as leiter in goldfinger and was subsequently replaced cast also included a number of actors who were to become stalwarts of future films including bernard lee who played bond s superior m for another ten films and lois maxwell who played m s secretary moneypenny in fourteen instalments of series lee was chosen because of being a prototypical father figure and maxwell after fleming thought he was perfect fit for his description of character maxwell was initially offered a choice between roles of moneypenny or sylvia trench and opted for moneypenny as she thought trench role which included appearing in immodest dress was too sexual eunice gayson was cast as sylvia trench and it was planned that she would be a recurring girlfriend for bond throughout six films although she appeared only in dr no and from russia with love she had been given part by director terence young who had worked with her in and invited gayson saying you always bring me luck in my films although she was also cast due to her voluptuous figure one role which was not given to a future regular was that of major boothroyd head of q branch which was given to peter burton burton was unavailable for subsequent film from russia with love and role was taken by desmond llewelyn anthony dawson who played professor dent met director terence young when he was working as a stage actor in london but by time of film s shooting dawson was working as a pilot and crop duster in jamaica dawson also portrayed ernst stavro blofeld head of spectre in from russia with love and thunderball although his face was never seen and his voice was redubbed by austrian actor eric pohlmann zena marshall who played miss taro was mostly attracted by humorous elements of script and described her role as this attractive little siren and at same time i was spy a bad woman who young asked to play not as chinese but a mid atlantic woman who men dream about but is not real role of taro was previously rejected by marguerite lewars miss jamaica 1961 who worked at kingston airport as it required being wrapped in a towel lying in a bed kissing a strange man filming right thumb dr no s lair was actually this bauxite terminal near oracabessa jamaica dr no is set in london jamaica and crab key a fictional island off jamaica filming began on location in jamaica on 16 january 1962 primary scenes there were exterior shots of crab key and kingston where an uncredited syd cain acted as art director and also designed dragon tank shooting took place a few yards from fleming s goldeneye estate and author regularly visited filming with friends location filming was largely in oracabessa with additional scenes on palisadoes strip and port royal in st andrew on 21 february production left jamaica with footage still unfilmed due to a change of weather five days later filming began at pinewood studios buckinghamshire england with sets designed by ken adam which included dr no s base ventilation duct and interior of british secret service headquarters studio was used on majority of later bond films adam s initial budget for entire film was just ps14 500 ps in but producers were convinced to give him an extra ps6 000 out of their own finances after 58 days of filming principal photography completed on 30 march 1962 scene where a tarantula walks over bond was initially shot by pinning a bed to wall and placing sean connery over it with a protective glass between him and spider director young did not like final results so scenes were interlaced with new footage featuring tarantula over stuntman bob simmons simmons who was uncredited for film described scene as most frightening stunt he had ever performed book features a scene where honey ryder is tortured by being tied to ground along with crabs but since crabs were sent frozen from caribbean they did not move much during filming so scene was altered to have honey slowly drowning simmons also served as film s fight choreographer employing a rough fighting style noted violence of dr no which also included bond shooting dent in cold blood caused producers to make adaptations to get an a rating allowing minors to enter accompanied by an adult from british board of film classification when he is about to have dinner with dr no bond is amazed to see goya s portrait of duke of wellington painting had been stolen from national gallery by a 60 year old amateur thief in london just before filming began ken adam had contacted national gallery in london to obtain a slide of picture painting copy over course of weekend prior to filming commencing on monday editor peter r hunt used an innovative editing technique with extensive use of quick cuts and employing fast motion and exaggerated sound effects on action scenes hunt said his intention was to move fast and push it along whole time while giving it a certain style and added that fast pacing would help audiences not notice any writing problems as title artist maurice binder was creating credits he had an idea for introduction that appeared in all subsequent bond films james bond gun barrel sequence it was filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual 38 calibre gun barrel with bob simmons playing bond binder also designed a highly stylised main title sequence a theme that has been repeated in subsequent eon produced bond films binder s budget for title sequence was ps2 000 ps in soundtrack monty norman was invited to write soundtrack because broccoli liked his work on 1961 theatre production belle a musical about murderer hawley harvey crippen norman was busy with musicals and only agreed to do music for dr no after saltzman allowed him to travel along with crew to jamaica most famous composition in soundtrack is james bond theme which is heard in gunbarrel sequence and in a calypso medley over title credits and was written by norman based on a previous composition of his john barry who would later go on to compose music for eleven bond films arranged bond theme but was uncredited except for credit of his orchestra playing final piece it has occasionally been suggested that barry not norman composed james bond theme this argument has been subject of two court cases most recent in 2001 which found in favour of norman theme as written by norman and arranged by barry was described by another bond film composer david arnold as bebop swing vibe coupled with that vicious dark distorted electric guitar definitely an instrument of rock n roll it represented everything about character you would want it was cocky swaggering confident dark dangerous suggestive sexy unstoppable and he did it in two minutes music for opening scene is a calypso version of nursery rhyme three blind mice with new lyrics to reflect intentions of three assassins hired by dr no other notable songs in film are song jump up played in background and traditional jamaican calypso under mango tree famously sung by diana coupland then norman s wife singing voice of honey ryder as she walked out of ocean on crab key byron lee appeared in film and performed some of music on later soundtrack album lee and other jamaican musicians who appear in soundtrack including ernest ranglin and carlos malcolm were introduced to norman by chris blackwell owner of then small label island records who worked in film as a location scout original soundtrack album was released by united artists records in 1963 as well as several cover versions of james bond theme on columbia records a single of james bond theme entered uk singles chart in 1962 reaching a peak position of number thirteen during an eleven week spell in charts ranglin who had acted as arranger on several tracks and malcolm sued eon for unpaid fees both settling out of court malcolm and his band performed a year later at film s premiere in kingston release and reception promotion as soon as late 1961 united artists started a marketing campaign to make james bond a well known name in north america newspapers received a box set of bond s books as well as a booklet detailing bond character and a picture of ursula andress eon and united artists made licensing deals revolving around character s tastes having merchandising tie ins with drink tobacco men s clothing and car companies campaign also focused on ian fleming s name due to minor success of books after dr no had a successful run in europe sean connery and terence young did a cross country tour in march 1963 which featured screening previews for film and press conferences it culminated in a well publicised premiere in kingston where most of film is set some of campaign emphasised sex appeal of film with poster artwork by mitchell hooks depicting sean connery and four scantily clad women campaign also included 007 logo designed by joseph with a pistol as part of seven dr no had its worldwide premiere at london pavilion on 5 october 1962 expanding

york city in former as a double bill with young and brave and latter in united artists premiere showcase treatment screening in 84 screens across city to avoid costly broadway cinemas critical response upon release dr no received a mixed critical reception time called bond a bounder and a great big hairy marshmallow who almost always manages to seem slightly silly stanley kauffmann in new republic said that he felt film never decides whether it is suspense or suspense spoof he also did not like connery or fleming novels vatican condemned dr no describing it as a dangerous mixture of violence vulgarity sadism and sex whilst kremlin said that bond was personification of capitalist evil both controversies helped increase public awareness of film and greater cinema attendance however leonard mosely in daily express said that dr no is fun all way and even sex is harmless whilst penelope gilliatt in observer said it was full of submerged self parody guardians critic called dr no crisp and well tailored and a neat and gripping thriller in years that followed its release it became more popular writing in 1986 danny peary described dr no as a cleverly conceived adaption of ian fleming s enjoyable spy thriller picture has sex violence wit terrific action sequences and colorful atmosphere connery andress and wiseman all give memorable performances there s a slow stretch in middle and dr no could use a decent henchman but otherwise film works marvelously describing dr no as a different type of film peary notes that looking back one can understand why it caused so much

once connery says his line monty norman s bond theme plays and creates an indelible link between music and character in short scene introducing bond there are portrayed qualities of strength action reaction violence and this elegant slightly brutal gambler with quizzical sneer we see before us who answers a woman when he s good and ready raymond benson author of continuation bond novels has stated that as music fades up on scene we have ourselves a piece of classic cinema following release of dr no quote bond james bond became a catch phrase that entered lexicon of western popular

stated that importance of dr no to british film industry cannot be overstated as it and subsequent bond series of films form backbone of industry dr no and bond films in general also inspired television output with nbc series man from u n c l e which was described as first network television imitation of bond style of bond films largely derived from production designer ken adam is one of hallmarks of bond film series and effect of his work on dr no s lair can be seen in another film he worked on dr strangelove as first film in series a number of elements of dr no were contributors to subsequent films including monty norman s james bond theme and maurice binder s gun barrel sequence variants of which all appeared in subsequent films these conventions were also lampooned in spoof films such as austin powers series first spoof films happened relatively soon after dr no with 1964 film carry on spying showing villain dr crow being overcome by agents who included charlie bind
