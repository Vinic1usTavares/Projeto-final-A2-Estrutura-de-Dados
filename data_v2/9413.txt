before she moved into historical fiction a genre new to her she noted one thing i d always wanted to try another someday dream was a big sprawling mainstream historical epic she proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of robin hood legend from perspective of maid marian roberson understood that her rendition was not a recounting of original story because there is none rather lady of forest was purely her own concoction roberson lady of forest p 591 describing novel as a prequel author explained i wanted very much to write story of how legend came to be tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight inequities of medieval england to me key was logic i historical fact with fantasy of classic legend and developed my own interpretation of how things came to be i wanted to come to know all of these people to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did it took roberson a year to research and write novel she credited as resource materials j c holt s robin hood maurice keen s outlaws of sherwood ballads of robin hood elizabeth hallam s plantagenet chronicles w l warren s king john as well as works of frances and joseph gies in a 2007 interview roberson stated that writing story was extremely challenging because she employs viewpoints of twelve main characters marian lord robert delacey sir guy de gisbourne earl of huntington eleanor delacey sheriff s plain scheming daughter friar tuck will scarlet minstrel alan of dales whom becomes an outlaw after being falsely accused of rape simple boy much moneylender abraham jew who robert uses to raise money for ransom and shepherd turned reluctant outlaw little john roberson believed that this experience made her a better writer roberson has spoken of difficulties of writing medieval women particularly because so many contemporary authors are accused of giving their characters anachronistic independence of thought and feminist leanings roberson lady of forest p 592 author acknowledged that with eleanor delacey an invented character she tread s close to boundaries but believes eleanor is a reflection of women of loose morals who indeed existed in 1190s roberson continued i choose to believe an eleanor might well have looked to sexual dalliance as a means of seeking freedom of choice in an age when women had very little roberson lady of forest p 593 conversely marian roberson wrote is a truer product of her times shaped by ordinary responsibilities and expectations of a medieval woman marian only gains strength and freedom to love after loss of her good reputation as a captive in sherwood forest analysis stephen thomas knight a scholar on robin hood has written extensively on roberson s interesting perspective of legend knight robin hood an anthology of scholarship and criticism p xx according to him lady of forest was another in a long line of contemporary stories that has elevated marian to hero status knight icons of middle ages p 404 he connects this to a corresponding weakening of robin in roberson s story noting that there is a relationship between novel s post vietnam date and its story with robin rendered as a veteran returning from crusades in a traumatized state knight robin hood and crusades p 218 knight continues that it is evident that roberson is using post vietnam mood as basis for her weakening of robin to permit a strong woman presentation of marion roberson s marian is made an independent and intelligent woman who helps lord robin traumatised by crusades re establish himself both as a man and a leader of resistance knight remembering robin hood p 158 in an article published in journal of gender studies jane tolmie stated that lady of forest was another in a long line of contemporary fantasy novels that depicted women having to endure acts of rape violence and oppression as aspects of a continuum rather than as isolated difficulties marian for instance is subjected to abductions and attempted forced marriage tolmie medievalism and fantasy heroine pp 148 49 tolmie added that in context of roberson s book marian is praised as extraordinary only within oppressive gender based criteria promoted by patriarchal norman society tolmie medievalism and fantasy heroine p 155 after marian wields a quarterstaff to attack another robert compares lady to a man namely her father both had met adversity with same determination same intensity roberson lady of forest p 302 release and reception lady of forest was published
