arrived in london to present day tipu s tiger has been a popular attraction to public background thumb tipu s tiger with organ keyboard visible tipu s tiger was originally made for tipu sultan also referred to as tippoo tippoo sultan and other epithets in nineteenth century literature in kingdom of mysore today in indian state of karnataka around 1795 tipu sultan used tiger systematically as his emblem employing tiger motifs on his weapons on uniforms of his soldiers and on decoration of his palaces his throne rested upon a probably similar life size wooden tiger covered in gold like other valuable treasures it was broken up for highly organised prize fund shared out between british army davis 156 157 on throne and 153 157 on prize fund generally tipu had inherited power from his father hyder ali a muslim soldier who had risen to become dalwai or commander in chief under ruling hindu wodeyar dynasty but from 1760 was in effect ruler of kingdom hyder after initially trying to ally with british against marathas had later become their firm enemy as they represented most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom and tipu grew up with violently anti british feelings tiger formed part of a specific group of large caricature images commissioned by tipu showing european often specifically british figures being attacked by tigers or elephants or being executed tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways many of these were painted by tipu s orders on external walls of houses in main streets of tipu s capital seringapatam tipu was in close co operation with french who were at war with britain and still had a presence in south india and some of french craftsmen who visited tipu s court probably contributed to internal works of tiger thumb left death of munrow staffordshire pottery c 1814 from walton school depicting a tiger mauling hector sutherland munro a natural son of general hector munro 1726 1805 it has been proposed that design was inspired by death in 1792 of a son of general sir hector munro who had commanded a division during sir eyre coote s victory at battle of porto novo parangipettai in 1781 when hyder ali tipu sultan s father was defeated with a loss of 10 000 men during second anglo mysore war hector sutherland munro a 17 year old east india company cadet on his way to madras was attacked and killed by a tiger on 22 december 1792

tipu and dated 1787 88 five years before incident description thumb view of heads tipu s tiger is notable as an example of early musical automata from india and also for fact that it was especially constructed for tipu sultan with overall dimensions for object of high and long man at least is close to life size painted wooden shell forming both figures likely draws upon south indian traditions of hindu religious sculpture it is typically about half an inch thick and now much reinforced on inside following bomb damage in world war ii there are many openings at head end formed to match pattern of inner part of painted tiger stripes which allow sounds from pipes within to be heard better and tiger is obviously male top part of tiger s body can be lifted off to inspect mechanics by removing four screws construction of human figure is similar but wood is much thicker examination and analysis by v a conservation department has determined that much of current paint has been restored or overpainted v a conservation in action tippoo s tiger video accessed 17 july 2011 human figure is clearly in european costume but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian current text on v a website avoids specifying other than describing figure as european tippoo s tiger on victoria albert museum website to ord hume he is a european soldier part 1 21 but to de almeida and gilpin he is an english gentleman p 35 operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside tipu s tiger a set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside man s throat with its opening at his mouth this produces a wailing sound simulating cries of distress of victim a mechanical link causes man s left arm to rise and fall this action alters pitch of wail pipe another mechanism inside tiger s head expels air through a single pipe with two tones this produces a regular grunting sound simulating roar of tiger concealed behind a flap in tiger s flank is small ivory keyboard of a two stop pipe organ in tiger s body allowing tunes to be played ord hume part 2 summarized at p 64 and throughout in more detail style of both shell and workings and analysis of metal content of original brass pipes of organ many have been replaced indicates that tiger was of local manufacture presence of french artisans and french army engineers within tipu s court has led many historians to suggest there was french input into mechanism of this automaton history thumb 300px right first published illustration of tipu s tiger in james salmond s book of 1800 tipu s tiger was part of extensive plunder from tipu s palace captured in fall of seringapatam in which tipu died on 4 may 1799 at culmination of fourth anglo mysore war an aide de camp to governor general of east india company richard wellesley 1st marquess wellesley wrote a memorandum describing discovery of object st james s chronicle april 1800 also reported in edinburgh caledonian mercury 24 april 1800 earliest published drawing of tippoo s tyger was frontispiece for book a review of origin progress and result of late decisive war in mysore with notes by james salmond published in london in 1800 it preceded move of exhibit from india to england and had a separate preface titled description of frontispiece which said as quoted in unlike tipu s throne which also featured a large tiger and many other treasures in palace materials of tipu s tiger had no intrinsic value which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to england essentially intact governors of east india company had at first intended to present tiger to crown with a view to it being displayed in tower of london but then decided but to keep it for company after some time in store during which period first of many misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at improving piece from a musical point of view may have taken place it was displayed in reading room of east india company museum and library at east india house in leadenhall street london from july 1808 153 157 it rapidly became a very popular exhibit and crank handle controlling wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by public french author gustave flaubert visited london in 1851 to see great exhibition writes julian barnes but finding nothing of interest in crystal palace visited east india company museum where he was greatly enamoured by tipu s tiger by 1843 it was reported that machine or organ is getting much out of repair and does not altogether realize expectation of visitor ord hume part 2 79 eventually crank handle disappeared to great relief of students using reading room in which tiger was displayed and athenaeum later reported that thumb left 300px engraving of east india company museum in leadenhall street tipu s tiger can be seen to left when east india company was taken over by crown in 1858 tiger was stored in fife house whitehall until 1868 when it moved down road to new india office which occupied part of building still used by today s foreign and commonwealth office in 1874 it was moved to india museum in south kensington which was in 1879 dissolved with collection distributed between other museums v a records tiger as acquired in 1880 during world war ii tiger was badly damaged by a german bomb which brought down roof above it breaking wooden casing into several hundred pieces which were carefully pieced together after war so that by 1947 it was back on display in 1955 it was exhibited in new york at museum of modern art through summer and spring ord hume part 1 31 in recent times tipu s tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring historical interface between eastern and western civilisation colonialism ethnic histories and other subjects one such being held at victoria and albert museum itself in autumn 2004 titled encounters meeting of asia and europe 1500 1800 in 1995 tiger and thistle bi centennial exhibition was held in scotland on topic of tipu sultan and scots organ was considered too fragile to travel to scotland for exhibition instead a full sized replica made of fibre glass and painted by derek freeborn was exhibited in its place replica itself also had an earlier scottish association having been made in 1986 for enterprising scot exhibition which was held to commemorate october 1985 merger of royal scottish museum and national museum of antiquities of scotland to form a new entity national museum of scotland today tipu s tiger is arguably best known single work in victoria and albert museum as far as general public is concerned it is a must see highlight for school children s visits to victoria and albert museum and functions as an iconic representation of museum replicated in various forms of memorabilia in museum shops including postcards model kits and stuffed toys visitors can no longer operate mechanism since device is now kept in a glass case a small model of this toy is exhibited in tipu sultan s wooden palace in bangalore although other items associated with tipu including his sword have recently been purchased and brought back to india by billionaire vijay mallya tipu s tiger has not itself been subject of an official repatriation request presumably due to ambiguity underlying tipu s image in eyes of indians his being an object of loathing in eyes of some indians while considered a hero by others symbolism thumb 150px left a seringapatam medal of 1808 showing british lion overcoming a prostrate tiger tipu sultan identified himself with tigers his personal epithet was tiger of mysore his soldiers were dressed in tyger jackets his personal symbol invoked a tiger s face through clever use of calligraphy and tiger motif is visible on his throne and other objects in his personal possession including tipu s tiger accordingly as per joseph for tipu tiger striking down european in organ represented his symbolic triumph over british british hunted tigers not just to emulate mughals and other local elites in this royal sport but also as a symbolic defeat of tipu sultan and any other ruler who stood in path of british domination tiger motif was used in seringapatam medal which was awarded to those who participated in 1799 campaign where british lion was depicted as overcoming a prostrate tiger tiger being dynastic symbol of tipu s line seringapatam medal was issued in gold for highest dignitaries who were associated with campaign as well as select officers on general duty silver for other dignitaries field officers and other staff officers in copper bronze for non commissioned officers and in tin for privates on reverse it had a frieze of storming of fort while obverse showed in words of a nineteenth century tome on medals british lion subduing tiger emblem of late tippoo sultan s government with period when it was effected and following words otta ul signifying lion of god is conqueror or conquering lion of god thumb british lion s vengeance on bengal tiger punch cartoon from 1857 in this manner iconography of this automaton was adopted and overturned by british when tipu s tiger was displayed in london in nineteenth century british viewers of time characterised tiger as a trophy and symbolic justification of british colonial rule tipu s tiger along with other trophies such as tipu s sword throne of ranjit singh tope s kurta and nana saheb s betel box which was made of brass were all displayed as memorabilia of mutiny in one interpretation display of tipu s tiger in south kensington served to remind visitor of noblesse oblige of british empire to bring civilisation to barbaric lands of which tipu was king tipu s tiger is also notable as a literal image of a tiger killing a european an important symbol in england at time and from about 1820 death of munro became one of scenes in repertoire of staffordshire pottery figurines tiger hunting in british raj is also considered to represent not just political subjugation of india but in addition triumph over india s environment iconography persisted and during rebellion of 1857 punch ran a political cartoon showing indian rebels as a tiger attacking a victim in an identical pose to tipu s tiger being defeated by british forces shown by larger figure of a lion it has been suggested that tipu s tiger also contributed indirectly to development of a popular early 20th century stereotype of china as sleeping lion a recent study describes how this popular stereotype actually drew on chinese reports about tiger ari larissa heinrich chinese surplus aesthetics and medically commodified body ch 1 duke 2018 motives for collection of articles such as tipu s tiger are seen by literary historian barrett kalter as having a social and cultural context collection of western and indian art by tipu sultan is seen by kalter as motivated by need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly hindu and did not share his religion viz islam in case of east india company collection of documents artefacts and objet s d art from india helped develop idea of a subjugated indian populace in minds of british people thought being that possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of dominance over and mastery of that culture as a musical instrument thumb side view showing how handle when turned gets in way of player of keyboard in a detailed study published in 1987 of tiger s musical and noise making functions arthur w j g ord hume concluded that since coming to britain instrument has been ruthlessly reworked and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed ord hume part 1 31 though his main discussion of matter is in his part 2 there are two ranks of pipes in organ as opposed to wailing and grunting functions each comprising eighteen notes which are nominally of 4ft pitch and are i e corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of same musical pitch this is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting two stops together results in more sound there is also detectable a slight beat between pipes so creating a celeste effect it is considered likely that as so much work has been done this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature tiger s grunt is made by a single pipe in tiger s head and man s wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate bellows located in man s chest where they can be accessed by and lifting off tiger grunt operates by cogs gradually raising weighted grunt pipe until it reaches a point where it slips down to fall against its fixed lower board or reservoir discharging air to form grunting sound today all sound making functions rely on crank handle to power them though ord hume believes this was not originally case works on noise making functions included those made over several decades by famous organ building firm henry willis sons and henry willis iii who worked on tiger in 1950s contributed an account to a monograph by mildred archer of v a ord hume is generally ready to exempt willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations which vandalism is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ builders ord hume part 1 30 and part 2 passim there was a detailed account of sound making functions in penny magazine in 1835 whose anonymous author evidently understood things mechanical and organs in particular ord hume part 2 75 preceding his full reproduction of text from this and ord hume s own investigations he concluded that original operation of man s wail had been intermittent with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from tiger above but that at some date after 1835 mechanism had been altered to make wail continuous and that bellows for wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones and operation of moving arm altered video of david dimbleby playing grunt and wail only puzzling features of present instrument include placing of handle which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of keyboard ord hume part 1 21 ord hume using 1835 account concludes that originally handle which is a nineteenth century british replacement probably of a french original only operated grunt and wail while organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work original bellows now replaced ord hume part 2 71 73 75 77 and see videos linked at end of section keyboard which is largely original is unique in construction with square ivory buttons with round lathe turned tops instead of conventional keys though mechanical functioning of each button is practical and convenient they are spaced such that it is almost impossible to stretch hand to play an octave ord hume part 2 69 73 and see videos linked at end of section buttons are marked with small black spots differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys ord hume part 2 69 and see videos linked at end of section two stop control knobs for organ are located rather confusingly a little below tiger s
