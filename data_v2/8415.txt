thalassodromeus is a genus of pterosaur that lived in what is now brazil during early cretaceous period about 100 million years ago thalassodromeus had one of largest known skulls among pterosaurs around long with one of proportionally largest cranial crests of any vertebrate though only skull is known animal is estimated to have had a wing span of crest was lightly built and ran from tip of upper jaw to beyond back of skull ending in a unique v shaped notch jaws were toothless and had sharp upper and lower edges its skull had large nasoantorbital fenestrae opening that combined antorbital fenestra in front of eye with bony nostril and part of its palate was concave lower jaw was blade like and may have turned slightly upwards original skull discovered in 1983 in araripe basin of northeastern brazil was collected in several pieces in 2002 skull was made holotype specimen of thalassodromeus sethi by palaeontologists alexander kellner and diogenes de almeida campos generic name means sea runner in reference to its supposed mode of feeding and specific name refers to egyptian god seth due to its crest being supposedly reminiscent of seth s crown other scholars have pointed out that crest was instead similar to crown of amon and seth did not wear such a crown a jaw tip was assigned to t sethi in 2005 moved to new genus banguela in 2014 and assigned back to thalassodromeus as species t oberlii in 2018 another species t sebesensis was named in 2015 based on a supposed crest fragment but this was later shown to be part of a turtle shell closest relative of thalassodromeus was tupuxuara both are grouped in a clade that has been placed within either tapejaridae as subfamily thalassodrominae or within neoazhdarchia as family thalassodromidae several theories have been suggested to explain function of thalassodromeus s crest including thermoregulation and display but it likely had more than one function crests of thalassodromids appear to have developed late in growth probably correlated with sexual maturity and they may have been sexually dimorphic differing according to sex as genus name implies thalassodromeus was originally proposed to have fed like a modern skimmer bird by skimming over water s surface and dipping its lower jaws to catch prey this idea was later criticised for lack of evidence thalassodromeus has since been found to have had strong jaw musculature and may have been able to kill and eat relatively large prey on ground limb proportions of related species indicate that it may have adapted to fly in inland settings and would have been efficient at moving on ground thalassodromeus is known from romualdo formation where it coexisted with many other types of pterosaurs dinosaurs and other animals description thumb left upright alt thalassodromeus was as tall as a human with a broad wing span size of t sethi shown from above and side compared to a human holotype and only known skull of thalassodromeus sethi is one of largest pterosaur skulls ever discovered entire skull is estimated to have been long bones were fused together indicating adulthood based on related pterosaurs its wing span was making thalassodromeus largest known member of its clade thalassodromidae of similar proportions its skull was more heavily built than that of its relative tupuxuara although postcranial skeleton of thalassodromeus is unknown relatives had unusually short and blocky neck vertebrae with well developed front and hind limbs that were almost equal in length excluding long wing finger hindlimbs were 80 percent that of forelimb length a unique ratio among pterodactyloids short tailed pterosaurs as a pterosaur extinct order of flying reptiles thalassodromeus was covered with hair like pycnofibres and had extensive wing membranes which were extended by wing finger skull of t sethi had a streamlined profile especially from tip of snout to front edge of nasoantorbital fenestra opening which combined antorbital fenestra in front of eye with bony nostril most conspicuous feature of skull was large crest which ran along upper edge from tip of snout and beyond occiput at back of skull almost doubling length and height of skull with exception of pterosaur tupandactylus imperator whose crest consisted mainly of soft tissue t sethi had proportionally largest cranial crest of any known vertebrate 75 percent of skull s side surface crest was mainly formed by premaxillae frontmost snout bones frontal bones parietal bones and part of supraoccipital bone premaxillae formed most of crest extending to its back and contacted frontoparietal part of crest by a straight suture a distinct feature of this species crest varied from in thickness it thickened at contact between premaxillae and frontoparietal part and became gradually thinner toward top and back except for lower part behind occiput where it had a thick base thumb alt long light coloured skull cast of t sethi holotype skull cleveland museum of natural history despite its size crest was lightly built and essentially hollow some areas indicate signs of skeletal pneumatisation and a well developed trabecular system uniting bones crest s surface had a system of channels of varying size and thickness probably impressions of extensive blood vessels a small opening was present above orbit eye socket piercing basal part of crest such a feature is unknown in other pterosaurs and does not appear to be due to damage margins of opening are smooth and inner border has fenestration connecting it to inner structure of crest back of crest ended in a prominent v shaped notch a unique feature of this species although other parts of crest have v shaped breaks v shape at end does not appear to have been due to breakage margins of bone can be seen there still encased by matrix crest probably had a keratinous horny covering and may have been extended by soft tissue in some areas but extent of this is unknown upper jaw of t sethi was primarily composed of premaxillae and maxillae suture which formed border between these bones is not visible as in all members of its clade jaws were edentulous toothless rostrum snout was long from tip of premaxilla to joint where quadrate bone of skull connected with articular bone of lower jaw front of premaxillae had sharp upper and lower edges unique to this species as in related genera nasoantorbital fenestra was comparatively large it was long and high which was 71 percent of skull length excluding crest lacrimal bone which separated orbit from nasoantorbital fenestra was vertically elongated and higher than upper surface of orbit in contrast to condition seen in pterodactyloids with smaller nasoantorbital fenestrae orbit was slender and compressed from front to back compared to tupuxuara and but similar to some of them in being more than half height of nasoantorbital fenestra orbit was positioned lower than upper margin of nasoantorbital fenestra and therefore very low on skull although bones bordering lower temporal fenestra an opening behind orbit were incomplete it appears to have been elongated and slit like as in tupuxuara and tapejara thumb upright left alt colour picture of two t sethi in flight restoration of a t sethi pair in flight palatal area at tip of t sethi s snout was a sharp ridge similar to keel seen on upper surface of mandibular symphysis where two halves of lower jaw connected small slit like foramina openings on lower side edges of ridge indicate that it had a horny covering in life similar to tupandactylus lower edge of area was somewhat curved which probably created a small gap when jaws were closed further back immediately in front of nasoantorbital fenestra palatal ridge became a strong blunt convex keel this convexity fit into symphyseal shelf at front end of lower jaw and they would have tightly interlocked when jaws were closed palatal ridge ended in a strongly concave area unique to this species fenestrae openings behind palatine bone were oval and very small differing from those of related species ectopterygoid bone on side of palate had large plate like sides and was well developed compared to related species supraoccipital bone which formed hindmost base of cranial crest had muscle scars at its upper end probably corresponding to attachment of neck muscles although lower jaw of t sethi is incomplete its total length is estimated at 47 percent of which was occupied by mandibular symphysis tip of mandible is missing but its front surface indicates that it might have been turned slightly upwards as in t oberlii possible second species of thalassodromeus or possibly a different genus banguela which is only known from a jaw tip symphyseal shelf upper surface of symphysis extended for and had a flat surface seen from above side edges of this area were tall and formed a sharp margin near front end of symphysis edges which formed margins became broader towards front of shelf until they met and fused upper and lower surfaces of jaw at front of shelf were keeled upper keel more robust and starting before lower which gave symphysis a blade like shape lower keel became deeper towards front of jaw giving impression that jaw deflected downwards it was actually straight except for perhaps upturned tip mandibular fossae depressions at back of upper jaw were deeper and broader than usual in pterodactyloids creating large surfaces for lower jaw to articulate with possible species t oberlii differed from t sethi and other relatives by upper surface of its mandibular symphysis being slightly shorter than lower surface and was further distinguished from t sethi by upper edge of symphysis being much sharper than lower two species shared features such as compression of symphysis sideways and from top to bottom sharp keel at upper front of symphysis and small groove running along upper surface of shelf history of discovery thumb alt see caption diagram of t sethi holotype skull hatched lines represent missing parts based on its initial interpretation first known thalassodromeus specimen was collected in 1983 near town of santana do in araripe basin of northeastern brazil found in outcrops of romualdo formation it was collected over a long period of time in several pieces specimen catalogued as dgm 1476 r at museu de ciencias

and figured in 1990 by palaeontologists alexander w a kellner and diogenes de almeida campos although pieces of skull had been divided between museums in south and north america they were assembled before 2002 thumb left alt egyptian god amun on an obelisk although t sethi was named after god seth for having a crest similar to his crown seth did not wear such a crown crest was instead similar to crown of amon left on an obelisk in 2002 kellner and campos described and named new genus and species thalassodromeus sethi skull dgm 1476 r being holotype specimen generic name is derived from ancient greek words thalassa thalassa sea and dromeus dromeus runner meaning sea runner in reference to animal s supposed skim feeding behaviour specific name refers to ancient egyptian god seth specimen was not fully prepared at time of this preliminary description original describers chose name sethi because crest of pterosaur was supposedly reminiscent of crown worn by seth however palaeontologists andre jacques veldmeijer marco signore and j m meijer pointed out in 2005 that crown with its two tall plumes was typically worn by god amon or amon ra and his manifestations not by seth in 2006 palaeontologists david m martill and darren naish suggested that thalassodromeus was a junior synonym of related genus tupuxuara which was named by kellner and campos in 1988 based on fossils from same formation in view of martill and naish differences between these genera including two species of tupuxuara t and t were due to ontogeny changes during growth and compression of fossils thalassodromeus was simply an older larger and better preserved individual this idea was rejected by kellner and campos in 2007 who pointed out these species had differences in features other than their crests they also noted that one specimen of tupuxuara had a larger skull than thalassodromeus measured from tip of premaxilla to back of squamosal bone despite martill and naish s contention that latter was an older individual kellner and campos view has since been accepted by other researchers including martill and naish thumb alt see caption reconstruction of t sethi skull showing possible extent of undamaged crest and downturned jaws proposed by headden but not supported by pegas and colleagues veldmeijer and colleagues assigned front part of a mandible collected from same formation to t sethi in 2005 they concluded that although two specimens differed in several details differences were not significant enough to base a new species on mandible and that new specimen filled in gap of kellner and campos t sethi skull reconstruction palaeontologists jaime a headden and herbert b n campos coined new binomial banguela oberlii based on their reinterpretation of jaw tip as belonging to a toothless member of family in 2014 generic name is portuguese for toothless and specific name honours private collector urs who had donated specimen to naturmuseum st gallen where it is catalogued as sao headden and campos interpreted tip of t sethi lower jaw as downturned this and other features distinguished it from banguela in their 2018 re description of further prepared t sethi holotype skull palaeontologists rodrigo v pegas r costa and kellner assigned b oberlii back to thalassodromeus while recognising it as a distinct species and thereby created new combination t oberlii pegas and colleagues also rejected theory that lower jaw of t sethi was downturned and reinterpreted frontmost piece of lower jaw to have connected directly with subsequent piece with no gap in 2015 palaeontologists gerald grellet tinner and vlad a codrea named a new species t sebesensis based on what they interpreted as part of a cranial crest in a concretion found near sebes river in romania authors said that this would extend range in time and space for genus thalassodromeus considerably creating a 42 million year gap between older south american species and younger european species palaeontologist gareth j dyke and a large team of colleagues immediately rejected identification of t sebesensis fossil instead arguing that it was a misidentified part of a plastron lower shell of prehistoric turtle named in 1923 idea that fragment belonged to a turtle had been considered and rejected by grellet tinnera and codrea in their original description grellet tinnera and codrea denied turtle identity suggested by dyke and colleagues noting that those researchers had not directly examined fossil classification classification of thalassodromeus and its closest relatives is one of most contentious issues regarding their group kellner and campos originally assigned thalassodromeus to family tapejaridae based on its large crest and large nasoantorbital fenestra within this clade they found that it differed from short faced genus tapejara but shared a keel on palate with tupuxuara kellner elaborated on relationships within tapejaridae in 2004 and pointed out that thalassodromeus and tupuxuara also shared a crest consisting primarily of bone crest had a large component of soft tissue in other members of group thumb alt skeleton posed in flight near ceiling of a large room reconstructed skeleton of related genus tupuxuara in american museum of natural history martill and naish considered tapejaridae a paraphyletic unnatural group in 2006 and found tupuxuara which included thalassodromeus in their analysis to be sister taxon to family azhdarchidae this clade tupuxuara and azhdarchidae had been named neoazhdarchia by palaeontologist david unwin in 2003 an arrangement martill and naish concurred with according to martill features uniting members of neoazhdarchia included presence of a fused vertebrae in shoulder region loss of contact between first and third metacarpals bones in hand and very long snouts more than 88 of skull length kellner and campos defended validity of tapejaridae in 2007 dividing it into two clades tapejarinae and thalassodrominae latter containing thalassodromeus type genus and tupuxuara they distinguished thalassodromines by their high nasoantorbital fenestrae and bony part of their crests beginning at front of skull and continuing further back than in other pterosaurs interrelationship of these clades within larger clade remained disputed and clade containing thalassodromeus and tupuxuara had received different names from different researchers thalassodrominae and tupuxuaridae palaeontologist mark p witton attempted to resolve naming issue in 2009 noting that name tupuxuaridae first used in vernacular form by palaeontologist lu junchang and colleagues in 2006 had never been validly established and thalassodrominae should be proper name although it was bestowed a year later witton further converted subfamily name thalassodrominae into family name thalassodromidae and considered clade part of neoazhdarchia a 2011 analysis by palaeontologist felipe pinheiro and colleagues upheld grouping of clades tapejarinae and thalassodrominae in family tapejaridae joined by a 2014 study by palaeontologist brian andres and colleagues instead found thalassodromids to group with forming clade within neoazhdarchia defined as most inclusive clade containing but not quetzalcoatlus cladogram based on pinheiro and colleagues 2011 cladogram based on andres and colleagues 2014 pegas and colleagues kept tapejarinae and thalassodrominae as part of tapejaridae in 2018 but acknowledged that subject was still controversial palaeobiology crest function thumb alt model head mounted on a museum wall life sized t sethi model head natural history museum rotterdam possible functions for thalassodromeus cranial crest were proposed by kellner and campos in 2002 they suggested that network of blood vessels on its large surface was consistent with use for thermoregulation which had also been suggested for crests of some dinosaurs kellner and campos thought that crest was used for cooling enabling animal to dissipate excess metabolic heat through convection while heat transfer was controlled by and depended on network of blood vessels ability to control its body temperature would have aided thalassodromeus during intense activity such as hunting and they suggested that when in flight heat would have been dispelled more effectively if crest was aligned with wind while head was intentionally moved to sides kellner and campos posited that crest could have had additional functions such as display aided by colour it could have been used in species recognition and could also have been a sexually dimorphic feature differing according to sex as has been proposed for pteranodon in 2006 martill and naish found that crests of tupuxuara and its relatives developed by premaxillary portion of crests growing backwards over skull roof as indicated by well defined suture between premaxilla and underlying bones hind margin of premaxillary part of this specimen s crest had only reached above hind margin of nasoantorbital fenestra indicating that it was not an adult at time of death this suggests that development of crest happened late in growth of an individual was probably related to sexual display and sexual maturity of a given specimen could be assessed by size and disposition of crest t sethi holotype with its hypertrophied enlarged premaxillary crest would thereby represent an old adult individual and mature stage of tupuxuara according to their interpretation kellner and campos found martill and naish s discussion of cranial crest development interesting although they found their proposed model speculative palaeontologists david w e hone naish and innes c cuthill reiterated martill and naish s growth hypothesis in 2012 since pterosaurs were probably precocial and able to fly shortly after hatching role of crest was only relevant after maturity when structure was fully grown they deemed thermoregulation hypothesis an unlikely explanation for blood vessel channels on crest which they found consistent with nourishment for growing tissue such as keratin in bird beaks hone naish and cuthill suggested that wing membranes and air sac system would have been more effective at controlling heat than a crest and wind and water could also have helped cool pterosaurs in high temperature maritime settings in 2013 witton agreed that substantially larger crests of adult thalassodromids indicated that they were more important for behavioural activities than for physiology he found idea that crests were used for thermoregulation problematic since they did not grow regularly with body size they grew at a fast pace in near adults quicker than what would be predicted for growth of a thermoregulatory structure according to witton large highly vascular wing membranes of pterosaurs would provide surface area needed for thermoregulation meaning crests were not needed for that function he concluded that crest s blood vessel patterns did not differ much from those seen on bones under beaks of birds which are used for transporting nutrients to bone and soft tissues rather than for thermoregulation witton noted that although bird beaks lose heat quickly that is not what they were developed for crests of pterosaurs might also have had an effect on thermoregulation without this being their primary function thumb alt photo of a toucan with a long bright bill crest of t sethi has been compared to a toucan s bill pegas and colleagues noted that sexual dimorphism in crest size and shape has been proposed for some pterosaurs crest shape seen in t sethi holotype may correlate with one sex and may have been result of sexual selection they suggested that both sexes could have had similar crests due to mutual sexual selection but interpretation of exaggerated features was challenging due to small sample size more t sethi specimens would have to be found to evaluate these theories they did not think that thermoregulation correlated with crest growth relative to body size since bills of toucans largest of any modern birds grow drastically out of proportion to body size and function as thermoregulatory structures as well as facilitating feeding and social behaviour pegas and colleagues found vascular structure of toucan bills comparable to that in crest of t sethi concluding that crest also had multiple functions feeding and diet thumb left alt illustration of a t sethi and a skimming bird it was suggested that t sethi right fed like an extant skimmer left but this theory has been criticised kellner and campos originally found jaws of thalassodromeus similar to those of modern skimmers three bird species in genus with their sideways compressed jaws blade like beak and protruding lower jaw resembling scissors in side view they argued that thalassodromeus would have fed in a similar way as implied by genus name skimmers skim over surface of water dipping their lower jaw to catch fish and crustaceans kellner and campos listed additional skull features of skimmers which are adaptations for skim feeding including enlarged palatine bones a feature also shared with thalassodromeus unlike skimmers and other pterosaurs palatine bones of thalassodromeus were concave which writers suggested could have helped it momentarily store food like skimmers thalassodromeus also appears to have had powerful neck muscles large jaw muscles and an upper jaw tip well irrigated by blood features which kellner and campos interpreted as adaptations for skimming they concluded that scissor like bill and thin crest almost made other modes of capturing prey such as swooping down toward water and plunging into it impossible conceding difficulty of reconstructing fishing method they envisioned it with a less mobile neck than skimmers with crest impeding its head from submersion it would glide and only flap its wings occasionally they found that pterosaur with jaws most similar to those of thalassodromeus was smaller rhamphorhynchus although they believed that it would have had limited skimming ability upright thumb alt see caption comparison of jaw of a skimmer a b tupuxuara c and holotype jaw tip of t oberlii or banguela d with cross sections at right in 2004 palaeontologist sankar chatterjee and engineer r jack templin said that smaller pterosaurs may have been able to skim feed they doubted that this was possible for larger ones due to their lesser manoeuvrability and flying capability while resisting water chatterjee and templin noted that skimmers have blunter beaks than pterosaurs like thalassodromeus to direct water from jaw while skimming in 2007 biophysicist stuart humphries and colleagues questioned whether any pterosaurs would have commonly fed by skimming and said that such conclusions had been based on anatomical comparisons rather than biomechanical data drag experienced by bird bills and pterosaur jaws was and aerodynamically tested by creating model bills of black skimmer thalassodromeus and presumably non skimming tupuxuara and towing them along a water filled trough at varying speeds researchers found that skimming was more energy costly for skimmers than previously thought and skimming would have been impossible for a pterosaur weighing more than due to metabolic power required they found that even smaller pterosaurs like rhamphorhynchus were not adapted for skimming aluminium rigging of thalassodromeus model was destroyed during experiment due to high and unstable forces exerted on it while high speed skimming casting further doubt on this feeding method authors used jaw tip of t oberlii to model performance of thalassodromeus since it was assigned to t sethi at time unwin and martill suggested in 2007 that thalassodromids may have foraged similarly to storks as had been suggested for azhdarchids witton said in 2013 that although skim feeding had been suggested for many pterosaur groups idea was criticised in recent years pterosaurs lacked virtually all adaptations for skim feeding making it unlikely that they fed this way thalassodromeus unlike skimmers did not have a particularly wide or robust skull or especially large jaw muscle attachment sites and its mandible was comparatively short and tubby witton agreed with unwin and martill that thalassodromids with their equal limb proportions and elongated jaws were suited to roaming terrestrially and feeding opportunistically their shorter more flexible necks indicated a different manner of feeding than azhdarchids which had longer stiffer necks he suggested that thalassodromids may have had more generalised feeding habits and azhdarchids may have been more restricted thalassodromeus may have been better at handling relatively large struggling prey than its relative tupuxuara which had a lighter built skull witton stressed that more studies of functional morphology would have to be done to illuminate subject and speculated that thalassodromeus might have been a raptorial predator using its jaws to subdue prey with strong bites its concave palate could help it swallow large prey pegas and kellner presented a reconstruction of mandibular muscles of t sethi at a conference in 2015 they found that its well developed jaw muscles differed from those of possible dip feeder anhanguera and terrestrially stalking azhdarchids indicating that t sethi had a strong bite force in 2018 pegas and colleagues agreed that thalassodromeus blade like robust jaws indicated that it could have used them to strike and kill prey but they thought that biomechanical work was needed to substantiate idea they found unlike witton that thalassodromeus had a reinforced jaw joint and robust jaw muscles but more work was needed to determine its dietary habits according to pegas and colleagues articulation between t sethi articular and quadrate bones where lower jaw connected with skull indicates a maximum gape of 50 degrees similar to 52 degree gape inferred for quetzalcoatlus locomotion thumb upright alt illustration of a thalassodromeus with bat like wings and a large flat head restoration of t sethi wading in a marsh in a 2002 comment on original description of t sethi engineer john michael williams noted that although kellner and campos had mentioned that large crest might have interfered aerodynamically during flight they had not elaborated on this point and had compared pterosaur with a bird one fifth its size he suggested that thalassodromeus used its crest to balance its jaws with head changing attitude depending on mode of locomotion williams speculated that crest would be inflatable with blood and presented varying air resistance which he compared to a handheld fan this would have helped animal change attitude of head during flight and during contact with water keeping it from rotating without powerful neck muscles crest would have made long flights possible rather than interfering williams compared it with spermaceti in head of sperm whale stating it is supposedly used to change buoyancy through temperature adjustment kellner and campos rejected idea of an inflatable crest since its compressed bones would not allow this they did not find sperm whale analogy convincing in relation to flying animals noting that spermaceti is more likely to be used during aggression or for sonar they agreed that idea of crest having an in flight function was tempting and sideways movement of head would have helped it change direction but biomechanical and flight mechanical studies of crest would have to be conducted to determine animal s aerodynamics witton also expressed hope for further analysis of locomotion he noted that since their limb proportions were similar to those of better studied azhdarchids shape of their wings and style of flight might have been similar thalassodromids might also have been adapted for inland flight their wings were short and broad unlike long narrow wings of marine and were more manoeuvrable and less likely to snag on obstacles their lower shoulder muscles appear to have been enlarged which would have helped with powerful or frequent wing downstrokes and takeoff ability although it may have had to compensate for its large crest during flight its development late in growth indicates that it did not develop primarily for aerodynamics witton suggested that proportional similarity between limbs of thalassodromids and azhdarchids also indicates that their terrestrial abilities would have been comparable their limbs would have been capable of long strides and their short compact feet would have made these mechanics efficient enlarged shoulder muscles may have allowed them to accelerate quickly when running and they may have been as adapted for movement on ground as has been suggested for azhdarchids witton cautioned that more analysis of thalassodromids was needed to determine this palaeoecology
