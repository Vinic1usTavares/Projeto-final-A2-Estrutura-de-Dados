banksia caleyi commonly known as red lantern banksia or banksia is a species of woody shrub of family proteaceae native to western australia it generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2 m 7 ft tall has serrated leaves and red pendent hanging inflorescences which are generally hidden in foliage first described by scottish naturalist robert brown in 1830 banksia caleyi was named in honour of english botanist george caley no subspecies are recognised it is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences which is an unusual feature within genus found south and east of stirling ranges through to vicinity of jerramungup banksia caleyi grows in a habitat marked by periodic bushfires plants are killed by fire and regenerate by seed afterwards species was classified as not threatened under wildlife conservation act of western australia in contrast to most other western australian banksias it appears to have some resistance to dieback from soil borne water mould phytophthora cinnamomi and is comparatively easy to grow in cultivation description thumb left cream and pink flowers banksia caleyi grows as a many branched bushy shrub to 2 m 7 ft in height with crumbly grey bark rarely plants of up to have been found new growth is hairy and generally occurs in summer branchlets become smooth after around two years stiff leaves are narrowly wedge shaped cuneate and measure in length by wide leaf margins are serrated with many teeth measuring each flowering takes place between september and january inflorescences hang down from ends of three to five year old branchlets deep within shrub and measure in length and roughly in diameter flowers are cream at base and deep pink to red in upper half and are brightest before anthesis and then gradually fade with age inflorescences eventually turn grey old flowers remaining as up to 25 large woody follicles develop oval in shape and covered with fine hair follicles can reach long high and wide obovate seed is long and fairly flattened and is composed of wedge shaped seed body proper measuring long and 1 6 1 7 cm in wide and a papery wing one side termed outer surface is dark brown and wrinkled while other is black and smooth both surfaces sparkle slightly seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly same shape as seeds with a depression where seed body sits adjacent to it in follicle seedlings have cuneate cotyledons which measure long and 1 3 1 4 cm in wide these are dull green with three veins and margin of wedge may be red and lined with small teeth hypocotyl is red and measures high seedlings have hairy stems and leaves that are oppositely arranged arising from stem in pairs that are obovate with triangular lobed serrate margins taxonomy robert brown formally described banksia caleyi in his 1830 work supplementum florae novae hollandiae naming it in honour of english botanist george caley type specimen was collected by william baxter inland from king george sound on western australia s south coast in 1829 carl meissner placed b caleyi in series quercinae in his 1856 arrangement of genus on account of its strongly dentate cuneate to obovate leaves as they were defined on leaf characters alone all of meissner s series were highly heterogeneous meissner also described b caleyi variety from material collected by james drummond which was reviewed by alex george and found to be no different from other collections of b caleyi drummond also collected material identified as b caleyi that was named as a distinct species banksia aculeata in 1981 no subspecies of b caleyi itself are recognised george bentham published a thorough revision of banksia in his landmark publication flora australiensis in 1870 in bentham s arrangement number of recognised banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 bentham defined four sections based on leaf style and pollen presenter characters banksia caleyi was placed in section orthostylis in his 1891 work revisio generum plantarum german botanist otto kuntze challenged generic name banksia l f on grounds that name banksia had previously been published in 1775 as banksia j r forst g forst referring to genus now known as pimelea kuntze proposed sirmuellera as an alternative republishing b caleyi as sirmuellera caleyi challenge failed and banksia l f was formally conserved in 1940 in his 1981 monograph genus banksia l f proteaceae alex george placed b caleyi in b subg banksia because its inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike shape in b sect banksia because of its straight styles and b ser tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences he considered its closest relative to be b aculeata which has narrower leaves with fewer larger lobes longer perianths which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red shorter pistils and also differences in follicles seeds and flowering time in 1996 kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of banksia they retained george s subgenera and many of his series but discarded his sections george s b ser tetragonae was found to be monophyletic and therefore retained and their analysis of relationships within series supported placement of b caleyi alongside b aculeata b caleyis placement in thiele and ladiges arrangement may be summarised as follows banksia b subg isostylis 3 species b elegans incertae sedis b subg banksia b ser tetragonae b elderiana b lemanniana b caleyi b aculeata arrangement of thiele and ladiges was not accepted by george and was discarded in his 1999 revision under george s 1999 arrangement b caleyis placement was as follows banksia b subg banksia b sect banksia b ser salicinae 11 species 7 subspecies b ser grandes 2 species b ser banksia 8 species b ser crocinae 4 species b ser prostratae 6 species 3 varieties b ser cyrtostylis 13 species b ser tetragonae b lemanniana b caleyi b aculeata since 1998 austin mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae his analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements but support placement of b aculeata alongside b caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with b ser tetragonae early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring dryandra to banksia and publishing b subg spathulatae for species having spoon shaped cotyledons in this way they also redefined autonym b subg banksia they have refrained from publishing a full arrangement of banksia until dna sampling of dryandra is complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b caleyi is placed in b subg banksia distribution and habitat thumb right distribution in southern western australia banksia caleyi is found near southern coast of western australia from south stirling to west river and northeast to some of its population lies within fitzgerald river national park pp 70 71 often locally abundant it is found in mallee woodland on white sand gravel and sandy clay generally on flat or slightly undulating land annual rainfall is banksia caleyi is classified as not threatened under wildlife conservation act of western australia ecology like many plants in south west western australia banksia caleyi is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent most banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire reseeders are killed by fire but fire triggers release of their canopy seed bank thus promoting recruitment of next generation resprouters survive fire resprouting from a lignotuber or more rarely epicormic buds protected by thick bark b caleyi belongs to group in wild seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire non patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders banksia caleyi has been shown to have a low susceptibility to dieback from soil borne water mould phytophthora cinnamomi unlike most western australian banksias fungal pathogen botryosphaeria has been recovered from b caleyi caterpillar of dryandra moth feeds on leaves though it prefers to eat those of dryandra species that grow alongside it upside down flower spikes drip nectar onto ground or lower leaves suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals which are attracted to scent supporting this hypothesis spiky leaves seem to also prevent access to foragers not at ground level furthermore individual flower structure is similar to banksia attenuata for which honey possum tarsipes rostratus is a major pollinator cultivation seeds do not require any treatment and take 23 to 50 days to germinate in cultivation banksia caleyi is a medium slow growing plant taking four to five years to flower from seed flowers are attractive but are obscured by foliage this species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage nominal soil ph range is from 6 to 7 5 it grows in full sun and partly shaded situations and tolerates light pruning unlike many other western australian banksias banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas such as australia s east coast it attracts pygmy and honey
