irresistible is second studio album by american recording artist jessica simpson released on may 25 2001 through columbia records simpson who began working on project in july 2000 contacted already established writers and producers to collaborate on project including cory rooney rodney jerkins and walter afanasieff in contrast to her debut album sweet kisses 1999 which included more ballads irresistible explored hip hop and r b genres of music simpson described material as mariah carey meets britney spears indicating soulfulness of songs as well as their contemporary appeal lyrical themes addressed in album include love and heartbreak sexuality and self respect sweet kisses which was aimed at an older audience did not perform well commercially and so simpson re evaluated her career at suggestion of her label executives simpson modified her image and sound in irresistible deciding to delve more into teen pop and r b genres as she felt that restyling herself to match image of her contemporaries spears and christina aguilera would help rejuvenate her career after its release irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics most of whom were disappointed by music some of them also felt it was too generic and over produced album debuted at number six on us billboard 200 but quickly fell down charts afterward though albums initial chart placement was an improvement from her previous endeavor it failed to match commercial success of her contemporaries as album went on to sell only about 850 000 copies in united states and two million worldwide it was certified gold by recording industry association of america riaa for shipments of 500 000 copies elsewhere album was not as successful reaching number thirteen in canada and barely cracking top forty in sweden japan and germany two singles were released from irresistible title track album s lead single was commercially successful as it reached top twenty in charts of eleven countries including number eleven on uk singles chart and at number fifteen on us billboard hot 100 it was followed by a little bit which failed to chart in united states but reached a peak position of number sixty two in australia simpson performed songs from irresistible on a number of occasions in 2001 she embarked on her first headlining tour titled dreamchaser tour to promote album background simpson signed a record deal with columbia records in 1998 and next year she released her debut album titled sweet kisses album featured mostly ballads and was targeted at a more mature audience than works of her contemporaries britney spears and christina aguilera simpson even stayed true to her christian beliefs and dressed conservatively unlike her peers album only managed a peak of number twenty five on us billboard 200 far from success of her contemporaries this led simpson to reevaluate her career and although she was enjoying some success she felt she could improve on this feeling her more innocent image would halt her career from developing further simpson adopted a sexier image and newer sound at suggestion of columbia executives she moved into teen pop genre as she felt that restyling herself to match image of spears and aguilera would help remake her career she separated from her then boyfriend nick lachey in march 2001 feeling need to concentrate on her career her new image was promoted through appearances on many events where simpson wore revealing outfits development of this image coincided with production and release of her second studio effort irresistible simpson said that she wanted to portray a sexier more mature style in her new album i recorded sweet kisses when i was 17 years old and i m 21 this month so there is four years of growth involved simpson said in an interview with coventry newspapers in july 2001 in an interview with cosmopolitan in june 2001 she explained this record is about who i am now music is edgier and i m all grown up according to terri author of people in news jessica simpson and nick lachey simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to power of her voice it s not just me singing about being in love i also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs it s going to take me a while to recoup on this album because we spent a lot of money on it simpson said to entertainment weekly development left

kisses she had expressed inconvenience when a track s lyrics were too suggestive or delivered a message she did not agree with and thus asked for its modification however for irresistible she decided to let tommy mottola ceo of columbia take control of whole project he enlisted many established composers and producers for album hand picked each song for track list and rejected those he felt were not so good although she had previously announced that she would write a few songs for her second album simpson does not share songwriting credits on any of tracks on being asked why she said that she was very shy when it came to songwriting and felt that it requires a lot of bravery to write songs she also expressed that she could not find right words for songs and hence did not write for record according to simpson album did not have a definite concept or theme mottola selected songs which they felt were good enough for simpson and compiled them into an album described as being very sexy and more grown up by simpson opening title track was written by swedish duo anders bagge and arnthor birgisson in collaboration with english singer songwriter pamela sheyne birgisson told music technology magazine sound on sound that they started developing song after sheyne proposed title and concept bagge and birgisson developed melody and completed song s lyrics sheyne also sings backing vocals in song a little bit was written by kara dioguardi along with steve morales and david siegal although she had written songs for other artists including kylie minogue and martine mccutcheon song became dioguardi s first writing credit for an artist from her native country simpson said that message behind song is for guys to listen to girl next track forever in your eyes was co written by lachey along with rhett lawrence walter afanasieff long time mariah carey collaborator worked with simpson on three cuts from irresistible one of songs when you told me you loved me was written by afanasieff in collaboration with billy mann in an interview with simpson named song as one of her favorites and said i really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced i like emotion behind that song cory rooney wrote hot like fire solely which simpson described as certainly not kid stuff a song with a lot of attitude louis biancaniello and sam watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for album one of cuts for your love according to simpson is reminiscent of i wanna love you forever 1999 simpson covered gospel hymn his eye is on sparrow as last song of album she said i wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul message is there s so much in life that can get you discouraged but if you trust that you re being watched over you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom it s different for everyone but for me my relationship with god is way i clear out shadows that hang in our lives recording and production selected cory rooney as executive producer of irresistible most of recording and mixing works were done at sony music studios new york city and was completed over a time span of eight months rooney also coordinated recording process while robert williams miked vocals sony s c tube condenser microphone equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick up pattern was used to record vocals in an interview with sony s soundbyte magazine in 2002 williams said of his choice in studio it comes down to what you hear she has such a big range from a whisper to really belting it out and you need a microphone that can handle range without distortion he had used microphone for simpson s first album and felt that it suited her well he also noted that on ballads s s and wet sounds of lips are important to texture of song according to him as simpson s vocals tended to be bright he edited lower ends of her voice to equalize track to mix tracks a sony oxford console was used audio engineer mick guzauski explained to soundbyte that he used console s automated eq feature on tracks he said that he could tailor frequency responses and dynamics within each song with optimum equalizer at every pitch and level for afanasieff tracks background vocals and overdubs were accomplished on oxford console at his wally world studio b at san rafael california simpson s label mate and latin singer marc anthony is featured as a guest vocalist on ballad there you were simpson met anthony at taping of tv special a christmas in washington in 2000 they talked to each other and proposed recording a song on both of their next albums they sang song side by side in studio and whole song was completed within six hours forever in your eyes was one of first songs to be recorded for album and was produced by rhett lawrence it was recorded at sony music studios within two hours rodney jerkins who was acquainted with mottola produced two cuts on irresistible in an interview with sony music japan simpson said that she never met jerkins in person he produced and recorded songs music and sent tape to columbia from which imagination and i never were selected cory rooney produced simpson s vocals and tony maserati mixed vocals initially simpson did not want to record what s it gonna be as she felt line are you gonna be a dog or a gentleman was a little awkward however due to her record label s persuasion she recorded song and ultimately became fond of it in order to record title track simpson traveled to murlyn music studios in sweden a little bit was produced by ric wake although he produced many songs for album only a little bit made final cut japanese version of album contains a bonus track hex hector remix of irresistible for which simpson re recorded her vocals music and lyrics simpson described material as mariah carey meets britney spears very mature but accessible to teens she said that she wanted to blend house r b pop genres into record opening track irresistible is an r b song with dance pop influences it also exhibits elements of pop rock and funk genres while incorporating latin rhythms aside from including a string section track features simpson s breathy vocals spoken passages and a mid section breakdown where her vocals are funk fortified according to author ben graham lyrics of song see simpson stripping her famous virginity image down bob waliszewski of plugged in gave a similar observation of lyrics writing that they point to an imminent sexual compromise a little bit is a dance pop song following same beat oriented pattern as irresistible it features piano instrumentation and simpson sings lyrics as rapid fire verses and with start and stop hooks simpson again adopts breathy vocals and lyrics talk about what she expects from her partner a little more time a little less wait a little more heart a little less break lyrics also demand healthy changes in her relationship forever in your eyes explores elements of latin music as song is backed by spanish guitar and infused with hip hop beats lyrics describe a couple in love lying together all through night there you were is a torchy power ballad which drew comparisons to simpson s previous song where you are 2000 lyrics of song are a homage to protagonist s partner who changed her life song received negative response from critics with some calling it sappy and unnecessary what s it gonna be is a bubblegum pop song influenced by 80s funk music which was compared to outtakes from spears oops i did it again 2000 lyrics deal with simpson expecting a reply from her lover regarding his fear of commitment when you told me you loved me is another power ballad about love this time utilizing a spanish guitar backed by a full 60 piece orchestra song and simpson s vocals were compared to that of mariah carey and celine dion hot like fire which received positive reviews from critics is a funky mid tempo number compared to likes of michael jackson and destiny s child song begins with a faux telephone call between simpson and her friend latter explains that simpson s boyfriend has been cheating on her lyrics sung with hard edge vocals over synth horns hip hop beats and electronica rhythms demonstrate simpson s annoyance at being cheated on by her boyfriend imagination is a song with electronic and r b influences rick de of daytona beach news journal commented that song contained stevie wonder styled funk music to fall in love again and for your love are ballads former is backed by a 60 piece orchestra and peter marsh of bbc music noted it morphs into an r n b tinged slow jam it also contains a jazz breakdown towards its end bob waliszewski wrote that through latter simpson pledges devotion to a partner i never produced by darkchild infuses spanish guitars and has an urban tinge song portrays theme of self respect and has simpson getting rid of her cheating partner closing track cover of hymn his eye is on sparrow is backed by a gospel choir and praises god for watching over his children reviewers called it one of standout tracks from album according to kirsten koba of popmatters simpson sings it with a depth and passion that is lacking on rest of album artwork title and release album artwork for irresistible was shot by alberto tolot in april 2001 front sleeve cover shows simpson wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair dressed in a semi transparent shirt raising it a bit to expose her navel simpson said god gave me my body you know i m just doing what i can to make it look good later in an interview with orlando sentinel she said that album art was a sign of confidence however cover received negative attention from many critics including conservative christian publication plugged in which was a strong supporter of simpson and her virgin image and sweet kisses they stated if anything irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which in conjunction with simpson s general immodesty models a dubious sexual ethic canadian music magazine chart also gave a negative response writing it takes more than wearing see through clothes with airbrushed non existent nipples to show that you have matured a few critics criticized art for being digitally edited while others commented on simpson s similarity to spears japanese version of album has same front sleeve artwork as that of irresistible single title of album was tentatively set to be hot like fire later changed to imagination before being confirmed to be irresistible on march 16 2001 in united states irresistible was initially slated for release on march 20 2001 however due to undisclosed reasons release was pushed to june 5 2001 a listening party was arranged by aol on june 4 2001 a day before album s release date album s release was celebrated with a release party at new york water club simpson rode down manhattan s east river on a yacht decorated with banners for celebration which included a water ski show a fireboat spraying water and fireworks simpson said album s release was a critical moment in her career one which could send her to stardom or obscurity in an interview she said i m right there ready to explode or i could go no one could ever hear from me again she added in united kingdom irresistible was released on july 16 2001 and in japan on may 25 2001 critical reception upon release irresistible received mixed to negative reviews by music critics who said album sounded generic and over produced chuck campbell of daily news gave album a rating of 2 5 out of 5 he said album was nothing but a footnote and remarked that songs sounded too similar to works by spears and aguilera he concluded by commenting on simpson s version of his eye is on sparrow so if her pop fortunes fail perhaps she ll find some contemporary christian singers to imitate teresa gubbins of dallas morning news wrote that it doesn t do much to set her apart it s likable but definitely not distinctive just another formulaic entry into already saturated teen pop field she gave album a grade of c david browne of entertainment weekly gave album a d and said that it should have been called relentless exploiting every cliche in pop 2001 handbook florid ballads seemingly formulated for movie soundtracks it quite literally hits you baby and more than one time although he gave simpson credit for being able to sing he said that she did it in a talent show manner kirsten koba of popmatters commented that irresistible is more reminiscent of trips to dentist s office or any equally oppressive place that only plays adult contemporary schlock barry walters of rolling stone wrote that except hot like fire every other track on irresistible needed remixing he concluded by saying with so many teen pop choices this prom queen cyborg remains redundant and reactionary sal cinquemani of slant called album a lackluster sophomore effort he commented that there was no original note on album and compared tracks to those by spears allmusic critic stephen thomas erlewine graded album 2 5 stars out of 5 and commented that album was filled with frothy sugary pop tunes he said that apart from title track and a little bit none of songs register as songs they re just stylish background music he concluded by commenting it s a bit of inverse of sweet kisses which was too heavy on ballads and like that record this is work of pros so it sounds fine as it plays but it lacks a song as strong as i think i m in love with you to anchor it so it floats away from memory peter marsh of bbc said album sounded like a mixture of spears aguilera carey and dion and wrote that it covered all bases larry printz of morning call called album pleasant palatable modern pop he wrote that album was clearly best of lot and commended simpson s vocals chuck taylor of billboard described what s it gonna be like another bid for chart domination he viewed album as a great step forward for youth pop and sure footing for this
