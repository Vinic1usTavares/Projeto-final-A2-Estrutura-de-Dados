east and west and two angled bastions to front and rear and was an early english example of trace italienne style of fortification popular on continent cowdray engraving of battle of solent in 1545 depicted henry viii visiting castle despite several serious fires it remained in service and saw brief action at start of english civil war in 1642 when it was stormed by parliamentary forces castle was expanded in 1680s by sir bernard de gomme and after a period of neglect in 18th century was redesigned again in 1814 during napoleonic wars after a brief period of use as a military prison in 1840s fortification was expanded in 1850s and 1860s with additional gun batteries on east and west sides defences were upgraded throughout century due to fears of a french invasion and formed part of

southsea castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between england france and holy roman empire in final years of reign of king henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications and while france and empire remained in conflict maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of england seemed unlikely modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but in general fortifications were limited in scale in 1533 henry broke with pope paul iii over annulment of his long standing marriage to catherine of aragon catherine was aunt of charles v holy roman emperor who took annulment as a personal insult this resulted in france and empire declaring an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraging two countries to attack england an invasion of england appeared certain in response henry issued an order called a device in 1539 giving instructions for defence of realm in time of invasion and construction of forts along english coastline immediate threat passed but resurfaced in 1544 with france threatening an invasion across channel backed by her allies in scotland henry therefore issued another device to further improve country s defences particularly along south coast thumb cowdray engraving of castle during battle of solent based on an original painting from between 1545 48 castle was built on southern end of portsea island to protect a deep water channel running through solent to royal naval base at portsmouth work began in early 1544 under overall direction of sir anthony knyvett governor of portsmouth supported by richard cawarden dean of chichester and john chatterton captain of garrison thomas bertie was appointed as master mason it is uncertain who designed castle although knyvett described it as being of his majesty s own device which typically indicated that king had taken a personal role design abandoned earlier use of semi circular bastions which could not be fully covered by flanking fire from supporting walls and instead used an angular design forming an early if imperfect adoption of trace italienne style of fortification already in use in continental europe work was carried out quickly due to risk of a french attack and by july two brass saker guns were mounted on site it cost at least ps3 100 ps1 300 of which came from proceeds of dissolution of monasteries with chalk stone and timber being brought across from neighbouring isle of wight castle was completed by october and formed a fortification with a square keep rectangular gun platforms to east and west and angled bastions to front and rear chatterton was appointed new captain with a team of eight soldiers twelve gunners and a porter castle was well armed with seven brass artillery pieces a culverin demi culverin cannon and demi cannon and eight iron guns french invasion emerged in 1545 when admiral claude d annebault crossed channel and arrived off solent with 200 ships on 19 july landing troops on isle of wight henry s fleet made a brief sortie resulting in battle of solent in which english flagship mary rose was lost before retreating safely behind protective fortifications henry was present in portsmouth at time and cowdray engraving of battle depicts him visiting southsea castle french expedition moved further on along coast on 25 july bringing an end to immediate invasion threat but henry gave orders for additional improvements to fortification to be made that summer including construction of stone flankers and timber caponiers to guard against a potential infantry attack edward vi spent a night at castle in 1552 while inspecting defences of portsmouth 17th century thumb castle in 1756 showing sir bernard de gomme improvements in 1680s in early 1600s england was at peace with france and spain and as a result coastal defences received little attention a survey found southsea castle to be verie ill prepared for defence with no guns mounted along walls or any stocks of powder in march 1626 a serious fire broke out that destroyed interior of keep and generated panic among ships moored nearby damage was not repaired until 1635 when 210 loads of timber was sent from new forest for use in work another serious fire then broke out in 1640 causing damage to lodgings and store rooms at start of english civil war in 1642 fighting broke out around portsmouth between royalist forces led by colonel george goring and parliamentarians under command of colonel richard norton southsea castle was held by royalist captain challoner supported by a small garrison of eleven men and 14 guns and norton decided to attack fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry assault took place at in early hours of morning on 5 september garrison had positioned their guns to point inland so attackers stormed moat on seaward side they then demanded that garrison surrender but challoner who had been drinking heavily with goring night before refused to discuss this and asked them to return later in day a fresh assault began and garrison surrendered without loss of life capture of castle meant left portsmouth s position untenable and town surrendered a significant parliamentarian garrison was then installed in castle to keep it from being retaken castle was primarily used as a prison during interregnum and early days of restoration concerns about a potential dutch attack grew however and in 1665 king charles ii commissioned his dutch born master engineer sir bernard de gomme to carry out a major scheme to improve defences of portsmouth including southsea castle funding and poor organisation meant that work did not begin until 1680s it included constructed an earthwork glacis around castle a new castle gate four projecting turrets and a redesign of central keep a large stone plaque above gatehouse entrance bearing charles coat of arms is dated 1683 when opposition grew in 1688 against catholic king james ii military establishment around portsmouth was controlled by king s illegitimate son james fitzjames duke of berwick revolution broke out and for a period portsmouth and its defences were important to king as a potential exit route for royal family to france by late december however this route was no longer needed george legge baron dartmouth pressurised fitzjames to hand over control of southsea castle to protestant captain carter on 18 december and portsmouth surrendered to revolution two days later traveller celia fiennes who visited castle in 1690 observed that it was very fine but i think it is but of little strength and service 18th 19th

store called was built outside north side of castle by second half of century castle was in poor condition and according to one contemporary account only garrisoned by an old sergeant and three or four men who sell cakes and ale master general of ordnance charles lennox duke of richmond reported in 1785 that it was of too bad a form to deserve expense necessary to repair it and proposed building a more modern fort along coast instead by end of century coastal erosion had destroyed most of 18th century grand battery with outbreak of revolutionary and napoleonic wars at end of 18th century southsea castle s importance increased once again in 1797 a french invasion appeared imminent and castle was urgently readied for action only eight 32 pounder 1 45 kg and five 6 pounder 2 7 kg guns were available and these were in a poor condition in 1813 work was begun to expand castle under direction of major general benjamin fisher fisher had work carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors arguing that it made it easier to contain costs and prevent union activity and project cost an estimated ps18 105 fort was extended north by up to with keep and interior bailey redesigned in brick moat was rebuilt and a counterscarp galley was built round edge most of work was finished by 1814 although final elements were not completed until 1816 thumb right looking west

into management of military offenders in south of england and in 1844 it was decided to bring southsea castle and fort clarence into use as military prisons to reduce pressure on civilian gaols in area and to provide a more suitable military environment for prisoners southsea was used as a prison until 1850 holding 150 offenders under supervision of a royal artillery sergeant who also oversaw remaining artillery defences thumb left rml 9 inch 12 ton 22 8 cm 12 192 kg gun emplacement in west battery c 1890 introduction of shell guns and steam ships in 1840s created a new risk that french might successfully attack along south coast in 1850 with closure of prison seven 8 inch 22 3 cm guns were mounted along walls in brick emplacements but there were concerns about defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside castle to house additional guns in 1856 at end of crimean war there was a large review of fleet along solent attended by queen victoria and numerous tourists naval gunboats launched a mock attack on castle which responded by firing a volley of forty 8 inch guns causing chaos among crowds watching around base of fortification fresh worries about france combined with development of rifled cannon and iron clad warships led to royal commission on defence of united kingdom expressing fears about security of portsmouth in 1860 lieutenant colonel oversaw broader programme of work across country and was supported at southsea by lieutenant colonel fisher new gun batteries with underground magazines were constructed on west and east sides of castle between 1863 and 1869 to form part of a complex enclosed by a defensive wall old castle was used for range and direction finding rather than to house weapons and was left to slowly decline by 1886 site was well armed with 25 rifled muzzle loading guns and design was praised by a visiting russian military engineer by 1890s castle s defences had become obsolete once again due to development of torpedo boats and superior breech loading guns in response five 6 pounder quick firing guns and searchlights were installed to deal with torpedo boat threat and between 1899 and 1901 east battery was converted to hold breech loading guns at a cost of ps16 670 meanwhile in 1785 government had taken possession of southsea common marshland surrounding castle to ensure it remained open and accessible to fort s guns and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out marshes from 1831 onwards surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre seaside facilities were established at start of century and in 1840s new private housing was built around edge of common used by military and naval officers construction of a railway line from london enabled settlement of southsea named after castle to turn into a prosperous resort southsea common was leased by local government in 1884 and as population grew practising firing castle s guns became more difficult 20th
