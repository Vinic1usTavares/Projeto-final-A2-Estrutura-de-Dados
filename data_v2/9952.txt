dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of clade dinosauria they first appeared during triassic period between 243 and 233 23 million years ago although exact origin and timing of evolution of dinosaurs is subject of active research they became dominant terrestrial vertebrates after triassic jurassic extinction event 201 3 million years ago their dominance continued through jurassic and cretaceous periods fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs having evolved from earlier theropods during late jurassic epoch as such birds were only dinosaur lineage to survive cretaceous paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs or birds and non avian dinosaurs which are all dinosaurs other than birds this article deals primarily with non avian dinosaurs dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic morphological and ecological standpoints birds at over 10 000 living species are most diverse group of vertebrates besides fish using fossil evidence paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1 000 different species of non avian dinosaurs dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species birds and fossil remains through first half of 20th century before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs most of scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold blooded most research conducted since 1970s however has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction some were herbivorous others carnivorous evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg laying and nest building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs both avian and non avian while dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal many extinct groups included quadrupedal species and some were able to shift between these stances elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines while dinosaurs modern day surviving avian lineage birds are generally small due to constraints of flight many prehistoric dinosaurs non avian and avian were large bodied largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of and heights of and were largest land animals of all time still idea that non avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias as large sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized many dinosaurs were quite small for example was only about long since first dinosaur fossils were recognized in early 19th century mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around world and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture large sizes of some dinosaur groups as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature have ensured dinosaurs regular appearance in best selling books and films such as jurassic park persistent public enthusiasm for animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science and new discoveries are regularly covered by media etymology taxon dinosauria was formally named in 1842 by paleontologist sir richard owen who used it to refer to distinct tribe or sub order of saurian reptiles that were then being recognized in england and around world term is derived though taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs teeth claws and other fearsome characteristics owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty other prehistoric animals including pterosaurs mosasaurs ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs and dimetrodon while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs being members of clade other groups mentioned are like dinosaurs and pterosaurs members of sauropsida reptile and bird clade except dimetrodon which is a synapsid definition thumb 250px left triceratops skeleton natural history museum of los angeles county under phylogenetic nomenclature dinosaurs are usually defined as group consisting of most recent common ancestor mrca of triceratops and modern birds and all its descendants it has also been suggested that dinosauria be defined with respect to mrca of megalosaurus and iguanodon because these were two of three genera cited by richard owen when he recognized dinosauria both definitions result in same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs dinosauria ornithischia saurischia encompassing ankylosaurians armored herbivorous quadrupeds stegosaurians plated herbivorous quadrupeds ceratopsians herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills ornithopods bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including duck bills theropods mostly bipedal carnivores and birds and sauropodomorphs mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails birds are now recognized as being sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs in traditional taxonomy birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs a distinct superorder however a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy this approach requires that for a group to be natural all descendants of members of group must be included in group as well birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are therefore not extinct birds are classified as belonging to subgroup maniraptora which are coelurosaurs which are theropods which are saurischians which are dinosaurs research by matthew g baron david b norman and paul m barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics phylogenetic analysis by baron et al recovered ornithischia as being closer to theropoda than sauropodomorpha as opposed to traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs they resurrected clade to refer to group containing ornithischia and theropoda dinosauria itself was re defined as last common ancestor of triceratops horridus passer domesticus and diplodocus carnegii and all of its descendants to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs a version of this article appears in print on march 28 2017 on page d6 of new york edition with headline shaking up dinosaur family tree this file contains supplementary text and data supplementary tables 1 3 and additional references supplementary information general description thumb alt montage of four birds in phylogenetic taxonomy birds are included in group dinosauria using one of above definitions dinosaurs can be generally described as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath body many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs such as ichthyosaurs mosasaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs and pelycosaurs especially dimetrodon but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs and none had erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs dinosaurs were dominant terrestrial vertebrates of mesozoic era especially jurassic and cretaceous periods other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches mammals for example rarely exceeded size of a domestic cat and were generally rodent sized carnivores of small prey dinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animals according to a 2006 study over 500 non avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far and total number of genera preserved in fossil record has been estimated at around 1850 nearly 75 of which remain to be discovered an earlier study predicted that about 3 400 dinosaur genera existed including many that would not have been preserved in fossil record by september 17 2008 1 047 different species of dinosaurs had been named in 2016 estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in mesozoic was estimated to be 1 543 2 468 some are herbivorous others carnivorous including seed eaters fish eaters insectivores and omnivores while dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal as are all modern birds some prehistoric species were quadrupeds and others such as anchisaurus and iguanodon could walk just as easily on two or four legs cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits and some extinct species had bony armor although known for large size many mesozoic dinosaurs were human sized or smaller and modern birds are generally small in size dinosaurs today inhabit every continent and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least early jurassic epoch modern birds inhabit most available habitats from terrestrial to marine and there is evidence that some non avian dinosaurs such as microraptor could fly or at least glide and others such as spinosaurids had semiaquatic habits distinguishing anatomical features while recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed upon list of dinosaurs distinguishing features nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to ancestral archosaurian skeleton or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits they are considered typical for dinosauria earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants such modifications originating in most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group are called synapomorphies of such a group a detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by sterling nesbitt confirmed or found following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies some previously known in skull a supratemporal fossa excavation is present in front of supratemporal fenestra main opening in rear skull roof epipophyses obliquely backward pointing processes on rear top corners present in anterior front neck vertebrae behind atlas and axis first two neck vertebrae apex of deltopectoral crest a projection on which deltopectoral muscles attach located at or more than 30 down length of humerus upper arm bone radius a lower arm bone shorter than 80 of humerus length fourth trochanter projection where caudofemoralis muscle attaches on inner rear shaft on femur thigh bone is a sharp flange fourth trochanter asymmetrical with distal lower margin forming a steeper angle to shaft on astragalus and calcaneum upper ankle bones proximal articular facet top connecting surface for fibula occupies less than 30 of transverse width of element bones at back of skull do not meet along midline on floor of endocranial cavity inner space of braincase in pelvis proximal articular surfaces of ischium with ilium and pubis are separated by a large concave surface on upper side of ischium a part of open hip joint is located between contacts with pubic bone and ilium cnemial crest on tibia protruding part of top surface of shinbone arcs curves to front and outer side distinct oriented vertical ridge present on posterior face of distal end of tibia rear surface of lower end of shinbone concave articular surface for fibula of calcaneum top surface of calcaneum where it touches fibula has a hollow profile nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested some of these are also present in which nesbitt recovered as a sister group to dinosauria including a large anterior trochanter metatarsals ii and iv of subequal length reduced contact between ischium and pubis presence of a cnemial crest on tibia and of an ascending process on astragalus and many others thumb left diagram of a typical diapsid jugal bone po postorbital bone p parietal bone sq squamosal bone q quadrate bone quadratojugal bone a variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs however because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs these features are not considered to be synapomorphies for example as diapsids dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of infratemporal fenestrae openings in skull behind eyes and as members of diapsid group archosauria had additional openings in snout and lower jaw additionally several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs or were absent in earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups these include an elongated scapula or shoulder blade a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae three are found in some other archosaurs but only two are found in herrerasaurus and a perforate acetabulum or hip socket with a hole at center of its inside surface closed in saturnalia tupiniquim for example another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from late triassic epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many ways these animals have sometimes been misidentified in literature thumb hip joints and hindlimb postures of left to right typical reptiles sprawling dinosaurs and mammals erect and rauisuchians pillar erect dinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to most modern mammals but distinct from most other reptiles whose limbs sprawl out to either side this posture is due to development of a laterally facing recess in pelvis usually an open socket and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on femur their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of sprawling reptiles erect limbs probably also helped support evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs some non dinosaurian archosaurs including rauisuchians also had erect limbs but achieved this by a pillar erect configuration of hip joint where instead of having a projection from femur insert on a socket on hip upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf evolutionary history origins and early evolution dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during middle to late triassic epochs roughly 20 million years after devastating permian triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 96 of all marine species and 70 of terrestrial vertebrate species approximately 252 million years ago radiometric dating of rock formation that contained fossils from early dinosaur genus eoraptor at 231 4 million years old establishes its presence in fossil record at this time paleontologists think that eoraptor resembles common ancestor of all dinosaurs if this is true its traits suggest that first dinosaurs were small bipedal predators discovery of primitive dinosaur like such as marasuchus and in argentinian middle triassic strata supports this view analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small bipedal predators dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago as evidenced by remains of genus from that period though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives paleontologist max c langer et al 2018 determined that from santa maria formation dates to 233 23 million years ago making it older in geologic age than eoraptor when dinosaurs appeared they were not dominant terrestrial animals terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs their main competitors were pseudosuchia such as aetosaurs ornithosuchids and rauisuchians which were more successful than dinosaurs most of these other animals became extinct in triassic in one of two events first at about 215 million years ago a variety of basal archosauromorphs including became extinct this was followed by triassic jurassic extinction event about 201 million years ago that saw end of most of other groups of early archosaurs like aetosaurs ornithosuchids phytosaurs and rauisuchians rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived at least in some areas at least as late as early mid norian and late norian or earliest rhaetian stages respectively and exact date of their extinction is uncertain these losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs dinosaurs mammals and turtles first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through carnian and norian stages of triassic possibly by occupying niches of groups that became extinct also notably there was a heightened rate of extinction during carnian pluvial event evolution and dinosaur evolution after triassic follows changes in vegetation and location of continents in late triassic and early jurassic continents were connected as single landmass pangaea and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores gymnosperm plants particularly conifers a potential food source radiated in late triassic early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in mouth and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along digestive tract general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into middle and late jurassic where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians and and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods examples of this include morrison formation of north america and tendaguru beds of tanzania dinosaurs in china show some differences with specialized theropods and unusual long necked sauropods like mamenchisaurus ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common but prosauropods had become extinct conifers and were most common plants sauropods like earlier prosauropods were not oral processors but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in mouth including potential cheek like organs to keep food in mouth and jaw motions to grind food another notable evolutionary event of jurassic was appearance of true birds descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians thumb skeleton of marasuchus a dinosaur like by early cretaceous and ongoing breakup of pangaea dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass earliest part of this time saw spread of ankylosaurians iguanodontians and brachiosaurids through europe north america and northern africa these were later supplemented or replaced in africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods also found in south america in asia maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids troodontids and oviraptorosaurians became common theropods and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like psittacosaurus became important herbivores meanwhile australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians hypsilophodonts and iguanodontians stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in late early cretaceous or early late cretaceous a major change in early cretaceous which would be amplified in late cretaceous was evolution of flowering plants at same time several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with dental batteries taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries best exemplified by rebbachisaurid nigersaurus thumb alt full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur displayed in a glass case in a museum early forms herrerasaurus large eoraptor small and a plateosaurus skull there were three general dinosaur faunas in late cretaceous in northern continents of north america and asia major theropods were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids ceratopsians ankylosaurids and in southern continents that had made up now splitting gondwana abelisaurids were common theropods and titanosaurian sauropods common herbivores finally in europe dromaeosaurids iguanodontians nodosaurid ankylosaurians and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent flowering plants were greatly radiating with first grasses appearing by end of cretaceous grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across north america and asia theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores with and ornithomimosaurians becoming common cretaceous paleogene extinction event which occurred approximately 66 million years ago at end of cretaceous caused extinction of all dinosaur groups except for neornithine birds some other diapsid groups such as crocodilians turtles lizards snakes sphenodontians and also survived event surviving lineages of neornithine birds including ancestors of modern ratites ducks and chickens and a variety of waterbirds diversified rapidly at beginning of paleogene period entering ecological niches left vacant by extinction of mesozoic dinosaur groups such as arboreal enantiornithines aquatic and even larger terrestrial theropods in form of gastornis eogruiids bathornithids ratites and terror birds it is often cited that mammals out competed for dominance of most terrestrial niches but many of these groups co existed with rich mammalian faunas for most of cenozoic era terror birds and bathornithids occupied carnivorous guilds alongside predatory mammals and ratites are still fairly successful as mid sized herbivores eogruiids similarly lasted from eocene to pliocene only becoming extinct very recently after over 20 million years of co existence with many mammal groups classification dinosaurs belong to a group known as archosaurs which also includes modern crocodilians within archosaur group dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait dinosaur legs extend directly beneath body whereas legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side collectively dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches saurischia and ornithischia saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with ornithischia while ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with triceratops than with saurischia anatomically these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their pelvic structure early saurischians lizard hipped from greek sauros sauros meaning lizard and ischion iskhion meaning hip joint retained hip structure of their ancestors with a pubis bone directed cranially or forward this basic form was modified by rotating pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups herrerasaurus dromaeosaurids and birds saurischia includes theropods exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets and sauropodomorphs long necked herbivores which include advanced quadrupedal groups by contrast ornithischians bird hipped from greek ornitheios ornitheios meaning of a bird and ischion iskhion meaning hip joint had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird s pelvis pubic bone was oriented caudally rear pointing unlike birds ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward pointing process ornithischia includes a variety of species which were primarily herbivores nb terms lizard hip and bird hip are birds evolved from dinosaurs with lizard hips taxonomy following is a simplified classification of dinosaur groups based on their evolutionary relationships and organized based on list of mesozoic dinosaur species provided by holtz 2007 a more detailed version can be found at dinosaur classification dagger is used to signify groups with no living members dinosauria saurischia lizard hipped includes theropoda and sauropodomorpha early bipedal carnivores theropoda all bipedal most were carnivorous thumb artist s impression

large carnivores including semiaquatic spinosaurids carnosauria allosaurus and close relatives like carcharodontosaurus coelurosauria feathered theropods with a range of body sizes and niches common

hand claws and small heads oviraptorosauria mostly toothless their diet and lifestyle are uncertain small winged theropods or primitive birds small to medium sized bird like with a distinctive toe

as primary armor some had club like tails stegosauria spikes and plates as primary armor new ornithischians ornithopoda various sizes bipeds and quadrupeds evolved a method of chewing using skull flexibility and numerous teeth marginocephalia characterized by a cranial growth pachycephalosauria bipeds with domed or knobby growth on skulls ceratopsia quadrupeds with frills many also had horns biology knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non fossil records including fossilized bones feces trackways gastroliths feathers impressions of skin internal organs and soft tissues many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs including physics especially biomechanics chemistry biology and earth sciences of which paleontology is a sub discipline two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior size alt thumb scale diagram comparing average human to largest known dinosaurs in five major clades current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through triassic early jurassic late jurassic and cretaceous predatory theropod dinosaurs which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during mesozoic most often fall into category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude whereas recent predatory carnivoran mammals peak in category mode of mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between this contrasts sharply with average size of cenozoic mammals estimated by national museum of natural history as about sauropods were largest and heaviest dinosaurs for much of dinosaur era smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat and largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked earth giant prehistoric mammals such as paraceratherium largest land mammal ever were dwarfed by giant sauropods and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size there are several proposed advantages for large size of sauropods including protection from predation reduction of energy use and longevity but it may be that most important advantage was dietary large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals because food spends more time in their digestive systems this also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry and ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments largest and smallest scientists will probably never be certain of largest and smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed this is because only a tiny percentage of animals were ever fossilized and most of these remain buried in earth few of specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing size and morphology of bones to those of similar better known species is an inexact art and reconstructing muscles and other organs of living animal is at best a process of educated guesswork thumb comparative size of argentinosaurus to average human tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is giraffatitan brancai previously classified as a species of brachiosaurus its remains were discovered in tanzania between 1907 and 1912 bones from several similar sized individuals were incorporated into skeleton now mounted and on display at museum fur naturkunde in berlin this mount is tall and long and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between and kilograms and lb longest complete dinosaur is long diplodocus which was discovered in wyoming in united states and displayed in pittsburgh s carnegie museum of natural history in 1907 longest dinosaur known from good fossil material is patagotitan skeleton mount in american museum of natural history in new york is long museo municipal carmen funes in plaza argentina has an argentinosaurus reconstructed skeleton mount long thumb left comparative size of eoraptor to average human there were larger dinosaurs but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils most of largest herbivorous specimens on record were discovered in 1970s or later and include massive argentinosaurus which may have weighed to kilograms 90 to 110 short tons and reached length of some of longest were long diplodocus hallorum formerly seismosaurus long supersaurus and long patagotitan and tallest tall sauroposeidon which could have reached a sixth floor window heaviest and longest dinosaur may have been maraapunisaurus known only from a now lost partial vertebral neural arch described in 1878 extrapolating from illustration of this bone animal may have been long and weighed kg lb however as no further evidence of sauropods of this size has been found and discoverer edward drinker cope had made typographic errors before it is likely to have been an extreme overestimation largest carnivorous dinosaur was spinosaurus reaching a length of and weighing other large carnivorous theropods included giganotosaurus carcharodontosaurus and tyrannosaurus therizinosaurus and deinocheirus were among tallest of theropods largest ornithischian dinosaur was probably hadrosaurid shantungosaurus giganteus which measured largest individuals may have weighed as much as smallest dinosaur known is bee hummingbird with a length of only and mass of around smallest known non avialan dinosaurs were about size of pigeons and were those theropods most closely related to birds for example anchiornis huxleyi is currently smallest non avialan dinosaur described from an adult specimen with an estimated weight of 110 grams and a total skeletal length of smallest herbivorous non avialan dinosaurs included and wannanosaurus at about long each behavior thumb a nesting ground of hadrosaur maiasaura was discovered in 1978 many modern birds are highly social often found living in flocks there is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds as well as in crocodiles birds closest living relatives were also common among extinct dinosaur groups interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on pose of skeletons and their habitat computer simulations of their biomechanics and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches first potential evidence for herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was 1878 discovery of 31 iguanodon bernissartensis ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in bernissart belgium after they fell into a deep flooded sinkhole and drowned other mass death sites have been discovered subsequently those along with multiple trackways suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck billed hadrosaurids may have moved in great herds like american bison or african springbok sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species at least in oxfordshire england although there is no evidence for specific herd structures congregating into herds may have evolved for defense for migratory purposes or to provide protection for young there is evidence that many types of slow growing dinosaurs including various theropods sauropods ankylosaurians ornithopods and ceratopsians formed aggregations of immature individuals one example is a site in inner mongolia that has yielded remains of over 20 from one to seven years old this assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey however this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds crocodiles and other reptiles and taphonomic evidence suggesting mammal like pack hunting in such theropods as deinonychus and allosaurus can also be interpreted as results of fatal disputes between feeding animals as is seen in many modern diapsid predators thumb left artist s rendering of two centrosaurus apertus engaged in intra specific combat crests and frills of some dinosaurs like marginocephalians theropods and lambeosaurines may have been too fragile to be used for active defense and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays though little is known about dinosaur mating and head wounds from bites suggest that theropods at least engaged in active aggressive confrontations from a behavioral standpoint one of most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in gobi desert in 1971 it included a velociraptor attacking a protoceratops providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other additional evidence for attacking live prey is partially healed tail of an edmontosaurus a hadrosaurid dinosaur tail is damaged in such a way that shows animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in madagascar in 2003 involving theropod majungasaurus comparisons between scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during day these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids juravenator and were likely nocturnal large and medium sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians sauropodomorphs hadrosaurids ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral active during short intervals throughout day although small ornithischian was inferred to be diurnal based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as oryctodromeus some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially fossorial burrowing lifestyle many modern birds are arboreal tree climbing and this was also true of many mesozoic birds especially enantiornithines while some early bird like species may have already been arboreal as well including dromaeosaurids such as microraptor most non avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land based locomotion a good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior science of biomechanics pioneered by robert mcneill alexander has provided significant insight in this area for example studies of forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip like tail snapping and whether sauropods could float communication thumb artist s impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a lambeosaurus magnicristatus modern birds are known to communicate using visual and auditory signals and wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups such as horns frills crests sails and feathers suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology reconstruction of plumage color of anchiornis huxleyi suggest importance of color in visual communication in non avian dinosaurs evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain paleontologist phil senter suggests that non avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non vocal acoustic sounds like hissing jaw grinding or clapping splashing and wing beating possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs he states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives crocodilians and birds use different means to vocalize former via larynx and latter through unique syrinx suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute earliest remains of a syrinx which has enough mineral content for fossilization was found in a specimen of duck like dated 69 66 million year ago and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non avian dinosaurs however in contrast to senter researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that syrinx based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx based one rather than two systems evolving independently a 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times following increases in body size crests of and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance though senter states that presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses reproductive biology thumb left alt three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone nest of a plover charadrius all dinosaurs laid amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate dinosaur eggs were usually laid in a nest most species create somewhat elaborate nests which can be cups domes plates beds scrapes mounds or burrows some species of modern bird have no nests cliff nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet primitive birds and many non avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests with males primarily incubating eggs while modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts like crocodiles some non avialan dinosaurs such as troodon exhibited iterative laying where adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid when laying eggs females grow a special type of bone between hard outer bone and marrow of their limbs this medullary bone which is rich in calcium is used to make eggshells a discovery of features in a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and for first time allowed paleontologists to establish sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen further research has found medullary bone in carnosaur allosaurus and ornithopod tenontosaurus because line of dinosaurs that includes allosaurus and tyrannosaurus diverged from line that led to tenontosaurus very early in evolution of dinosaurs this suggests that production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs thumb fossil interpreted as a nesting oviraptorid citipati at american museum of natural history smaller fossil far right showing inside

mother lizard nesting ground in montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods a specimen of mongolian oviraptorid citipati was discovered in a chicken like brooding position in 1993 which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep eggs warm a dinosaur embryo pertaining to prosauropod massospondylus was found without teeth indicating that some parental care was required to feed young dinosaurs trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from isle of skye in northwestern scotland however there is ample evidence of or superprecociality among many dinosaur species particularly theropods for instance non birds have been abundantly demonstrated to have had slow growth rates like egg burying behavior and ability to fly soon after birth both tyrannosaurus rex and troodon formosus display juveniles with clear superprecociality and likely occupying different ecological niches than adults superprecociality has been inferred for sauropods physiology because both modern crocodilians and birds have four chambered hearts albeit modified in crocodilians it is likely that this is a trait shared by all archosaurs including all dinosaurs while all modern birds have high metabolisms and are warm blooded endothermic a vigorous debate has been ongoing since 1960s regarding how far back in dinosaur lineage this trait extends scientists disagree as to whether non avian dinosaurs were endothermic ectothermic or some combination of both after non avian dinosaurs were discovered paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic this supposed cold bloodedness was used to imply that ancient dinosaurs were relatively slow sluggish organisms even though many modern reptiles are fast and light footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic and sluggish remained a prevalent view until robert t bob bakker an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy published an influential paper on topic in 1968 modern evidence indicates that even non avian dinosaurs and birds thrived in cooler temperate climates and that at least some early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means aided by animals bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species evidence of endothermy in mesozoic dinosaurs includes discovery of polar dinosaurs in australia and antarctica as well as analysis of blood vessel structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms scientific debate continues regarding specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved thumb comparison between air sacs of an and a bird in dinosaurs higher metabolisms were supported by evolution of avian respiratory system characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended lungs and invaded many of bones in skeleton making them hollow early avian style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than those of mammals of similar size and build in addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism which is essential for animals that are active but too large to get rid of all excess heat through their skin like other reptiles dinosaurs are primarily that is their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via ureters into intestine in most living species uric acid is excreted along with feces as a waste however at least some modern birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively excreting most of nitrogenous wastes as ammonia they also excrete creatine rather than creatinine like mammals this material as well as output of intestines emerges from cloaca in addition many species regurgitate pellets and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as cretaceous origin of birds possibility that dinosaurs were ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by thomas henry huxley after work of gerhard heilmann in early 20th century theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of idea of their being descendants of generalized with key piece of evidence being supposed lack of clavicles in dinosaurs however as later discoveries showed clavicles or a single fused wishbone which derived from separate clavicles were not actually absent they had been found as early as 1924 in oviraptor but misidentified as an in 1970s john ostrom revived dinosaur bird theory which gained momentum in coming decades with advent of cladistic analysis and a great increase in discovery of small theropods and early birds of particular note have been fossils of yixian formation where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found often with feathers of some type birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives they are most closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs a minority of scientists most notably alan feduccia and larry martin have proposed other evolutionary paths including revised versions of heilmann s basal archosaur proposal or that maniraptoran theropods are ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs only convergent with dinosaurs feathers thumb various feathered non avian dinosaurs including archaeopteryx anchiornis microraptor and feathers are one of most recognizable characteristics of modern birds and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups based on current distribution of fossil evidence it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait though one that may have been selectively lost in some species direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non avian dinosaur groups both among saurischians and ornithischians simple branched feather like structures are known from heterodontosaurids primitive supplement to online journal of vertebrate paleontology october 2013 and theropods and primitive ceratopsians evidence for true vaned feathers similar to flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in theropod subgroup maniraptora which includes oviraptorosaurs troodontids dromaeosaurids and birds feather like structures known as pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaurs suggesting possibility that feather like filaments may have been common in bird lineage and evolved before appearance of dinosaurs themselves research into genetics of american alligators has also revealed that crocodylian scutes do possess feather keratins during embryonic development but these keratins are not expressed by animals before hatching archaeopteryx was first fossil found that revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds it is considered a transitional fossil in that it displays features of both groups brought to light just two years after charles darwin s seminal on origin of species 1859 its discovery spurred nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism this early bird is so dinosaur like that without a clear impression of feathers in surrounding rock at least one specimen was mistaken for compsognathus since 1990s a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found providing even stronger evidence of close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds most of these specimens were unearthed in lagerstatte of yixian formation liaoning northeastern china which was part of an island continent during cretaceous though feathers have been found in only a few locations it is possible that non avian dinosaurs elsewhere in world were also feathered lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from fossil record description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy perhaps most vocal critics have been alan feduccia and who have proposed that some purported feather like fossils are result of decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid dinosaurs skin and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs but convergent with dinosaurs however their views have for most part not been accepted by other researchers to point that scientific nature of feduccia s proposals has been questioned in 2016 it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in amber fossil is about 99 million years old skeleton because feathers are often associated with birds feathered dinosaurs are often touted as missing link between birds and dinosaurs however multiple skeletal features also shared by two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists areas of skeleton with important similarities include neck pubis wrist semi lunate carpal arm and pectoral girdle furcula wishbone and breast bone comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens case for link soft anatomy thumb on left ilium of aerosteon riocoloradensis large meat eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds according to a 2005 investigation led by patrick m o connor lungs of theropod dinosaurs carnivores that walked on two legs and had bird like feet likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons as is case in birds what was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in ancestors of birds o connor said in 2008 scientists described aerosteon riocoloradensis skeleton of which supplies strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird like breathing system ct scanning of fossil bones revealed evidence for existence of air sacs within animal s body cavity behavioral evidence fossils of troodonts mei and demonstrate that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms this behavior which may have helped to keep head warm is also characteristic of modern birds several and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests likely brooding in a bird like manner ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that eggs were primarily brooded by male and that young were highly precocial similar to many modern ground dwelling birds some dinosaurs are known to have used gizzard stones like modern birds these stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once they enter stomach when found in association with fossils gizzard stones are called gastroliths extinction of major groups discovery that birds are a type of dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not in fact extinct as is commonly stated however all non avian dinosaurs estimated to have been 628 1078 species as well as many groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66 million years ago it has been suggested that because small mammals squamata and birds occupied ecological niches suited for small body size non avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small bodied species which led to their downfall when large bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by mass extinction event many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time including ammonites nautilus like mollusks mosasaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs and many groups of mammals significantly insects suffered no discernible population loss which left them available as food for other survivors this mass extinction is known as cretaceous paleogene extinction event nature of event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since 1970s at present several related theories are supported by paleontologists though consensus is that an impact event was primary cause of dinosaur extinction some scientists cite other possible causes or support idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from fossil record impact event thumb chicxulub crater at tip of yucatan peninsula impactor that formed this crater may have caused dinosaur extinction asteroid impact hypothesis which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by walter alvarez and colleagues links extinction event at end of cretaceous to a bolide impact approximately 66 million years ago alvarez et al proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels recorded around world in period s rock stratum was direct evidence of impact bulk of evidence now suggests that a bolide wide hit in vicinity of yucatan peninsula in southeastern mexico creating approximately chicxulub crater and triggering mass extinction scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before impact event some scientists propose that meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in earth s atmospheric temperature while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave consensus among scientists who support this hypothesis is that impact caused extinctions both directly by heat from meteorite impact and also indirectly via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from impact crater reflected thermal radiation from sun although speed of extinction cannot be deduced from fossil record alone various models suggest that extinction was extremely rapid being down to hours rather than years in 2019 scientists drilling into seafloor off mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be day a city sized asteroid smashed into planet deccan traps before 2000 arguments that deccan traps flood basalts caused extinction were usually linked to view that extinction was gradual as flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 million years ago and lasted for over 2 million years however there is evidence that two thirds of deccan traps were created in only 1 million years about 66 million years ago and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction possibly over a period of thousands of years but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event deccan traps in india could have caused extinction through several mechanisms including release into air of dust and sulfuric aerosols which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants in addition deccan trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased greenhouse effect when dust and aerosols cleared from atmosphere before mass extinction of dinosaurs release of volcanic gases during formation of deccan traps contributed to an apparently massive global warming some data point to an average rise in temperature of in last half million years before impact at chicxulub in years when deccan traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction luis alvarez who died in 1988 replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data while his assertion was not initially well received later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim eventually most paleontologists began to accept idea that mass extinctions at end of cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive earth impact however even walter alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on earth even before impact such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced indian deccan traps and these may have contributed to extinctions possible paleocene survivors non avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above cretaceous paleogene boundary in 2000 paleontologist spencer g lucas et al reported discovery of a single hadrosaur right femur in san juan basin new mexico and described it as evidence of paleocene dinosaurs formation in which bone was discovered has been dated to early paleocene epoch approximately 64 5 million years ago if bone was not re deposited into that stratum by weathering action it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into cenozoic other evidence includes finding of dinosaur remains in hell creek formation up to above cretaceous paleogene boundary representing years of elapsed time similar reports have come from other parts of world including china many scientists however dismissed supposed paleocene dinosaurs as re worked that is washed out of their original locations and then re buried in much later sediments direct dating of bones themselves has supported later date with uranium lead dating methods resulting in a precise age of 64 8 0 9 million years ago if correct presence of a handful of dinosaurs in early paleocene would not change underlying facts of extinction history of study dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia although their true nature was not recognized chinese considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such for example guo zhi a gazetteer compiled by chang qu during western jin dynasty 265 316 reported discovery of dragon bones at wucheng in sichuan province villagers in central china have long unearthed fossilized dragon bones for use in traditional medicines a practice that continues today in europe dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be remains of giants and other biblical creatures scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in late 17th century in england part of a bone now known to have been femur of a megalosaurus was recovered from a limestone quarry at cornwell near chipping norton oxfordshire in 1676 fragment was sent to robert plot professor of chemistry at university of oxford and first curator of ashmolean museum who published a description in his natural history of oxford shire 1677 he correctly identified bone as lower extremity of femur of a large animal and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species he therefore concluded it to be femur of a giant human similar to those mentioned throughout ages edward a friend of sir isaac newton published 1699 first scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a sauropod tooth that had been found in caswell near witney oxfordshire thumb left william buckland between 1815 and 1824 rev william buckland first reader of geology at university of oxford collected more fossilized bones of megalosaurus and became first person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal second dinosaur genus to be identified iguanodon was discovered in 1822 by mary ann mantell wife of english geologist gideon mantell gideon mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and bones of modern iguanas he published his findings in 1825 study of these great fossil lizards soon became of great interest to european and american scientists and in 1842 english paleontologist richard owen coined term dinosaur he recognized that remains that had been found so far iguanodon megalosaurus and hylaeosaurus shared a number of distinctive features and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group with backing of prince albert husband of queen victoria owen established natural history museum london to display national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits in 1858 william parker foulke discovered first known american dinosaur in marl pits in small town of haddonfield new jersey although fossils had been found before their nature had not been correctly discerned creature was named hadrosaurus it was an extremely important find hadrosaurus was one of first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found first was in 1834 in maidstone england and it was clearly a bipedal creature this was a revolutionary discovery as until that point most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet like other lizards foulke s discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in united states thumb marsh s 1896 illustration of bones of stegosaurus a dinosaur he described and named in 1877 dinosaur mania was exemplified by fierce rivalry between edward drinker cope and othniel charles marsh both of whom raced to be first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as bone wars feud probably originated when marsh publicly pointed out that cope s reconstruction of an elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed cope had inadvertently placed plesiosaur s head at what should have been animal s tail end fight between two scientists lasted for over 30 years ending in 1897 when cope died after spending his entire fortune on dinosaur hunt marsh won contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with united states geological survey unfortunately many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to pair s rough methods for example their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones a method modern paleontologists would find appalling because explosions from dynamic would potentially destroy any and all evidence despite their unrefined methods contributions of cope and marsh to paleontology were vast marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and cope discovered 56 a total of 142 new species cope s collection is now at american museum of natural history while marsh s is on display at peabody museum of natural history at yale university after 1897 search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent including antarctica first antarctic dinosaur to be discovered ankylosaurid was found on james ross island in 1986 although it was 1994 before an antarctic species theropod was formally named and described in a scientific journal current dinosaur hot spots include southern south america especially argentina and china china in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to unique geology of its dinosaur beds as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization dinosaur renaissance thumb paleontologist robert t bakker with mounted skeleton of a tyrannosaurid gorgosaurus libratus field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in 1970s and is ongoing this was triggered in part by john ostrom s discovery of deinonychus an active predator that may have been warm blooded in marked contrast to then prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold blooded vertebrate paleontology has become a global science major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions including india south america madagascar antarctica and most significantly china amazingly well preserved feathered dinosaurs in china have further consolidated link between dinosaurs and their living descendants modern birds widespread application of cladistics which rigorously analyzes relationships between biological organisms has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs cladistic analysis among other modern techniques helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record timeline of notable dinosaur taxonomic descriptions soft tissue and dna thumb scipionyx from natural history museum of milan italy one of best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in in southern italy discovery was reported in 1998 and described specimen of a small very young coelurosaur scipionyx fossil includes portions of intestines colon liver muscles and windpipe of this immature dinosaur in march 2005 issue of science paleontologist mary schweitzer and her team announced discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68 million year old tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from hell creek formation in montana after recovery tissue was rehydrated by science team when fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from fossilized bone marrow cavity a process called demineralization schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels bone matrix and connective tissue bone fibers scrutiny under microscope further revealed that putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures microstructures even at cellular level exact nature and composition of this material and implications of schweitzer s discovery are not yet clear in 2009 a team including schweitzer announced that using even more careful methodology they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a duck billed dinosaur brachylophosaurus canadensis found in judith river formation of montana this included even more detailed tissue down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells among other materials found in bone was collagen as in tyrannosaurus bone type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its dna and in both cases this collagen was of same type found in modern chickens and ostriches extraction of ancient dna from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions upon further inspection and peer review however neither of these reports could be confirmed however a functional peptide involved in vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds in addition several proteins including hemoglobin have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils in 2015 researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers preserved in bone fossils of six cretaceous dinosaur specimens which are approximately 75 million years old thumb outdated iguanodon statues created by benjamin waterhouse hawkins for crystal palace park in 1853 thumb battles that may have occurred between tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops are a recurring theme in popular science and dinosaurs depiction in culture cultural depictions by human standards dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size as such they have captured popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture entry of word dinosaur into common vernacular reflects animals cultural importance in english dinosaur is commonly used to describe anything that is large obsolete or bound for extinction public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in victorian england where in 1854 three decades after first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains a menagerie of lifelike dinosaur sculptures was unveiled in london s crystal palace park crystal palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed in subsequent decades dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and museums around world ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to animals in an immersive and exciting way dinosaurs enduring popularity in its turn has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science and has frequently spurred new discoveries in united states for example competition between museums for public attention led directly to bone wars of 1880s and 1890s during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in literature film and other media beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in charles dickens bleak house dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of fictional works jules verne s 1864 novel journey to center of earth sir arthur conan doyle s 1912 book lost world iconic 1933 film king kong 1954 godzilla and its many sequels best selling 1990 novel jurassic park by michael crichton and its 1993 film adaptation are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction authors of general interest non fiction works about dinosaurs including some prominent paleontologists have often sought to use animals as a way to educate readers about science in general dinosaurs are ubiquitous in advertising numerous companies have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised
