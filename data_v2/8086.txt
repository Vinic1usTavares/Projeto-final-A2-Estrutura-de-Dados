release on cacophonous return of black death proved influential for christian black metal movement and has sold over 10 000 copies in late 1990s they dubbed their musical style as sorrow metal rather than black metal because black metal movement was publicly affiliated with satanism in norway according to hm magazine progressive elements on debut album martyrium were possibly ahead of their time in norwegian extreme metal scene group has gone through several line up changes over years and currently antestor consists of founding guitarist lars stokstad vemod vocalist ronny hansen vrede bassist

three songs and an outro band is christian and over course of their career have received death threats because of this existence of band itself caused a debate in metal underground for example during early 1990s bard faust of emperor brought up subject when he discussed with euronymous guitarist vocalist from seminal black metal band mayhem in his zine about norwegian scene faust asked don t you think that something is terribly wrong when it has gone so far that we have a christian death metal band here crush evil any advice on how we should kill them euronymous replied to this it s bad enough to have a couple of society bands but a christian band is too much but don t worry we have plans they will not continue for a very long time however band persevered despite these threats antestor was never forced to split apart and in an almost ironic twist of fate jan axel blomberg better known as hellhammer drummer for mayhem was antestor s session drummer on their latest two releases martyrium 1993 1996 in 1993 vegard undal joined band as a bassist and svein sander became their drummer during that time they changed name crush evil to antestor which is latin for to call to

records would subsequently distribute bootleg copies of album in 1997 in an interview drummer armoth said we were in contact with a label called morphine records but that was about signing a deal for martyrium album but we never signed a contract but that guy burrito made several and sold every bit of it illegally cause he didn t have a contract however tape copies circulated in up to fifth generation copies and their audience grew fast martyrium was last album that emphasized band s death doom direction on june 3 1994 antestor appeared on a local television program called where youth

australian unblack metal group horde s 1994 album hellig in article vocalist kjetil molnes explains band s stance on if a christian band can play black metal we identify ourselves as black metal as a music style not black metal as an ideology or belief return of black death 1997 1998 in 1997 antestor recorded a promotional cd titled kongsblod promo cd caught interest of british cacophonous records one of biggest labels with experience in black metal style and helped established groups such as cradle of filth and dimmu borgir start their career cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with antestor in 1998 cacophonous released kongsblod under a different name return of black death and changed original cover art of a famous norwegian painting to artwork by joe a well known american heavy metal cover art creator cacophonous being a secular label releasing material by a band that held christian beliefs generated some interest in metal scene in an interview with art for ears webzine published on december 12 1998 armoth said we sent cd and a short biography they just wanted to sign us because of music and that s exactly what we wanted to do 2 years later in a 2000 interview with finnish christian underground zine issue 4 fanzine s interviewer asked antestor however you had a record deal with cacophonous records ex cradle of filth bal what kind of experiences did you get from that band replied pretty bad actually i can not say they did anything else than released album no money no royalties nothing interviewer also asked did record company set any demands concerning your image antestor replied nothing like that they just said that it is not for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a christian band and they censored words lord and jesus from our lyrics we ourselves removed a few texts because we did not want to provoke unnecessarily translated from finnish return of black death was mostly well received by both christian and non christian black metal fans and critics for example british metal magazines kerrang and terrorizer both gave album 4 points out of 5 musically return of black death is a mixture of black metal and doom metal album relies on hypnotic cold atmosphere and showcases influences from norwegian folk music which led some to label antestor as viking metal unlike previously around this time band themselves said they felt uncertain whether a christian band can play black metal because movement was still strongly associated with satanism drummer svein sander says in 1998 interview forsaken 2000 2009 thumb left upright borgund

went there on april 12 2015 guitarist robert bordevik announced his departure from band after bordevik s departure rolfsen returned to band as their guitarist bordevik also returned to band as their bassist style music while band s style on first publications was primarily death doom with correspondingly slow songs and death growl singing band began playing black metal on 1998 album return of black death on that album band showcased screaming vocals tremolo guitar riffs and drum passages with increased speed typical for black metal genre keyboard is also in a central role which for typical black metal is used to perform epic interludes and dominates soundscapes for example over first three minutes of song sorg only keyboard melody leads performance with third album forsaken band developed more in direction of a more technical style as it is apparent on style of return of black death band s musical development resulted in that forsaken includes several guitar solos also quality of production compared to return of black death improved through introduction of two ex members of vaakevandring style became more melodic and atmospheric lyrics antestor s lyrical themes include hope and despair but also deal with personal christian faith of band members therefore many metal fans oppose classifying antestor s style to category of black metal as their lyrics are often contrary to ideology of black metal lyrics are mostly in english norwegian texts are also rare for group but on album return of black death norwegian language dominates lyrics on this album only part of lyrics are listed in booklet words directly referring to jesus christ and god were omitted song a sovereign fortress dealt with for example acknowledgments of god who protects and supports lyrical i since birth it is portrayed in chorus of this song as sorg norwegian for grief sorrow sadness however deals with themes of sorrow and search for hope with song based on darker imagery and lyrics are not explicitly christian yet are not negative in end an example in norwegian language another song that is also a dark but this takes on christian theme is ancient prophecy lyrics tells that man was sinful and no one can escape court of god antestor process in their lyrics also topics such as suicide doubts about certainty of salvation and longing death all of which are rare themes for a christian band an example from text betrayed from album forsaken appearance thumb left lars stokstad elements of rock 2011 thumb robert bordevik elements of rock 2011 antestor are one of few bands in christian metal scene who use corpse paint in their appearances and on photos one example is booklet photos in album return of black death depicting antestor in norsemen outfits and black and white

paint is same for us as masking is for actors or mimes one way to express certain feelings in battle we are in main purpose is to concentrate on god and not to break a lance in side issues like these reception according to vrede in an interview with intense radio on december 13 2007 by various sources return of black death has sold over 10 000 copies and still keeps selling very few published reviews of band s albums exist yet ones that are available are positive often good and some excellent michael bryzak writes in liner notes of defeat of satan despair that although first album was not officially released until 2000 martyrium was rightfully considered a cult classic group s position in norwegian metal scene was controversial from beginning bryzak writes that standing up for their faith in life and hope antestor received serious death threats during this time from some of major bands and key players of scene when asked if band ever played with other groups in black metal scene antestor said in a 2000 interview with tcu zine we played with some early form of band old man s child once apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs and walked out of venue during our set it was their way of saying screw you christians in liner notes of martyrium antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone for those of you who despised us disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us may god have mercy on your poor souls on antestor s achievements bryzak wrote that birth of northern europe s christian extreme metal scene can be attributed to only one act antestor in 2010 hm magazine ranked return of black death number 40 on their top 100 christian metal albums of all time list with beck stating about album devastatingly dark set standard for christian black metal
