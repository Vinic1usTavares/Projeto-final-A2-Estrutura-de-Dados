dick hoodwinked was among earliest computer animated films to be completely independently funded working apart from a major studio allowed filmmakers greater creative control but also restrained them economically due to film s small budget its animation was produced in philippines with a less realistic design inspired by stop motion films weinstein company did not sign on as film s distributor until near end of production and while company had many roles recast it otherwise made few changes to film structurally film was inspired by non linear crime dramas such as rashomon and pulp fiction it was released shortly after first two installments in successful shrek series which accentuated fairy tale parody genre of which it is a part film however intentionally deviated from that series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements this was in part based on cory edwards concerns over exposing children to high level of cynicism often found in genre critical reception to film was varied although its script and cast were praised by many reviews its animation quality was heavily criticized film was a commercial success earning over thirteen times its less than 8 million budget a sequel hoodwinked too hood vs evil directed by mike disa and written by edwards brothers and leech was released in 2011 to negative reviews and financial failure plot little red riding hood anne

save her granny s recipes she embarked upon a journey to take them to top of a nearby mountain where her granny lives on her way she encountered wolf who asked her a series of suspicious questions she managed to escape and eventually reached her granny s house however she found wolf already waiting in ambush what at first seems to be an open and shut case becomes confused though once it is learned that wolf is an investigative reporter he reveals that he was searching for a lead on identity of goody bandit and had reason to believe that red and granny were culprits locating red along with his squirrel assistant twitchy cory edwards he questioned her hoping to get to bottom of mystery when red escaped he headed for her granny s house and arriving first went undercover hoping to trick her

production hoodwinked was one of first independent computer animated films to be produced without aid of a distributor it was produced on a budget of less than 8 million significantly less than a typical computer animated film s budget costs of computer animation software had only recently decreased to a price that was accessible to more than just major studios and according to producer david lovegren six or seven years ago idea of doing hoodwinked as an independent animated feature would have been impossible filmmakers only made film independently by necessity and cory edwards has said it s not a model to be followed it was a once in a lifetime seat of your pants kind of thing that just barely came off however he added that process was worth going through to get film made and encouraged aspiring filmmakers to be willing to follow it development thumb left film s production was privately financed by entrepreneur maurice kanbar brothers cory and todd edwards founded blue yonder films after a number of years spent producing commercials and music videos in tulsa joined by their friend preston stutzman who was put in charge of marketing for company they released their first feature film chillicothe at 1999 sundance film festival three then moved to los angeles in pursuit of new opportunities but did not find amount of success that they had expected sue bea montgomery who had served as an associate producer on chillicothe also tried to interest studios in working with them but was met with indifference she determined that they would have to find greater success in independent filmmaking before anyone would take interest in them and introduced three to maurice kanbar a successful entrepreneur who had made a minor investment in chillicothe they pitched a number of live action ideas to kanbar and proposed that he invest in a development division of their company paying them and covering their rent in exchange for a significant portion of rights to any scripts that they might sell kanbar however was interested in a more direct approach and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film he had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct to dvd computer animated short film that cory had made called wobots he suggested possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist and gave them a month to come up with a story idea kanbar had expressed interest in cinderella or pinocchio but edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by walt disney a few days after brothers initial meeting with kanbar todd found inspiration in non linear crime dramas such as rashomon pulp fiction run lola run and memento and came up with idea of telling fairy tale little red riding hood as a police investigation using multiple points of view kanbar was taken with idea and agreed to fully finance film before even seeing a finished script with initial intent of releasing film directly to dvd in 2002 kanbar and montgomery founded kanbar entertainment and kanbar animation for production of film cory served as film s main director as he had more experience with animation comedy and children s entertainment while todd served as co director montgomery and stutzman were joined by disney animation veteran david lovegren as producers on film and cory s and todd s sister katie hooten joined as an associate producer tony leech who had worked with edwards brothers on chillicothe was initially hired as an editor but gained story input as well he eventually proved to be so valuable to production that he was given a role as co director pre production thumb left alt a drawing of little red riding hood standing next to wolf hoodwinked is a parody of european fairy tale little red riding hood filmmakers found independently producing film to have both benefits and challenges although they were given a great amount of creative control by their executive producer maurice kanbar their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to story once production was underway todd edwards related that money doesn t just buy you more talent and more machinery it also buys you flexibility on a story level at disney if they don t like third act they just throw whole thing out and re animate whole thing even if it s finished we had no such luxury and so in a way you re watching our first version of movie knowing ahead of time their inability to alter film s script once animating had begun an effort was made by filmmakers to finalize script as much as possible before start of production which is not a common practice for studio produced animated films turning away from well known archetypes of little red riding hood characters filmmakers continued to look towards non linear crime dramas for inspiration instead producer preston stutzman explained that whole film is about surprises and secret lives not wanting red to be boring or too innocent she was patterned on james dean and given desire of leaving home to find her way in world todd edwards had idea of basing wolf on chevy chase s character in fletch feeling that it would be fun to apply character s dry deadpan style of humor to an animated wolf while cory edwards created hyperactive character of twitchy to serve as wolf s foil going against types red s granny was written as a thrill seeking action hero while strong woodsman was written as being childishly incompetent police officers were written to come across as everyday guys and cory edwards has explained that decision to make three of them pigs was not politically motivated nicky flippers was not a part of story as it was initially conceived and prior to his creation investigation was going to be led by chief grizzly after producer sue bea montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between film and 1950s television series thin man edwards brothers and leech decided to introduce character and his dog into film as an homage they considered several different types of animals before settling on making him a frog thumb cory edwards right alt a photograph of cory edwards director and co writer cory edwards also co wrote two of film s songs performed one of them and voiced character twitchy cory edwards chose to approach film predominantly as an action comedy instead of as a typical animated film and wrote script to appeal to audiences of any age like many of films produced by pixar or disney road runner rocky and bullwinkle and muppets have all been cited as inspirations for film an attempt was made to distance film from shrek and other similar themed films that had been recently released by excluding magic wizards and fairies from film cory edwards also strived for a different style of humor than shrek choosing to make his film more family friendly and less of a satire working out of tony leech s apartment cory edwards sketched film s storyboards todd edwards wrote script while simultaneously writing songs and leech edited story reel on his mac computer producer sue bea montgomery showed test screenings of story reel to children in her neighborhood and gained input from their reactions filmmakers had been considering removing japeth but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings children also particularly liked twitchy which led to expansion of character s role in an effort to save costs film s cast was originally going to be composed mostly of friends and family members of filmmakers cory and todd brought in their cousin tye edwards to play dolph and turned to their friend joshua j greene to play jimmy lizard japeth was written specifically for benjy gaither son of gospel music singers bill and gloria gaither he had been a friend of edwards brothers since childhood and cory s short film wobots had been produced through his animation studio live bait productions cory s wife vicki was given role of a skunk reporter and while some consideration was initially given to having an adult play child woodpecker quill role was instead given to producer david k lovegren s daughter kathryn edwards brothers leech and producer preston stutzman all took on roles as well cory took on role of twitchy and pro tools was used to speed up recording of his dialogue by 50 percent todd played sandwich man leech played both det bill stork and glen and stutzman played timmy as producers gained greater confidence in film however larger name actors were brought in patrick warburton was first celebrity actor to join film and did so purely out of a love for script though cory edwards had originally envisioned wolf as sounding like a mixture between a young chevy chase and bill murray he praised warburton s performance saying that he made wolf his own character andy dick also joined cast early on to voice boingo he used improvisation and approached role differently from how it had been written interpreting character as victimized and unstable filmmakers were enthusiastic over dick s angle on character and todd edwards said what we had written was kind of stock to be honest but andy dick well where he was supposed to laugh he d be crying where he was supposed to yell he d be laughing he just mixed it up prolific voice performers tara strong david ogden stiers and tom kenny were cast in multiple roles strong was cast as red and zorra stiers was cast as kirk woodsman and nicky flippers and kenny was cast as tommy and woolworth sheep emmy winning actress sally struthers was brought in to play granny puckett and joel mccrary was cast as chief grizzly animation film s animation was created on maya software and in an effort to save costs was produced in manila philippines producers sue bea montgomery and david k lovegren founded animation studio digital eyecandy for purpose of film s production and stationed it in a 5 000 square foot rented house cory edwards traveled to this studio a total of fifteen times over course of film s three year production and has explained that although house was located in an expensive part of manila rent was no more than that of his two bedroom apartment in los angeles when cory was not able to be on site todd took over directing duties along with tony we were kind of a three headed monster cory explains we all knew what movie we were making and i trusted those guys to make creative calls when i couldn t be there lovegren had attempted to start an independent animation studio in philippines before in 2001 but studio called imagineasia was closed after it failed to attract business digital eyecandy hired approximately twenty animators that had previously been employed by imagineasia and at one point studio reached fifty employees film s animators had little experience with computer animation and feature length films and had to be trained by producers over course of film s production since none of animators were specialists they were not divided into specific teams but instead each worked on all areas of animating process filmmakers found this to be a poor method though because it kept individual skills of animators from being optimized due to their independent backgrounds animators were accustomed to working at fast paces and despite their small numbers each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time still schedule and budget restraints led filmmakers to enlist prana studios in mumbai india to perform lighting and compositing filmmakers found that most difficult aspect of producing film independently was their inability to fix all of mistakes made in film s animation todd edwards explained that it becomes an equation i have 10 things that i would like to change in this shot i have time and budget to do three pick those three and then let s move on and that was hard to do knowing that they could not match quality of other computer animated films film was instead designed to imitate look of stop motion cory edwards cited rankin bass as an inspiration and explained if we approach our look like that photographed miniatures in stop motion and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look then we re not going to shoot ourselves in foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures edwards contrasted technically innovative but critically panned 1986 film howard duck with simple but beloved puppet character kermit frog to illustrate to his crew importance of well written likeable characters over technical quality distancing film from what producer preston stutzman called candy coated brightly colored pastel world s of other cg animated films an attempt was made to bring an organic look to film and dirt was rubbed into colors nightmare before christmas was cited as an inspiration for filmmakers to try to bend characters shapes into extremes and many other choices unconventional to computer animated films were also made for example one of woodsman s eyes was made bigger than other and red was given only four fingers so as to make her look more like a doll producer katie hooten explained that cg in past has been pushing envelope to make things look more realistic but hoodwinked takes things back to where cg looks a lot more like a cartoon music film s score was composed by john mark painter who along with his wife fleming mcwilliams constituted rock duo fleming and john in 1990s edwards brothers were fans of group and first met painter while cory was performing in an animated film on which painter served as composer score was inspired by music from 1960s and soundtracks to planet of apes dark shadows and untouchables have been cited as influences as well as works of henry mancini it was recorded in nashville tennessee where kristin wilkinson served as orchestrator and conductor in an effort to appeal to older audience members todd edwards chose to replace parts of painter s score with original rock music from this came song little boat written and sung by daniel rogers who had composed edwards first film chillicothe runaway was written by joshua j greene a friend of edwards brothers who also provided voice of jimmy lizard in film real g sung by cory edwards and bounce sung by todd collins were both written by painter and cory edwards blow your house down was performed by filipino band pupil and written by their lead singer ely buendia todd edwards wrote nine original songs for film and sung four of them critters have feelings tree critter eva deanna and glow eva deanna was written about a day that he and his wife spent at zoo with their niece daughter of associate producer katie hooten glow was written about edwards siblings grandmother vera who had died a few years earlier great big world was sung by anne hathaway and replaced another song called woods go round which edwards considered too childish and described as being in vein of saturday morning cartoons this change required scene to be re animated and re cut be prepared was sung by benjy gaither and developed out of a practicality filmmakers wanted to introduce japeth while character is rocking back and forth on his horns as though horns are a rocking chair however they realized that this would make horns too big to fit in a later on in film as a solution they came up with gag of having character switch his horns several times and this led to song s concept mcwilliams joined jim belushi to sing schnitzel song and painter asked his longtime friend ben folds to sing red is blue a selection strongly advocated for by edwards folds was working on a new album at time but a year after proposal found opportunity to record song and compose a piano arrangement for it as well top of woods was sung by andy dick and was originally composed to be slow paced recording of dick s performance was sped up though at suggestion of ralf palmer a prolific animator and friend of producer sue bea montgomery distribution thumb left 150 px harvey pictured here in 2011 and bob weinstein distributed hoodwinked as one of weinstein company s first films hoodwinked was shown to potential distributors throughout various stages of its production though a distribution offer was made by dreamworks it was turned down as filmmakers did not feel that it was a good deal as film neared end of production it was screened at cannes film festival harvey and bob weinstein were also at festival at time screening robert rodriguez s film sin city which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio weinstein company they decided to pick hoodwinked up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by rodriguez s wife whose attorney also happened to work for blue yonder films weinsteins had recently left walt disney company and according to cory edwards they loved idea of picking up an animated film and giving disney a run for their money involvement of weinstein company encouraged kanbar enough to enlist skywalker sound film was nearly complete by time that weinsteins became involved and edwards has stated that nothing was done by them to ruin original vision of movie however a few edit suggestions were made to quicken film s pace which edwards felt were good ideas as he considered first twenty minutes to be dragging weinstein company also heavily recast film with bigger name actors in hopes of attracting a larger audience anne hathaway replaced tara strong in lead role of red jim belushi replaced david ogden stiers in role of kirk woodsman anthony anderson replaced tony leech in role of det bill stork glenn close replaced sally struthers in role of granny puckett xzibit replaced joel mccrary in role of chief grizzly and chazz palminteri replaced tom kenny in role of woolworth sheep despite these recastings tara strong retained much smaller role of zorra david ogden stiers retained role of nicky flippers tom kenny retained role of tommy and tony leech retained role of glen many high profile country singers were considered to replace benjy gaither in role of japeth but none of them were available and gaither retained role weinsteins also wanted to replace joshua j greene in role of jimmy lizard with a more famous actor such as albert brooks but role was ultimately not recast edwards appreciated reason for recastings and attributed a large part of film s financial success to them he expressed disappointment about amount of recasting however saying at a certain point it became recast o rama everybody got recast happy my feeling is you get two or three names on that poster you re fine our hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it after a certain point i don t think you need more than two three celebrities give it to voice actors it sweetens pot since film s animation had already been mostly completed by time recastings were made new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as old actors had done giving them no opportunity to improvise edwards expressed disappointment with fact that original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in film which were copied by replacement actors soundtrack soundtrack was released in december 2005 owing to legal disputes cd was pulled off of market a month after its release and was not available again until november 2009 it was re released on itunes in january 2010 release hoodwinked received a one week limited release in los angeles on december 16 2005 to qualify for oscar consideration a

have wit or animation quality to compete with likes of shrek franchise on metacritic it received a score of 45 out of 100 based on 29 critics indicating mixed or average reviews james berardinelli of reelviews gave film two and a half stars out of four and claimed that many of film s ideas for altering its familiar storyline sound better on paper than they turn out in execution finding it tedious to view film s story told multiple times he wrote that film slips into boredom bruce westbrook of houston chronicle also gave film two and a half stars and although he praised its snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations he considered film s plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation peter rainer writing for christian science monitor gave film a c and called it a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn t quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children he was not overly critical of film but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to high standards for computer animated films set by pixar jami bernard of new york daily news suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic and faulted film for its attempt to be hip and current while ty burr of boston globe praised film s vocal performances he wrote hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania one aches to think what great looney tunes directors could have done with this material several critics however were more enthusiastic about film owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly gave hoodwinked an a and praised zaniness of its humor calling filmmakers heroes he compared them to quentin tarantino and steven soderbergh due to their potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation although nancy churnin of dallas morning news considered film inferior to those of pixar and dreamworks she still gave it a b and wrote it s got an upstart charm a clever premise appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make you laugh out loud more than once in his review for chicago tribune michael wilmington praised film s voice cast music and script and wrote it packs more verbal wit and surprise than usual cartoon kevin thomas of los angeles times gave it three and a half stars out of five calling it high energy imaginative entertainment japeth was praised amongst both positive and negative reviews gleiberman and churnin both felt that character was one of best parts of film and westbrook and wilmington both described him as a hoot in a mostly positive review for orlando sentinel roger moore called character hilarious while in a mostly negative review for variety justin chang wrote that character steals show every minute he s onscreen one of main criticisms of film was poor quality of its animation berardinelli called it some of worst cgi animation in memory he felt that characters looked plastic considered backgrounds dull and wrote on more than one occasion i thought i was watching something made for tv when compared to today s visual standards for animated films hoodwinked is far below curve burr considered film s surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to with naugahyde westbrook felt that animation worked well for animal characters but wrote humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness much like work done in early days of cg that art has come too far to embrace a throwback like hoodwinked as quaint it s simply dated stephen hunter of washington post compared characters to rubber toys and wrote their faces are without nuance or vividness in movement especially do they lack grace and conviction it seems like recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed poor edwards fellows as it looks stuck somewhere in 1970s or maybe even earlier many reviews negatively compared film to shrek series liam lacey of globe and mail considered film to be a sort of discount shrek while burr called it shrek with added westbrook wrote that echoing such a popular predecessor as shrek is not a good thing especially when echo is so faint berardinelli felt that fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in first shrek film while bernard felt that hoodwinked took fairy tale revisionism too far he felt that humor in shrek worked due to fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout film and wrote it s pointless to scold them for behaving way fairy tales intended and that s far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms bill muller of arizona republic considered red s kung fu abilities to be overly similar to princess fiona s matrix agility gleiberman also noted similarities between film and shrek but he was positive in comparison feeling that its independent production gave filmmakers freedom to follow their corkscrew whims while wilmington did not find hoodwinked as impressive or beguiling as shrek he wrote that when it s cooking it does make you laugh retrospectively several critics noted that film was considerably better than 2007 computer animated fairy tale parody film happily n ever after although burr had given hoodwinked a negative review he likened film to citizen kane in comparison to happily n ever after wilmington also considered hoodwinked superior of two films and lou lumenick of new york post felt that film was far than happily n ever after while christy lemire of associated press likened hoodwinked to a poor man s shrek she went on to call happily n ever after a poor man s hoodwinked in 2018 richard brody of new yorker called hoodwinked one of top independent films for families acknowledging crudeness of animation he nonetheless praised writing as bold and funny and wrote that direction displays admirable comic timing brody considered character personalities distinct from those in other animated comedies he also commended vocal performances for having a zippy brash energy that doesn t feel condescending hoodwinked has also been praised by tony bancroft who co directed mulan hoodwinked received a saturn award nomination for best animated film at academy of science fiction fantasy horror films but lost to corpse bride entertainment weekly ranked film as number ten on must list for its january 27 2006 issue calling it a genre busting indie animated gem analysis in february 2006 author timothy sexton wrote an article titled hoodwinked a postmodern examination of dangers of runaway capitalism for associated content in which he posited that hoodwinked was one of first postmodern animated films and that film also carried political undertones he argued that relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from original fairy tale as film explored story from each of central characters points of view calling hoodwinked most subversive movie released nationwide since fahrenheit 9 11 sexton went on to interpret film as a critique on free enterprise system he drew comparisons between film s villain and typical american business owner going so far as to say that character was clearly based on people like bill gates and sam walton in sexton s view film exposed flaws of capitalism showing that if left unregulated business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition film s director and co writer cory edwards was surprised by sexton s interpretation and denied that film intentionally carried any political messages he explained that he and other filmmakers were simply drawing from evil schemes common of james bond films bugs bunny cartoons and a team and wrote if mr sexton sees my movie as a sermon against mega corporations monopolizing america that s fine but our villain is just as easily face of every dictator in history or every schoolyard bully who is compensating for low self esteem or any mafia boss who dominates by either absorbing or wiping out his competition hey if you look at an abstract painting and see devil in a red splotch that s your prerogative i guess a movie s message is only partially supplied by filmmaker in may 2007 time magazine ran an article by james poniewozik titled is shrek bad for kids which considered negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires instead of original stories poniewozik mentioned hoodwinked writing i thought hoodwinked and most of shrek series were hilarious but even if you ultimately reject their messages old school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary there s something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre satirized skepticism critique and revision having been done for them by mama birds of hollywood cory edwards wrote into magazine expressing his similar sentiments and writing as writer director of hoodwinked it may surprise you that i couldn t agree more with james poniewozik s article even as i was making film i asked myself same question are we parodying something that kids should have chance to experience first un parodied we went to great lengths to distance our film from humor and no i don t think shrek considers kids i would hope that hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters rather than look for next joke at expense of innocence we all need real folklore of fairytales whether we admit it or not sequel a sequel hoodwinked too hood vs evil was released on april 29 2011 it was first announced in january 2006 and in february cory edwards todd edwards and tony leech explained that although they would be writing screenplay they would not return to direct cory edwards later elaborated on this decision explaining that he had a negative experience working with some of first film s key players and felt that he had been poorly treated by them he also cited concerns over being confined to animation and stated that he felt it would be a lateral move to direct a sequel to his first film as his second film in march 2007 edwards announced that mike disa had been hired to direct sequel and expressed enthusiasm over his involvement saying that he has a real passion for film and a devotion to maintaining hoodwinked world he wants to do sequel justice and he really gets what we re trying to do although much of first film s cast returned for sequel anne hathaway was replaced by hayden panettiere in role of red and jim belushi was replaced by martin short in role of kirk woodsman kanbar entertainment initially intended to finance production of sequel independently as it had done with first film but entered into a co financing agreement proposed by weinstein company film was initially scheduled to be released on january 15 2010 but in december 2009 weinstein company postponed film s release date indefinitely in april 2010 kanbar entertainment brought a lawsuit against weinstein company in addition to claiming that postponement of film s release date breached an agreement between two companies lawsuit accused weinstein company of not contributing to monthly production accounts after february 2009 neglecting to consult kanbar entertainment of a release strategy and not responding to proposed changes to film even though kanbar entertainment held final authority on production decisions film was a financial failure earning 16 9 million worldwide only about half of its budget critical reception to film was almost universally negative with a rotten score of 11 across 61 reviews on rotten tomatoes and a score of 20 100 on metacritic cory edwards expressed disappointment with finished film indicating that it was heavily altered from original script and saying that it was deflating to give this thing away and watch others run with it in ways i would not references external links category 2006 films category 2006
