rock martin ptyonoprogne fuligula is a small passerine bird in swallow family that is resident in central and southern africa it breeds mainly in mountains but also at lower altitudes especially in rocky areas and around towns and unlike most swallows it is often found far from water it is 12 15 cm 4 7 5 9 in long with mainly brown plumage paler toned on upper breast and underwing coverts and with white windows on spread tail in flight sexes are similar in appearance but juveniles have pale fringes to upperparts and flight feathers former northern subspecies are smaller paler and whiter throated than southern african forms and are now usually split as a separate species pale crag martin rock martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a slow flight with much gliding its call is a soft twitter this martin builds a deep bowl nest on a sheltered horizontal surface or a neat quarter sphere against a vertical rock face or wall nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers and may be built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man made structures such as buildings dam walls culverts and bridges it is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years this species is a solitary breeder and is not gregarious but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches and are incubated by both adults for 16 19 days prior to hatching both parents then feed chicks fledging takes another 22 24 days but young birds will return to nest to roost for a few days after first flight this small martin is caught in flight by several fast agile falcon species such as hobbies and it sometimes carries parasites but it faces no major threats because of its range of nearly 10 million km2 4 million sq mi and large apparently stable population it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as least concern on iucn red list taxonomy rock martin was formally described in 1842 as hirundo fuligula by german physician explorer and zoologist martin lichtenstein and was moved to new genus ptyonoprogne by german ornithologist heinrich gustav reichenbach in 1850 reichenbach 1850 plate lxxxvii figure 6 its nearest relatives are three other members of genus pale crag martin p obsoleta of north africa dusky crag martin p concolor of southern asia and eurasian crag martin p rupestris turner 1989 pp 158 164 genus name is derived from ancient greek ptuon ptuon a fan referring to shape of opened tail and procne prokne a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow specific name fuligula means sooty throated from latin fuligo soot and gula throat brookes 2003 pp 596 660 three ptyonoprogne species are members of swallow family and are placed in subfamily hirundininae which comprises all swallows and martins except very distinctive river martins dna sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within hirundininae broadly correlating with type of nest built groups are core martins including burrowing species like sand martin nest adopters which are birds like tree swallow that utilise natural cavities and mud nest builders ptyonoprogne species construct open mud nests and therefore belong to last group hirundo species also build open nests delichon house martins have a closed nest and cecropis and petrochelidon swallows have retort like closed nests with an entrance tunnel genus ptyonoprogne is closely related to larger swallow genus hirundo but a dna analysis showed that a coherent enlarged hirundo should contain all mud builder genera although nests of ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical hirundo species like barn swallow dna research suggested that if delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus as is normally case cecropis petrochelidon and ptyonoprogne should also be split off subspecies there are several subspecies differing in plumage shade or size although differences are clinal and races interbreed where their ranges meet small pale former subspecies obsoleta arabica and found in mountains of north africa arabian peninsula and southwest asia are now normally split as a separate species pale crag martin following german ornithologist jean cabanis who first formally described these birds but changes in size and colour are continuous and forms often intergrade where they meet so evidence for separate species is not strong southern forms of rock martin can weigh more than twice as much as smallest northern subspecies of pale crag martin average weight for p f fusciventris is 22 4 g 0 79 oz against 10 g 0 35 oz for p o obsoleta dunning 1993 p 327 robust large billed southernmost forms p f fuligula p f pretoriae and p f anderssoni are sufficiently different from dark fine billed p f fusciventris that latter could also be regarded as a potentially different species however rhodesian ornithologist michael irwin collected specimens from southern zimbabwe then rhodesia which were dark above like p f fusciventris and rich reddish below like p f fuligula this led him to suggest that two groups had previously been isolated but were probably hybridising following secondary contact subspecies subspecies authority range f fuligula lichtenstein 1842 eastern cape nominate subspecies p f pusilla zedlitz 1908 mali to western sudan and most of

square tail that has small white patches near tips of all but central and outermost pairs of feathers it has a cinnamon chin throat upper breast and underwing coverts with rest of underparts being a similar brown to upperparts eyes are brown small bill is mainly black and legs are brownish pink sexes are similar in appearance but juveniles have pale edges to upperparts and flight feathers other subspecies differ from nominate form as detailed above rock martin s flight is slow with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat winged glides and it is more acrobatic than larger eurasian crag martin it is a quiet bird song is a muffled twitter and other calls include a resembling call of common house martin a nasal vick mullarney et al 1999 p 240 and a high pitched twee contact call rock martin is much than most african swallows and confusion is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins of genus riparia pale crag martin is smaller paler and greyer than its southern relative although only slightly larger than sand martin and brown throated sand martin rock martin is more robust has white tail spots and lacks a breast band it is paler on throat breast and underwings than all dark form of brown throated sand martin sinclair et al 2002 p 298 distribution and habitat rock martin breeds in suitable habitat in africa north to nigeria chad and ethiopia it is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding this species has been recorded as a vagrant in gabon and its status in congo is uncertain snow perrins 1998 pp 1058 1059 retrieved 21 november 2012 natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs gorges and caves up to 3 700 m 12 000 ft above sea level baker 1926 pp 238 239 but this martin also breeds in lowlands especially if rocks or buildings are available and may be found far from water it readily uses man made structures as a substitute for natural precipices behaviour breeding rock martin pairs often nest alone although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form with up to 40 pairs these martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions two broods are common and three have been raised in a season breeding mainly august to september nest built by both adults over several weeks is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers it may be a half cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff or bowl shaped like that of barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge nest may be built on a rock cliff face in a crevice or on a man made structure and is re used for second brood and in subsequent years clutch is usually two or three buff white eggs blotched with sepia or grey brown particularly at wide end average egg size in south africa was 20 8 x 14 1 mm 0 82 x 0 56 in with a weight of 2 17 g 0 077 oz both adults incubate eggs for 16 19 days prior to hatching and feed chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly fledging time can vary from 22 24 days to 25 30 days though latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to nest for food feeding rock martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight although it will occasionally feed on ground when breeding birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to nesting territory at other times they may hunt low over open ground insects caught depend on what is locally available but may include mosquitoes and other flies hymenoptera ants and beetles this martin often feeds alone but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on fleeing insects and outside breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant cliff faces generate standing waves in airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas crag martins exploit area close to cliff when they hunt relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns a study of nine bird species including four hirundines showed that more young there are in a nest more frequent are parents feeding visits but visits do not increase in proportion to number of young on average a solitary nestling therefore gets more food than a member of a pair or of a trio since nestling period is not prolonged in proportion to drop in feeding rate an individual fledgling from a larger brood is likely to weigh less when it leaves nest however a subspecies of rock martin p f fusciventris was an anomaly in respect of both feeding rate and nestling time there was no difference in parental feeding rate for members of a pair and members of a trio but nestling period averaged 1 5 days longer for trios than pairs predators and parasites some falcons have speed and agility to catch swallows and martins in flight and rock martins may be hunted by species such as peregrine falcon simmons robert e jenkins andrew r brown christopher j a review of population status and threats to peregrine falcons throughout namibia in 2008 pp 99 108 falcon african hobby and wintering eurasian hobby barlow et al 1997 p 165 rock martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts 2000 p 241 which sometimes forcibly take over martin s nests in 1975 one of first findings of tick argas a was in a nest of ptyonoprogne f fusciventris in kenya at that time martin was described under its synonym ptyonoprogne fuligula fischer reichenow status rock martin has a very large range of 9 5 million km2 3 7 million sq mi total population is unknown but bird is described as generally common although scarce in botswana and namibia population is thought to be stable mainly due to absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats its large range and presumably high numbers mean that rock martin is not considered to be threatened and it is classed as least concern on iucn red list notes references cited texts external links rock martin species text in atlas of southern african birds
