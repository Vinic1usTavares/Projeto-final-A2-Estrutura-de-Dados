agaricus hondensis commonly known as felt ringed agaricus is a species of fungus in family agaricaceae species was officially described in 1912 by mycologist william alphonso murrill along with three other agaricus species that have since been placed in synonymy with a hondensis found in pacific northwest region of north america a hondensis fruits in fall under conifers or in mixed forests fungus produces fruit bodies mushrooms with white to gray brown caps up to in diameter covered with pale pinkish brown scales that darken in age tightly packed gills on cap underside are initially white before becoming pinkish lilac gray and finally brownish as spores mature stout stipe is bulbous and has a thick white felt like ring mushroom is poisonous and causes severe gastrointestinal upset if consumed it has an unpleasant odor similar to phenol or creosote and develops a soapy metallic taste when cooked agaricus hondensis can be distinguished from similar agaricus species by differences in geographic range habitat staining reaction and odor systematics species was first described as new to science by american mycologist william alphonso murrill in 1912 based on collections he made in november 1911 under californian redwoods in same publication murrill also described species agaricus bivelatoides a hillii and a macmurphyi all from pacific northwest region of north america latter two were named to honor their original collectors albert hill and james ira wilson respectively while former was named for its resemblance to a in 1944 alexander h smith examined type material of several of murrill s species and concluded that were no characters to separate a hondensis from a bivelatoides a hillii or a macmurphyi he also determined that sanford myron zeller s a glaber published as new in 1938 was also same species as a hondensis nomenclatural database mycobank considers these names synonymous epithet hondensis refers to type location la honda california mushroom is commonly known as felt ringed agaricus agaricus hondensis has traditionally been classified in section xanthodermatei a grouping of agaricus species related to a that are characterized by fruit bodies with phenolic odors temporary yellowing discolorations in some parts of fruit body a negative schaeffer s reaction and toxicity a molecular analysis has shown that it along with related species a freirei and a comprise a basal lineage in a clade of related sylvan species that have weak yellowing reactions and some tendencies toward reddish bruising reactions this lineage is closely related to a group of agaricus species that are typically placed in section phylogenetic evidence suggests that these three species belong to a clade that diverged shortly after presumed split of sections xanthodermatei and description thumb left thick skirtlike ring flares outward from stipe cap is initially convex before flattening out and reaches a diameter of dry and smooth cap surface is whitish or has pale pinkish brown to pinkish gray to fawn colored flattened fibrils or fine fibrillose scales at least in center in maturity fibrils usually darken to brown reddish brown or reddish gray but in one northern form fibrils are darker brown from beginning flesh is thick and white when bruised or injured flesh either does not change color or may stain pale yellowish then often slowly discolors pinkish odor of crushed flesh is mild or faintly phenolic but is usually distinctly phenolic in base of stipe gills are initially pale pinkish to pinkish gray before becoming brown then chocolate brown or darker when spores mature in maturity gills are free from attachment to stipe and are packed close together with little intervening spaced between them stipe is long and thick but with a thicker or bulbous base firm smooth and lacking scales found on cap stipe is white but discolors dingy pinkish or brownish in age or after handling flesh in extreme base usually stains pale yellowish when bruised partial veil is membranous white and forms a thick felt like ring on upper portion of stipe ring is skirtlike but often flares outward instead of collapsing against stipe a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on cap turns yellow thumb agaricus hondensis spores 1000x spore prints are purplish brown to chocolate brown smooth thick walled spores are broadly ellipsoidal and typically measure 5 8 7 3 by 3 7 4 4 mm basidia spore bearing cells are four spored club shaped hyaline translucent and measure 20 21 3 by 5 8 7 0 mm cystidia on gill edge cheilocystidia are sac shaped to club shaped hyaline to pale yellowish brown in color and have dimensions of 18 3 25 6 by 7 3 11 0 mm there are no cystidia on gill face pleurocystidia similar species distinctive field characteristics of agaricus hondensis include its woodland habitat yellow staining reaction with koh and its odor agaricus freirei closely resembles a hondensis and based on similarities in dna sequences is a close relative a freirei is found in coastal regions of spain a hondensis has also been confused with a and a placomyces a sylvaticus does not have foul smelling flesh and has a negative koh reaction a placomyces is found from midwestern united states eastward another lookalike edible a has similar overall coloration but is distinguished from a hondensis by a mild odor a shaggy stipe and a less substantial ring habitat and distribution a saprobic species fruit bodies of agaricus hondensis grow scattered or in groups under conifers or in mixed forests they have also been reported to grow in fairy rings fungus is found in pacific coast of north america from british columbia in canada south to california but is most common in california mushroom fruits in fall from september to october throughout much of its range but in california fruiting season tends to be from november to february toxicity agaricus hondensis mushrooms are toxic and consuming fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis some fruit bodies smell of creosote an odor that becomes even more prevalent if mushrooms are cooked cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy metallic flavor fruit bodies are used as food by vagrant shrew sorex vagrans and american shrew mole relatively high levels of chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies see also list of agaricus species references external links hondensis
