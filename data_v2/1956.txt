sydney for 52 years until 1999 sydney hailstorm caused a 1 7 billion in insured damage in becoming costliest natural disaster in australian history conditions and climatology thumb right 240px barometric map for 9 00 am from newman s bureau of meteorology report of storm during spring and summer conditions along east coast of australia are highly conducive for formation of hailstorms variation of air temperature in atmosphere with warm and humid air close to ground and colder air above it causes instability and cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones whitaker 2005 p 93 since records began in 1791 hailstorms in month of january form approximately 13 of total number of hailstorms in sydney metropolitan area and over 15 of all events with large hail schuster et al 2005a pp 1641 1643 hailstorms have a history of significant damage in australia since records on insured losses began in 1967 four hailstorms sydney in 1986 1990 and 1999 as well as brisbane in 1985 have featured on top ten list of most insured damages caused by a single australian natural disaster hailstorms caused more than 30 of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in australia during this period and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in new south wales schuster et al 2005b p 1 conditions on new year s day 1947 were sound for formation of a storm day was hot and humid with maximum temperature recorded during day being and humidity reaching 73 newman 1947 p 27 many travelled to beaches along coastline to benefit from afternoon sea breeze general weather pattern for sydney in summer is movement from west to east from over blue mountains to across city and into tasman sea progression of storm thumb right 240px path of centre of storm over sydney metropolitan region developing from blue mountains to south west of sydney in morning of 1 january 1947 storm cell was first identified at 10 00 am by weather observers at mascot newman 1947 p 26 formation of storms in this region is not unusual especially given hot and humid conditions at ground level which causes atmospheric instability however bureau of meteorology reported that formation of storm was different from most others describing how underpart of cloud was mottled and serrated or rather than and looked angry black while false cirrus tufts were discernible at top storm cell dropped hailstones size of billiard balls across south western suburbs of sydney it moved directly over liverpool at 2 25 pm heading in a north east direction before slowly bending its path and travelling almost due east as it passed over southern part of central business district large explosion like sounds presumed to be thunder by bureau were heard around sydney harbour bridge whitaker 2005 96 sounds were described by bureau who were based at observatory hill next to southwest pylon of bridge in 1947 as a terrific noise akin to several trains passing over bridge storm intensified as it cut through suburbs and eventually unleashed its full power across eastern suburbs of sydney suburbs most seriously affected were surry hills south of central district as well as bondi and rose bay in waverley region which were struck at around 2 40 pm hailstorm pelted beach goers particularly at bondi beach and situation was described by a second world war veteran as though he was back in firing line overseas hail in coastal regions was described as being of similar size to a cricket ball aftermath thumb right 240px trams on eastern suburbs route from central station to circular quay via pitt street suffered damage from hail most damage was caused when storm was its most intense over eastern suburbs of city according to bureau of meteorology over 5000 roofs were damaged in waverley by lumps of hail which weighed up to no official cost total exists for amount of damage caused by 1947 hailstorm however a reuters article published in new york times on 2 january estimated preliminary damage to be worth around us 3 million equivalent to gbps750 000 this is approximately equal to a 45 million in modern figures placing it well below costliest natural disasters in australian history this given severity of storm cell is attributable mainly to relative inexpensiveness of buildings and other items of era hunter 1998 more definite historical accounts exist for damage caused to certain buildings historic skylight which runs through centre of main central railway station building was smashed and shards reportedly fell in sizes up to on around 100 waiting passengers convertible cars in fashion at time of storm also sustained severe damage mainly punctures to soft top roofs and trams that ran through eastern suburbs at time also suffered damage according to veteran meteorologist richard whitaker sydney was staggered by enormity of incident as there had not been even a remotely similar storm in living memory problems were exacerbated due to a lack of building materials available for use in repair work a result of second world war which had concluded only 18 months prior this contributed to delays which resulted in houses still covered with only temporary tarpaulins several years later most of approximately 1000 injuries were caused by hailstones directly striking people or from flying debris with latter mainly from shattered windows newman 1947 p 24 of these between 200 and 350 people required hospitalisation or other medical attention however figures vary between different sources storm struck during afternoon of a public holiday new year s day which produced hot and humid conditions and beaches in eastern suburbs were significantly populated beach goers were exposed to large hail when storm cell reached coastline and according to front page report in sydney morning herald following day f or nearly three hours ambulance wagons travelled from eastern suburbs beaches with injured hailstones which fell during 1947 event were not matched in sydney for 52 years until 1999 hailstorm which caused a 1 7 billion in insured damage costliest natural disaster in australian
