spongiforma is a genus of sponge like fungi in boletaceae family newly described in 2009 genus contains two species s thailandica and s squarepantsii type species s thailandica is known only from khao yai national park in central thailand where it grows in soil in old growth forests dominated by dipterocarp trees rubbery fruit bodies which has a strong odour of coal tar similar to consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore producing tissue s squarepantsii described as new to science in 2011 is found in malaysia it produces sponge like rubbery orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky odour these fruit bodies will like a sponge resume their original shape if water is squeezed out origin of specific name derives from its perceived resemblance to cartoon character spongebob squarepants apart from differences in distribution s squarepantsii differs from s thailandica in its colour odour and spore structure description fruit bodies of spongiforma species have a brain like to sponge like form and grow on surface of ground they do not have a stalk and lack a layer of outer skin small cavities locules of fruit body are irregular in outline and measure between in diameter they are lined with a smooth greyish orange to brown or reddish brown hymenium spore bearing tissue with sterile ridges that range in colour from white to cream columella a column like structure extending up into fruit body is poorly developed pear shaped cream coloured and attached at base to white rhizomorphs basidiospores are brown to vinaceous brown in mass almond shaped bilaterally symmetrical and finely wrinkled spores bear a central apiculus a region that was once attached to sterigmata at end of a basidium and a small apical pore spores are reddish brown in water violet grey in 3 potassium hydroxide inamyloid and cyanophilic turning red in stain acetocarmine basidia are four spored and do not discharge spores forcibly cystidia are common on sterile locule edges they are hyaline translucent and range in shape from cylindrical to ventricose swollen in middle or rostrate with a beaklike proboscis hyphae of flesh are gelatinous and inamyloid clamp connections are absent from hyphae taxonomy and naming type species s thailandica was first described scientifically in 2009 by egon horak timothy flegel and dennis e desjardin based on specimens collected in july 2002 in khao yai national park central thailand and roughly three years later in same location before this s thailandica had been reported and illustrated in a 2001 thai publication as an unidentified species of s squarepantsii was first described scientifically in 2011 in journal mycologia authored by a team headed by desjardin with kabir and thomas bruns description was based on two specimens collected by bruns in 2010 in lambir hills national park in sarawak malaysia species was first mentioned in scientific literature in 2010 in a study of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms in a tropical dipterocarp rainforest in lambir hills although it was not formally described in this publication genus name spongiforma refers to sponge like nature of fruit body specific epithet thailandica denotes country in which type species is found epithet squarepantsii honors well known cartoon character spongebob squarepants unusual epithet garnered species attention in popular press phylogeny and classification molecular analysis of dna sequences of internal transcribed spacer it region of s thailandica showed that species was part of boletineae one of several lineages of boletales recognized taxonomically at level of suborder similarity between s thailandica and s squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis which showed a 98 match between large subunit ribosomal dna sequences of two a value typical of many species in same genus of boletaceae spongiforma is sister sharing a common ancestor to genus porphyrellus spongiforma and porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to strobilomyces all three genera are members of boletaceae family phylogenetic relationships determined by molecular techniques are not consistent with a classification scheme based on similarities in spore morphology several bolete taxa have been proposed to accommodate species with reddish brown to vinaceous brown finely wrinkled rugulose to perforated or punctate spores these include boletus subgenus tylopilus tylopilus subgenus porphyrellus austroboletus or porphyrellus austroboletus tristis and a longipes two species from southeast asia share several spore characteristics with spongiforma thailandica all three species have spores with rugulose surfaces sometimes with minute punctures and spores turn purple in potassium hydroxide additionally pores from three species share similar surface ornamentation visible with scanning electron microscopy in contrast to spongiforma however austroboletus spores do not have an apical pore genetic analysis shows that spongiforma is more closely allied with smooth spored porphyrellus than with rugulose punctate spored austroboletus thumb right alt electron micrograph showing several dozen ellipsoid spores with rough surfaces and a distinct pore in each spores of s squarepantsii scale bar 10 mm relatively few boletes have an apical pore at distal end of their basidiospores dark reddish brown smooth spores of porphyrellus are truncate with a thin walled depression some species of heimioporus have spores with apical pores but molecular analyses demonstrate that heimioporus is only distantly related to spongiforma spongiforma further resembles austroboletus and porphyrellus species in cellular structure of cap cuticle pileipellis arrangement known as a trichodermium features outermost hyphae emerging roughly parallel like hairs perpendicular to surface of fruit body trichodermium comprises chains of short cylindrical to somewhat moniliform cells resembling a string of beads with terminal end cells that are cylindrical to club shaped this cellular arrangement is similar to that present in sterile edges of tissues that demarcate locules in spongiforma according to desjardins and colleagues this may represent vestiges of what was once cap cuticle or peridial tissue in an ancestor spongiforma is only genus of boletales that forms above ground fruit bodies that lack a peridium and have many exposed locules lined with basidia that do not forcibly discharge spores ecology habitat and distribution both species of spongiforma are known only from their original collection locations s thailandica was found growing on ground in an old growth forest in khao yai national park nakhon province thailand at an elevation of about fungus is thought to grow in a mycorrhizal association with shorea and gracilis species considered to be endangered and critically endangered respectively by international union for conservation of nature spongiforma squarepantsii was collected from ground where it was growing solitarily under undetermined dipterocarp trees in lambir hills national park sarawak state malaysia northern borneo this tropical rainforest receives about of rain yearly with average temperatures ranging from spongiforma species have lost ability to eject their spores forcefully and have distinctive odours suggesting that fungus relies on activity of animals to help disperse spores because island habitat of genus restricts gene flow and because two known species are separated by considerable distance geographically authors suggest that other unexplored isolated tracts of dipterocarp forests between thailand and malaysia may contain additional species references external links category boletaceae category boletales genera
