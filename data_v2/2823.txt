operation sandstone was a series of nuclear weapon tests in 1948 it was third series of american tests following trinity in 1945 and crossroads in 1946 and preceding ranger like crossroads tests sandstone tests were carried out at pacific proving grounds although at enewetak atoll rather than bikini atoll they differed from crossroads in that they were conducted by atomic energy commission with armed forces having only a supporting role purpose of sandstone tests was also different they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of effects of nuclear weapons three tests were carried out in april and may 1948 by joint task force 7 with a work force of 10 366 personnel of whom 9 890 were military successful testing of new cores in operation sandstone tests rendered every component of old weapons obsolete even before third test had been carried out production of old cores was halted and all effort concentrated on new mark 4 nuclear bomb which would become first mass produced nuclear weapon more efficient use of fissionable material as a result of operation sandstone would increase u s nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in june 1948 to 169 in june 1949 origins thumb

weapons were developed during world war ii by manhattan project which created a network of production facilities and weapons research and design laboratory at los alamos national laboratory two types of bombs were developed mark 1 little boy a gun type fission weapon using uranium 235 and mark 3 fat man an implosion type nuclear weapon using plutonium these weapons were not far removed from their laboratory origins a great deal of work remained to improve ease of assembly safety reliability and storage before they were ready for production there were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended during war that had not been possible under pressure of wartime development norris bradbury who replaced robert oppenheimer as director at los alamos felt that we had to put it bluntly lousy bombs plutonium was produced by irradiating uranium 238 in three 250 mw nuclear reactors at hanford site in theory they could produce of plutonium per megawatt day or about per month in practice production never approached such a level in 1945 when only between was produced per month a fat man core required about of plutonium of which 21 plutonium production fell off during 1946 due to swelling of reactors graphite neutron moderators this is known as wigner effect after its discoverer manhattan project scientist eugene wigner these reactors were also required for production by irradiation of bismuth 209 of polonium 210 which was used in initiators a critical component of nuclear weapons some of bismuth 209 had to be irradiated for 100 days to produce 600 curies of polonium 210 a little over because polonium 210 has a half life of only 138 days at least one reactor had to be kept running oldest unit b pile was therefore closed down so that it would be available in future investigation of problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found uranium 235 was derived from enrichment of natural uranium at y 12 plant and k 25 site in oak ridge tennessee improvements in processes and procedures of electromagnetic and gaseous isotope separation between october 1945 and june 1946 led to an increase in production to around of uranium 235 per month which was only enough for one of very wasteful little boys a fat man was 17 5 times as efficient as a little boy but a ton of uranium ore could yield eight times as much uranium 235 as plutonium and on a per gram basis plutonium cost somewhere between four and eight times as much to produce as uranium 235 which at this time cost around 26 per gram weapon development 1945 48 objectives of sandstone series of tests were to test nuclear cores and initiators improve theory and knowledge of implosion type weapons test levitated cores test composite cores and determine most economic designs in terms of efficient use of fissionable material levitation meant that instead of being immediately inside tamper there would be an air gap between tamper and core which would be suspended inside on wires this would allow tamper to gain more momentum before striking core principle was similar to swinging a hammer at a nail versus putting hammerhead directly on nail and pushing as hard as possible in order for this to work outside laboratory wires had to be strong enough to withstand being dropped from an aircraft but thin enough to not disturb spherical symmetry of implosion theoretical division at los alamos known as t division had run computer calculations on levitated core as early march 1945 use of levitated core had been proposed during planning for operation crossroads but it had been decided instead to use existing solid core christy design this was named after its designer robert christy for sandstone however it was decided that at least two of three tests would use levitated cores motivation behind composite core was to make better use of available fissionable material use of uranium 235 in an implosion weapon instead of inefficient gun type little boy was an obvious development however while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium 235 it fissions faster because it makes better use of neutrons its fission produces on other hand slower reaction of uranium 235 permits assembly of super critical masses making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields by july 1945 oppenheimer and groves were considering using both materials in a composite core containing of plutonium and of uranium 235 composite cores became available in 1946 los alamos priority then became development of an all uranium 235 core by january 1948 national stockpile contained 50 cores of which 36 were composite christy cores nine were plutonium christy cores and five were composite levitated cores testing new levitated composite and uranium 235 cores would require at least three test firings more efficient weapons would require less efficient initiators this meant that less polonium would be required at time of sandstone national stockpile of polonium beryllium initiators consisted of 50 a class initiators with more than 25 curies of polonium and 13 b class initiators with 12 to 25 curies during sandstone at least one test would be conducted with a b class initiator preparations organization thumb right briefing on pictured are colonel t j sands captain james s russell dr d k froman brigadier general david a ogden major

commission s director of military applications brigadier general james mccormack and his deputy captain james s russell met with bradbury and john henry manley at los alamos on july 9 to make arrangements for tests they readily agreed that they would be scientific in nature with los alamos supplying technical direction and armed forces providing supplies and logistical support cost of tests around 20 million was divided between department of defense and atomic energy commission lieutenant general john e hull was designated as test commander rear admiral william s parsons and major general william e kepner reprised their operation crossroads roles as deputy commanders joint task force 7 was formally activated on october 18 1947 as its commander hull was answerable to both joint

scientific director darol k froman from los alamos laboratories set out with a group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in pacific enewetak atoll was chosen as test site on october 11 island was remote but with a good harbor and an airstrip it also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea an important consideration in view of what had happened at bikini atoll during operation crossroads as trust territory of pacific islands was a united nations trust territory administered by united states united nations security council was notified of upcoming tests on december 2 atoll was inhabited by dri enewetak who lived on aomon and dri enjebi who lived on bijire their original homes had been on enewetak and enjebi but they had been moved during war to make way for military bases population about 140 in number had been temporarily relocated to meck island during operation crossroads this time ujelang atoll an uninhabited atoll southwest of enewetak was selected as a relocation site a naval construction battalion group arrived there on november 22 to build accommodation and amenities military authorities met with local chiefs on december 3 and they agreed to relocation which was carried out by by december 20 an lst and four douglas c 54 skymaster aircraft were placed on standby to evacuate in case it was affected by fallout but were not required unlike crossroads tests which were conducted in media spotlight sandstone tests were carried out with minimal publicity on april 15 there was still discussion in washington about whether or not there should be any public announcement of tests at all hull opposed making any announcement until after series was completed but aec commissioners felt that news would leak out and united states would look secretive it was therefore decided to make a last minute announcement there was no announcement of purpose of tests and only cursory press releases on 18 may after series was over hull held a press conference in hawaii but only permitted media to quote from written statements construction enjebi aomon and runit islands were cleared of vegetation and graded level to make it easier to install required instrumentation and a causeway was built between aomon and bijire so instrument cables could be run from test tower on aomon to control station on bijire detonations were ordered so that later test areas would suffer minimal fallout from earlier shots army component task group 7 2 was responsible for construction work it consisted of provisional

used a levitated composite core it was detonated on enjebi just before sunrise at 06 17 on april 15 1948 with a yield of 37 kilotons efficiency of utilization of plutonium was about 35 that of uranium 235 was 25 or more this was somewhat higher than los alamos prediction observers watching from ships in lagoon saw a brilliant flash and felt radiant heat a condensation cloud in diameter quickly enveloped fireball which glowed within cloud it took 45 to 50 seconds for thunderous roar of explosion to reach observers about 20 minutes later launched a helicopter to check on cable winch which was to collect samples it also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in lagoon b 17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through clouds and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from crater unfortunately it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later thumb left yoke explosion alt fireball cloud lights up clouds in red and yellow like a sunrise yoke yoke nuclear device used a levitated all uranium 235 core it was detonated on aomon just before sunrise on may 1 1948 at 06 09 a day late due to unfavorable winds observers saw a similar flash and felt same heat as x ray blast but wide condensation cloud was larger and sound of explosion more forceful one observer likened it to sound of a paper bag which is forcefully burst in a small room they were correct its yield of 49 kilotons made it largest nuclear detonation up to that time but it was considered inefficient and wasteful of fissile material zebra zebra third test and last of sandstone series was detonated on runit just before sunrise at 06 04 on may 15 1948 this test was characterized by aec chairman david lilienthal as hardest and most important test of three by using one of b class initiators it demonstrated that these could still be used with confidence observers perceived flash and blast as similar to previous two tests but this time base of condensation cloud was at which gave observers an unobstructed view of fireball which therefore appeared to be brighter and last longer than other two looks were deceiving its levitated uranium 235 core produced a yield of 18 kilotons thumb right

radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting one of men who had carried out procedure for yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too but was discharged on 28 may once again drone tank gave trouble and bogged in crater but soil samples were retrieved by backup drone tank both tanks were subsequently dumped in ocean outcome successful testing of new cores in sandstone tests had a profound effect practically every component of old weapons was rendered obsolete even before third test had been carried out bradbury had halted production of old cores and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on mark 4 nuclear bomb which would become first mass produced nuclear weapon more efficient use of fissionable material would increase nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in june 1948 to 169 in june 1949 mark iii bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950 at same time new production plants were coming online and wigner effect problem had been solved by may 1951 plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947 while uranium 235 production had increased eight fold chief of armed forces special weapons project major general kenneth d nichols saw clearly that era of scarcity was over he now recommended that we should be thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds notes references external
