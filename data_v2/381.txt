way i see it is third album by american r b singer songwriter and producer raphael saadiq it was released on september 16 2008 by columbia records after independently releasing 2004 album ray ray saadiq continued working on other artists projects and developed a partnership with audio engineer charles brungardt who shared singer s fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment in 2008 he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded way i see it primarily at his north hollywood studio with engineer saadiq and brungardt disregarded their previous experience in recording production while making way i see it instead they experimented with older recording techniques in an attempt to recreate motown music aesthetic of 1960s producing a traditional soul album that draws on motown sound and philadelphia soul styles saadiq whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends way i see it was initially overlooked by consumers but charted steadily on billboard 200 and eventually sold 282 000 copies in united states by 2011 it also performed well in european countries such as france where it charted for 51 weeks album received mostly positive reviews from critics and was seen as an exemplary release of classic soul revival at time it garnered saadiq a newer more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of album performing concerts in us europe and asia background after releasing his second studio album ray ray in 2004 saadiq continued working as a producer composer and instrumentalist on other recording artists music he was introduced to audio engineer charles brungardt through production and songwriting team jake and phatman who had worked on ray ray brungardt interned at blakeslee recording company saadiq s north hollywood recording studio and eventually became his principal sonic partner on projects two shared a fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment they also studied 2006 book recording beatles together and had an interest in knowledge of recording gear by engineers and technicians for english rock band beatles brungardt increased his engineering output and in 2007 saadiq enlisted him to engineer and mix english singer joss stone s studio album introducing joss stone which saadiq produced while vacationing in bahamas and costa rica in 2008 saadiq observed people there listening to classic soul music and was inspired to pursue it as a musical direction for his next album he recounted experience in an interview for blues soul saying that i was like wow maybe i should tap into this vibe because it s actually what i love i realised that though you can hear it in many of records i ve done throughout my career i d never paid 100 attention to going in that direction before so difference this time is that i took a more focused route as a part of tony toni tone during late 1980s and 1990s saadiq had incorporated influences from music of motown in his songwriting for group before recording way i see it saadiq signed to columbia records label executive rick rubin visited saadiq s home studio and was impressed by his material there he said of rubin s visit and advice to him as a solo artist he told me to never box myself in i just have to be myself you ve got to follow your own path i ve always gone down road less traveled but now i do it even more aggressively recording and production after returning from his vacation saadiq started writing and recording way i see it which took four months in an interview for sound on sound he discussed his comfort level when returning to blakeslee recording company music for this album flowed organically naturally and since i have my own studio i was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right i was able to live with it day after day and i think that had a lot to do with how album turned out he wrote songs extemporaneously often by playing guitar and improvising riffs he subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time including guitar bass and basic piano parts that he planned to include on recordings he attributed this secluded approach to state of industry and idealized bounc ing ideas off other people do some writing with them take material to my band and say ok let s cut it with orchestra already there that s my dream i d crank records out weekly if i had staff writers like they did at stax and motown saadiq recorded mostly at blakeslee recording company additional sessions took place at harmonie park studios in detroit and music shed studios in new orleans while recording he immersed himself in a composite character of classic soul singers from videos he watched including al green gladys knight pips four tops and temptations he recorded his vocals with only brungardt present in studio a preference he felt prevented him from looking for answers from somebody who may not really know saadiq said he tended to record complete takes and if something isn t quite right but it s got a feel that i know i can never ever capture again i ll leave it even if it s flat i mean there are flat parts on my record because it s not about perfection it s about soul he recorded background vocals for all songs saadiq played most of instruments including drums guitar piano sitar and bass guitar his instrument of choice throughout his career he viewed bass playing of james jamerson as an integral part of motown recordings citing it as inspiration for his own bass sound on album saadiq worked with other musicians including joss stone percussionist jack ashford string arranger paul riser multi instrumentalist bobby ozuna singer cj hilton and recording artist stevie wonder ashford and riser were members of funk brothers a group of session musicians for motown records during 1960s ashford played tambourine vibraphone bells and shakers on songs such as 100 yard dash love that girl and staying in love ozuna one half of jake and phatman co produced and co wrote three songs and played several instruments including bongos tambourine and drums hilton co wrote never give you up and played its drum and keyboard parts wonder s contribution of a harmonica solo on song was impromptu as saadiq reached out to wonder after recording song s vocal parts with improvised line i d like to invite mr stevie wonder to my album come on stevie after having idea recommended to him by rapper q tip saadiq also reached out to jay z to record a featured rap for a remix of oh girl it was included on album as a bonus track way i see it was engineered by saadiq gerry brown james tanksley and brungardt who mixed album with saadiq saadiq and brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and prior to recording had contemplated techniques such as sampling and drum programming however they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and motown aesthetic of 1960s to familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques they studied mark lewisohn s 1988 book complete beatles recording sessions books about motown records and images of label s studio personnel setup of instruments and microphone placement they also studied motown eqs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs rhythm guitar parts saadiq said that he had to disregard about 85 to 90 percent of new techniques people used to take recording very seriously they used to wear lab coats at abbey road so i got serious with what i was trying to do both mentally and physically brungardt said in an interview for mix that he abandoned approach learned on previous records he had engineered where they wanted it clean with no distortion i was taught to make sure it was polish polish polish and to make sure everything fits right bass hits and things are clean for big pop vocal right thumb saadiq s recording studio featured an ssl 9000 mixing console pictured saadiq s studio integrated modern equipment such as a pro tools digital workstation and an ssl 9000 mixing console and featured various vintage gear including saadiq s 1960s ludwig drum kit and a kick drum mic purchased from abbey road studios in studio saadiq and brungardt experimented with techniques and equipment they wanted songs to have slower attacks like older recordings as producers in past did not have advanced compressors audio tools that manipulate dynamic content of signals and affect certain sounds in a recording s mix their production applied tube and tube compressors with former used as a front end for pro tools for saadiq s vocals he used a shure dynamic microphone to thicken and distort his voice and embellish his characteristically clean delivery while brungardt employed a compressor and a pro tools plug in during mix saadiq sought a certain edge for his vocals and an unpolished sonic element for album they also tried to record tracks onto cassette tapes in order to produce a grittier older sound brungardt used a filterbank plug in when mixing album to vocals and roll off high end sound from tracks although they wanted to reproduce an older sound saadiq and also wanted to capture more of bass and drum parts to add a louder modern element to mix they applied a more basic approach to miking instruments and utilizing outboard gear using a neumann u 47 for guitars alternating overhead microphones for saadiq s drum kit a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for kit s bass drum and ampex tape machines for extra warmth to kit brungardt used various standard mics for snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound rather than capturing drum s overall tone their miking of guitars amps was adapted from complete beatles recording sessions and as brungardt recounted it really gave us warmth and character it allowed amp to breathe and we got tones of amp along with room for me that really opened things up so that i could play with live room using different reverbs to get a sound for saadiq s bass they used a di unit to connect a microphone preamplifier increased gain on a plug in for less compression and adjusted low end tones with an equalizer plug in music and lyrics right thumb way i see it draws on music of 1960s motown former headquarters pictured way i see it has a traditional soul style fashioned after 1960s motown sound and philadelphia soul it is a departure from saadiq s previous work with neo soul which bears a hip hop influence j gabriel boylan of new york observer said that saadiq expands further beyond his work as a producer for other recording artists for whom he encouraged a classic aesthetic heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic deeply indebted to past and distrustful of easy formulas bbc music s chris jones interpreted saadiq s use of 1960s soul as album s source material to be a reflection of america s most recent great political and cultural shift first true post obama expression of hope in record form saadiq viewed his rootsy direction as a response to state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics you force so many terrible things on people they get tired of it we have a black president now album s songs draw on motown s grooves driving rhythms tight drumming tambourines in rhythm section guitar melodies layered vocal arrangements and two to four minute durations they also feature bright melodies swinging bass sweeping strings and snare drums that emit reverb cameron of said that most hook oriented riffs are played on bass and guitar which blend low with high and cited keep marchin love that girl and staying in love as examples jon pareles of new york times viewed that saadiq follows example of 1960s motown artists such as marvin gaye smokey robinson stevie wonder and holland dozier holland label s songwriting and production team robert christgau wrote that album shares holland dozier holland s bright swift clearly hooked aesthetic saadiq sings in a tenor voice which is slightly distorted as a result of album s post production saadiq s songwriting is characterized by straightforward romanticism positive exhortations pining ballads and message songs christgau interpreted saadiq s persona on album to be a romantic who stays true to deliberate simplicity of song titles but never threatens to assume fetal position if he doesn t get extreme cuddling he craves patrick of observer dispatch asserted that saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary r b lyrics there are no thinly veiled food sex metaphors or pimp fantasies his songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and on album s slower songs expresses tightly coiled emotions saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences he described album as basically a series of love songs about music how falling in love can be easy but staying true to it can be tricky he elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for chicago tribune you have to watch out for those curves trendy music comes out and how do you stay true to what you love i m not saying everything has to sound like a 60s record to stay true but you should never take relationship lightly opening track sure hope you mean it features slightly off beat percussion tambourine shakes and lyrics about a man who awaits a sign of approval from woman he admires keep marchin which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments was composed in vein of civil rights movement era soul music by artists such as sam cooke and staple singers gail mitchell from billboard compared song to curtis mayfield and impressions 1968 song we re a winner saadiq said keep marchin was also inspired by his journey in music industry big easy featuring new orleans style brass playing was sung from point of view of a man in new orleans who reacts to hurricane katrina and looks for his lost lover j gabriel boylan of new york observer remarked that song manages to cast hurricane katrina as villain in a romance tearing lovers apart its composition mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics is similar to songwriting technique used by holland dozier holland saadiq was inspired to write big easy after watching 2006 documentary film when levees broke he explained its upbeat composition in an interview for all things considered in new orleans when they mourn they really celebrate and have a great time i wanted to give it that same spirit according to saadiq just one kiss can be interpreted as a song devoted to a female love interest but i m really talking about music and what it did for me that one guitar line that certain drum beat how it turned my life into a ball of gold song incorporates cinematic strings xylophone and a rolling crescendo ballad calling featuring mexican balladeer rocio mendoza draws on motown s late 1950s r b roots and doo wop music and incorporates latin style guitar and spanish language lyrics staying in love an uptempo rhythm and blues song was written by saadiq after he thought of an ex girlfriend incongruous with its 1960s inspired sound let s take a walk has sexually forward lyrics and come ons which narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest midtempo never give you up is fashioned in motown s early 1970 sound and unlike other songs on album also incorporates elements from more modern soul music sometimes which was inspired by saadiq s upbringing in a tough neighborhood in oakland is about dealing with fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by burden of racism line now i know what they meant by keep your head to sky makes reference to earth wind fire whose music saadiq immersed himself in while growing up saadiq said of song s message that s just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and people who raised me in neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but i m just giving thanks to people that helped me along way title and packaging saadiq titled way i see it as a declaration to listeners about how his perspective was more informed by classic soul than before in his career this is what i really love he later explained and everything you ve heard from me before has been based on roots of this music cover photo was taken at a show in 2006 at sweet s ballroom in oakland in which saadiq performed marvin gaye s 1965 song ain t that peculiar it showed saadiq singing into a microphone with his arms raised and wearing a suit tie and thick rimmed glasses a look similar to that of temptations singer david ruffin according to saadiq photo set tone for whole album me singing that song me wearing that suit it said everything that this album should be music journalist greg kot believed cover evokes dramatic portraits and color schemes of old school jazz and soul albums think ray charles on atlantic sonny rollins on blue note sam and dave on stax with arms raised he looks like he s testifying as much as singing rest of album s packaging also adheres to a retro aesthetic with its crimson tinted cover s font and 1960s columbia records logo packaging s photography was taken by norman seeff release and promotion before completing way i see it saadiq previewed its songs in may 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at sony club in new york city he also planned a grassroots marketing strategy for record which evolved from his difficulty with columbia executives to promote album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records he felt that nobody at label knew him in an interview with dallas morning news they had this record that i turned in that sounded like a 60s record what hell do we do with this record it was quality there was not a lot of marketing and promotion but they knew i had credibility so you don t just throw it in garbage i don t mind being a slow burn because that s actually a better road to take i have to go in one more time and prove myself again because i am starting over again in week leading up to its release saadiq made promotional appearances at v 103 s for sisters only international soul music summit and uptown restaurant lounge in atlanta he also performed songs from album on vh1 columbia

called it flawlessly produced and performed by saadiq while rolling stone magazine s will hermes said record showcased an original take on classic northern soul andy gill of independent wrote that it was one of 2008 s most captivating albums because few have managed to retro fabricate that classic sound so accurately nor in as many subtle variations like saadiq allmusic s andy kellman stated here s where a modern master backed by living and breathing session musicians masters masters with startling accuracy in observer kitty empire found album both feather light and substantial because of how unlike most modern records saadiq s tunes gather weight deeper in you go writing for msn music christgau said saadiq sang with smokey robinson s detailed sentimentality and dennis edwards amenable personality he expanded on his praise in slate finding that while painstakingly retro saadiq s achievement isn t replicating motown sound but writing consistently charming and catchy songs in that style q was more critical finding record devoid of a fresh approach to elevate it from a simple homage according to popmatters writer christian john wikane one s total enjoyment of album depends on their appreciation of classic soul and r b and whether such appreciation is contingent on absolute authenticity at end of 2008 way i see it was included in a number of critics best albums lists it was

two years to promote way i see it performing in venues throughout united states europe and asia he was originally apprehensive at prospect of touring extensively having toured minimally as a solo act he reconsidered at advice of his rhythm guitarist rob bacon which he recounted in an interview for los angeles times money was just ok so i was like i don t know i could probably stay home and find something better but then rob reminded me you know all those cats you love that s exactly what they did little richard he played 10 shows a day at apollo i said ok let s go to complement his songs

headlining performance at central park in august legacy way i see it was an exemplary release of classic soul revival during its peak in 2008 music scene was marked by similarly retro minded work from mainstream artists such as amy winehouse and adele independent acts such as sharon jones dap kings and mayer hawthorne and older artists attempting comebacks such as al green and bettye lavette oliver wang cited saadiq s album along with solange knowles 2008 record sol angel and hadley st dreams as one of retro soul efforts that were released by contemporary r b artists as music scene peaked in popularity wang wrote that way i see it showcased a mastery of any number of past r b styles including those out of memphis muscle shoals philadelphia new orleans and of course detroit estelle said in 2008 every song is like a different era of motown everything sounds exactly like it did back in day not to take away from amy but this is real shit it was described by david nathan as contemporary album that was closest to authentically recreating great soul music sound of late 60s and early 70s ken tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music you can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm but without an emotional commitment it s all tedious pandering to baby boomers for raphael saadiq there s a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas way i see it also earned saadiq highest international profile of his career in promoting album he broadened his audience demographic and expanded his repertoire as a touring artist his extensive touring in us and europe garnered attention of younger white audiences who were not exposed to his previous solo albums and work with tony toni tone press of atlantic city wrote that album brought in a whole new

crowd music supervisors and festival bookers he also attained a following among japanese audiences saadiq s touring for album influenced his approach for recording his next album stone rollin in 2011

of a lifetime of experiences informed by music i grew up on kristal hawkins of village voice said that he hit his artistic maturity with album robert christgau remarked on its place in his solo career in 1996 saadiq turned climactic tony toni tone album into a virtuoso history lesson six years later he tried to dazzle maxwell in his own reflected glory six years later yet again he id himself with a fearless return to retro elton john a fan of saadiq s music since his beginnings with tony toni tone said that he was blown away by way i see it citing it as my album of year a soul record of highest quality he subsequently called saadiq to congratulate him for album and ask him to play at his aids foundation academy award party in 2009 in an interview for blues soul saadiq elaborated on album s impact on his career before that record after i d been in tony toni tone and lucy pearl most people had thought oh well he s a producer now he s never gonna be an artist he s not gonna put time in way
