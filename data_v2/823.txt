new mexico class was a class of three dreadnought battleships built for united states navy in late 1910s class comprised three ships lead ship and part of standard series they were in most respects copies of s that immediately preceded them carrying same main battery of twelve 50 caliber guns they incorporated several improvements however including a better arrangement of secondary battery that increased its usability a clipper bow that improved seakeeping and new mexico adopted an experimental turbo electric propulsion system like other standard type battleships they had a top speed of that allowed fleet to operate as a tactically homogeneous unit all three ships spent bulk of their peacetime careers in pacific fleet throughout 1920s and 1930s they were involved in numerous fleet problems which were large scale training exercises that helped develop doctrine later employed during pacific war by 1941 three ships were moved to east coast to join neutrality patrols that protected american merchant ships from german u boat attacks during battle of atlantic following japanese attack on pearl harbor in december they were quickly transferred back to pacific though they spent most of 1942 escorting convoys off west coast of united states beginning in mid 1943 they supported amphibious operations during aleutian islands gilbert and marshall islands and mariana and palau islands campaigns philippines campaign followed in late 1944 though mississippi was only member of class to participate in early stages of campaign other vessels being under refit at time there she was present for battle of surigao strait on 24 october last battleship engagement in history mississippi and new mexico took part in invasion of lingayen gulf part of philippines campaign in early 1945 and both were hit by kamikazes as they were both under repair only idaho participated in battle of iwo jima but all three ships were part of bombardment force for battle of okinawa where all were damaged by kamikazes they were present for occupation of japan in august and september thereafter returning to united states new mexico and idaho were quickly decommissioned and sold for scrap but mississippi remained in service having been converted into a gunnery testing and training ship in this capacity her crew experimented with anti aircraft missiles in mid 1950s before ship was sold to ship breakers in 1956 design thumb left second member of which provided basis for new mexico class in early 1910s us navy began experimenting with guns as other navies began to move to weapons as development of new guns progressed navy evaluated a series of proposals for ships incorporating 16 inch guns first was a ten gun ship with five twin gun turrets that also included improved armor compared to earlier battleships additionally secondary battery was increased from standard us armament of guns to weapons another smaller version with eight 16 inch guns was also suggested along with a design mounting then standard gun as work on new design progressed cost of vessels increased significantly compared to cost of a 14 inch gunned ship 12 million eight gun ship was estimated to cost 16 5 million while price for ten gun ship rose to 19 million even before trials of new guns had been completed rear admiral joseph strauss then chief of bureau of ordnance buord argued in 1913 that 16 inch gun was not worth pursuing he argued that at expected battle ranges of day 14 inch gun was capable of penetrating heavy armor plate just as effectively and that a ship carrying twelve of those guns had a much better chance of hitting than a ship with eight 16 inch guns general board concurred and instructed designers to work on 14 inch ship existing turrets for those guns used a single recoil slide for all three guns which caused concern that a single hit could jam it and thus disable all three guns strauss accordingly suggested that designers at bureau of construction and repair under chief constructor richard watt incorporate independent slides design staff submitted two proposals on 21 november 1913 a version and a variant first incorporated a secondary battery of twenty 6 inch guns while smaller one retained twenty two of standard 5 inch guns weight savings were also achieved by reducing thickness of barbette and belt armor by an inch and reducing fuel capacity general board preferred larger of two citing heavier armor as needed to defeat latest 15 inch guns being adopted in foreign battleships and stronger secondary battery which they viewed as necessary to ward off long range torpedo attacks by destroyers secretary of navy josephus daniels disagreed and on 3 january 1914 rejected design owing to its higher cost instead he ordered navy to accept a repeat of preceding which might be fitted with separate slides for main guns thumb left colorized photograph of note strong resemblance to arizona work on design continued through year designers were concerned that earlier battleships were too wet forward leading to adoption of a clipper bow to reduce tendency to ship water in heavy seas additionally experience with existing ships had revealed that secondary battery mounted in casemates in forecastle deck were effectively unusable in rough sea conditions designers therefore moved eighteen of guns a deck higher and further aft where they would be less prone to being washed out weight savings elsewhere allowed designers to strengthen main deck and transverse bulkhead at either end of belt daniels approved these changes on 2 july and following month buord suggested a newly developed 50 caliber version of 14 inch gun be used which watt authorized in september longer gun produced a higher muzzle velocity which allowed shells to penetrate an additional of armor at by this time work on design stopped as bids for contracts were to be submitted starting on 6 october despite fact that offer period had opened one more major change to design was made at time standard propulsion system for warships relied on steam turbines to turn propeller shafts though former operated most efficiently at high speed while latter generated thrust most effectively at relatively low speed one solution to this problem was turbo electric transmission which used turbines to generate electric power that in turn powered electric motors that drove screws bureau of steam engineering bueng recommended new system on 17 october pointing out that it would have many advantages over traditional direct drive systems including greater fuel economy and lighter and smaller machinery which could be used to shorten armored box that protected ships vitals also since turbines would only need to spin in one direction simpler machinery without reverse gears could be used daniels was convinced and he approved change for new mexico on 10 november since this was an unproven technology other two members of class received direct drive systems congress authorized two ships for class and but in mid 1914 two pre dreadnoughts were sold to greek navy and us navy was able to use funds generated by their sale to fund a third member of class general characteristics and machinery thumb idaho during a naval review in 1927 ships of new mexico class were part of standard series that began with they featured similar characteristics including speed armor armament and use of fuel oil rather than coal they were designed as such to create a battle fleet of tactically homogeneous ships that would simplify command and control they were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of they displaced as designed and up to at full combat load their hulls featured a long forecastle deck that stepped down to main deck level at main mast as built ships were fitted with two cage masts with spotting tops for main gun battery their crew numbered 58 officers and 1 026 enlisted men over course of their careers their crews expanded significantly as equipment was added after their early 1930s refit their crew numbered 82 officers and 1 371 enlisted and by 1945 wartime improvements brought crews to 129 officers and 1 850 enlisted they carried a number of smaller boats for utility purposes while in harbor as well as to assist with rescue efforts at sea these included a number of motor launches of various lengths and motor whaleboats all three ships were powered by four curtis turbines with steam provided by nine oil fired babcock wilcox boilers new mexicos turbines were used to power electrical motors that drove screw propellers her system was rated for latter two ships with their traditional propulsion systems were rated at all three vessels were rated for a top speed of though turbo electric system was effective and it was repeated in follow on navy ultimately decided that system was too heavy and occupied too much space in hull and later ships reverted to traditional turbine propulsion ships had storage capacity for of fuel oil for boilers though additional spaces in hull could be used to increase capacity to which provided a cruising range of at a speed of as speed increased their range decreased significantly at they could steam for and at their range fell to moreover these figures were assuming vessels had clean hulls free of marine growth that would inhibit their hydrodynamic efficiency in service conditions where biofouling added drag to hulls their ranges were reduced even further to and respectively armament thumb crewmen loading 14 inch shells aboard new mexico before battle of guam ships were armed with a main battery of twelve 50 caliber mark iv guns in four three gun turrets on centerline placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of superstructure unlike earlier american battleships with triple turrets these mounts were true three gun barrels in that each barrel could elevate independently they fired a shell with a bursting charge guns had a muzzle velocity of early in their careers new mexicos and tennessee class experienced excessive dispersion of shot after extensive testing it was eventually discovered to have been caused by overly lengthy chambers which allowed a gap between shell and propellant charges problem was eventually corrected with mark vii gun guns were supplied with 100 shells each and they were capable of a rate of fire of about one salvo per minute as demonstrated by extensive testing with idaho in october 1942 secondary battery consisted of fourteen 51 caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in superstructure amidships initially ship was to have been fitted with twenty two of guns but experiences in north sea during world war i demonstrated that additional guns which would have been placed in hull would have been unusable in anything but calm seas as a result casemates were plated over to prevent flooding leaving only fourteen guns in superstructure of these ten were located on forecastle deck and other four were in open mounts on shelter deck each gun position contained twenty four rounds of ready use ammunition with further munitions stored in magazines below guns were mark viii type which had a muzzle velocity of firing a shell secondary battery was augmented with four 50 caliber guns in high angle mounts for anti aircraft defense guns fired a shell at a velocity of in addition to their gun armament new mexico class ships were also fitted with two torpedo tubes mounted submerged in hull one on each broadside both tubes were located in a single torpedo room forward in hull each tube was supplied with a total of six torpedoes which were bliss leavitt weapons of mark vii type these carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of armor as was standard for american battleships of period new mexico class ships relied on all or nothing principle that reserved armor protection only for a ship s vitals creating an armored citadel that had enough reserve buoyancy to keep vessel afloat even if unarmored portions of ship were flooded main armored belt was thick with thickest armor protecting ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces transverse bulkheads that capped either end of belt were same thickness ships had two armored decks first consisted of two layers of special treatment steel sts that were thick further aft these were increased to a 1 75 in layer and a layer over steering compartment lower armored deck also consisted of two layers which were also composed of sts first thick and second 2 in thick main battery gun turrets had thick faces with thick sides rears and 5 in roofs they rested on barbettes that reduced to 4 5 in below upper deck where it was protected by armored citadel conning tower had 16 in thick sides and a roof that consisted of two layers that were each thick modifications thumb left idaho off iceland in 1942 showing her post 1934 refit configuration members of new mexico class received a series of modifications even while under construction including already noted alterations to secondary battery which was authorized on 7 february 1918 by which time new mexico had been completed with her original twenty two guns other two ships had already had their casemates built into their hulls so they were simply plated over unlike later tennessees which had their hulls faired in their conning towers were modified with a newly developed bridge arrangement that became standard for all american battleships of period it consisted of a fully enclosed navigation bridge on forward side of tower with a large chart house located behind bridge atop structure was an enclosed torpedo defense station starting in 1921 navy began installing aircraft catapults on its battleships to allow them to operate floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance and fire observation and three new mexicos were among vessels to receive a mark ii catapult ships initially carried hanriot hd 2 and then vought uo 1s in 1920s which were replaced with vought o2u corsairs toward end of decade these and improved variants served aboard ships until 1938 when these were replaced with curtiss soc seagulls beginning in august 1940 ships began to receive vought os2u kingfishers three ships were heavily modernized in early 1930s their received an additional 2 in of special treatment steel for their main deck armor bringing total thickness to a second torpedo bulkhead was installed outboard of original one and all three ships received anti torpedo bulges to further enhance their resistance to underwater attack both lattice masts were removed a heavy tower bridge was built in place of fore mast and a light pole mast was erected in place of main mast during installation of her new bridge idaho was fitted out as a flagship which included addition of a flag bridge for admiral and his staff ships armament was also revised with main battery turrets being modified to allow elevation to 30 degrees greatly extending range of guns two of 5 inch guns were removed and eight 5 inch 25 caliber anti aircraft guns were installed these alterations greatly increased their displacement to standard and full load all three ships had their propulsion systems overhauled receiving new westinghouse turbines and six bueng express boilers despite increases in displacement resulting from additional armor plating and bulges new powerplant increased speed to from ships crews increased significantly to 1 443 immediately after japanese attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 while new mexico class ships were in atlantic ships were docked for improvements to their anti aircraft armament receiving a battery of anti aircraft guns ships also had mark 3 fire control radars installed navy considered removing their heavily armored conning towers to compensate for increased weight of new equipment but work could not be accomplished in eight week overhaul period that had been scheduled so they retained their original towers unlike many of other older battleships that were rebuilt early in war since many of american battleships had been sunk or damaged at pearl harbor three new mexicos were too valuable to be removed from operational status for necessary amount of time to substantially rebuild them as a result of these limitations new mexico and mississippi received a series of rolling changes over course of late 1942 and into 1943 while at pearl harbor in october 1942 they had four of their 5 inch 51 guns removed along with their directors to free up space for a pair of quadruple bofors guns and shielded tubs for 1 1 inch guns were converted for use with 40 mm mounts though 1 1 inch guns remained until 1943 six oerlikon guns were added as well thumb mississippi launching a rim 2 terrier missile during a refit from 14 october to 28 december 1942 while her sisters received only modest alterations idaho underwent a more thorough modernization this consisted of a new anti aircraft battery of ten quadruple bofors guns and forty three oerlikons though oerlikons were added in stages by time refit ended she carried only sixteen of them with eleven more added in january 1943 remaining sixteen being added in february mark 3 radars were replaced in 1944 by mark 28 radars for new mexico and mississippi and mark 8 radars aboard idaho later that year ships began to receive mark 27 backup fire control radars as well from 22 october 1944 to 1 january 1945 idaho received another major refit which included installation of ten 5 inch 38 caliber guns in individual dual purpose mounts in place of old 25 caliber guns she also received new mark 8 radars for her main battery fire control system in early 1945 while under repair for combat damage mississippi also received a new secondary battery old 51 caliber 5 inch guns were removed and eight more of 25 caliber anti aircraft guns were installed along with thirteen quadruple bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm oerlikon guns to compensate for added weight ship s armored conning tower was removed in 1946 mississippi was converted into a gunnery training ship and for this role she received a new gun battery no 1 turret was replaced by a twin 6 inch 152 mm 47 caliber dual purpose turret same as mounted on anti aircraft cruisers no 2 and no 3 main battery turrets were also removed but no 4 turret was initially retained three twin 5 inch 38 caliber dual purpose mounts two single 5 inch 54 caliber dual purpose mounts as on aircraft carriers two twin 3 inch 76 mm 50 caliber mounts and two 40 mm bofors quad mounts were installed in 1952 last main battery turret was removed and mississippi had two new rim 2 terrier missile launchers installed in its place she later tested petrel missile a radar homing weapon in february 1956 ships in class ship

service they initially operated in atlantic and new mexico escorted president woodrow wilson across atlantic to versailles peace conference that ended world war i as us navy reorganized its fleet to emphasize a focus on affairs in asia and pacific ships were reassigned to pacific fleet in 1919 with new mexico serving as fleet flagship throughout this period fleet was based in san pedro california but it frequently operated in hawaiian waters off coast of central and south america and in caribbean sea in 1925 pacific fleet embarked on a major cruise to visit australia and new zealand beginning in 1923 us navy began a series of major exercises with fleet problem i during which mississippi sank old battleship which had by then been converted into a target ship mississippi used aircraft to spot her shots at long range first time this had been done in us navy fleet problems were typically held once a year and they provided basis for us navy s operations in pacific war experience in exercises that demonstrated that standard type battleships were too slow to operate with aircraft carriers led to development of fast battleships built in 1930s joint training with marine corps provided experience that proved to be useful during island hopping campaign during pacific war in 1937 ships took part in training exercises in dutch harbor alaska to experiment with sub arctic operations in mid 1940 battle fleet was transferred from california to hawaii in response to rising tensions between united states and japan over latter s aggression in second sino japanese war by 1941 president franklin d roosevelt initiated neutrality patrols to protect american shipping caught in battle of atlantic during world war ii all three new mexico class ships were transferred from pacific to atlantic fleet to reinforce patrols in may that year during this period ships escorted convoys between united states and iceland though they saw no action with german u boats that were waging an unrestricted submarine warfare campaign against merchant shipping in north atlantic world war ii thumb left shelling okinawa on 1 immediately after japanese attack on pearl harbor navy reassigned three battleships to pacific fleet to shore up fleet s battleship strength after arriving in california in january 1942 ships spent next several months patrolling west coast of united states and escorting convoys in area they took part in aleutian islands campaign between may and july 1943 with idaho serving as flagship of bombardment group that shelled islands of attu and kiska after maintenance and training at pearl harbor three new mexicos then took part in gilbert and marshall islands campaign that began in november where they provided naval gunfire support to marines who stormed ashore at tarawa kwajalein and eniwetok among other islands in archipelago these operations continued into january 1944 at which point fleet began preparations for next major campaign which would be directed against marianas islands in central pacific new mexico and idaho took part in mariana and palau islands campaign beginning in june 1944 though mississippi was out of service for a refit during first part of campaign they shelled japanese positions on saipan tinian and guam as amphibious forces assaulted each island in turn two battleships remained with invasion fleet to cover it from japanese attacks while fast carrier task force met and decisively defeated japanese 1st air fleet in battle of philippine sea by september mississippi had returned to fleet to relieve new mexico for her own refit and she and idaho shelled island of last battle of marianas campaign fleet thereafter withdrew to manus island to prepare for coming invasion of philippines while new mexico departed for a refit at puget sound navy yard mississippi supported invasion of leyte in october as part of bombardment group under rear admiral jesse b oldendorf american invasion triggered japanese to launch operation sho go 1 a major naval counterattack that resulted in battle of leyte gulf on 23 26 october a complex battle that involved four separate actions she was present at battle of surigao strait on night of 24 october which was one component of battle there allied fleet destroyed japanese southern force consisting of a pair of old battleships one heavy cruiser and four destroyers only one japanese destroyer escaped overwhelming allied fleet mississippi which still had her old mark 3 radars had difficulty in finding a target in darkness and fired only one salvo in last battleship action in history thumb new mexico anchored in tokyo bay with mount fuji in background by january 1945 new mexico had rejoined fleet next target of which was invasion of lingayen gulf on island of luzon she and mississippi supported amphibious assault and during battle both ships were struck by a kamikaze suicide plane two ships nevertheless remained in action until february when they departed for pearl harbor for repairs by that time idaho had completed her refit and had rejoined fleet in time to take part in battle of iwo jima she shelled island extensively before marines went ashore and continued to provide fire support during battle repairs to new mexico and mississippi were completed quickly and all three sister ships were reunited to support invasion of okinawa in may 1945 as japan s military situation continued to deteriorate they launched increasingly desperate kamikaze attacks new mexico and mississippi were both hit by another kamikaze and idaho was damaged by a near miss new mexico was also hit by a bomb forcing her to withdraw for repairs all three ships were repaired in time to participate in initial occupation of japan in august and september postwar new mexico and idaho returned to east coast of united states by october 1945 where they were both decommissioned initially slated to be kept in reserve fleet they were instead stricken from naval register in 1947 and sold for scrap mississippi survived postwar draw down in naval strength through conversion into a gunnery training and evaluation ship to replace older battleship with new hull number eag 128 to designate her status as an auxiliary vessel she was reconstructed at norfolk naval shipyard from november 1945 through april 1948 with a new armament that included a variety of different weapons thereafter serving as flagship of operational test and evaluation force she helped to evaluate anti aircraft missiles in mid 1950s before being decommissioned in february 1956 and sold to ship breakers by that time she had spent nearly 39 years in service citations references category battleship classes new mexico class battleship
