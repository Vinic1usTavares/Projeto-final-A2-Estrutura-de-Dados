major general sir isaac brock kb 6 october 1769 13 october 1812 was a british army officer and colonial administrator from guernsey brock was assigned to lower canada in 1802 despite facing desertions and near mutinies he commanded his regiment in upper canada present day ontario successfully for many years he was promoted to major general and became responsible for defending upper canada against united states while many in canada and britain believed war could be averted brock began to ready army and militia for what was to come when war of 1812 broke out populace was prepared and quick victories at fort mackinac and detroit defeated american invasion efforts brock s actions particularly his success at detroit earned him accolades including a knighthood in order of bath and sobriquet hero of upper canada his name is often linked with that of native american leader tecumseh although two men collaborated in person only for a few days tupper 1847 p viii brock died at battle of queenston heights which british won early life thumb left saint peter port where brock was born brock was born at st peter port on channel island of guernsey eighth son of john brock 1729 1777 a midshipman in royal navy and elizabeth de lisle daughter of daniel de lisle then lieutenant bailiff of guernsey brocks were an english family who had been established in guernsey since sixteenth century brock earned a reputation during his early education on guernsey as an assiduous student as well as an exceptional swimmer and boxer at age ten he was sent to school in southampton he also studied for one year in rotterdam learning french despite his lack of an extensive formal education brock appreciated its importance as an adult he spent much time reading in an attempt to improve his education tupper 1847 pp 4 5 and 88 he read many works on military tactics and science but he also read ancient history and other less immediately practical topics at time of his death he owned a modest library of books including classic works by shakespeare voltaire and samuel johnson he kept a reputation as an unusually tall robust tupper 1847 p 4 man throughout his life with an adult height of about measurements taken from his uniform show that at his death he had a waist size of and inside brim of his hat measured in circumference malcomson 2004 though brock was noted as a handsome man who enjoyed company of women he never married military service brock had a successful pre war military career and a quick rise through ranks which many commented on at time some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions and brock had substantial portions of both on his way to prominence lacking special political connections brock s ability to gain promotions even when nation was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances and ambition tupper 1847 p 6 early career at age of fifteen brock joined 8th king s regiment of foot on 8 march 1785 with rank of ensign and was likely given responsibility for regimental colours traditionally regimental colours were placed in care of regiment s most junior officer which in this case would be brock his elder brother john was already an officer in same regiment as was usual at time brock s commission was purchased on 16 january 1790 he bought rank of lieutenant and later that year he raised his own company of men sweetman 2004 as a result he was promoted to captain of an independent company of foot on 27 january 1791 and transferred to 49th hertfordshire regiment of foot on 15 june 1791 his nephew and biographer ferdinand brock tupper asserts that shortly after brock joined regiment a professional forced a match on him tupper 1847 pp 5 6 as one being challenged brock had his choice of terms and he insisted that they use pistols his friends were shocked as brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot brock however refused to change his mind when duellist arrived at field he asked brock to decide how many paces they would take brock insisted that duel would take place not at usual range but at handkerchief distance i e close range duellist declined and subsequently was forced to leave regiment this contributed to brock s popularity and reputation among his fellow officers as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in regiment during his time with this regiment brock served in caribbean where he fell ill with fever and nearly died he did not fully recover until after returning to england in 1793 once back in britain he spent much of his time recruiting and he was placed in charge of recruits on jersey he purchased his majority on 27 june 1795 and rejoined his regiment in 1796 when rest of his men returned from west indies first command on 28 october 1797 brock purchased rank of lieutenant colonel for ps3 000 and became acting commanding officer of regiment assuming substantive command on 22 march 1798 with retirement of lieutenant colonel frederick keppel rank was apparently bought cheaply his predecessor from whom he purchased rank was advised to sell up and leave army rather than face a court martial and probable dismissal in 1799 49th was assigned to helder expedition against batavian republic now known as netherlands to be led by sir ralph abercromby during troop landings brock saw his first combat on 10 september 1799 under command of then major general john moore given that 49th was in poor shape when brock took command they saw little actual combat likely moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish beachhead finally on 2 october 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at battle of alkmaar where they acquitted themselves well sustaining only 33 deaths 49th had been ordered to proceed up beaches of egmont op zee a steep climb through sand dunes and poor terrain risks were exacerbated by harassment from french sharpshooters who had excellent cover after about six hours of heavy fighting attack was stopped about a mile 1 6 km short of british objective after an hour of close combat french began to withdraw brock was injured in fighting when hit in throat by a spent musket ball his neck cloth prevented a possibly fatal injury tupper 1847 p 8 in his own words i got knocked down shortly after enemy began to retreat but never quitted field and returned to my duty in less than half an hour thumb depiction of battle of copenhagen aboard brock was to lead 49th foot on an assault against city s fortress although outcome of battle made such actions unnecessary in 1801 while aboard 74 gun commanded by captain thomas fremantle a personal friend brock was present at battle of copenhagen his troops were supposed to lead an assault on forts at copenhagen outcome of sea battle made such an assault unnecessary and brock was able to observe first hand tactical brilliance of lord nelson after battle fremantle and brock celebrated victory with nelson tupper 1847 pp 18 20 in 1802 brock and 49th foot were ordered to canada transfer to canada brock arrived in canada with rest of 49th foot and was initially assigned to montreal almost immediately in 1804 he was faced with one of primary problems in canada desertion seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across river and border into united states despite having no jurisdiction on american soil brock sent a party across border in pursuit and men were captured stacey mutiny a short time later brock received a report from fort george that some of garrison were planning to imprison officers and flee to u s immediately he boarded schooner that had brought message and proceeded to fort george under command of then lieutenant colonel roger hale sheaffe a hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet brock s unexpected arrival alone on entering fort brock ordered sergeant of guard to disarm and had him confined tupper 1847 pp 26 30 as it was dinner hour all soldiers were in barracks brock ordered drummers to call out men he ordered first officer on scene lieutenant williams to bring him a soldier suspected of being one of mutiny s ringleaders pinning man with a sabre williams took him into custody other suspected mutineers were also captured brock sent twelve mutineers and seven deserters to quebec for court martial mutineers had planned to jail all officers save sheaffe who was to be killed and to cross niagara river into u s at queenston seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad mutineers testified that they were forced to such measures by severity of sheaffe s command they said if they had continued under brock s command they would never have taken such action tupper 1847 pp 31 32 brock was evidently upset by news that conspirators had been shot in a botched execution firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance so that condemned men were not killed instantly tupper 1847 pp 348 1908 p 49 brock s younger brother john savery brock was compelled to retire from royal navy after his involvement in a mutinous incident he induced his brother midshipmen of fleet at spithead to sign a round robin against their being subjected to practice of mast heading he was recommended privately to retire from service tupper 1847 p 22 pre war preparations after a period of leave in england over winter 1805 6 and promotion to colonel on 29 october 1805 brock returned to canada temporarily in command of entire british army there by 1806 united states was becoming increasingly hostile to british empire relations between two nations continued to deteriorate until war finally broke out in 1812 united states had grievances at british violations of american sovereignty their navy was impressing us sailors restriction of american trade by britain and an american desire to gain territory by invading and annexing poorly defended british north american colonies american grievances included impressment of american sailors by royal navy blockade of french ports and a belief that british were inciting american indians to attack u s settlements on western frontier war hawks in u s called for an invasion of canada to punish british empire and to lessen threat to american interests represented by native americans at same time us leaders believed that growing population needed new territory some imagined that united states was destined to control all of north american continent this philosophy was later known as manifest destiny american hawks assumed that canadian colonists would rise up and support invading u s armies as liberators and that as thomas jefferson famously wrote conquering canada would be a mere matter of marching letter from jefferson to colonel william duane 4 august 1812 in response to this emerging threat brock moved quickly to bolster canadian defences he strengthened fortifications of quebec by building walls and an elevated battery brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due largely to his military reading which included several volumes on science of running and setting up artillery he also rearranged and strengthened provincial marine responsible for transport on lakes and rivers he ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding great lakes this was to be pivotal during war but brock s appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with civilian authorities led by thomas dunn in 1807 brock was appointed brigadier british practice of time brigadier general was not a permanent rank but an appointment of colonels or lieutenant colonels for a specific purpose or period of time by governor general sir james henry craig new commander of canadian forces he was to take command of all forces in upper canada in 1810 during this time brock continued to ask for a posting in europe in june 1811 he was promoted to major general and in october of that year lieutenant governor francis gore left for england brock was sent to upper canada as senior officer commander of troops and senior member of executive council putting him fully in charge of both military and civil authority he was usually referred to as president of council or administrator of upper canada never as lieutenant governor when permission to leave for europe finally came in early 1812 brock declined offer believing he had a duty to defend canada in war against united states tupper 1847 pp 108 109 as upper canada s administrator brock made a series of changes to prepare for war he amended militia act to allow use of all available volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits despite opposition from provincial legislature he continued strengthening and reinforcing defences brock also began seeking out first nations leaders such as shawnee chief tecumseh to build alliances with him against americans in event of war although conventional wisdom of day was that canada would fall quickly in event of an invasion brock pursued these strategies to give colony a fighting chance meanwhile back in england brock s brother william faced financial difficulties as bank in which he was a senior partner failed isaac s commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into bank s books by his brother and brocks faced a demand for payment isaac could not meet ps3000 debt but made over whole of his salary to his brother irving to be used for whatever was considered most critical his commission debt or family s other bills tupper 1847 pp 110 113 war of 1812 early war and capture of detroit thumb left upright governor general sir george prevost whose approach to war conflicted with brock s united states declared war on britain on 18 june 1812 despite his preparations brock was worried about canadian security in upper canada besides militia there was only one british regular infantry regiment a detachment of retired veterans and a company of artillery these had to be dispersed among several widely separated posts brock s advantage was that armed vessels of provincial marine controlled lakes and allowed him to move his reserves rapidly between threatened points brock continually kept commanders of his posts informed of all developments when news of outbreak of war reached him he sent a canoe party under noted trader and voyager william mckay to british outpost at st joseph island on lake huron his orders to commander captain charles roberts allowed him to stand on defensive or attack nearby american outpost at fort mackinac at his discretion roberts immediately launched an attack on fort mackinac with a scratch force of regulars fur traders and first nations warriors on 17 july american garrison was taken by surprise not being aware that war had been declared and surrendered this victory immediately encouraged many first nations tribes who had hitherto been neutral or undecided to give their active support to british they hoped to expel american settlers from their territories west of appalachian mountains tupper 1847 pp 224 brock felt he needed to go further he was hampered by governor general george prevost who had replaced craig in late 1811 prevost s orders from government and his own inclinations were to emphasise defence prevost kept bulk of his forces in lower canada to protect quebec and opposed any attack into united states brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among legislature and other officials he wrote to prevost s adjutant general my situation is most critical not from anything enemy can do but from disposition of people population believe me is essentially bad a full belief possesses them that this province must inevitably succumb this is fatal to every exertion legislators magistrates militia officers all have imbibed idea and are so sluggish and indifferent in all their respective offices that artful and active scoundrel is allowed to parade country without interruption and commit all imaginable mischief what a change an additional regiment would make in this part of province most of people have lost all confidence i however speak loud and look big stacey quoted in zaslow p 13 on 12 july an american army under william hull had invaded canada at sandwich later known as windsor invasion was quickly halted and hull withdrew but this gave brock excuse he needed to abandon prevost s orders having finally obtained limited support from legislature for his measures to defend province brock prorogued assembly and set out on 6 august with a small body of regulars and some volunteers from york militia york volunteers to reinforce garrison at amherstburg at western end of lake erie facing hull s position at detroit travelling mainly by water in bad weather brock reached amherstburg on 13 august tupper 1847 pp 241 242 upright thumb left brock met with shawnee chief tecumseh in amherstburg he quickly established a rapport with tecumseh ensuring his cooperation against fort detroit here brock met tecumseh and was immediately impressed tupper 1847 pp 244 253 brock also read american dispatches captured from hull s army he quickly judged hull to be timid and afraid of first nations in particular and american force to be demoralised and short of rations against advice of his officers brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on detroit he later 3 september wrote to his brothers some say that nothing could be more desperate than measure but i answer that state of province admitted of nothing but desperate remedies i got possession of letters my antagonist addressed to secretary at war and also of sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends confidence in general was gone and evident despondency prevailed throughout i have succeeded beyond expectation i crossed river contrary to opinion of cols procter st george etc it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment i must say proceeded from a cool calculation of pours and contres stacey quoted in zaslow p 17 even with his first nations allies brock was outnumbered his force included 600 indians and 1300 soldiers as well as two battleships according to his later report hull had 2 500 soldiers under his command he decided to use tricks to intimidate hull he dressed his militia contingent in uniforms discarded by his regulars making it appear at a distance as if his force consisted entirely of british regular infantry brock laid siege to fort detroit from established artillery positions across river in sandwich through a carefully crafted series of marches he gave appearance of having much more numerous forces he had tecumseh s forces cross in front of fort several times doubling back under cover intimidating hull with show of a large raucous barely controlled group of first nations warriors finally he sent hull a letter demanding his surrender in which he stated in part it is far from my inclination to join in a war of extermination but you must be aware that numerous body of indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond my control moment contest commences tupper 1847 p 246 brock hammered fort with cannon fire on 16 august day after receiving brock s letter hull surrendered hull elderly and without recent military experience was terrified by risk of losing battle tupper 1847 p 254 thumb depiction of american forces surrendering fort detroit he later wrote that surrender had saved 2 500 troops and 700 civilians from horrors of an indian massacre capture of detroit and hull s army wounded american morale and eliminated main american force in area as a threat while at same time boosting morale among his own forces brock took american supplies at detroit and used them for his own forces particularly ill equipped militia under prize regulations a substantial part of value of captured military stores would accrue to him if he had lived longer he could have settled his debts brock valued captured ordnance supplies at ps30 000 finally victory secured support of tecumseh and other chiefs in his confederation who took brock s actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action tecumseh evidently trusted and respected brock reportedly saying this is a man after meeting him for first time tupper 1847 p 262 although brock s correspondence indicates a certain amount of paternal condescension for first nations see letters from brock to lt gen prevost dated 2 and 3 december 1811 quoted in tupper 1847 pp 123 130 he seems to have regarded tecumseh very highly calling him wellington of indians and saying a more sagacious or a more gallant warrior does not i believe exist tupper 1847 p 253 brock made a number of commitments to shawnee he promised to negotiate no peace treaty without addressing shawnee s vision of an independent homeland there is no evidence brock negotiated in bad faith see for example letters from brock to colonel procter dated 17 september 1812 and sir george prevost dated 18 september 1812 quoted in tupper 1847 pp 310 311 314 1847 pp 318 321 347 brock s personal integrity and respect for first nations peoples has been well documented and suggest that if he had lived he would have kept his word to shawnee capture of detroit led to british domination over most of michigan territory brock had planned to continue his campaign into u s but he was thwarted by negotiation of an armistice by prevost with american major general henry dearborn this stalled brock s momentum and gave americans time to regroup and prepare to invade canada unable to predict point of invasion brock frantically worked to prepare defences throughout upper canada prince regent decreed a silver medal be struck for presentation to senior officers to commemorate event death at battle of queenston heights meanwhile american general stephen van rensselaer iii a federalist political appointee in command of a sizable army near lewiston was pressured by american president to invade although van rensselaer had severe doubts about quality of his troops he had no choice but to attack he was an inexperienced militia general and not trusted by majority of regular army troops in early morning of 13 october 1812 he attempted to cross niagara river leading to battle of queenston heights despite heavy fire from british artillery first wave of americans under captain john e wool managed to land and then follow a fishermen s path up to heights from this point they attacked and routed british artillery brock had arrived from nearby fort george and moved up to artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before wool attacked he his aides and gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat leading their horses down steep slope thumb general brock leading charge fearing americans would move rest of their soldiers brock ordered an immediate attack on american position fearing that americans would move rest of their troops across river brock ordered an immediate attack on their position true to his philosophy of never ordering men where he would not lead them he personally led charge on foot brock s charge was made by dennis and williams two companies of 49th and two companies of militia cruikshank in zaslow p 33 assault was halted by heavy fire and as he noticed unwounded men dropping to rear brock shouted angrily that this is first time i have ever seen 49th turn their backs cruikshank in lundy s lane historical society p 1908 p 177 surely heroes of egmont will not tarnish their record at this rebuke ranks promptly closed up and were joined by two more companies of militia those of cameron and brock saw that militia supports were lagging behind at foot of hill and ordered one of his provincial aides de camp lieutenant colonel john macdonell to push on york volunteers while he led his own party to right presumably intending to join his party with that of williams detachment who were beginning to make progress on that flank brock was struck in wrist of his sword arm by a musket ball but continued to press home attack his height and energetic gestures together with his officer s uniform and a gaudy sash given to him eight weeks earlier by tecumseh after siege of detroit graves prevost 2000 p 96 made him a conspicuous target an unknown american stepped forward from a thicket and fired at a range of barely fifty yards musketball struck brock in chest and he fell cruikshank in zaslow p 36 his last words have been reported as push on brave york volunteers in reference to a group of militia brock favoured or push on don t mind me tupper 1847 p 331 footnote or latin for rise or push on now used as a motto by brock university and even a request that his fall might not be noticed or prevent advance of his brave troops adding a wish which could not be distinctly understood that some token of remembrance should be transmitted to his sister tupper 1847 p 331 these accounts are considered unlikely since he was not in company of york volunteers but regular soldiers at time and it is also reported that brock died almost immediately without speaking latimer 2007 p 79 and hole in his uniform suggests that bullet entered his heart his body was carried from field and secreted in a nearby house at corner of queenston and partition streets diagonally opposite that of laura secord thumb left push on brave york volunteers shouts brock who is shown mortally wounded at lower right of picture following death of brock lieutenant colonel john macdonell became senior officer a lawyer by trade and having little military experience macdonell led a second attempt to retake redan malcomson 2003 p 154 with williams men of 49th starting from brush to right of line near escarpment and macdonell s anchoring left force of between 70 and 80 men more than half of whom were militia advanced toward redan wool had been reinforced by more troops who had just made their way up path to top of heights and macdonell faced some four hundred troops during charge it is reported that 49th used revenge general as a battle cry nursey 1908 pp 161 162 despite disadvantage in numbers as well as attacking a fixed position williams and macdonell s small force was driving opposing force to edge of gorge on which redan was situated and seemed on verge of success before americans were able to regroup and stand firm momentum of battle turned when a musket ball hit macdonell s mount causing it to rear and twist around and another shot hit him in small of back causing him to fall from horse malcomson 2003 p 155 he was removed from battlefield and died from his injuries early next day captain williams was laid low by a wound to head and dennis by a severe wound to thigh although he continued to lead his detachment throughout action cruikshank in lundy s lane historical society p 10 carrying macdonnell and body of brock british fell back through queenston to durham s farm a mile north near s point cruikshank in zaslow p 38 in afternoon sheaffe arrived on battlefield with reinforcements and took command of british forces in sharp contrast to his predecessors direct attacks sheaffe took a more cautious approach this ultimately proved successful leading to a total victory over americans burial thumb brock s remains are presently interred at brock s monument in queenston ontario after battle sheaffe and his staff decided to entrust funeral arrangements to captain john who had served with brock for many years on 16 october a funeral procession for brock and colonel macdonell went from government house to fort george with soldiers from british army colonial militia and first nations warriors on either side of route caskets were lowered into a freshly dug grave at northeast corner of fort george british fired a twenty one gun salute in three salvos in a gesture of respect later that day american garrison at fort niagara respectfully fired a similar salute over five thousand people attended funeral collins 2006 p 116 a remarkable number given limited population of upper canada at that time a small cairn at foot of niagara escarpment marks spot where brock fell in 1824 brock s and macdonell s remains were moved into brock s monument which overlooked queenston heights that original monument was bombed and heavily damaged in 1840 this action was reputedly by irish canadian terrorist benjamin lett malcomson 2003 p 216 although a subsequent assize failed to confirm this it was replaced by a larger structure high built at public expense that still stands brock s remains were reinterred inside new monument on 13 october 1853 an inscription reads upper canada has dedicated this monument to memory of late major general isaac brock k b provisional lieutenant governor and commander of forces in province whose remains are deposited in vault beneath opposing invading enemy he fell in action near these heights on 13 october 1812 in forty third year of his age revered and lamented by people whom he governed and deplored by sovereign to whose services his life had been devoted legacy on british leadership thumb left upright posthumous portrait c 1883 by george theodore berthon british military leadership which had been decisive up to brock s death suffered a blow with his loss his direct successor major general sheaffe although successful in his approach at queenston heights was never able to live up to brock s reputation he was criticised by many including john strachan for his retreat at battle of york and was shortly after recalled to england where he continued a successful if not brilliant military career whitfield turner brock s successor at detroit however fared much worse colonel henry procter faced an attack from a resurrected american army of northwest under future president william henry harrison harrison set out to retake detroit but a detachment of his army was defeated at frenchtown on 22 january 1813 procter displaying poor judgement left prisoners in custody of his first nations allies who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them subsequent american victories allowed harrison to attempt another invasion of canada which led to battle of thames on 5 october 1813 after a successful american charge procter s forces turned and fled leaving tecumseh and his american indian troops to fight alone they fought on eventually being defeated perhaps of more importance to british at this battle tecumseh died and their alliance with american indians effectively ended as for governor general prevost who often clashed with brock he remained in command of all british forces until after battle of plattsburgh in 1814 battle was intended to be a joint naval infantry attack but prevost did not commit his forces until after naval battle had nearly ended when he finally did attack his forces proved unable to cross saranac river bridge which was held by a small group of american regulars under command of recently promoted john e wool despite a heavy advantage in manpower prevost finally retreated upon hearing of failure of naval attack for his failure at plattsburgh prevost was recalled to england to face an inquiry and a naval court martial determined that blame for loss at plattsburgh primarily rested with prevost

brock s betrothal to sophia shaw daughter of general aeneas shaw was first published nursey 1908 pp 79 136 there is no supporting evidence for claim and most biographers consider it apocryphal a legend about brock s horse alfred was first published in 1859 horse was supposedly shot and killed during battle while being ridden by macdonell and it is commemorated in a monument erected in 1976 in queenston near cairn marking spot where brock fell but little evidence supports this account general s horse fully caparisoned led by four grooms is listed as preceding coffin at general s interment
