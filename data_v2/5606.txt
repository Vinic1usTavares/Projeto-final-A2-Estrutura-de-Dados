250px thumb right a penrose tiling alt a penrose tiling is an example of non periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist roger penrose who investigated these sets in 1970s aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match original a penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry as in diagram at right penrose tiling is non periodic which means that it lacks any translational symmetry it is self similar so same patterns occur at larger and larger scales thus tiling can be obtained through inflation or deflation and every finite patch from tiling occurs infinitely many times it is a quasicrystal implemented as a physical structure a penrose tiling will produce bragg diffraction and its reveals both fivefold symmetry and underlying long range order various methods to construct penrose tilings have been discovered including matching rules substitutions or subdivision rules cut and project schemes and coverings 250px right thumb roger penrose in foyer of mitchell institute for fundamental physics and astronomy texas a m university standing on a floor with a penrose tiling alt background and history periodic and aperiodic tilings right thumb 150px figure 1 part of a periodic tiling alt penrose tilings are simple examples of aperiodic tilings of plane general references for this article include and to cover a flat surface plane with some pattern of geometric shapes tiles with no overlaps or gaps is called a tiling most familiar tilings e g covering a floor or wall with squares or hexagons are periodic a perfect copy of tiling can be obtained by translating all of tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction such a translation is called a period of tiling more informally this means that a finite region of tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals tiles normally have a finite number of shapes called prototiles and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile plane if there is a tiling of plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles a tiling that has no periods is non periodic a set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles plane but every such tiling is non periodic tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings earliest aperiodic tilings thumb left 150px an aperiodic set of wang dominoes alt subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in 1960s when logician hao wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings in particular he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges now known as wang dominoes or tiles and posed domino problem to determine whether a given set of wang dominoes could tile plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges he observed that if this problem were undecidable then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of wang dominoes at time this seemed implausible so wang conjectured no such set could exist thumb right robinson s six prototiles alt wang s student robert berger proved that domino problem was undecidable so wang s conjecture was incorrect in his 1964 thesis and obtained an aperiodic set of wang dominoes he also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles latter did not appear in his published monograph but in 1968 donald knuth detailed a modification of berger s set requiring only 92 dominoes color matching required in a tiling by wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying edges of tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by edge colorings raphael robinson in a 1971 paper which simplified berger s techniques and undecidability proof used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles development of penrose tilings 250px thumb left figure 2 pentagonal penrose tiling p1 drawn in black on a colored rhombus tiling p3 with yellow edges alt first penrose tiling tiling p1 below is an aperiodic set of six prototiles introduced by roger penrose in a 1974 paper but it is based on pentagons rather than squares any attempt to tile plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps but johannes kepler showed in his 1619 work harmonices mundi that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams star polygons decagons and related shapes traces of these ideas can also be found in work of albrecht durer acknowledging inspiration from kepler penrose found matching rules which can be imposed by decorations of edges for these shapes obtaining an aperiodic set his tiling can be viewed as a completion of kepler s finite aa pattern penrose subsequently reduced number of prototiles to two discovering kite and dart tiling tiling p2 below and rhombus tiling tiling p3 below rhombus tiling was independently discovered by robert ammann in 1976 penrose and john h conway investigated properties of penrose tilings and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature their findings were publicized by martin gardner in his january 1977 mathematical games column in scientific american in 1981 de bruijn explained a method to construct penrose tilings from five families of parallel lines as well as a cut and project method in which penrose tilings are obtained as two dimensional projections from a five dimensional cubic structure in this approach penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points its vertices while tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges penrose tilings thumb right 200px a p1 tiling using penrose s original set of six prototiles alt three types of penrose tiling p1 p3 are described individually below p1 p3 notation is taken from they have many common features in each case tiles are constructed from shapes related to pentagon and hence to golden ratio but basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges or patterns on tile faces alternatively edge profile can be modified e g by indentations and protrusions to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles original pentagonal penrose tiling p1 penrose s first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes a five pointed star a pentagram a boat roughly 3 5 of a star and a diamond a thin rhombus to ensure that all tilings are non periodic there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other and there are three different types of matching rule for pentagonal tiles it is common to indicate three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors as in figure above right however as will be explained momentarily differently colored pentagons will be considered to be different types of tiles shows edge modifications needed to yield an aperiodic set of prototiles kite and dart tiling p2 thumb part of plane covered by penrose tiling of type p2 kite and dart created by applying several deflations see section below penrose s second tiling uses quadrilaterals called kite and dart which may be combined to make a rhombus however matching rules prohibit such a combination rhombus of course tiles periodically but we are not allowed to join pieces in this manner both kite and dart are composed of two triangles called robinson triangles after 1975 notes by robinson kite is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72 72 72 and 144 degrees kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute robinson triangles with angles of 36 72 and 72 degrees dart is a non convex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36 72 36 and 216 degrees dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse robinson triangles with angles of 36 36 and 108 degrees which are smaller than acute triangles matching rules can be described in several ways one approach is to color vertices with two colors e g black and white and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices another is to use a pattern of circular arcs as shown above left in green and red to constrain placement of tiles when two tiles share an edge in a tiling patterns must match at these edges these rules often force placement of certain tiles for example concave vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites corresponding figure center of top row in lower image on left is called an ace by conway although it looks like an enlarged kite it does not tile in same way similarly concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts bottom right in fact there are only seven possible ways for tiles to meet at a vertex two of these figures namely star top left and sun top right have 5 fold dihedral symmetry by rotations and reflections while remainder have a single axis of reflection vertical in image apart from ace and sun all of these vertex figures force placement of additional tiles rhombus tiling p3 right thumb matching rule for penrose rhombs using circular arcs or edge modifications to enforce tiling rules alt right thumb matching rule for penrose rhombs using parabolic edges to enforce tiling rules left thumb a penrose tiling using penrose rhombuses with parabolic edges third tiling uses a pair of rhombuses often referred to as rhombs in this context with equal sides but different angles ordinary rhombus shaped tiles can be used to tile plane periodically so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled no two tiles may form a parallelogram as this would allow a periodic tiling but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity as figure 1 above shows there are two kinds of tile both of which can be decomposed into robinson triangles thin rhomb t has four corners with angles of 36 144 36 and 144 degrees t rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute robinson triangles thick rhomb t has angles of 72 108 72 and 108 degrees t rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse robinson triangles in contrast to p2 tiling these are larger than acute triangles matching rules distinguish sides of tiles and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in image on right in one form tiles must be assembled such that curves on faces match in color and position across an edge in other tiles must be assembled such that bumps on their edges fit together there are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex but rules of tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear although one of these arises in two ways various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles such as penrose chickens traditionally p3 penrose tiling is made of thin and thick rhombi however by raising vertices in three dimensions it is possible to force all of rhombi to be congruent resulting surface is known as a roof due to similarities with three dimensional quasicrystals you can see rhombic and rhombic hidden in tiling features and constructions golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry several properties and common features of penrose tilings involve golden ratio 1 2 approximately 1 618 this is ratio of chord lengths to side lengths in a regular pentagon and satisfies 1 1 left thumb pentagon with an inscribed thick rhomb light acute robinson triangles lightly shaded and a small obtuse robinson triangle darker dotted lines give additional edges for inscribed kites and darts alt consequently ratio of lengths of long sides to short sides in isosceles robinson triangles is 1 it follows that ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also 1 as are length ratios of sides to short diagonal in thin rhomb t and of long diagonal to sides in thick rhomb t in both p2 and p3 tilings ratio of area of larger robinson triangle to smaller one is 1 hence so are ratios of areas of kite to dart and of thick rhomb to thin rhomb both larger and smaller obtuse robinson triangles can be found in pentagon on left larger triangles at top halves of thick rhomb have linear dimensions scaled up by compared to small shaded triangle at base and so ratio of areas is 2 1 any penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry in sense that there are points in tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about center point as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through point a dihedral symmetry group this symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around center point but patch can be very large conway and penrose proved that whenever colored curves on p2 or p3 tilings close in a loop region within loop has pentagonal symmetry and furthermore in any tiling there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up there can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry if there were more than one then rotating each about other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry which leads to a mathematical contradiction there are only two penrose tilings of each type with global pentagonal symmetry for p2 tiling by kites and darts center point is either a sun or star vertex inflation and deflation right thumb a pentagon decomposed into six smaller pentagons half a net with gaps alt many of common features of penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by substitution rules this is often referred to as inflation and deflation or composition and decomposition of tilings or collections of tiles in term inflation is used where other authors would use deflation followed by rescaling terms composition and decomposition which many authors also use are less ambiguous substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of same shape as those used in tiling and thus allow larger tiles to be composed from smaller ones this shows that penrose tiling has a scaling self similarity and so can be thought of as a fractal p on fractal nature of penrose tiling current science 79 2000 p364 penrose originally discovered p1 tiling in this way by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons one half of a net of a dodecahedron and five half diamonds he then observed that when he repeated this process gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars diamonds boats and other pentagons by iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of two p1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry robinson triangle decompositions left thumb robinson triangles and their decompositions alt substitution method for both p2 and p3 tilings can be described using robinson triangles of different sizes robinson triangles arising in p2 tilings by bisecting kites and darts are called a tiles while those arising in p3 tilings by bisecting rhombs are called b tiles smaller a tile denoted as is an obtuse robinson triangle while larger a tile al is acute in contrast a smaller b tile denoted bs is an acute robinson triangle while larger b tile bl is obtuse concretely if as has side lengths 1 1 then al has side lengths 1 b tiles can be related to such a tiles in two ways if bs has same size as al then bl is an enlarged version as of as with side lengths 2 1 this decomposes into an al tile and as tile joined along a common side of length 1 if instead bl is identified with as then bs is a reduced version 1 al of al with side lengths 1 1 1 joining a bs tile and a bl tile along a common side of length 1 then yields a decomposition of an al tile in these decompositions there appears to be an ambiguity robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways which are mirror images of each other in isosceles axis of symmetry of triangle in a penrose tiling this choice is fixed by matching rules furthermore matching rules also determine how smaller triangles in tiling compose to give larger ones it follows that p2 and p3 tilings are mutually locally derivable a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into a tiles and these can be composed in a canonical way to form b tiles and hence rhombs p2 and p3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with p1 tiling see figure 2 above decomposition of b tiles into a tiles may be written bs al bl al as assuming larger size convention for b tiles which can be summarized in a substitution matrix equation combining this with decomposition of enlarged a tiles into b tiles yields substitution so that enlarged tile al decomposes into two al tiles and one as tiles matching rules force a particular substitution two al tiles in a al tile must form a kite thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two half darts and a dart decomposes into a kite and two half darts enlarged b tiles decompose into b tiles in a similar way via a tiles composition and decomposition can be iterated so that for example number of kites and darts in nth iteration of construction is determined by nth power of substitution matrix where fn is nth fibonacci number ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large p2 penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to golden ratio a similar result holds for ratio of number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in p3 penrose tiling deflation for p2 and p3 tilings thumb consecutive deflations of sun vertex in a penrose tiling of type p2 thumb consecutive deflations of a tile set in a penrose tiling of type p2 filling a 16 9 wide rectangle thumb 8th deflation of sun vertex in a penrose tiling of type p2 starting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling which might be a single tile a tiling of plane or any other collection deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations in one generation of deflation each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled down versions of tiles used in original tiling substitution rules guarantee that new tiles will be arranged in accordance with matching rules repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles this rule for dividing tiles is a subdivision rule name initial

with caution half kite and half dart deflation are only useful in context of deflating a larger pattern as shown in sun and star deflations they give incorrect results if applied to single kites and darts in addition simple subdivision rule generates holes near edges of tiling which are just visible in top and bottom illustrations on right additional forcing rules are useful consequences and applications inflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart p2 tilings or rhombus p3 tilings known as up down generation penrose tilings being non periodic have no translational symmetry pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over entire plane however any bounded region no matter how large will be repeated an infinite number of times within tiling therefore no finite patch can uniquely determine a full penrose tiling nor even determine which position within tiling is being shown any finite patch that we choose in a tiling will lie inside a single inflated tile if we continue moving far enough up in inflation hierarchy this means that anywhere that tile occurs at that level in hierarchy our original patch must also occur in original tiling therefore patch will occur infinitely often in original tiling and in fact in every other tiling as well this shows in particular that number of distinct penrose tilings of any type is uncountably infinite up down generation yields one method to parameterize tilings but other methods use ammann bars or cut and project schemes related tilings and topics decagonal coverings and quasicrystals 300px thumb right gummelt s decagon left with decomposition into kites and darts indicated by dashed lines thicker darker lines bound an inscribed ace and thick rhomb possible overlaps right are by one or two red aces alt in 1996 german mathematician petra gummelt demonstrated that a covering so called to distinguish it from a non overlapping tiling equivalent to penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches and covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with coloring a suitable decomposition of decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a penrose p2 tiling similarly a p3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon remaining space is filled by thin rhombs these coverings have been considered as a realistic model for growth of quasicrystals overlapping decagons are quasi unit cells analogous to unit cells from which
