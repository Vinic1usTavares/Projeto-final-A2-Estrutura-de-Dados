thumb right hester lynch thrale author of thraliana thraliana was a diary kept by hester thrale and is part of genre known as table talk although work began as thrale s diary focused on her experience with her family it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and stories about life of samuel johnson work was used as a basis for thrale s anecdotes of late samuel johnson but thraliana remained unpublished until 1942 anecdotes contained within work were popular with thrale s contemporaries but seen as vulgar among 20th century readers work was popular and many literary critics believe that work is a valuable contribution to genre and for providing information about johnson s and her own life background hester thrale when still hester lynch salusbury spent her youth writing letters and keeping journals her talents at writing won her respect of her uncles sir robert cotton and sir thomas salusbury who later appointed her their heir bloom 1998 p 74 when thrale was older she became close to johnson it was natural to her to keep a detailed collection of anecdotes and stories of their time together as of everything she experienced balderston 1951 p ix two initially bonded after thrale gave birth to her first child queeney in 1766 thumb right samuel johnson however there were problems between thrale and johnson along with his defenders during his life and in criticism since then over their gradual estrangement from each other after death of her husband these problems were then heightened by her marriage to gabriel piozzi after johnson s death thrale felt isolated because she believed that johnson s previous friends along with public as a whole did not accept her and some went so far as to claim she abandoned johnson in his final moments brownley 1985 p 631 in particular james boswell who resented thrale and felt himself as her literary competitor began to exploit falling out between thrale and johnson s friends in order to promote his life of samuel johnson after birth of queeney thrale began to document various moments in her daughter s life in a baby book called children s book work eventually expanded to include documentation of whole family and was retitled family book to encourage his wife s writing her husband henry thrale gave her six blank diary books with title thraliana on cover in 1776 work was intended as an ana balderston 1951 p x which she admits her fascination with in thraliana i am grown quite mad after these french anas anecdote is in itself so seducing thrale 1951 p 463 after searching for english models for writing her ana she settled on used john selden s table talk william camden s remains and joseph spence s anecdotes as her guides in may 1778 she was given by johnson a manuscript of spence s anecdotes but her first years of ana were written without an exact model balderston 1951 p xi before thraliana thrale kept two sets of anecdotes first was devoted to samuel johnson and other for miscellaneous events she relied on these along with her memory to write early portions of her work balderston 1951 p xii boswell when trying to find information for his own work wrote mr thrale told me i am not sure what day that there is a book of johnsoniana kept int heir family in which all mr johnson s sayings and all that they can collect about him is put down i must try to get this miscellany to assist me in writing mr johnson s life if mrs thrale does not intend to do it herself boswell 1941 p 200 after johnson s death thrale used thraliana to create anecdotes of late samuel johnson 1786 bloom 1998 p 75 manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by a edward newton until his death in autumn 1940 thraliana was eventually published in 1942 and it was produced by clarendon press in england while its editor katharine balderston was prohibited from travelling across ocean from wellesley college because of world war ii balderston 1951 p vi ana thrale explains that her book is not for diary keeping in strict sense when she writes on first page it is many years since doctor samuel johnson advised me to get a little book and write in it all little anecdotes which might come to my knowledge all observations i might make or hear all verses never likely to be published and in fine ev ry thing which struck me at time mr thrale has now treated me with a repository and provided it with pompous title of thraliana i must endeavour to fill it with nonsense new and old thrale 1951 p 1 these encouraging remarks from johnson set theme of work as it became a new johnsoniana collection in particular she transferred her previous notes and documentations about johnson s life into collection in a 6 september 1777 letter johnson told thrale to be punctual in annexing dates chronology you know is eye of history johnson no 542 however system of ana allowed thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics like odd medical stories to organize anecdotes quotations and stories when henry thrale died while thrale was writing volume three work became a diary for thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss this volume soon began to describe thrale s feelings for gabriel piozzi throughout thraliana thrale examines how others view her which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived this is especially true when she writes life has been to me nothing but a perpetual canvass carried on in all parts of world not to make friends neither for i have certainly found very few but to keep off enemies thrale initially did not want to write in sixth volume of thraliana but did so because johnson said that pleasure might one day be made from such nonsense so i ll e en finish this last volume of anecdote store up no more stuff thrale vol ii p 840 however she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for remainder of her life brownley 1985 p 635 critical response thrale s anecdotes were popular when they were first published in various works but many readers initially thought that her relaxed and natural style was vulgar brownley 1985 p 630 however martine brownley points out that this style helped win over 20th century readers even though work suffered from unevenness katherine balderston regards work as what was almost if not quite first english ana james clifford declared that there is much valuable evidence about great man samuel johnson within thraliana clifford 1978 p 10 he also stated that work along with her anecdotes of late samuel johnson established her reputation as a bluestocking writer of late eighteenth century edward bloom et al claim that thraliana as with her letters lays bare a woman s psychology bloom 1978 p 310 notes references
