pumpkin bombs were conventional aerial bombs developed by manhattan project and used by united states army air forces against japan during world war ii it was a close replication of fat man plutonium bomb with same ballistic and handling characteristics but it used non nuclear conventional high explosives it was mainly used for testing and training purposes which included combat missions flown with pumpkin bombs by 509th composite group name pumpkin bomb was term used in official documents from large fat ellipsoidal shape of munition casing instead of more usual cylindrical shape of other bombs intended to enclose fat man s spherical physics package plutonium implosion nuclear weapon core development pumpkin bombs were a means of providing realistic training with non nuclear bombs for 509th composite group s boeing b 29 superfortress crews assigned to drop atomic bomb pumpkin bomb had same weight size and weight distribution as fat man plutonium bomb giving it same ballistic and handling characteristics specifications for bomb required that it be carried in forward bomb bay of a silverplate b 29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets pumpkin bombs were produced in both inert and high explosive variants inert versions were filled with a cement plaster sand mixture that was combined with water to density of composition b high explosive versions filler of both variants had same weight and weight distribution as inner spherical physics package of fat man plutonium bomb concept for high explosive pumpkin bomb was originated in december 1944 by u s navy captain william s parsons head of ordnance division at manhattan project s los alamos laboratory and united states army air forces lieutenant colonel paul w tibbets commander of 509th composite group prior testing was carried out with an inert version name pumpkin bomb originated with parsons and dr charles c lauritsen of california institute of technology who managed development team name was used for training bombs in official meetings and documents and probably derived from its large ellipsoidal shape on other hand anecdotal sources attribute naming of bombs to a pumpkin color while bombs were painted olive drab or khaki in field photographs show that at least units delivered to tinian were shipped in same yellow zinc chromate primer color worn by fat man while many manhattan scientists expected that development of means of delivery of atomic bomb would be straightforward parsons with his experience of proximity fuze program expected that it would involve considerable effort test program was initiated on 13 august 1943 at naval proving ground in dahlgren virginia where a scale model of fat man plutonium bomb was developed on 3 march 1944 testing moved to army air field california initial tests demonstrated that fat man assembly was unstable in flight and that its fuzes did not work properly production shells of pumpkin bomb were manufactured by two los angeles firms consolidated steel corporation and western pipe and steel company while california parachute tail assembly was produced by centerline company of detroit after initial development management of program was turned over to u s navy bureau of ordnance in may 1945 a total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually delivered at a cost of between 1 000 and 2 000 apiece all of inert versions went from manufacturers directly to wendover army air field utah by rail where they were used by 216th base unit in flight testing of bomb some test drop missions were flown by 509th composite group s 393d bombardment squadron as training exercises bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to naval ammunition depot mcalester oklahoma for filling with explosives composition b was poured as a slurry solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours sealed and shipped by railroad to port chicago naval magazine california for shipment by sea to tinian description pumpkin bombs were externally similar to fat man bomb in size and shape and both had same california parachute square tail assembly and single point attachment lug pumpkin bomb had three contact fuzes arranged in an equilateral triangle around nose of bomb while atomic bomb had four fuse housings atomic bomb had its shell sections bolted together and sealed with externally applied sprayed on liquid asphalt but most if not all of pumpkin bombs were welded with a four inch hole used for filling shell fat man also had four external mounting points for radar antennas which pumpkin bombs did not have pumpkin bombs were in length and in maximum diameter they weighed consisting of for shell for tail assembly and of composition b filler shells were made of steel plate and tail assemblies from aluminum plate combat missions combat missions were flown by 509th composite group on 20 23 26 and 29 july and 8 and 14 august 1945 using bombs against individual targets in japanese cities a total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets one bomb was jettisoned into ocean and two were aboard aircraft that aborted their missions mission parameters and protocols were similar to those of actual atomic bomb missions and all targets were located in vicinity of cities designated for atomic attack bombs were released at an altitude of and aircraft then went into sharp turn required on a nuclear mission after war strategic bombing survey concluded that pumpkin bombs were a reasonably effective weapon against japanese plants when direct hits were scored on vital areas or when near miss was sufficiently close to important buildings to cause severe structural damage notes references category world war ii aerial bombs of united states category history of manhattan project category atomic bombings of hiroshima
