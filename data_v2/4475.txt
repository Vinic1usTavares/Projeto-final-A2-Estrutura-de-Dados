james longstreet january 8 2 1904 was one of foremost confederate generals of american civil war and principal subordinate to general robert e lee who called him his old war horse he served under lee as a corps commander for most of famous battles fought by army of northern virginia in eastern theater and briefly with braxton bragg in army of tennessee in western theater after graduating from united states military academy at west point longstreet served in mexican american war he was wounded in thigh at battle of chapultepec and afterward married his first wife louise garland throughout 1850s he served on frontier duty in american southwest in june 1861 longstreet resigned his u s army commission and joined confederate army he commanded confederate troops during an early victory at blackburn s ford in july and played a minor role at first battle of bull run longstreet made significant contributions to several important confederate victories mostly in eastern theater as one of robert e lee s chief subordinates in army of northern virginia he performed poorly at seven pines by accidentally marching his men down wrong road causing them to be late in arrival but played an important role in success of seven days battles in summer of 1862 longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed union army at second bull run in august his men held their ground in defensive roles at antietam and fredericksburg longstreet s most controversial service was at battle of gettysburg in july 1863 where he openly disagreed with general lee on tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several unsuccessful attacks on union forces including disastrous pickett s charge afterwards longstreet was at his own request sent to western theater to fight under braxton bragg where his troops launched a ferocious assault on union lines at chickamauga which carried day afterwards his performance in command during knoxville campaign resulted in a confederate defeat longstreet s tenure in western theater was marred by his central role in numerous conflicts amongst confederate generals unhappy serving under bragg longstreet and his men were sent back to lee he ably commanded troops during battle of wilderness in 1864 where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire he later returned to field serving under lee in siege of petersburg and appomattox campaign he enjoyed a successful post war career working for u s government as a diplomat civil servant and administrator his conversion to republican party and his cooperation with his old friend president ulysses s grant as well as critical comments he wrote about lee s wartime performance made him anathema to many of his former confederate colleagues his reputation in south further suffered when he led african american militia against anti reconstruction white league at battle of liberty place in 1874 authors of lost cause movement focused on longstreet s actions at gettysburg as a primary reason for confederacy s loss of war since late 20th century his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment many civil war historians now consider him among war s most gifted tactical commanders early life boyhood james longstreet was born on january 8 1821 in edgefield district south carolina an area that is now part of north augusta edgefield county he was fifth child and third son of james longstreet 1783 1833 of dutch descent and mary ann dent 1793 1855 of english descent originally from new jersey and maryland respectively who owned a cotton plantation close to where village of gainesville would be founded in northeastern georgia james s ancestor dirck immigrated to dutch colony of new netherland in 1657 but name became anglicized over generations longstreet wrote in his memoirs p 13 that it is difficult to determine whether name sprang from france germany or holland james s father was impressed by his son s character on rural plantation giving him nickname peter and he was known as pete or old pete for rest of his life longstreet s father decided on a military career for his son but felt that local education available to him would not be adequate preparation at age of nine james was sent to live with his aunt frances eliza and uncle augustus baldwin longstreet in augusta georgia james spent eight years on his uncle s plantation westover just outside city while he attended academy of richmond county his father died from a cholera epidemic while visiting augusta in 1833 although james s mother and rest of family moved to somerville alabama following his father s death james remained with uncle augustus as a boy longstreet enjoyed swimming hunting fishing and riding horses he became adept at shooting firearms northern georgia was very rural frontier territory during longstreet s boyhood and southern genteel traditions had not yet taken hold as a result longstreet s manners were sometimes rather rough he dressed unceremoniously and at times used coarse language although not in presence of women in his old age longstreet described his aunt and uncle as caring and loving he never made any known political statements before war and seemed largely disinterested in politics but augustus as a lawyer judge newspaper editor and methodist minister was a man of some political prominence and was a fierce states rights partisan who supported south carolina during nullification crisis it is considered likely that longstreet was exposed to these ideas while living with him augustus was also known for drinking whiskey and playing card games even though many americans in this era considered them to be immoral habits he seems to have passed on to longstreet west point and early military service in 1837 augustus attempted to obtain an appointment for his nephew to united states military academy but vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled so longstreet was appointed in 1838 by a relative reuben chapman who represented first district of alabama where mary longstreet lived longstreet was a poor student by his own admission in his memoirs he had more interest in school of soldier horsemanship exercise and outside game of foot ball than in academic courses he ranked in bottom third of every subject during his four years at academy in january of his third year longstreet initially failed his mechanics exam but took a second test two days later and passed longstreet s engineering instructor in his fourth year was dennis hart mahan a man who stressed swift maneuvering protection of interior lines and positioning troops in strategic points rather than attempting to destroy enemy s army outright although longstreet earned modest grades in course his behavior during civil war followed similar tactics in end longstreet ranked 54th out of 56 cadets when he was graduated in 1842 longstreet was also a disciplinary problem at west point he earned a large number of demerits especially in his final two years his offenses included visiting after taps absence at roll call an untidy room long hair causing a disturbance during study time and disobeying orders biographer jeffry d wert says longstreet was neither a model student nor a gentleman he was popular with his classmates however and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during civil war including george henry thomas william s rosecrans his west point roommate john pope d h hill lafayette mclaws george pickett and ulysses s grant who was of class of 1843 longstreet was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant after a brief furlough he set out to join 4th u s infantry at jefferson barracks missouri longstreet spent his first two years of service at post which was under command of lt col john garland in 1843 he was joined by his friend lieutenant ulysses grant in 1844 longstreet met his future first wife maria louisa garland called louise by her family she was daughter of longstreet s commander lt col garland at about same time as longstreet began courting garland grant became acquainted with and courted longstreet s fourth cousin julia dent and couple eventually married historians agree that longstreet attended grant wedding on august 22 1848 in st louis but his role at ceremony remains unclear smith p 73 grant biographer jean edward smith asserted that longstreet served as grant s best man at wedding john y simon editor of julia grant s memoirs concluded that longstreet may have been a and longstreet biographer donald brigman sanger called role of best man uncertain while noting that neither grant nor longstreet mentioned such a role in either of their memoirs sanger p 13 later in 1844 regiment along with third infantry was transferred to camp near louisiana as part of army of observation under general zachary taylor on march 8 1845 longstreet received a promotion to second lieutenant and was transferred to eighth infantry stationed at fort marion in st augustine florida he served for month of august on court martial duty in pensacola regiment was then transferred to corpus christi texas where he was reunited with officers of third and fourth regiments including grant men passed winter by staging plays mexican american war longstreet served with distinction in mexican american war with 8th u s infantry he fought under zachary taylor as a lieutenant in may 1846 in battles of palo alto and resaca de la palma he recounted both of these battles in his memoirs but wrote nothing about his personal role in them on june 10 longstreet was given command of company a of eighth infantry of william j worth s second division he fought again with taylor s army at battle of monterrey in september 1846 during battle about 200 mexican lancers drove back a group of american troops longstreet commanding companies a and b led a counterattack killing or wounding almost half of lancers on february 23 1847 he was promoted to rank of second lieutenant he served at battle of contreras in august longstreet served in battle of churubusco a pivotal battle as u s army moved closer to capturing mexican capital of mexico city eighth infantry was only force in worth s division to reach mexican earthworks longstreet carried regimental banner under heavy mexican fire troops found themselves stuck in a ditch and could only scale mexican defenses by standing on each other in fierce hand to hand combat that ensued americans prevailed longstreet received a brevet promotion to captain for his actions at churubusco he received a brevet promotion to major for molino del rey in battle of chapultepec on september 12 he was wounded in thigh while charging up hill with his regimental colors falling he handed flag to his friend lt george e pickett who was able to reach summit longstreet recovered in home of escandon family which treated wounded american soldiers his wound was slow to heal and he did not leave home until december after a brief visit with his family longstreet went to missouri to visit louise subsequent activities thumb right 200px antebellum portrait of longstreet after war and his recovery from chapultepec wound longstreet and louise garland were officially married on march 8 1848 and marriage produced 10 children little is known of their courtship or marriage longstreet mentions her only rarely in his memoirs and never revealed any personal details there are no surviving letters between two most anecdotes about their relationship come through writings of longstreet s second wife helen dortch longstreet novelist ben ames williams a descendant of longstreet included longstreet as a minor character in two of his novels williams questioned longstreet s surviving children and grandchildren and in novels depicted him as a very devoted family man with an exceptionally happy marriage longstreet s first assignment placed him on recruiting duty in poughkeepsie new york where he served for several months after travelling to st louis for grant wedding longstreet and his wife moved to carlisle barracks pennsylvania on january 1 1850 he was appointed chief commissary for department of texas responsible for acquiring and distributing food to soldiers and animals of department job was complex and consisted mainly of paperwork although it provided valuable experience in how to manage troops in june longstreet hoping to find promotion and an income above his 40 per month salary to support his growing family requested transfer to cavalry his request was rejected he resigned as commissary in march 1851 and returned to eighth infantry longstreet served on frontier duty in texas at fort martin scott near fredericksburg primary purpose of military in texas was to protect frontier communities against indians and longstreet frequently participated in scouting missions against comanche his family remained in san antonio and he saw them regularly in 1854 he was transferred to fort bliss in el paso and louise and children moved in with him in 1855 longstreet was involved in fighting against mescalero he assumed command of garrison at fort bliss on two occasions between spring of 1856 and spring of 1858 time at fort bliss was pleasant small size of garrison allowed for easy socialization with local people and fort s location allowed louise to visit her parents in santa fe longstreet performed scouting missions on march 29 1858 longstreet wrote to adjutant general s office in washington d c requesting that he be assigned to recruiting duty in east which would allow him to better educate his children he was granted a six month leave but request for assignment in east was denied and he was instead directed to serve as major and paymaster for 8th infantry in leavenworth kansas he left his son garland in a school at yonkers new york before journeying to kansas on way longstreet came across his old friend grant in st louis missouri grant was very poor but nonetheless asked that longstreet accept a five dollar gold piece that he had borrowed at west point longstreet initially refused but grant insisted and got him to take it longstreet s time in leavenworth lasted about a year until he was transferred to colonel garland s department in albuquerque new mexico to serve as paymaster where he was joined by louise and their children knowledge of longstreet s prewar life is extremely limited his experience resembles that of many would be civil war generals insofar as he went to west point served with distinction in war with mexico and continued his career in peacetime army of 1850s but beyond that there are few details he left no diary and his lengthy memoirs focus almost entirely on recounting and defending his civil war military record they reveal little of his personal side while providing only a very cursory view of his pre war activities not only that but an 1889 fire destroyed his personal papers making it so that number of e antebellum private letters written by longstreet could be counted on one hand american civil war joining confederacy and initial hostilities at time of battle of fort sumter at beginning of american civil war longstreet was paymaster for united states army and stationed in albuquerque having not yet resigned his commission after news of engagement he joined his fellow southerners in leaving post in his memoirs longstreet calls it a sad day and records that a number of northern officers attempted to persuade him not to go he states that he asked one of them what course he would pursue if his state should pass ordinances of secession and call him to its defence he confessed that he would obey call longstreet was not enthusiastic about secession from union but he had long been infused with concept of states rights and felt he could not go against his homeland although he was born in south carolina and reared in georgia he offered his services to state of alabama which had appointed him to west point and where his mother still lived furthermore he was senior west point graduate from that state which implied a commensurate rank in state s forces would be available after settling his accounts he resigned from u s army on may 8 1861 to cast his lot with confederacy in civil war thumb left 200x sketch of longstreet 1861 longstreet arrived in richmond virginia with a commission as a lieutenant colonel in confederate states army he met with confederate president jefferson davis at executive mansion on june 22 1861 where he was informed that he had been appointed a brigadier general with date of rank on june 17 a commission he accepted on june 25 he was ordered to report to brig gen p g t beauregard at manassas where he was given command of a brigade of three virginia regiments 1st 11th and 17th virginia infantry regiments in confederate army of potomac longstreet pp 32 33 claimed that he sought only appointment as a paymaster but historians such as wert believe this was falsely modest and that he sought glory of infantry command from earliest days see wert 1993 pp 58 61 longstreet assembled his staff and trained his brigade incessantly on july 16 union general irvin mcdowell began marching his army toward manassas junction longstreet s brigade first saw action at blackburn s ford on july 18 when it collided with mcdowell s advance division under brigadier general daniel tyler an infantry charge pushed longstreet s men back and in his own words longstreet rode with sabre in hand for leading files determined to give them all that was in sword and my horse s heels or stop break a second attack soon began but confederate successes were hampered when inexperienced soldiers from colonel jubal early s brigade sent to reinforce longstreet began firing on their own men tyler eventually withdrew as he had orders not to bring on a general engagement battle preceded first battle of bull run first manassas when main attack came at opposite end of line on july 21 brigade played a relatively minor role although it endured artillery fire for nine hours between 5 and 6 in evening longstreet received an order from general joseph e johnston instructing him to take part in pursuit of federal troops who had been defeated and were fleeing battlefield he obeyed but when he met brigade of brigadier general milledge bonham bonham who outranked longstreet ordered him to retreat an order soon arrived from johnston ordering same longstreet was infuriated that his commanders would not allow a vigorous pursuit of defeated union army his trusted chief of staff moxley sorrel recorded that he was in a fine rage he dashed his hat furiously to ground stamped and bitter words escaped him he quoted longstreet as saying afterwards retreat hell federal army has broken to pieces on october 7 longstreet was promoted to major general and assumed command of a division in newly reorganized and renamed confederate army of northern virginia under johnston formed from previous army of potomac and army of shenandoah with four infantry brigades commanded by generals daniel harvey hill david r jones bonham and louis wigfall as well as hampton s legion commanded by wade hampton iii family tragedy on january 10 1862 longstreet traveled under orders from johnston to richmond where he discussed with davis creation of a draft or conscription program he spent much of intervening time with louise and their children and was back at army headquarters in centreville by 20th after only a day or two he received a telegram informing him that all four of his children were extremely sick in an outbreak of scarlet fever longstreet immediately returned to richmond longstreet arrived in richmond before death of his one year old daughter mary anne on january 25 four year old james died following day eleven year old augustus baldwin gus died on february 1 his 13 year old son garland remained ill but appeared to be out of mortal danger george pickett and his future wife lasalle were in longstreet s company throughout affair they arranged funeral and burial which for unknown reasons neither longstreet nor his wife attended longstreet waited a very short time to return to army doing so on february 5 he rushed back to richmond later in month when garland took a turn for worse but came back after he recovered losses were devastating for longstreet and he became withdrawn both personally and socially in 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties drinking and poker games after he returned from funeral headquarters social life became for a time more somber he rarely drank and his religious devotion increased peninsula that spring union maj gen george b mcclellan commander of army of potomac launched peninsula campaign intending to capture confederate capital of richmond in his memoirs longstreet would write that while in temporary command of confederate army he wrote to thomas j stonewall jackson proposing that he march to jackson in shenandoah valley and combine forces no evidence has emerged for this claim following delay of union offensive against richmond at siege of yorktown johnston oversaw a tactical withdrawal to outskirts of richmond where defenses had already been prepared longstreet s division formed rearguard which was heavily engaged at battle of williamsburg on may 5 there union troops beginning with joseph hooker s division of union iii corps which was commanded by samuel p heintzelman came out of a forest into open ground to attack longstreet s men to protect army s supply wagons longstreet launched a strong counterattack with brigades of cadmus m wilcox a p hill pickett and two other regiments assault drove union soldiers back finding ground he occupied untenable longstreet requested reinforcements from d h hill s division a little further up road and received among others early s brigade early then launched a fruitless and bloody attack well after wagons had already been safely evacuated overall battle was a success protecting passage of confederate supply wagons and delaying advance of mcclellan s army toward richmond affair resulted in capture of nine union artillery pieces longstreet reported 9 000 confederate troops engaged compared to 12 000 union troops and confederates suffered fewer casualties mcclellan inaccurately characterized battle as a union victory in a dispatch to washington on may 31 during battle of seven pines longstreet received his orders verbally from johnston but ended up apparently misremembering them he marched his men in wrong direction down wrong road causing congestion and confusion with other confederate units diluting effect of massive confederate counterattack against mcclellan he then got into an argument with maj gen benjamin huger over who had seniority causing significant delay when d h hill subsequently asked longstreet for reinforcements he complied but failed to properly coordinate his brigades late in day general edwin vose sumner crossed rain swollen chickahominy river with two divisions general johnston was wounded during battle although johnston preferred longstreet as his replacement command of army of northern virginia shifted to g w smith senior major general for a single day on june 1 richardson s division of sumner s corps engaged longstreet s men routing lewis armistead s brigade but brigades of pickett william mahone and roger atkinson pryor positioned in woods managed to hold it back after six hours of fighting battle ended in a draw johnston praised longstreet s performance in battle biographer william garrett piston marks it as lowest point in longstreet s military career longstreet s report unfairly blamed huger for mishaps on june 1 president s military advisor robert e lee assumed command of army of northern virginia in his memoirs longstreet suggested that he initially doubted lee s capacity for command sanger p 62 he wrote that his arrival was far from reconciling troops to loss of our beloved chief joseph e johnston he wrote that lee did not have much of a reputation at time that he took command and that there were therefore misgivings about lee s power and skill for field service in late june lee organized a plan to drive mcclellan s army away from capital which culminated in what became known as seven days battles at daybreak on june 27 at gaines s mill confederate army attacked v corps of union army under brigadier general fitz john porter which was positioned south of chickahominy river federal troops held their lines for most of day against attacks from divisions of a p hill and d h hill and jackson did not arrive until afternoon at about 5 p m longstreet received orders from lee to join battle longstreet s fresh troops accompanied by brigades of brigadier general john bell hood and colonel evander m law from william h c whiting s division charged union lines forcing them to retreat across chickahominy sanger pp 67 68 longstreet was engaged again on june 30 with about 20 000 men at glendale he departed from his usual strategy of placing troops several lines deep and instead spread them out which in opinion of some military historians cost him battle his efforts were further damaged by slowness of other confederate commanders and mcclellan was able to withdraw his army to high plateau of malvern hill sanger pp 72 74 jackson engaged at white oak swamp ignored reports of ways in which to cross swamp and refused to answer an inquiry from longstreet s staff officer john fairfax huger s advance was slow enough to allow federal troops to be transported away from guarding him and towards longstreet and theophilus holmes also performed poorly nearly 50 000 confederate troops stood within a few miles of field at glendale and rendered little to no assistance in a reconnaissance on evening of june 30 longstreet reported to lee that conditions were favorable enough to justify assault in fighting next day longstreet surrendered a p hill s entire division to magruder and marched his remaining troops toward union positions on confederate extreme right his men were exposed to fire on their flanks from mcclellan s troops and were forced to withdraw without success sanger p 74 throughout seven days battles longstreet had operational command of nearly half of lee s army 15 brigades as it drove mcclellan back down peninsula longstreet performed aggressively and quite well in his new larger command particularly at gaines s mill and glendale lee s army in general suffered from poor maps organizational flaws and weak performances by longstreet s peers including uncharacteristically stonewall jackson and was unable to destroy union army moxley sorrel wrote of longstreet s confidence and calmness in battle he was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle world seemed flying to pieces general lee said shortly after seven days longstreet was staff in my right hand he had been established as lee s principal lieutenant lee reorganized army of northern virginia after seven days increasing longstreet s command from six brigades to 28 over time lee and longstreet became good friends and set up headquarters very near each other despite sharing with jackson a belief in temperance as well as a deep religious conviction lee never developed as strong a friendship with him piston speculates that more relaxed atmosphere of longstreet s headquarters which included gambling and drinking allowed lee to relax and take his mind off war and reminded him of his more happy younger days after campaign an editorial appeared in richmond examiner inaccurately claiming that that battle of glendale was fought exclusively by general a p hill and forces under his command longstreet then drafted a letter refuting article which was published in richmond whig hill took offense and requested that his division be transferred out of longstreet s command longstreet agreed but lee took no action then hill refused to accede to longstreet s repeated requests for information and was eventually arrested on longstreet s orders he challenged longstreet to a duel who accepted but lee intervened and transferred hill s division out of longstreet s command and into jackson s second bull run military reputations of lee s corps commanders are often characterized as stonewall jackson representing audacious offensive component of lee s army with longstreet more typically advocating and executing strong defensive strategies and tactics jackson has been described as army s hammer longstreet its anvil in first part of northern virginia campaign of august 1862 this stereotype held true but in climactic battle it did not in june federal government created 50 000 strong army of virginia and put major gen john pope in command for confederate army longstreet commanded right wing later to become known as first corps and jackson commanded left wing pope moved south in an attempt to attack lee and threaten richmond through an overland march lee left longstreet near richmond to guard city and dispatched jackson to hinder pope s advance jackson won a major victory at battle of cedar mountain after learning that mcclellan as ordered had dispatched troops north to assist pope lee ordered longstreet north as well leaving only three divisions under g w smith to protect richmond against mcclellan s reduced force longstreet s men began their march on august 17 aided by stuart s cavalry on august 23 longstreet engaged pope s position in a minor artillery duel at first battle of rappahannock station confederate washington artillery was heavily damaged and a union shell landed feet away from longstreet and wilcox but failed to explode meanwhile stuart s cavalry rode around army of virginia and captured hundreds of soldiers and horses as well as some of pope s personal belongings jackson executed a sweeping flanking maneuver that captured pope s main supply depot he placed his corps in rear of pope s army but he then took up a defensive position and effectively invited pope to assault him on august 28 and august 29 start of second battle of bull run second manassas pope pounded jackson as longstreet and remainder of army marched from west through thoroughfare gap to reach battlefield on afternoon of 28th longstreet engaged a 5 000 man federal division under james b ricketts at battle of thoroughfare gap ricketts had been ordered to delay longstreet s march towards main confederate army but he took up his position too late allowing george t anderson s brigade to occupy high ground lee and longstreet watched battle together and decided to flank union position hood s division and a brigade under henry l benning advanced towards gap from north and south respectively while wilcox s division followed in a six mile march northward ricketts realized his position was untenable and withdrew that evening allowing longstreet to join up with rest of lee s army postwar criticism of longstreet claimed that he marched his men too slowly leaving jackson to bear brunt of fighting for two days but they covered roughly in a little over 24 hours and lee did not attempt to get his army concentrated any faster thumb upright left longstreet circa 1862 when longstreet s men arrived at second manassas around midday on august 29 lee planned a flanking attack on union army which was concentrating its attention on jackson longstreet demurred against three suggestions from lee urging him to attack recommending instead that a reconnaissance in force be conducted to survey ground in front of him by 6 30 p m hood s division moved forward against porter s corps and longstreet withdrew it at 8 30 p m having a better idea of terrain and enemy soldiers in area despite smashing victory that followed longstreet s performance at battle was criticized by postbellum advocates of lost cause claiming that his slowness reluctance to attack and disobedience to general lee were a harbinger of his controversial performance to come on july 2 1863 at battle of gettysburg lee s biographer douglas southall freeman wrote seeds of much of disaster at gettysburg were sown in that instant when lee yielded to longstreet and longstreet discovered that he would longstreet biographer jeffry d wert disputes this conclusion pointing out that in a post war letter to longstreet porter told him that had he attacked him that day his loss would have been enormous despite this criticism following day august 30 was one of longstreet s finest performances of war after his attacks on 29th pope came to believe with little evidence that jackson was in retreat he ordered a reluctant porter to move his corps forward in pursuit and they collided with jackson s men and suffered heavy casualties attack exposed union left flank and longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on union flank with over 25 000 men for over four hours they pounded like a giant hammer with longstreet actively directing artillery fire and sending brigades into fray longstreet and lee were together during assault and both of them came under union artillery fire although union troops put up a furious defense pope s army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to embarrassing union defeat at first bull run fought on roughly same battleground longstreet gave all of credit for victory to lee describing campaign as clever and brilliant it established a strategic model he believed to be ideal use of defensive tactics within a strategic offensive on september 1 jackson s corps moved to cut off union retreat at battle of chantilly longstreet s men remained on field in order to fool pope into thinking that lee s entire army was still on his front antietam and fredericksburg longstreet s actions in final two major confederate defensive battles of 1862 would be proving grounds for his development of dominant defensive tactics after confederate success at second manassas lee holding strategic initiative decided to take war to maryland to relieve virginia and hopefully induce foreign nations to come to confederates aid longstreet supported plan situation called for action he later said and there was but one opening across potomac his men crossed into maryland on september 6 and arrived in frederick following day in maryland campaign of september at battle of antietam longstreet held his part of confederate defensive line against union forces twice as numerous after delaying action longstreet s corps fought at south mountain he retired to sharpsburg to join stonewall jackson and prepared to fight a defensive battle using terrain to his advantage longstreet validated his idea that tactical defense was now vastly superior to exposed offense while offense dominated in time of napoleon technological advancements had overturned this lt col harold m knudsen claims that longstreet was one of few civil war officers sensible of this development at end of that bloodiest day of civil war lee greeted his subordinate by saying ah here is longstreet here s my old war horse on october 9 a few weeks after antietam longstreet was promoted to lieutenant general lee arranged for longstreet s promotion to be dated one day earlier than jackson s making old war horse senior lieutenant general in entire confederate army in an army reorganization in november longstreet s command now designated first corps consisted of five divisions approximately 41 000 men thumb a map of battle of fredericksburg in december longstreet s first corps played decisive role in battle of fredericksburg midway between two opposing capitals where confederate army made its stand to protect richmond from army of potomac now commanded by ambrose burnside since lee moved longstreet to fredericksburg early it allowed longstreet to take time to dig in portions of his line methodically site artillery and set up a kill zone over axis of advance he thought union attack would follow remembering slaughter at antietam in which confederates did not build defensive works longstreet ordered trenches abatis and to be constructed south of town along a stonewall at foot of marye s heights which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by army of northern virginia this was completed in days before battle after failing to cross rappahannock on december 11 burnside ordered an artillery bombardment of town and forced his way across following day longstreet had his men firmly entrenched along marye s heights on december 13 under burnside s orders troops from union right grand division under sumner launched fourteen frontal assaults against longstreet s troops who unexpectedly found themselves at center of battle when lee expressed apprehension that federal troops might overrun longstreet s men longstreet replied that as long as he had sufficient ammunition he would kill them all before any of reached his line he advised him to look towards jackson s more tenuous position to right longstreet was proven correct for from their strong position longstreet s men easily held off all of union assaults while jackson managed with greater difficulty to repel a much stronger union attack by division of george meade one union general compared scene before marye s heights to a great slaughter pen and said that his men might as well have tried to take hell burnside intended to attack again next day but several of his officers particularly sumner advised him against it he entrenched his men instead and withdrew on december 15 union army suffered almost 8 000 casualties at marye s heights longstreet lost only 1 900 his great defensive success was not based entirely on advantage of terrain this time it was combination of terrain defensive works and a centralized coordination of artillery suffolk shortly after fredericksburg longstreet vaguely suggested to lee that one corps could hold rappahannock while other was operating elsewhere in february of 1863 he made a more specific request suggesting to wigfall that his corps be detached from army of northern virginia and sent to reinforce army of tennessee where gen braxton bragg was being challenged in middle tennessee by army of cumberland under union maj gen william s rosecrans longstreet s roommate at west point by this time longstreet could be identified as part of a western concentration bloc which believed that reinforcing confederate armies operating in western theater of war to protect states in that part of confederacy from invasion was more important than offensive campaigns in east this group also included joe johnston and louis wigfall now a confederate senator both of whom longstreet was very close with these people were generally cautious and believed that confederacy with its limited resources should engage in a defensive rather than an offensive war lee did detach two divisions from first corps but ordered them to richmond not tennessee seaborne movements of union ix corps potentially threatened vital ports on mid atlantic coast division of george pickett started for capital in mid february was followed by john hood s and then longstreet himself was told to take command of detached divisions and departments of north carolina and southern virginia divisions of mclaws and anderson remained with lee in april longstreet besieged union forces in city of suffolk virginia a minor operation but one that was very important to lee s army still stationed in war devastated central virginia it enabled confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of provisions that had been under union control however this operation caused longstreet and 15 000 men of first corps to be absent from battle of chancellorsville in may despite lee s brilliant victory at chancellorsville longstreet once again came under criticism claiming that he could have marched his men back from suffolk in time to join lee however from chancellorsville and suffolk scenario longstreet brought forward beginnings of a new confederate strategy these events proved that army of northern virginia could manage with fewer troops for periods of time and units could be shifted to create windows of opportunity in other theaters longstreet advocated first strategic movements to utilize rail interior lines and create temporary numerical advantages in mississippi or tennessee prior to gettysburg gettysburg campaign plans following chancellorsville and death of stonewall jackson longstreet and lee met in mid may to discuss options for army s summer campaign longstreet once more pushed for detachment of all or part of his corps to be sent to tennessee justification for this course of action was becoming more urgent as union maj gen ulysses s grant was advancing on critical confederate stronghold on mississippi river vicksburg longstreet argued that a reinforced army under bragg could defeat rosecrans and drive toward ohio river which would compel grant to break his hold on vicksburg he advanced these views during a meeting with confederate secretary of war james seddon who approved of idea but doubted that lee would do so and opined that davis was unlikely to go against lee s wishes longstreet had criticized bragg s generalship and may have been hoping to replace him although he also might have wished to see joseph johnston take command and indicated that he would be content to serve under him as a corps commander lee prevented this plan from taking place by telling davis that parting with large numbers of troops would force him to move his army closer to richmond and instead advancing a plan to invade pennsylvania a campaign in north would relieve agricultural and military pressure that war was placing on virginia and north carolina and by threatening a federal city disrupt union offensives elsewhere and erode support for war among northern civilians in his memoirs longstreet described his reaction to lee s proposal there is conflicting evidence for veracity of longstreet s account it was written years after campaign and is affected by hindsight both of results of battle and of postbellum criticism of lost cause authors in letters of time longstreet made no reference to such a bargain with lee in april 1868 lee said that he had never made any such promise and had never thought of doing any such thing yet in his post battle report lee wrote it had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base unless attacked by enemy army of northern virginia was reorganized after jackson s death two division commanders richard s ewell and a p hill were promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of second and newly created third corps respectively longstreet s first corps gave up division of maj gen richard h anderson during reorganization leaving him with divisions of hood mclaws and pickett after it was determined that an advance north was inevitable longstreet dispatched scout henry thomas harrison whom he had met during suffolk campaign to gather information he paid harrison in gold and told him that he did not care to see him till he could bring information of importance in initial movements of campaign longstreet s corps followed ewell s through shenandoah valley harrison reported to longstreet on evening of june 28 and was instrumental in warning confederates that army of potomac was advancing north to meet them more quickly than they had anticipated and were already massing around frederick maryland lee was initially skeptical but report prompted him to order immediate concentration of his army north of frederick near gettysburg pennsylvania harrison also brought news that joseph hooker had been replaced as commander of army of potomac by george meade july 1 2 thumb gettysburg july 2 longstreet s actions at battle of gettysburg would become centerpiece of controversy that surrounded him for over a century sears stephen w general longstreet and american cause american heritage feb march 2005 longstreet arrived on battlefield late in afternoon of first day july 1 1863 hours ahead of his troops by then two union corps had been driven by ewell and hill back through town into defensive positions on cemetery hill lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated but chance and questionable decisions by a p hill brought on battle which on first day was an impressive confederate victory meeting with lee longstreet was concerned about strength of union defensive position on elevated ground and advocated a strategic movement around left flank of enemy to secure good ground between him and his capital which would presumably compel meade to attack defensive positions erected by confederates instead lee exclaimed if enemy is there tomorrow i will attack him longstreet replied if he is there tomorrow it is because he wants you to attack lee s plan for july 2 called for longstreet to attack union s left flank which would be followed up by hill s attack on cemetery ridge near center while ewell demonstrated on union right longstreet was not ready to attack as early as lee envisioned he received permission from lee to wait for brig gen evander m law s brigade hood s division to reach field before he advanced any of his other brigades law marched his men quickly covering 28 miles in eleven hours but did not arrive until noon three of longstreet s brigades were still in march column and some distance from attack positions they would need to reach all of longstreet s divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching enemy position misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route postbellum criticism of longstreet claims that he was ordered by lee to attack in early morning and that his delays were a significant contributor to loss of battle however lee agreed to delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for attack until 11 a m although longstreet s motivations have long been clouded by vitriol of lost cause partisans see legacy many historians agree that longstreet did not aggressively pursue lee s orders to launch an attack as early as possible biographer jeffry d wert wrote longstreet deserves censure for his performance on morning of july 2 he allowed his disagreement with lee s decision to affect his conduct once commanding general determined to assail enemy duty required longstreet to comply with vigor and thoroughness that had previously characterized his generalship concern for detail regard for timely information and need for preparation were absent military historians herman hattaway and archer jones wrote unenthusiastic about attack longstreet consumed so much time in properly assembling and aligning corps that assault did not commence until 4 p m during all time that passed meade continued to move in troops to bring about a more and more complete concentration by 6 p m he had achieved numerical superiority and had his left well covered hattaway and jones pp 406 07 campaign historian edwin coddington presents a lengthy description of approach march which he described as a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia but not of lee s war horse and his veteran troops he called episode a dark moment in longstreet s career as a general gettysburg historian harry pfanz concluded that longstreet s angry dissidence had resulted in further wasted time and delay pfanz p 123 david l callihan in a 2002 reassessment of longstreet s legacy wrote it is appalling that a field commander of longstreet s experience and caliber would so cavalierly and ineptly march and prepare his men for battle callihan p 14 an alternative view has been expressed by john lott general longstreet did all that could be expected on 2nd day and any allegations of failing to exercise his duty by ordering a morning assault can be repudiated it would have been impossible to have commenced an attack much earlier than it occurred and it is doubtful that confederacy could have placed attack in any more secure hands than general longstreet lott p 27 regardless of controversy regarding preparations however once assault began around 4 p m longstreet pressed assault by mclaws and hood pickett s division had not yet arrived competently against fierce union resistance but it was largely unsuccessful with significant casualties july 3 on night of july 2 longstreet did not follow his usual custom of meeting gen lee at his headquarters to discuss day s battle claiming that he was too fatigued to make ride instead he spent part of night planning for a movement around big round top that would allow him to attack enemy s flank and rear longstreet despite his use of scouting parties was apparently unaware that a considerable body of troops from union vi corps was in position to block this move shortly after issuing orders for attack around sunrise longstreet was joined at his headquarters by lee who was dismayed at this turn of events commanding general had intended for longstreet to attack union left early in morning in a manner similar to attack of july 2 using pickett s newly arrived division in concert with a resumed attack by ewell on culp s hill what lee found was that no one had ordered pickett s division forward from its bivouac in rear and that longstreet had been planning an independent operation without consulting with him lee wrote with some restraint in his after battle report that longstreet s dispositions were not completed as early as was expected thumb pickett s charge july 3 since his plans for an early morning coordinated attack were now infeasible lee instead ordered longstreet to coordinate a massive assault on center of union line employing division of george pickett and brigades from a p hill s corps longstreet knew this assault had little chance of success union army was in a position reminiscent of one longstreet had taken at fredericksburg to defeat burnside s assault confederates would have to cover almost a mile of open ground and spend time negotiating sturdy fences under fire lessons of fredericksburg and malvern hill were lost to lee on this day in his memoirs longstreet claims to have told lee that he believed attack on union center would fail during artillery barrage that preceded infantry assault longstreet began to agonize over an assault that was going to cost dearly he attempted to pass responsibility for launching pickett s division to his artillery chief col edward porter alexander when time came to actually order pickett forward longstreet could only nod in assent unable to verbalize order assault known as pickett s charge suffered heavy casualties that longstreet anticipated it was decisive point in confederate loss at gettysburg and lee ordered a retreat back to virginia following day criticism of longstreet after war was based not only on his reputed conduct at battle of gettysburg and support for reconstruction but also intemperate remarks he made about robert e lee for example in his memoirs he commented for years after war longstreet s reputation suffered and was blamed for failed attack even though lee ordered advance after longstreet s repeated advice to cancel attack chickamauga in mid august 1863 longstreet once again resumed his attempts to be transferred to western theater he wrote a private letter to seddon requesting that he be transferred to serve under his old friend gen joseph johnston he followed this up in conversations with his congressional ally wigfall who had long considered longstreet a suitable replacement for braxton bragg bragg had a poor combat record and was very unpopular with his men and officers since bragg s army was under increasing pressure from rosecrans outside of chattanooga lee and president davis agreed to request on september 5 in one of most daunting logistical efforts of confederacy longstreet with divisions of lafayette mclaws and john hood a brigade from george pickett s division and porter alexander s 26 gun artillery battalion traveled over 16 railroads on a route through carolinas to reach bragg in northern georgia although entire operation would take over three weeks lead elements of corps arrived on september 17 on september 19 at battle of chickamauga bragg began an unsuccessful attempt to interpose his army between rosecrans and chattanooga before arrival of most of longstreet s corps throughout day confederate troops launched largely unsuccessful assaults on union positions that were highly costly for both sides one of longstreet s own divisions under hood successfully resisted a strong union counterattack from jefferson c davis s division of xx corps that afternoon official records series i volume xxx part 1 pp 498 529 when longstreet himself arrived on field in late evening he failed to find bragg s headquarters he and his staff spent considerable time riding looking for them they accidentally came across a federal picket line and were nearly captured when two finally met at bragg s headquarters late at night bragg placed longstreet in command of left wing of his army lt gen leonidas polk commanded right on september 20 longstreet lined up eight brigades in a deep column against a narrow front an attack very similar to future german tank tactics in world war ii attack was supposed to begin early in morning shortly after an assault by polk s wing however confusion and mishandled orders caused polk s attack to be delayed and longstreet s advance did not begin until just after 11 after hearing gunfire from his left by chance a mistaken order from general rosecrans caused a gap to appear in union line by transferring thomas j wood s division from right to reinforce xiv corps under george henry thomas in center longstreet took additional advantage of confusion to increase his chances of success organization of attack was well suited to terrain and would have penetrated union line regardless bushrod johnson s division poured through gap driving union forces back after longstreet ordered thomas c hindman s division forward union right collapsed entirely rosecrans fled field as units began to retreat in panic thomas managed to rally retreating units and solidify a defensive position on snodgrass hill he held that position against repeated afternoon attacks by longstreet who was not adequately supported by confederate right wing once night fell battle was over and thomas was able to extricate units under his control to chattanooga bragg s failure to coordinate right wing and cavalry to further envelop thomas prevented a total rout of union army bragg also neglected to pursue retreating federals aggressively resulting in futile siege of chattanooga he had dismissed a proposal from longstreet that he do so citing a lack of transportation and calling plan a visionary scheme nevertheless chickamauga was greatest confederate victory in western theater and longstreet deserved and received a good portion of credit tennessee not long after confederates entered tennessee following their victory at chickamauga longstreet clashed with bragg and became leader of group of senior commanders of army who conspired to have him removed bragg s subordinates had long been dissatisfied with his abrasive personality and poor battlefield record arrival of longstreet senior lieutenant general in army and his officers and fact that they quickly took their side added credibility to earlier claims and was a catalyst toward action longstreet wrote to seddon i am convinced that nothing but hand of god can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander situation became so grave that president davis was forced to intercede in person what followed was one of most bizarre scenes of war with bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him longstreet stated that bragg was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight and that he knew nothing of business on october 12 davis declared his support for bragg he left him and his dissatisfied subordinates in their positions doing nothing to resolve conflict thumb left carte de visite portrait of longstreet 160px bragg relieved or reassigned generals who had testified against him and retaliated against longstreet by reducing his command to only those units that he brought with him from virginia despite dysfunctional command climate under bragg and lack of support from war department and president davis concerning bragg s removal longstreet did best he could to continue to seek options in chattanooga campaign bragg resigned himself and his army to siege of union army of cumberland in chattanooga at about this time longstreet learned of birth of a son who was named robert lee grant arrived in chattanooga on october 23 and took overall command of new union military division of mississippi he replaced rosecrans with thomas while longstreet s relations with bragg were extremely poor his connection with his subordinates also soured he had a strong prewar friendship with mclaws but it began to show signs of souring after mclaws blamed longstreet for defeat at gettysburg and was accused by longstreet of displaying lethargy after chickamauga hood s old division was under temporary command of brigadier general micah jenkins brigadier general who had been in division longest was evander m law both men disliked each other and desired permanent command of division longstreet favored jenkins his longtime protege while most of men favored law longstreet had asked davis to name a permanent commander but he refused on october 27 union troops managed to open up a cracker line to bring food to their troops by defeating law s brigade of hood s division temporarily commanded by jenkins at battle of brown s ferry in nighttime battle of wauhatchie from october 28 29 jenkins failed to regain lost position he blamed law and brigadier general jerome b robertson for lack of success longstreet sided with jenkins in dispute longstreet took no immediate action against law but complained about robertson a court of inquiry was set up but its proceedings were suspended and robertson returned to command after confederate failures longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of siege by grant he knew this union reaction was underway and that nearest railhead was bridgeport alabama where portions of two union corps would soon arrive after sending his artillery commander porter alexander to reconnoiter union occupied town he devised a plan to shift most of army of tennessee away from siege setting up logistical support in rome georgia to go after bridgeport to take railhead possibly catching maj gen joseph hooker and arriving union troops from eastern theater in a disadvantageous position plan was well received and approved by president davis but it was disapproved by bragg who objected to significant logistical challenges it posed longstreet accepted bragg s arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to east tennessee to deal with an advance by union army of ohio commanded by maj gen ambrose burnside longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on bragg s part but also because war department intended for longstreet s men to return to lee s army and this movement was in that direction longstreet was criticized for slow pace of his advance toward knoxville in november and some of his troops began using nickname peter slow to describe him at battle of campbell s station on november 16 federals evaded longstreet s troops this was due both to poor performance of law who exposed his brigade to enemy and thus ruined what was supposed to be a surprise attack and burnside s skillful retreat confederates also dealt with muddy roads and a shortage of good supplies burnside settled into entrenchments around city which longstreet besieged longstreet soon learned that bragg had been defeated at chattanooga on november 25 and that william tecumseh sherman s men were marching to relieve burnside he decided to risk a frontal attack on union entrenchments before they arrived on november 29 he sent his troops forward at battle of fort sanders attack was repulsed and longstreet was forced to retreat when bragg was defeated by grant longstreet was ordered to join forces with army of tennessee in northern georgia he demurred and began to move back to virginia soon pursued by sherman longstreet defeated federal troops in an engagement at bean s station on december 14 before armies went into winter quarters greatest effect of campaign was to deprive bragg of troops he sorely needed in chattanooga longstreet s second independent command after suffolk was a failure and his self confidence was damaged he reacted to failure of campaign by blaming others he relieved lafayette mclaws from command and requested court martial of robertson and law he also submitted a letter of resignation to adjutant general samuel cooper on december 30 1863 but his request to be relieved was denied sufferings of confederate troops were to continue into winter longstreet set up his headquarters in rogersville he attempted to keep communications open with lee s army in virginia but federal cavalry general william w averell s raids destroyed railroads isolating him and forcing him to rely only on eastern tennessee for supplies longstreet s corps suffered through a severe winter in eastern tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions more than half of men were without shoes writing to georgia s quartermaster general ira roe foster on january 24 1864 longstreet noted there are five georgia brigades in this army wofford s g t anderson s bryan s benning s and crews cavalry brigade they are all alike in excessive need of shoes clothing of all kinds and blankets all that you can send will be thankfully received meanwhile longstreet again developed strategic plans he called for an offensive through tennessee into kentucky in which his command would be bolstered by p g t beauregard and 20 000 men although he had concurrence of general lee longstreet was unable to convince president davis or his newly appointed military advisor braxton bragg who had finally been relieved and replaced by joe johnston as commander of army of tennessee following defeat at chattanooga in february 1864 lines of communication were repaired once weather warmed longstreet s men marched north and returned to army of northern virginia at gordonsville wilderness to appomattox thumb longstreet s attack in battle of wilderness may 6 1864 shortly before he was wounded longstreet found out that his old friend ulysses s grant had been appointed general in chief of union army with headquarters in field alongside army of potomac longstreet told his fellow officers that he will fight us every day and every hour until end of war rhea p 42 longstreet helped save confederate army from defeat in his first battle back with lee s army battle of wilderness in may 1864 after grant moved south of rapidan river in an attempt to take richmond lee intended to delay battle in order to give longstreet s 14 000 men time to arrive on field grant disrupted these plans by attacking him on may 5 and fighting was inconclusive following morning at 5 a m hancock led two divisions in a ferocious attack on a p hill s corps driving men back two miles just as this was happening longstreet s men arrived on field they took advantage of an old roadbed built for an out of use railroad to creep through a densely wooded area unnoticed before launching a powerful flanking attack longstreet s men moved forward along orange plank road against ii corps and in two hours nearly drove it from field once again he developed innovative tactics to deal with difficult terrain ordering advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines which allowed his men to deliver a continuous fire into enemy while proving to be elusive targets themselves historian edward attributed much of success of army to display of tactical genius by longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength after war hancock said to longstreet of this flanking maneuver you rolled me up like a wet blanket foote p 177 thumb left james longstreet in 1865 longstreet was wounded during assault accidentally shot by his own men only about away from place where jackson suffered same fate a year earlier a bullet passed through his shoulder severing nerves and tearing a gash in his throat jenkins who was riding with longstreet was also shot and died from his wounds momentum of attack subsided as he was taken from field longstreet urged lee to press attack instead lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned giving union defenders adequate time to reorganize subsequent attack was a failure alexander called removal of longstreet critical juncture of battle i have always believed that but for longstreet s fall panic which was fairly underway in hancock s ii corps would have been extended have resulted in grant s being forced to retreat back across rapidan longstreet missed rest of 1864 spring and summer campaign where lee sorely missed his skill in handling army sawyer p 63 on may 1 he was confirmed as an episcopalian he was treated in lynchburg virginia and recuperated in augusta georgia with his cousin emma eve longstreet sibley daughter of his father s brother gilbert while in augusta he participated in funeral service for lt gen leonidas polk at saint paul s church joining bishops of mississippi and arkansas in casting earth onto coffin project canterbury website he rejoined lee in october 1864 with his right arm paralyzed and in a sling initially unable to ride a horse he had taught himself to write with his left hand by periodically pulling on his arm as advised by doctors he was able to regain use of his right hand in later years at this time longstreet s staff underwent major changes most significant was transfer of sorrel longstreet s chief of staff to brigade command he was replaced by major latrobe for remainder of siege of petersburg longstreet commanded defenses in front of capital of richmond including all forces north of james river and pickett s division at bermuda hundred he retreated with lee in appomattox campaign commanding both first and third corps following death of a p hill on april 2 as lee s army attempted to escape to farmville longstreet was engaged at sailor s creek on april 6 confederates were unable to reach town but with assistance of troops under anderson and ewell managed to prevent federal troops from blocking army s last path of escape overall battle ended in disaster with nearly 7 000 of 10 000 confederate troops engaged killed wounded or captured sanger 298 300 by april 7 lee s army had been reduced from nearly 40 000 men on march 31 to 25 000 a group of confederate officers including william n pendleton concluded that time had come to ask lee to open negotiations for army s surrender pendleton approached longstreet and asked him to intercede with lee but he refused saying if general lee doesn t know when to surrender until i tel him he will never know nevertheless pendleton approached lee who was in communication with grant on subject of confederate surrender but refused to surrender army sanger 302 lee held his last conference of war on night of april 8 it was decided that at daybreak longstreet would hold union troops back while john b gordon would lead an escape towards lynchburg and then cover his retreat sanger 303 at battle of appomattox court house that morning longstreet was heavily engaged with union ii corps under andrew a humphreys gordon s troops were surrounded and he requested reinforcements which longstreet could not furnish lee was left with no alternative but to meet general grant to discuss surrender sanger 306 308 lee worried that his refusal to meet with grant to discuss surrender terms at latter s first request would cause him to demand harsher terms this time longstreet advised him of his belief that grant would treat them fairly as lee rode toward appomattox court house on april 9 longstreet said that if grant gave too strong demands he ought to break off interview and tell general grant to do his worst after lee s surrender longstreet arrived in mclean house where grant happily greeted him he offered longstreet a cigar and invited him to play a card game why do men fight who were born to be brothers his whole greeting and conduct towards us was as though nothing had ever happened to mar our pleasant relations longstreet told a reporter postbellum life thumb james longstreet after war after war longstreet and his family settled in new orleans a location popular with a number of former confederate generals he entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became president of newly created and prominent insurance company he actively sought presidency of mobile and ohio railroad but was unsuccessful and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from new orleans around northwestern coast of gulf of mexico south across rio grande river and american mexican border to monterrey mexico in 1870 he was named president of newly organized new orleans and northeastern railroad with grant s support he applied for a pardon from president andrew johnson johnson refused however telling longstreet in a meeting there are three persons of south who can never receive amnesty mr davis general lee and yourself you have given union cause too much trouble regardless of such opposition radical republican controlled united states congress restored his citizenship rights in june 1868 longstreet was one of a small group of former confederate generals including james l alcorn and william mahone to join or ally with nationally dominant republican party during reconstruction era he endorsed grant for president in election of 1868 attended his inauguration ceremonies in washington d c and six days later was appointed by grant as surveyor of customs in new orleans for these acts he lost favor with many white southerners his old friend harvey hill wrote to a newspaper our scalawag is local leper of community unlike northerners who moved south and were sometimes referred to as carpetbaggers hill wrote longstreet is a native which is so much worse a major element of lost cause movement aside from attacking longstreet s war record was idea that central cause of civil war was protection of states rights not slavery responding to such arguments longstreet once remarked i never heard of any other cause of quarrel than slavery republican governor of louisiana appointed longstreet adjutant general of state militia and by 1872 he became a major general in command of all militia and state police forces within city of new orleans in april 1873 longstreet dispatched a police force under colonel theodore w deklyne to louisiana town of colfax to help local government and its majority black supporters defend themselves against an insurrection by white supremacists deklyne did not arrive until april 14 one day after colfax massacre by then his men s task consisted mainly of burying bodies of blacks who had been killed and attempting to arrest culprits during protests of election irregularities in 1874 referred to as battle of liberty place an armed force of 8 400 members of anti reconstructionist white league advanced on state house in new orleans which was capitol of louisiana at time after republican william pitt kellogg was declared winner of a close and heavily disputed gubernatorial election longstreet commanded a force of 3 600 metropolitan police city policemen and african american militia troops armed with two gatling guns and a battery of artillery he rode to meet protesters but was pulled from his horse shot by a spent bullet and taken prisoner white league charged causing many of longstreet s men to flee or surrender there were total casualties of 38 killed and 79 wounded federal troops sent by president grant were required to restore order longstreet s use of armed black troops during disturbances increased denunciations by anti reconstructionist and former southern confederates thumb left james longstreet in later life 1896 affecting sideburns of his opponent at fredericksburg and knoxville in 1875 longstreet family left new orleans with concerns over health and safety returning to gainesville georgia by this time louise had given birth to ten children five of whom lived to adulthood he applied for various jobs through rutherford b

march 1877 on one of his frequent return trips to new orleans on business longstreet converted to catholicism and was a devout believer until his death he was encouraged to convert by fr abram j ryan author of conquered banner who assured longstreet that he would be welcomed with open arms if he decided to come into church longstreet served as a u s marshal from 1881 to 1884 but return of a democratic administration under grover cleveland ended his political career and he went into on a farm near gainesville where he raised turkeys and planted orchards and vineyards on terraced ground

longstreet s children reacted poorly to marriage helen became a devoted wife and avid supporter of his legacy after his death she outlived him by 58 years dying in 1962 after louise s death and after bearing criticism of his war record from other confederates for decades longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled from manassas to appomattox a labor of five years that was published in 1896 piston describes prose as entertaining if occasionally labored in book longstreet praises several civil war officers but frequently disparages others most heavily his postwar detractors jubal early and fitzhugh lee although longstreet expressed personal affection for robert e lee he was at times sharply critical of his strategy quality of book was said to have been diminished by bitterness and a lack of objectivity and it did little if anything to alter views of longstreet s opponents his final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness in 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism and was unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time his weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by january 1903 cancer developed in his right eye and in

few general officers from civil war to live into 20th century legacy historical reputation authors espousing lost cause attacked longstreet s war career for many years after his death modern authors trace that criticism to longstreet s acceptance of defeat and accommodations both with republican party and freed blacks attacks formally began on january 19 1872 anniversary of lee s birth and less than two years after lee died jubal early in a speech at washington college exonerated lee for defeat at gettysburg and falsely accused longstreet of having attacked late on second day and of being responsible for debacle on third following year william n pendleton lee s artillery chief claimed in same venue that longstreet disobeyed an explicit order to attack at sunrise on july 2 both allegations were fabrications however longstreet failed to challenge them publicly until 1875 delay damaged his reputation as lost cause mythology had now taken hold longstreet s former subordinate col john s mosby defended his commander and other former confederates who joined republican party were subjected to similar criticism including gen william mahone and robert w flournoy james w loewen lies my teacher told me p 199 a reconstructed rebel longstreet embraced equal rights for blacks unification of nation and reconstruction after longstreet died his widow helen dortch longstreet privately published lee and longstreet at high tide in his defense and stated that south was seditiously taught to believe that federal victory was wholly fortuitous outcome of culpable disobedience of general longstreet new georgia encyclopedia in 20th century douglas southall freeman kept criticism of longstreet foremost in civil war scholarship in his biography of lee battle was being decided at that very hour in mind of longstreet who at his camp a few miles away was eating his heart away in sullen resentment that lee had rejected his long cherished plan of a strategic offensive and a tactical defensive he called longstreet s performance on july 2 so sluggish that it has often been asked why lee did not arrest him for insubordination or order him before a court martial historian gary w gallagher notes that freeman moderated his views in his later three volume set lee s lieutenants a study in command where he states that longstreet s attitude was wrong but his instinct was correct he should have obeyed orders but order should not have been given clifford dowdey a virginia newspaperman and novelist was noted for his severe criticism of longstreet in 1950s and 1960s in 1974 michael shaara s novel killer angels about battle of gettysburg was published and was based in part on longstreet s memoirs in 1993 book was adapted into a film gettysburg with tom berenger

attack on lee lost cause and virginia revisionists wakelyn p 258 in 1993 wert published a new longstreet biography stating that his subject was finest corps commander in army of northern virginia in fact he was arguably best corps commander in conflict on either side military historian richard l dinardo wrote even longstreet s most virulent critics have conceded that he put together best staff employed by any commander and that his de facto chief of staff lieutenant colonel g moxley sorrel was best staff officer in confederacy noting longstreet s effectively delegating responsibilities for control of battlefield movements to his staff dinardo believed this allowed them to communicate more effectively during battles than staffs of other confederate generals during war richard l dinardo
