letocetum is ancient remains of a roman settlement it was an important military staging post and posting station near junction of watling street roman military road to north wales and icknield or ryknild street now a38 site is now within parish of wall staffordshire england it is owned and run by national trust under name letocetum roman baths site museum site is in guardianship of english heritage as wall roman site romans came to letocetum in 50 ce to establish a fortress during early years of invasion of britain land could not support large numbers of soldiers and letocetum at an important cross roads became a large scale posting station settlement developed with successive bath houses and mansiones built to serve official travellers as well as growing civilian population it is known mainly from detailed excavations in 1912 13 which concentrated on sites of mansio and bath house but there is evidence of a substantial settlement with possible basilica temples and amphitheatre remains visible today are those of stone bath house and mansio built in approximately 130 ce after letocetum ceased to have a military function and became a civilian settlement settlement reached its peak during 2nd and 3rd centuries and at this time occupied 8 1 12 hectares 20 30 acres at end of 3rd century town relocated within high defensive walls astride watling street after romans left early in 5th century settlement went into decline modern village of wall emerged in land once occupied by letocetum name site is mentioned as in antonine itinerary and presumably represented a latinisation of a brittonic place name reconstructed as grey wood cf and modern welsh name possibly represented species of tree prominent at site such as ash and elm ford identifies community as

native settlement occupied site before advent of romans possibly as main trading station on boundary between two british tribes corieltauvi in east midlands whose later tribal centre was at and cornovii to west with their original capital which would later give its name to important roman british city of viroconium at hill fort on wrekin these tribes offered little resistance to roman rule military staging post in about 50 ce a roman vexillatio built a large timber fortress on a hilltop near site of current church at letocetum this housed legio xiv gemina during campaigns of governor aulus didius gallus against brigantes it was a good defensive position but poor farmland surrounding fortress could not support large numbers of soldiers during period this initial fortress was replaced with a smaller one and letocetum then developed into a large scale posting station most of troops moved to fortress at viroconium during early administration of gaius suetonius paulinus in about 58 ce posting station right thumb alt map of roman road network map showing central position of letocetum on roman road network a mansio was built to provide lodging for official couriers travelling on watling street a bath house was also built for travellers and growing civilian population when first mansio and bath house were completed workers were needed to provide wood for bath house look after animals and repair vehicles to be used by official travellers civilian population would have provided many of these services native settlement grew during flavian period onwards to occupy roman burials with 1st and 2nd century pottery were found along watling street in 1927 and more in 1966 in field between mansio site and watling street a round depression in ground may mark site of a roman amphitheatre a large earthenware vessel in likeness of minerva was found near modern church which may therefore be site of a temple of minerva a rectangular crop mark in field to north west of bath house only visible in dry weather may be site of another temple when legion xiv first settled at letocetum they would have used existing trackways a stone surfaced road was needed to allow reliable movement watling street was given a stone surface past letocetum in about 70 ce this date is approximated from two coins found in centre of letocetum beneath first road surfacing there is no evidence to indicate when ryknild street was constructed but from layout it is thought that watling street was built first watling street stretched from letocetum to london in one direction and to wroxeter and chester in other ryknild street wide where it crossed with watling street connected letocetum with cirencester to south west and yorkshire to north east early mansiones and bath houses foundations of last mansio built at site and its associated bath house were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912 13 rooms of both mansio and bath house were emptied and stone foundations were exposed this work left in some lower stratified levels traces of two earlier wooden mansiones hillside had been terraced and first mansio whose construction is dated to 54 60 ce fully occupied one terrace it was of a sleeper beam construction walls were wattle and daub some were plastered and some were painted with simple linear decoration it has been assumed roof was thatch and was consumed when building was destroyed by fire rooms were arranged around a square courtyard approximately due to construction of later buildings known layout of first mansio is very fragmentary date at which first mansio was destroyed is uncertain it was probably near beginning of 2nd century as destruction layers contained flavian trajanic samian ware part of a dating from 70 100 ce and part of a glass bowl which has been dated to 2nd century evidence for layout of second mansio is also very fragmentary it was a courtyard building constructed with posts set vertically in foundation trenches left thumb alt artists impression of letocetum in 2nd century how town may have looked in 2nd walls were plaster and daub and some rooms were painted in vivid colours in courtyard was a large well and deep cut into underlying sandstone second mansio was deliberately dismantled in about 140 150 ce during construction of third mansio well was filled in at this time and contained a samian dated 125 145 ce about same time second hilltop fort was abandoned and town ceased to be a military site one of last military features at letocetum was punic ditch associated with this last small fort ditch was filled before any secondary silt formed and filling contained a trajanic coin dated 98 117 ce and pottery suggesting a hadrianic or early antonine date earliest bath house was discovered during an excavation in 1956 in a construction trench of very first building was a worn coin of vespasian dated 71 ce due to condition of coin it is believed that this building was erected around 100 ce it is thought that this building was built during military period as surviving masonry is of high quality with finely dressed stone and a wall some thick it is thought that second mansio last fort and first bath house all ended approximately at end of military period on site civilian development third mansio and second bath house right thumb alt remains of 3rd mansio remains of 3rd mansio right thumb alt remains of 3rd bath house remains of 3rd bath house letocetum ceased to be used by military after about 130 ce probably leaving town under authority of civitas of cornovii with its capital at viroconium cornoviorum about this time that a new mansio and bath house were built third and best understood mansio was built on a stone base about 130 ce it was at least two storeys high and fronted by a colonnade with a tiled roof probably supported on wooden columns in centre of colonnade a large door formed main entrance to interior of building through entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor central area probably being open to sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden timber posts resting on these foundations around edges of colonnade supported a balcony above entrance hall was flanked on either side by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from central courtyard one on west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak away in central part of building room to east may possibly have been a guardroom on western side of courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto central colonnade at ground level function of these rooms is uncertain but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of mansio largest room in mansio lay in north east corner chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after building was first completed to west of mansio lay public bath house separated from it by a cobbled road between wide from street a paved area led into a colonnade fronting building on east and continuing round north side large doors in centre of eastern colonnade opened into a large covered courtyard this courtyard may have been a basilica a settlement of this size would be expected to have one and this is only candidate on site at far north end of bath complex was stoke room or which contained wood fired furnaces of hypocaust system this underfloor heating system was present in tepidarium caldarium and where floors were supported on pillars of tiles or hot combustion gases from stoke room furnaces circulated under floor between these pillars and were drawn up around sides of building through box tiles embedded in walls to escape finally through vents in barrel vaulted roof late roman defences abandoned mansio and bath house thumb right alt a roman coin a golden coin from time of emperor gratian latest coin found at letocetum was from this period letocetum lost its public buildings near end of 3rd century bath house and mansio were destroyed by fire around this time very solid defences were built which did not include bath house or mansio sites reason bath house and mansio were abandoned can not be determined but reason was probably economic other mansio sites around britain appear to have been abandoned at this time this did not imply an end to posting service at letocetum it may have been a less costly reorganisation late defences were built in about 300 ce astride watling street approximately east of mansio site defences consisted of a stone wall about thick fronted by three ditches and with a contemporary turf rampart to rear area within walls was northern and western sides were identified and sectioned in 1964 and foundations of a wall at south west corner were uncovered on western side a section of wall was found still standing high above shallow foundations but below ploughed soil wall is believed to have been built within period 275 325 ce it is thought that construction of these defences was related to a general uprising of welsh tribes ordovices and silures that occurred at this time revolt was soon quelled but to guard against further disruptions a series of strongholds including letocetum and were established along length of watling street all 4th century archaeological remains have come from within defences and none from outside suggesting that whole population were within defences by 4th century latest coin to be found at letocetum was minted in time of emperor gratian and dated to 381 ce roman administration collapsed at beginning of 5th century and nothing has been found at site that is datable after this time post roman abandonment and later re occupation settlement must have been significant for some time it is listed in 9th century historia brittonum and reno writes wall appearing as cair and undoubtedly correctly ascribed appears rather incongruously among such major towns and military depots as york london chester wroxeter and caerleon but nevertheless must have been a place of important consequence because of its inclusion as a strategic city late defences led to its description as a caer and a british possibly outpost was established there we have no knowledge of period immediately after roman departure as no historical or archaeological evidence is present letocetum lost all importance with development of nearby lichfield in 7th century as seat of a bishop when place again emerged historically it was under a new name wall this name referred to remains of late roman defences parts of which were still standing in early 19th century notes
