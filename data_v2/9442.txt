floyd bennett field is an airfield in marine park neighborhood of southeast brooklyn in new york city along shore of jamaica bay airport originally hosted commercial and general aviation traffic before being used as a naval air station bennett field is currently part of gateway national recreation area s jamaica bay unit and is managed by national park service nps while no longer used as an operational commercial military or general aviation airfield a section is still used as a helicopter base by new york city police department nypd and one runway is reserved for hobbyists flying radio controlled aircraft floyd bennett field was created by connecting barren island and several smaller islands to rest of brooklyn by filling channels between them with sand pumped from bottom of jamaica bay airport was named after floyd bennett a noted aviator who piloted first plane to fly over north pole and had visualized an airport at barren island before dying in 1928 construction on bennett field started same year airport was dedicated on june 26 1930 and officially opened to commercial flights on may 23 1931 despite exceptional quality of its facilities bennett field never received much commercial traffic and it was used instead for general aviation during interwar period dozens of aviation records were set by aviators flying to or from bennett field starting in 1930s united states coast guard and united states navy occupied part of airport with outbreak of world war ii bennett field became part of naval air station new york on june 2 1941 floyd bennett field was a hub for naval activities during world war ii after war airport was used as a naval air reserve station in 1970 navy stopped using bennett field though a reserve center remained until 1983 and coast guard remained through 1998 several plans for use of bennett field were proposed and in 1972 it was ultimately decided to integrate airport into gateway national recreation area floyd bennett field reopened as a park in 1974 many of earliest surviving original structures are included in a historic district listed on national register of historic places being among largest collections and best representatives of commercial aviation architecture from period and due to significant contributions to general aviation and military aviation made there during interwar period bennett field also contains facilities such as a natural area a campground and grasslands history thumb a bell htl 1 taking off near a grumman albatross prototype at floyd bennett field 1948 planning need for an airport floyd bennett field was new york city s first municipal airport built largely in response to growth of commercial aviation after world war i during 1920s air travel in europe was more popular than in united states because although europe had a surplus of airplanes united states already had a national railroad system which reduced need for commercial aircraft while other localities such as atlantic city new jersey and cleveland ohio had municipal airports new york city had a multitude of private airfields and thus did not see need for a municipal airport until late 1920s new york city board of estimate submitted a recommendation for a new york city municipal airport in 1925 but it was denied two years later port authority of new york and new jersey announced a similar recommendation which was largely ignored by this time city urgently needed an airport this was underscored by construction of newark municipal airport in 1928 as well as several transatlantic flights from new york area that were piloted by such figures as charles lindbergh clarence d chamberlin charles a levine most of nation s air traffic around this time was from airmail operations and united states postal service designated newark airport as airmail terminal for new york city area since newark was region s best equipped airport for airmail traffic new york city officials decided that an airport in city itself was necessary because placing airmail terminal in newark represented a missed opportunity to put new york city on aviation map in mid 1927 herbert hoover united states secretary of commerce approved creation of a fact finding committee on suitable airport facilities for new york metropolitan district hoover committee composed of representatives from new york and new jersey identified six general locations in metropolitan area where an airport could be built committee recommended middle village in central queens as first location for an airfield its second choice was an existing airstrip on barren island in southeastern brooklyn another site in eastern part of bay near present day jfk airport was also recommended at time report listed three federal or state fields three commercial fields and seventeen intermediate fields in new york metropolitan area chamberlin was appointed as city s aeronautical engineer to make final decision on airport s location there was much debate over where airport should be located u s representative and future new york city mayor fiorello la guardia himself a former military airman advocated for a commercial airport to be placed in governors island as it was closer to manhattan and located in middle of new york harbor he left open possibility that outer boroughs could also build their own local airports la guardia along with representative william w cohen introduced a motion in 70th united states congress to establish airport on governors island but it was voted down site chosen chamberlin chose barren island as site for new municipal airport an isolated settlement on island had been developed in late 19th century and at its peak had been home to several thousand people a garbage incinerator and a glue factory had been located on island by 1920s barren island s industrial presence had dwindled and only a small percentage of residents remained on island in 1927 a pilot named paul rizzo had opened barren island airport a private airstrip on island chamberlin chose barren island location over middle village for several reasons first city officials had already spent 100 million between 1900 and 1927 toward constructing a seaport in jamaica bay having dredged land for proposed shipping channels chamberlin also favored barren island location because of lack of obstructions nearby as well as presence of jamaica bay which would allow seaplanes to also use airport finally site was city owned while land in middle village was not city officials believed that an airport at barren island would be able to spur development of jamaica bay despite abandonment of seaport proposal however airline companies feared that barren island airport would have low visibility during foggy days a claim chamberlin disputed because he said there was little history of fog in area construction in february 1928 board of estimate unanimously approved chamberlin s suggestion to build airport at barren island allotting a plot on barren island for that purpose project also received an appropriation of 500 000 paid for with taxes one of members of hoover s fact finding committee objected because middle village was located at a higher elevation with less fog while barren island was more frequently foggy during spring and fall however barren island was already flat so an airport located there would be ready for use in less time than an airport built on hills of middle village after plan was approved two airmail companies announced that they would not move their operations from new jersey to barren island because airmail facilities at newark international airport were closer to manhattan than proposed barren island airport was designs for proposed barren island airport were being solicited in 1927 even before city had given its approval of barren island site by january 1928 new york city department of docks had composed its own team to create plans for airport future airport would be able to accommodate both airplanes and seaplanes a jamaica bay channel on airport s east side would provide loading docks and hangars for seaplanes airplane hangars and an administrative building would occupy northwest corner of airport four runways would be built across rest of grass field by fall 1928 department of docks had published a more detailed plan that would theoretically allow barren island airport to get an a1a rating highest rating for an airport awarded by united states department of commerce this new plan called for two perpendicular concrete runways in a t shape with one being long and other being long an administration building fourteen hangars and other maintenance facilities would be constructed on west side of airport parallel to flatbush avenue rest of airport would be a grass field department of docks was in charge of constructing barren island airport first contract for construction was awarded in may 1928 583 000 contract entailed filling in or leveling of soil across a parcel sand from jamaica bay was used to connect islands and raise site to above high tide mark this contract was completed by may 1929 a subsequent contract for 75 000 involved filling in an extra of land and was finished by end of 1929 in order to secure an a1a rating planners built runways twice minimum runway width mandated by department of commerce these runways were designed for planes taking off planners also constructed grass fields with several layers of soil which would allow for smooth plane landings they conducted studies on other infrastructure such as power sewage and water systems to determine what materials should be used to allow airport to get an aaa rating which was same as an a1a rating barren island airport was renamed after aviator floyd bennett in october 1928 floyd s wife cora recalled that they had once toured barren island when floyd said some day cora there will be an airport here bennett and richard e byrd claimed to have been first to travel to north pole by airplane having made flight in may 1926 for which they both received medal of honor they were preparing to fly to south pole in 1927 when bennett placed these plans on hold in order to rescue crew of bremen bennett died of pneumonia in april 1927 during bremen rescue mission and he was subsequently buried with honors at arlington national cemetery many things were named after bennett including aircraft byrd and three others flew to south pole in 1929 and barren island airport thumb left a concrete runway at floyd bennett field after field was completely filled and leveled two concrete runways were built shorter runway was numbered 15 33 while longer runway was numbered 6 24 at time runway 6 24 was longest concrete runway in u s layer of reinforced concrete gravel drainage strips and extra width contributed to airport s aaa rating new airfield s runways built at a time when most airports still had dirt runways and no night landings made airport among most advanced of its day as did its comfortable terminal facilities with numerous amenities as work on runways was ongoing plans for administration building and hangars were being revised number of hangars was reduced from fourteen to eight due to a lack of funds other six hangars were supposed to be built later but it never happened after plans were finalized in late 1929 construction started on administration building and eight hangars materials were shipped by boat to a temporary pier west of flatbush avenue in 1930 work started on administration building administration building was erected on west side of field near flatbush avenue and four hangars each were constructed to north and south of building architect of hangars and administration building is not documented but tony p wrenn a preservation consultant surmises that edward c designed these structures in 1929 builders awarded contracts for hydraulic filling operations a wooden perimeter fence soil placement and seeding and runway widening these contracts were substantially complete by 1930 opening airport dedication occurred on june 26 1930 a crowd of 25 000 attended this aerial demonstration led by charles lindbergh and jimmy doolittle a flotilla of 600 us army air corps aircraft circled field as part of airport dedication admiral byrd mayor walker and his wife and cora bennett were present at event however airport was not finished at that time administration building and parking areas had yet to be completed costs of proposed airport were increasing even as its completion was being delayed a few days after dedication brooklyn daily eagle reported that airport would not be complete until 1932 and would cost 4 5 million floyd bennett field was formally dedicated again on may 23 1931 upon its official completion at time administration building was almost finished and united states navy was to occupy part of airfield dedication was attended by 25 000 people including chamberlain byrd captain john h towers who flew first transatlantic flight f davison assistant united states secretary of army for aviation and colonel charles lindbergh who flew first solo transatlantic flight many of attendees were also there to view largest aircraft demonstration to date in united states history that day 597 aircraft flew over metropolitan area new york times stated that if aircraft demonstration had not been visible around city bennett field s dedication might have attracted more spectators commercial use thumb upright 1 1 alt a u s coast guard curtiss soc 4 seagull at bennett field a u s coast guard curtiss soc 4 seagull at bennett field from may 23 1931 through end of year airport recorded 1 153 commercial aircraft and 605 military craft which made a combined 25 000 landings according to 1932 annual report from department of docks floyd bennett field had become most desirable american field as an ocean hop terminal at least four transatlantic flights had occurred there that year and at least four more flights had been scheduled for 1933 by 1933 floyd bennett field accommodated more flights than newark airport there were 51 828 arrivals and departures at bennett field in 1933 compared to 19 232 at newark same year by number of flights bennett field was second busiest airport in u s that year behind only oakland international airport in california floyd bennett field was never a commercial success due to its distance from rest of new york city through 1934 there were no commercial passenger airlines that made regular scheduled arrivals or departures at bennett field this was partly because bennett field was never able to secure a lucrative stream of airmail traffic which went to newark airport instead according to 1933 annual report newark airport carried 120 000 airline passengers of mail and of express mail as opposed to bennett field s 52 airline passengers 98 bags of mail and of express according to tony wrenn most of passenger aircraft and mail planes that landed at bennett field likely only did so because planes could not land at newark airport in 1937 american airlines became only commercial airline that regularly operated at bennett field and for one specific flight an air shuttle from new york to boston seaplane taxi routes running from bennett field to east 34th street heliport and lower manhattan heliport were established but they failed to attract airlines as a general aviation airfield floyd bennett field attracted record breaking pilots of interwar period because of its superior modern facilities lack of nearby obstacles and convenient location near atlantic ocean see airport hosted dozens of firsts and time records as well as a number of air races in its heyday such as bendix cup civilians were also allowed to take flying lessons at bennett field various improvements were made to airport throughout its entire commercial existence first as a seaplane hangar then by works progress administration wpa and finally by united states navy however bennett field s lack of commercial tenants a byproduct of its isolation from rest of city caused city to begin developing laguardia field in northern queens new airfield was much closer to manhattan commercial aviation activity at bennett field ceased in 1939 when laguardia field now airport was opened navy gained ownership of field in 1941 after leasing space there for several years accessibility thumb left upright 1 0 alt marine parkway gil hodges memorial bridge marine parkway bridge opened in 1937 is located south of bennett field flatbush avenue was widened and straightened to create a more direct route into manhattan in 1937 avenue was extended south to marine parkway gil hodges memorial bridge which in turn connected to rockaways however this had more to do with expansion of marine park and jacob riis park same year a bus route to subway current q35 route to flatbush avenue brooklyn college station was established in order to create a faster connection to manhattan however q35 bus only started making stops at bennett field in 1940 bennett field s usefulness was debilitated by its poor location in outer brooklyn there were no limited access roads between manhattan and airport and only direct route from manhattan to bennett field was flatbush avenue a congested street with local traffic throughout its length this was exacerbated by fact that bus to subway connection did not occur until 1940 belt parkway which was constructed between 1934 and 1940 provided a limited access connection to manhattan for cars however commercial traffic could still only use flatbush avenue since commercial vehicles were banned from parkways in new york airmail terminal proposals during 1930s commercial air traffic at airports nationwide was low because few people could afford plane tickets and airmail made up majority of air traffic in united states officials believed that all aviation activity in new york area should be located at floyd bennett field laguardia pushed for floyd bennett field to replace newark airport in newark new jersey as city s de facto main air terminal including designs and plans to shuttle passengers to and from manhattan in flying boats however newark airport turned out to be adequately equipped to handle commercial traffic in early days of commercial aviation bulk of profits was provided by freight instead of passengers as airmail was a major fraction of air freight at time airports having contracts with united states post office department attracted commercial airlines and post office department had already designated newark airport as new york city s airmail terminal in order to try and compete an expansion of city s pneumatic tube mail system was planned between floyd bennett field and main post office in brooklyn with a branch of system continuing to lower manhattan in one well publicized incident in november 1933 shortly before la guardia assumed new york city mayor s office he refused to get off a plane at newark airport because his ticket said that flight went to new york and mayor elect demanded that plane be flown to bennett field in 1934 officials requested that post office department to compare merits of newark airport and floyd bennett field as they believed that latter was better equipped in letters to postmaster general james farley u s representatives from brooklyn extolled new facilities at bennett field and compared them to inadequate facilities at newark airport however representatives failed to note that postal service had chosen newark airport because it was built first in 1935 la guardia succeeded in convincing post office department to review benefits and drawbacks of floyd bennett field department s review of airport consisted mainly of drawbacks there was no direct highway or train route from bennett field to manhattan but there were such links between newark and manhattan la guardia suggested that new york city subway be extended to bennett field in order to resolve this problem in august 1935 department decided to keep metropolitan area s airline terminal at newark however la guardia persisted in lobbying for floyd bennett field he had new york city police department calculate how long it would take in clear weather to go from penn station to each airport and then back to penn station nypd found that it only took 24 minutes to get to or from newark but that same trip to floyd bennett field took 38 minutes new york times determined that it would take five to ten minutes more to go from midtown manhattan to bennett field than to newark after learning of this evidence la guardia then petitioned to make floyd bennett field a suitable alternative to newark airmail terminal to support his argument la guardia cited several flights that had been diverted to bennett field in december 1935 a meeting was held at post office department headquarters in washington d c concerning floyd bennett field s suitability as an airmail terminal grover whalen chairman of la guardia s committee on airport development argued that city had an inalienable right to appear on maps of united states airspace and that floyd bennett field was ready for use as an alternate airmail terminal in march 1936 farley announced that he had rejected bid to move airmail operations to bennett field because all evidence showed that doing so would cause a decline in traffic and profits ultimately la guardia was never able to convince postal service to move its new york city operations from newark to floyd bennett field because airmail traffic did not move to bennett field neither did most of commercial lines save for american airlines flights to boston instead he decided to allow city to construct laguardia airport in queens new airport was much closer to manhattan and it took advantage of then new queens midtown tunnel moreover federal government created a new airmail contract in which it divided airmail traffic between newark airport and laguardia airport once latter was completed this confirmed that floyd bennett field was denied an airmail contract not in spite of being located in new york city but because it was too far from manhattan military and police activity thumb upright 1 1 one of original hangars after 1930 closure of naval air station rockaway across rockaway inlet a hangar at floyd bennett field was dedicated as naval air reserve base new york within larger civilian facility naval reserve aviation unit started using bennett field in april 1931 when it moved from long island s curtiss field to hangar 1 in floyd bennett field leasing hangar for 1 per year department of docks allowed navy to use airport s other facilities as needed but left navy to pay for any additional expenses on its own unit soon moved to hangar 5 because they required more space starting in 1934 nypd also occupied a hangar for world s first police aviation unit nypd aviation unit occupied hangar 4 in 1935 united states coast guard wrote a letter to city requesting that part of bennett field be set aside for coast guard use in 1936 a square parcel of floyd bennett field along jamaica bay covering an approximately area was leased to coast guard for creation of coast guard air station brooklyn cgas brooklyn in february 1937 graves quinn corporation was hired to create a hangar barracks building garages and other support facilities for new coast guard station 1 million facility opened in june 1938 at time coast guard was only paying 1 per year in rent which was insufficient in light of bennett field s commercial troubles navy expanded in 1937 and again in 1939 see navy wished to further expand its presence in bennett field and in june 1940 government started a third 1 million expansion of naval facilities there it built barracks for 125 naval reserve cadets expanded hangar 2 and took over hangars 3 and 4 navy agreed to rent expanded complex for 8 000 per year effective october 1 however by august 1940 navy was considering purchasing entire airport city valued bennett field at 15 million but was at first uncertain about whether to sell airport city wanted to retain control of airport because nypd base was housed there la guardia also felt that federal government might buy airport for less than assessed price of 15 million because it had already paid for improvements throughout this time world war ii s european theater was growing in intensity in december 1940 while navy and city were in negotiations about proposed sale of bennett field navy pilot eddie august schneider died in a training crash on tarmac together with another pilot whom he was training a security survey conducted in spring 1941 weighed benefits and drawbacks of bennett field benefit was that navy already had a base there but drawback was that it was going to be too hard to manage both military and civilian traffic at same airport solution was to close airport to all civilian uses see soon after survey was conducted city suggested that navy take an 8 year lease on airport while coast guard continued to lease its own hangar improvements thumb mural in progress improvements to bennett field continued even after its second dedication a study from state university of new york lists four phases of construction through 1941 including three phases after airport s opening first additional phase between 1932 and 1933 covers completion of seaplane facilities at bennett field a second phase from 1934 to 1938 covers improvements wpa while a third phase includes additions by united states navy between 1939 and 1941 a vehicle parking area was completed in may 1931 and administration building was opened in october of same year new taxiways and a temporary wire fence were completed in 1932 that year contracts for repairing hangars roofs and grading land were also awarded bennett field did not yet have an a1a rating so city gave a contract to general electric company to install lights along runways lighted directional signs on roofs of three hangars and wind recording equipment a local company sperry gyroscope company was contracted to install two floodlight towers around field an electrical wiring system was built around airport and two accompanying buildings hosting a transformer and sewage pump were built alongside it other maintenance facilities were not added until later a gravel parking area with two entrance driveways as well as a separator fence between parking area and runways was completed in 1932 three taxiways each wide were constructed in order to reduce congestion from planes who were lining up to take off a seaplane base was also constructed as part of first additional phase of construction it had been part of original plans for airport but only a steel bulkhead had been constructed during initial construction phase seaplane ramps had been built on east side of airport contract for a seaplane base with four hangars was awarded in 1930 and completed in october 1931 city had finished building a by seaplane ramp by august 1931 it was accompanied by a by seaplane pier and three anchorage buoys three seaplane runways were built as well as a turning basin spurred by expansion of air travel across united states department of docks began planning extensive upgrades to bennett field in 1934 plans coincided with authorization of wpa which provided labor needed to carry out these upgrades in 1935 wpa allocated 1 5 million to finish airport federal government ultimately contributed 4 7 million toward bennett field s expansion while city spent only slightly more than 339 000 wpa constructed two extra runways expanded hangars and airport aprons erected extra maintenance buildings added a passenger tunnel under administration building and placed utility wires and pipes underground wpa also planted a landscaped lawn in front of administration building work involved demolition of a brick chimney at south end of barren island which lay in way of one of new runways there were plans to add four more hangars and two more ramps to existing seaplane base but they were not acted upon due to low passenger traffic volumes expanded seaplane base was also in path of runway 12 30 which was added as part of wpa renovations because base was not going to be expanded coast guard started using unfinished seaplane base for their own purposes coast guard added a new hangar a taxiway and three radio towers navy which already occupied part of bennett field unveiled plans to expand its facilities there in 1938 next year timeline was moved up due to world war ii in europe in 1939 navy started constructing a base for 24 seaplanes at floyd bennett field in preparation for expanding its neutrality patrol activities during world war ii after its 1939 expansion navy occupied hangars 1 and 2 new building a in between hangars 1 and 2 and half of field s dope shop in january 1940 congress approved navy s request to take over ownership of in bennett field so it could construct a new base like coast guard navy would lease land for 1 per year but if navy stopped using their facilities at bennett field navy base s ownership would revert to new york city government naval air station new york thumb left upright 1 1 coast guard station as seen acquisition changes to navy s expansion plan were announced on may 25 1941 as part of plan all private airlines were ordered to leave and all remaining residents on barren island would be evicted to make way for a larger facility on may 26 1941 airport was closed to all commercial and general aviation uses a week later on june 2 navy opened naval air station new york nas new york with an air show that attracted 30 000 to 50 000 attendees audience included navy undersecretary james admiral harold r stark rear admiral chester w nimitz rear admiral john h towers new york city mayor la guardia and brooklyn borough president john cashmore by fall 1941 navy decided that bennett field was best place to put its air station in new york after attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 navy sought to acquire property as well as surrounding land as soon as possible artemus gates assistant secretary of navy for air wrote a letter to la guardia stating that navy was willing to take over control of bennett field for a price of 9 750 000 this offer was substantially less than la guardia s asking price of 15 million and it took into account valuation of wpa improvements and existing military facilities on february 9 1942 navy submitted a declaration of taking that would allow it to acquire most of desired land for 9 25 million nine days later on february 18 rest of bennett field became part of nas new york most prior leases were terminated but coast guard was allowed to stay if its operations did not conflict with navy s this meant that nypd aviation unit at floyd bennett field was forced to relocate for duration of war expanded naval base totaled over this consisted of of existing airfield combined that belonged to coast guard and navy and combined that belonged to remaining barren island residents navy had also wanted to buy on west side of flatbush avenue which was reserved for a future expansion of marine park however new york city parks department commissioner robert moses prevented purchase from happening some of money from transaction was to go toward improving marine park world war ii thumb upright 1 3 aerial view of nas new york in mid 1940s showing original airfield dark colored ground and new additions light colored ground navy awarded first contract for upgrades to floyd bennett field on december 17 1941 navy s design division developed most of expansion plans instead of contracting them out it graded undeveloped land to 16 feet to make it level with rest of airport demolition of future barracks site on western side of field started in spring 1941 because newer craft necessitated longer runways a new runway 6 24 was built on northern side of field and three existing runways were expanded so that all four runways measured long by wide navy built a seaplane hangar and two seaplane runways as well as extended taxiways and roads it also constructed facilities for officers on bennett field s eastern side such as barracks training rooms dining rooms and auditoriums navy also filled in northeastern section of former barren island a new entrance for navy was created at south end of bennett field and a one story annex on north side of administration building was added a dirigible landing station and two front line simulator facilities were installed within field significant effort was spent toward developing part of base that faced jamaica bay where a recreation area was installed all remnants of barren island s former community and landscape were obliterated upgrades allowed 6 500 people to use naval base most of new structures were designed to be removable because of possibility that bennett field might become a civilian airfield again after war in accordance with military conventions all buildings at bennett field were given numbers during war nas new york hosted several naval aviation units of u s atlantic fleet including three land based antisubmarine patrol squadrons a scout observation service unit and two naval air transport service nats squadrons processing majority of aircraft destined for pacific theater nas new york served as a training facility as well as a base where navy boats could load supplies and officers nas new york aircraft also patrolled atlantic coastline and engaged german u boats in addition navy waves women accepted for volunteer emergency service took up several positions including those of air traffic controllers parachute riggers and aviation machinist s mates military air transport service opened an east coast terminal at bennett field in december 1943 more than 20 000 new aircraft were delivered to nas new york during war and more than 46 000 aircraft movements were recorded from december 1943 to november 1945 cgas brooklyn worked in conjunction with nas new york patrolling new york harbor as well as testing equipment training soldiers and delivering supplies starting in 1944 cgas brooklyn tested navy craft and trained pilots korean to vietnam wars in 1946 after conclusion of world war ii many naval stations were decommissioned or downgraded as part of these cutbacks floyd bennett field became a naval air reserve station at time it was largest naval air reserve base in u s navy demolished many of temporary structures including barracks as well as outdated sperry floodlights navy renovated recreation field on southern side of bennett field nypd aviation unit resumed its operations at naval air reserve base by 1947 there were proposals to use bennett field for commercial purposes again airport would have handled excess traffic from laguardia airport while laguardia was being repaired and idlewild now jfk airport was being built in april 1947 city and port authority of new york and new jersey made a preliminary agreement that allowed port authority to take over operations of all airports in new york city by june port authority hoped to spend 1 5 million to improve facilities for airlines with foreign registrations however partial conversion of bennett field commercial use was delayed over concerns of cost navy estimated that it would cost 1 2 million to move its facilities but port authority would not spend more than 750 000 for navy to do this navy mostly operated on southern and eastern parts of airport during this time by september 1947 port authority and navy were deadlocked unable to reach an agreement commercial traffic at floyd bennett field ultimately never materialized as airspace congestion near laguardia airport was resolved navy allowed new york air national guard and u s army air reserve to use hangars on condition that their activities did not interfere with navy s coast guard regained control of cgas brooklyn and it also began leasing nearly of navy base adjoining cgas brooklyn s southern border by 1950 cold war and korean war preparations were underway and navy needed to use bennett field s facilities again however bennett field was less busy during korean war than during world war ii five reserve squadrons based at bennett field were recalled to active duty for korean war some minor modifications were made during this time navy lengthened three runways reconstructed roads and taxiways built a beacon tower and veterans housing and added some fuel storage containers a new southern entrance was built because one of runway extensions overlapped with old entrance navy abandoned many of original buildings on western side of field instead moving to eastern side coast guard made even fewer modifications it expanded its apron built a small hangar and replaced its wooden seaplane ramp with a concrete one throughout remainder of postwar period and until early 1970s nas new york floyd bennett field primarily functioned as a support base for units of naval air reserve and marine air reserve airport was also a training facility for reserve squadrons until 1970 more than 3 000 reservists in navy and marines trained at bennett field every weekend and 34 aircraft squadrons were constantly being maintained at field field was busiest during weekends when there were up to 300 daily departures from bennett field installation also served as a base for units of new york air national guard from 1947 to 1970 when air national guard moved to francis s gabreski air national guard base on long island minor adjustments were made to field through 1960s in order to accommodate jet aircraft navy also built a trailer park and a school building in main barracks area during this time decommissioning in aftermath of vietnam war in 1960s military was greatly demobilized by 1970 navy was offloading property including bennett field to pay for war s expenses on march 5 1970 federal government announced that navy would start vacating airport upon announcement of bennett field s decommissioning mayor john v lindsay asked federal government for permission to convert field into a commercial airport simultaneously governor nelson rockefeller proposed a 1 4 billion development on site if built rockefeller s development would contain a shopping mall an industrial park 46 100 housing units and potential for 180 000 residents governor s proposal had been in planning since november 1969 on april 4 1970 navy conducted its last daily formal inspections of officers an act that started process of decommissioning floyd bennett field nas new york s tenant squadrons and personnel were transferred to other naval air stations a naval air reserve detachment which supported non flying units remained navy itself continued to own land for two more years naval air reserve detachment would occupy hangar a until 1983 meanwhile dispute over possible future uses of bennett field continued in may 1970 state government released more details of its redevelopment proposal without consulting city next month lindsay s administration wrote to federal government advocating for bennett field to be converted to commercial use u s president richard nixon supported a third proposal turning entirety of floyd bennett field into a national park this had been suggested by regional plan association rpa previous year except that rpa had advocated for a national seashore in may president started process of getting congressional approval for this move state government objected since neighboring marine park was not used in meantime bennett field was only sparsely used by coast guard and nypd helicopters national park service ownership creation

runways for flying radio controlled aircraft land sailing and cycling end of runway 19 contains an area where visitors can fly model airplanes as per international civil aviation organization standards runways were numbered based on their alignment value on each end was how many tens of degrees off that runway was from facing magnetic north counting in clockwise direction and rounding to nearest whole number for example a plane landing on runway 19 would be facing slightly magnetic southwest since it would be 190 degrees clockwise from magnetic north while a plane landing on one of two runways 6 would be facing magnetic northeast since it would be 60 degrees clockwise from magnetic north two original runways are wide runway 15 33 was lengthened to in 1936 it runs parallel to
