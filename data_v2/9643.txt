executive producers on austin powers soundtrack and chose beautiful stranger as first single alt guy oseary in a coat smiling madonna and canadian actor mike myers had previously collaborated for an episode of saturday night live in 1991 when singer hosted show and invited myers character wayne campbell to play a game of truth or dare while pitching her documentary madonna truth or dare according to gwen ihnat from a v club creative partnership between them works because madonna though serious always seems game and myers though frequently goofy is also creatively inventive in 1999 singer was chosen to contribute a single on soundtrack for myers second film about spy character austin powers titled austin powers spy who shagged me soundtrack to spy who shagged me led to teaming up of two music executives warner bros records senior vice president danny bramson and madonna s maverick records co owner guy oseary both of them served as executive producer on soundtrack by may 1999 expectations were already high for release so producers decided to include madonna s track along with a song from a number of other high profile artists like r e m lenny kravitz and mel b from spice girls as recalled by oseary there was intense competition among artists to have their songs placed in soundtrack with one manager connected to project describing fight for first potential single release as a blood bath main intention of producers was to have artists contribute music which would abide by predominant 1960s mood of film ultimately it was decided that beautiful stranger was suitable for this and was chosen as first single from soundtrack however madonna s recording company warner bros decided not to release any cd single or remix singles to accompany release in united states only promo 12 discs were sent to dance club djs song was only released to chr top 40 radio for airplay on may 19 1999 beautiful stranger has appeared on two separate madonna greatest hits

basic sequence of e b f a c before moving to main chord progression of c7 beautiful stranger is a psychedelic pop song and begins with a musical instrumentation reminiscent of light my fire 1967 by doors and lucy in sky with diamonds 1967 by beatles song s main structure is backed by guitar while drums come in during choruses around 1 06 mark there is a hint of mellotron and flute being played like beatles 1967 songs strawberry fields forever or fool on hill song has similar composition to madonna s endeavors with her previous album ray of light mixed with psychedelic music usa todays ken barnes has suggested that chorus riff instrumentation and structure of beautiful stranger were based on american rock band love s 1966 single she comes in colors band s record company rhino records executive gary stewart stated that certainly riff and instrumentation of beautiful stranger are reminiscent of she comes in colors and that da da da da da chorus on track seems to be based upon an instrumental flourish that s an integral part of love record it may be a conscious or an unconscious homage madonna denied any such influence claiming that she had never heard of love according to michael paoletta from billboard no fierce ruling club dj in 1999 would have dared play original jangly rock etched version of song hence song was remixed by victor calderone who kept basic structure of song while mixing it with tribal infused beats unlike many of his then releases where he removed bulk of song s lyrics for remixing with beautiful stranger he kept them paoletta described remixes as if calderone fully understands importance of a song and understands how best to unite deft beats and a dazzling vocal performance remixes include a rock leaning version as well as calderone s club and radio mixes critical reception beautiful stranger received generally positive reviews chuck taylor from billboard denoted song as a new shift in wind for madonna calling it another creative high for her he also complimented production saying that this latest partnership with orbit taps into a walloping romp of guitars and enough cascading organs to prompt an urge to listen to your monkees collection taylor ended review with positive feedback for madonna s vocals likening them to those for evita album along with commending chorus in a different article for billboard talking about song s remixes paoletta described track as effervescent blast of psychedelic electronica writing for philippine daily inquirer gino dela paz found it cute but forgettable gwen ihnat from entertainment website a v club labeled it as madonna s best song that never appeared on one of her regular albums a psychedelic pop confection that offered a few of her most indelible hooks ihnat also wrote that although less ethereal than 1998 s ray of light beautiful stranger is just as dance floor ready dance flute has never sounded so enticing and madonna s voice so sweetly seductive allmusic s jose f promis listed track as one of singer s more memorable moments coupling 1960s go go rock with 1990s electronica resulting in nothing less than a true slice of old fashioned rock roll promis also praised two calderone mixes slant magazines sal cinquemani gave song a rating of b and wrote like any good throwaway track beautiful stranger doesn t pretend to be much more than it is whiny guitars and flutes abound madonna and orbit concocted a perfect theme song for friend mike myers s cooky austin powers spy who shagged me playful wispy and ultimately forgettable in august 2018 paul schrodt from same magazine placed it at number 53 on his raking of singer s singles calling it antithesis of ray of light hooky psychedelic track is more accessible than madonna s previous work with orbit innocuous lyrics could ve been ghostwritten for anyone but song endears due to madge s playful delivery and orbit s sonic details ken tucker from entertainment weekly declared it as song of summer and praised it for being a piece of psychedelic pop at once so 60s and so 90s that to sully it with a joke would be an insult way madonna has of making her voice merge into indistinguishability with surging instrumentation in chorus way she sings title phrase with an ache in her voice that s at once urgent and playful matthew jacobs from huffington post ranked song 22 on their list of definitive
