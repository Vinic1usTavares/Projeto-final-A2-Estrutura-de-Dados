thumb 250px dunfermline abbey from a 17th century engraving robert henryson author of morall fabillis was associated with place fox wolf and husbandman is a poem by 15th century scottish poet robert henryson and part of his collection of moral fables known as morall fabillis of phrygian it is written in middle scots as with other tales in collection appended to it is a moralitas which elaborates on moral that fable is supposed to contain however appropriateness of moralitas for tale itself has been questioned tale combines two motifs firstly a husbandman tilling fields with his new oxen makes a rash oath aloud to give them to wolf when wolf overhears this he attempts to make sure that man fulfills his promise fox mediates a solution by speaking to them individually eventually he fools wolf into following him to claim his supposed reward for dropping case and tricks him into a draw well moralitas connects wolf to wicked man fox to devil and husbandman to godly man a probable source for tale is petrus alfonsi s disciplina clericalis containing same motifs and william caxton s aesop s fables though tale is a beast fable not aesopic sources thumb left william caxton pictured centre right whose translation of aesop s fables was a probable source for tale a probable source of tale is petrus alfonsi s disciplina clericalis which has same three motifs rash promise of husbandman wolf mistaking moon for cheese and wolf that descends into well via a bucket thereby trapping himself and freeing fox farber 2000 p 89 however discussion of legality and questioning of language that take place alongside these motifs are entirely henryson s invention whereas moral of alfonsi s tale explains that wolf lost both oxen and cheese because he relinquished what was present for what was to come latin pro futuro quod erat henryson s moralitas more fully involves husbandman farber 2000 p 90 another source may be aesop s fables as published by william caxton scholar john macqueen considers this more likely than disciplina clericalis although tale itself is not aesopic but rather of beast fable also beast epic genre macqueen 2006 p 175 plots of such works are more complicated than their aesopic counterpart tend more towards and feature fox making a victim of wolf macqueen 2006 p 176 synopsis tale a husbandman tilling fields with his new untrained oxen is made furious by their wrecking of land in his anger he makes rash oath that wolf mot have you all at anis may at once however wolf is lying nearby with fox and overhearing it promises to make him stay true to his word eventually oxen calm down but on way back home wolf jumps into their path wolf asks where husbandman is driving them since they are not his to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended wolf before wolf reminds husbandman of his earlier declaration to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything they argue and husbandman reproaches wolf for not having a witness in response he produces fox creature takes it upon himself to mediate dispute and takes each aside in turn to husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him were it not for grit and expence of doing so husbandman offers him half a dozen of fattest hens he has to which fox and goes off to wolf he says that husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping case wolf after some complaint agrees to this and two proceed through woods after prize all while fox considers how to trick wolf eventually as wolf complains of of their quest they arrive at a draw well with buckets on each end of a rope seeing reflection of moon in water at bottom of well wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers fox down to pick it up when he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone wolf jumps into other bucket and descends to help however this pulls up other bucket into which fox has jumped and so two swap places wolf at bottom of well and fox safely escaped narrator professes that he does not know who helped wolf out of well but that tale is at an end moralitas wolf is likened to a wicked man who oppresses others fox is likened to devil farmer is likened to godly man with whom fiend finds fault woods where wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get cheese represents covetousness well that contains it is fraud and fantasy which draws men downwards into hell analysis as with other tales in collection moralitas of fox wolf and husbandman can be considered at odds with tale itself lianne farber highlights a number of these discrepancies and says that allegory does not hold true in any traditional sense amongst inconsistencies is that fox not wolf is figure that argues with and finds fault in husbandman woods of world are not traversed by husbandman in spite of moralitas suggesting it is applicable to all men farber argues that even assuming moral to be true is problematic since it apparently suggests that godly man must bribe figure of judge and that this does not affect his godly status furthermore absence of legal discussion and binding quality of words from moralitas suggests to farber that intricate legal framework has no impact whatsoever in resolving issues with which it is supposed to deal in contrast philippa m bright considers that moralitas of this tale as well as several others create an additional sense which co exists with literal narrative and extends and complements it thematically treating literal details symbolically and establishing sense through direct comparisons bright 1990 pp 150 51 according to dorothy yamamoto significant themes in tale are solidity and vacancy substance and illusion yamamoto 2000 p 70 cheese that apparently resides in well is only an illusion not a solid object and similarly fox creates a surface reconciliation between wolf and husbandman but which betrays his real intentions macqueen 2006 p 176 through their frequent misuse words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning as an example yamamoto highlights fox s on which wolf and husbandman make their pledge which body part she says is used by fox in other tales to blind his foes and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use notes references modern edition secondary sources further reading
