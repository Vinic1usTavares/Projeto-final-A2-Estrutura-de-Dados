thumb right thunderstorm image showing cumulus inflow bands inflow is flow of a fluid into a large collection of that fluid within meteorology inflow normally refers to influx of warmth and moisture from air within earth s atmosphere into storm systems extratropical cyclones are fed by inflow focused along their cold front and warm fronts tropical cyclones require a large inflow of warmth and moisture from warm oceans in order to develop significantly mainly within lowest of atmosphere once flow of warm and moist air is cut off from thunderstorms and their associated tornadoes normally by thunderstorm s own rain cooled outflow boundary storms begin to dissipate rear inflow jets behind squall lines act to erode broad rain shield behind squall line and accelerate its forward motion thunderstorms thumb airflow in and around a supercell with inflow at base on right inflow into a thunderstorm or complex of thunderstorms is circulation of warm and humid air ahead of a trigger convergence zone such as a cold front this airmass is uplifted by trigger and form convective clouds later cool air carried to ground by thunderstorm downdraft cuts off inflow of thunderstorm destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation tornadoes which form within stronger thunderstorms grow until they reach their mature stage this is when rear flank downdraft of thunderstorm fed by rain cooled air begins to wrap around tornado cutting off inflow of warm air which previously fed tornado inflow can originate from mid levels of atmosphere too when thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops to south of mid level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex this leads to an erosion of rain within broad rain shield behind squall line and may lead to acceleration of squall line itself tropical cyclones thumb structure of a tropical cyclone with inflow in red while an initial warm core system such as an organized thunderstorm complex is necessary for formation of a tropical cyclone a large flux of energy is needed to lower atmospheric pressure more than a few millibars 0 10 inch of mercury inflow of warmth and moisture from underlying ocean surface is critical for tropical cyclone strengthening a significant amount of inflow in cyclone is in lowest of atmosphere extratropical cyclones thumb right a weather map of an extratropical cyclone affecting great britain and ireland l symbol denotes center of low and occluded cold and warm frontal boundaries are depicted polar front theory is attributed to jacob bjerknes and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in norway during world war i this theory proposed that main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence one ahead or east of low and another trailing equatorward south in northern hemisphere and north in southern hemisphere and behind or west of low convergence line ahead of low became known as either steering line or warm front trailing convergence zone was referred to as squall line or cold front areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones a conveyor belt also referred to as warm conveyor belt is a term describing flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within warm sector or generally equatorward of an extratropical cyclone in advance of cold front which slopes up above and poleward north in northern hemisphere and south in southern hemisphere of surface warm front concept of conveyor belt originated in 1969 left edge of conveyor belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from west forcing a sharp slope to cold front an area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of warm front along conveyor belt active precipitation poleward of warm front implies potential for greater development of cyclone a portion of this conveyor belt turns to right left in southern hemisphere aligning with upper level westerly flow however western portion of this belt wraps around northwest southwest in southern hemisphere side of cyclone which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation if air mass is cold enough precipitation falls in form of heavy snow theory from 1980s talked about presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of warm front and flowing along a clockwise path in northern hemisphere into main belt of westerlies aloft but there has been conflicting evidence as to whether or not this phenomenon actually exists see also outflow meteorology references category meteorological phenomena category severe weather and convection category synoptic meteorology and weather
