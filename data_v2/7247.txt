states that various apparently incorrect versions of norcross gift have been published archibald murray in 1862 made reference to alleged sum of ps500 given to colonel macdonnell and reported investigations made by a fellow researcher who could find no proof of this bequest murray concluded that reports arose from a misrepresentation of original annuity murray pp 72 3 in his history of
