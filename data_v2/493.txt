his children toby gerty bertha and victoria before enactment of natives land act 1913 black south africans had freehold rights and they bought properties in suburb distance from city centre was seen as disadvantageous and after city of johannesburg built a sewage plant nearby area seemed even less attractive because of these and other reasons most of whites had moved out by 1920 leaving behind a vibrant multi racial community by late 1940s sophiatown had a population of nearly 54 000 black africans 3 000 1 500 indians and 686 chinese forced removals as neighbouring white working class areas such as and newlands developed adjacent to sophiatown perception arose that suburb was too close to white suburbia from 1944 onwards johannesburg city council planned to move black population out of western areas including sophiatown after election victory of national party in 1948 relocation plans were debated at level of national politics under immorality amendment act no 21 of 1950 people of

unlike other townships in south africa was a freehold township which meant that it was one of rare places in south african urban areas where blacks were allowed to own land this was land that never belonged to johannesburg municipality and so it never developed form of municipal matchbox houses built row upon row with same uniformity and lack of character houses were built according to people s ability to pay tastes and cultural background some houses were built of brick and had four or more rooms some were much smaller others were built like homes in rural areas others still were single room shacks put together with corrugated iron and scrap sheet metal majority of families living in sophiatown were tenants and sub tenants eight or nine people lived in a single room and houses hid backyards full of shanties built of cardboard and flattened kerosene cans since many black property owners in sophiatown were poor in order to pay back mortgages on their properties they had to take in paying tenants sophiatown residents had a determination to construct a respectable lifestyle in shadow of a state that was actively hostile to such ambitions a respectable lifestyle rested on three pillars of religious devotion reverence for formal education and a desire for law and order people struggled to survive together and a rich culture based on shebeens informal and mostly illegal pubs mbaqanga music and beer brewing developed shebeens were one of main forms of entertainment people came to shebeens not only for or illegally self made alcoholic beverages but to talk about their daily worries their political ideas and their fears and hopes in these shebeens politicians tried to influence others and get them to conform to their form of thinking if one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer these two conflicting images of sophiatown stand side by side romantic vision of a unique community juxtaposed with a seedy and violent township with

award in 2008 crime and gangsterism crime and violence were a reality of urban life and culture in sophiatown poverty misery violence and lawlessness of city led to growth of many gangs sections of society frowned on gangsterism as anti social behaviour and gangsters like and don mattera were despised by many as anti social after second world war there was a large increase in number of gangs in sophiatown part of reason for this was that there were about 20 000 african teenagers in city who were not at school and did not have jobs township youths were unable to find jobs easily employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience and many of them were not able to read or write they also considered them to be undisciplined and weak in johannesburg in 1950s crime was a day to day reality and sophiatown was nucleus of all reef crimes gangsters were city bred and spoke a mixture of afrikaans and english known as some of more well known gangs in sophiatown were russians americans gestapo berliners and vultures names gestapo and berliners reflect their admiration for hitler whom they saw as some kind of hero for taking on whites of europe best known gang from this period and also best studied was russians they were a group of basotho migrant workers who banded together in absence of any effective law enforcement by either mine owners or state primary goal of this gang was to protect members from and from other gangs of migrant workers and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable most notably women jobs and urban space necessary for parties and staged fights that formed bulk of their weekend entertainment one of more successful community campaigns emerged in early 1950s when informal policing initiatives known as civic guards were mobilized to combat rising crime this attempt to restore law and order attracted widespread support prior to a series of bloody clashes with migrant criminal society from poorer enclave of newclare this provided state with an excuse to ban guard groups which they eyed with suspicion because of their anc and communist party connections these supposed arbiters of law and order engaged in a series of brutal street battles with members of russians gang in early 1950s representation of gangsters in literature drum magazine went through very different stages during 1950s and early 1960s first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens rural identity of tribal blacks second is almost a complete turn around from first as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors who are able to achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks final period is an extended period of nostalgia for shebeen culture that
