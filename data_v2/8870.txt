in a coma he was diagnosed with a fractured skull a shard of bone had also punctured his skull initially coverage of assault in bernas was slow murder had occurred too late in evening to be covered in 14 august edition and head editor due to press censorship was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case however other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage and front page of 15 august edition showed udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about case on 16 august udin died without having regained consciousness on morning of his death a breathing tube had been inserted after his death udin s body was autopsied then brought to bernas office for a quick memorial service in which staff sang bunga fallen flowers following day udin was buried in a small

after assault under command of sergeant major edy wuryanto police began by collecting udin s notes and blood from his family family had received several bags of blood from bethesda and were planning to bury it with body meanwhile five members of indonesian journalists association indonesia or pwi formed a fact finding team on 14 august under leadership of putut and sutan team read articles written by udin in previous six months looking for any coverage which could have led to attack they concluded that most of his articles could have been a trigger committee eventually focused on bribery allegations against sudarmo as those were only ones exclusively covered in bernas as well as a case of election rigging another team from bernas known as white kijang team for type of car they drove investigated case independently when pwi team failed to share information they had gathered udin s death swiftly became a national cause celebre with circumstances of his death and resulting investigation covered extensively in national media muslim prayer services held by bernas seven days after udin s death attracted hundreds of mourners and saw several community leaders give speeches on politics and udin s death others such as goenawan mohamad wrote poems and flowery obituaries though police ruled out udin s political reporting as a motive in early stages of investigation many reports focused on theory that his killing had been related to his reporting on sudarmo one journalist quoted regent as having said shortly before murder that he would like to teach udin a lesson police focused instead on allegations of infidelity in late august police stated that udin had been murdered by a jealous husband as a result of an extramarital affair with a woman named tri sumaryani a citizens band radio enthusiast who had once dated udin s younger brother however sumaryani soon admitted to press that she had been paid to fabricate this testimony by a nephew of sri roso meanwhile pwi and bernas teams concluded that udin had been murdered by a government official intent on saving face by late september bernas was under political pressure to cease coverage of case one of pwi team members putut reported that his daughter had been nearly kidnapped and his home broken into several journalistic and human rights organisations stated their belief that murder was likely connected with udin s reporting including amnesty international which expressed its concern that allegations about involvement of government officials had not been properly investigated committee to protect journalists sent a letter to president suharto that demanded a full investigation into udin s death with results made public an independent report by indonesian alliance of independent journalists praised courage and neutrality of udin s reporting stating he was not an ngo activist nor was he involved in student movement he was just an ordinary journalist who did an average job for a regional newspaper however regent denied these reports and rumours in a press conference on 23 august 1996 he said that he was at receiving end of over dramatization arrest of dwi sumaji on 21

sumaji obtained independent counsel through whom he attempted to withdraw confession marsiyem who had seen her husband s attackers insisted that sumaji was innocent on 23 october bernas published a sketch of udin s attacker drawn soon after murder based on marsiyem s description with a picture of sumaji under sumaji s photograph they wrote rejected drawing attention to dissimilarities between two sumaji withdrew his confession then alleged that police had encouraged him to confess after plying him with alcohol and bribing him with money a prostitute and a better job if he confessed to crime sunarti incredulous that her husband could be a murderer wrote letters to several high ranking officials and bodies including president suharto only one to national commission on human rights

witnesses to corroborate sumaji s account including prostitute police continued investigation under pressure to finish quickly two reconstructions of murder were conducted drawing hundreds of spectators one was done with sumaji playing role of murderer without his lawyers knowledge when counsel found out they removed him from reconstruction eventually police agreed to a deal with counsel in which sumaji s pre trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest sumaji was released on 17 december awaiting trial in early 1997 sumaji s case was refused by prosecutor s office several times due to weak evidence mishandling charges on 7 november udin s family announced their intention to sue city for improper use of evidence this announcement followed a report from police chief that udin s blood had been disposed of in southern sea off parangtritis beach as an offering to nyai roro kidul area s deity to ensure quick resolution
