black throated loon gavia arctica also known as arctic loon and black throated diver is a migratory aquatic bird found in northern hemisphere primarily breeding in freshwater lakes in northern europe and asia it winters along sheltered ice free coasts of north east atlantic ocean and eastern and western pacific ocean this loon was first described by carl linnaeus in 1758 it has two subspecies it was previously considered to be same species as pacific loon of which it is traditionally considered to be a sister species although this is debated in a study that used mitochondrial and nuclear intron dna black throated loon was found to be sister to a clade consisting of pacific loon and two sister species common loon and yellow billed loon black throated loon measures about in length and can weigh anywhere from in breeding plumage adult of nominate subspecies has mostly black upperparts with exception of some of and which have white squares head and hindneck are grey and sides white and striped black most of throat is also black giving this bird name black throated loon colour of throat patch can be used to distinguish two subspecies throat patch of other subspecies g a viridigularis is green underparts are mostly white including bottom of throat flanks are also white a feature which can be used to separate this bird from pacific loon when it is not breeding black patch on throat is absent replaced with white most of black lines on throat are also missing except those on bottom sides and upperparts are unpatterned with exception of a few white spots on juvenile is similar to non breeding adult except more brown overall timing of breeding season is variable in southern part of its range this loon starts breeding in april whereas in northern portion it waits until after spring thaw it builds an oval shaped nest that measures about across either near breeding lake or on vegetation emerging from it black throated loon usually lays a clutch of two rarely one or three brown green eggs with dark splotches after an incubation period of 27to 29days chick hatches and is fed a diet of small fish and invertebrates this contrasts with mostly fish diet of adult to catch this food it forages by itself or in pairs very rarely foraging in groups it dives from water going no deeper than most dives are successful whether or not at least one chick will hatch from a nest is variable ranging from 30 to 90 most failures come from predators and flooding overall population of this loon is declining although international union for conservation of nature iucn still rates it as least concern because population decline is not rapid enough black throated loon is protected under both migratory bird treaty act of 1918 and agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds taxonomy and etymology black throated loon gavia arctica was originally described by carl linnaeus as colymbus arcticus in his 18th century work systema naturae it was moved to genus gavia by american ornithologists union aou in 1897 genus name gavia comes from latin for sea mew as used by ancient roman naturalist pliny elder specific arctica is latin for northern or arctic name of subspecies viridigularis stems from latin viridis meaning green and latin gularis meaning throated in reference to green throat of this subspecies common name black throated loon stems from its black throat patch this loon is also called arctic loon and black throated diver there are two subspecies gavia arctica arctica linnaeus 1758 this subspecies is found in northern europe east to center of northern asia and from that to lena river and transbaikal it migrates to coasts of northwestern europe and coasts of mediterranean black and caspian seas g a viridigularis dwight 1918 this subspecies is found in eastern russia from lena river and transbaikal east to peninsulas of and kamchatka and northern portion of sakhalin it migrates to northwestern pacific coasts g a viridigularis was considered to be a separate species when described by jonathan dwight in 1918 but a year after in 1919 arthur cleveland bent suggested that former species be moved to its current placement as a subspecies black throated loon was previously considered conspecific with north american pacific loon which was its subspecies but they have now been split into two species there was no evidence of two interbreeding in areas where they occurred together furthermore architecture of air sacs in lungs of two species are significantly different this split was done by aou in 1985 phylogeny of this species is debated black throated loon and pacific loon traditionally being considered sister species whereas a study using mitochondrial and nuclear intron dna supported placing black throated loon sister to a clade consisting of pacific loon and two sister species that are common loon and yellow billed loon this latter study is criticized on basis that it may form a phylogeny on incomplete lineage sorting in former phylogeny split between pacific loon and black throated loon is proposed to have happened about 6 5 million years ago description adult black throated loon is in length with a wingspan and a weight of nominate subspecies in its has a grey head and hindneck with a black throat and a large black patch on foreneck both of which have a soft purple gloss lower throat has a necklace shaped patch of short parallel white lines sides of throat have about five long parallel white lines that start at side of patch on lower throat and run down to chest which also has a pattern of parallel white and black lines rest of including centre of chest are pure white upperparts are blackish down to base of wing where there are a few rows of high contrast white squares that cover and there are small white spots on both lesser and median coverts rest of is a blackish colour is paler than upperwing and underwing coverts are white tail is blackish bill and legs are black with a pale grey colour on inner half of legs toes and webs are grey latter also being flesh coloured irides are a deep brown red sexes are alike and subspecies viridigularis is very similar to nominate except that former has a green throat patch instead of black subspecies viridigularis does still retain a purplish gloss although it is less than nominate thumb right breeding top and non breeding bottom black throated loons non breeding adult differs from breeding adult in that cap and back of neck are more brownish non breeding adult also lacks patterned upperparts of breeding adult although some of upperwing coverts do not lose their white spots this results in upperparts being an almost unpatterned black from above sides of throat are usually darker at white border separating sides of throat and front of throat most of time a thin dark necklace between these two areas can be seen there is white on sides of head that are below eye bill is a steel grey with similar to breeding adult a blackish tip thumb left non breeding adult juvenile is similar to non breeding adult but has a browner appearance it has a buffy scaling on upperparts that is especially pronounced on scapulars lower face and front of neck has a diffused brownish tinge juvenile does not have white spots on wing coverts and its irides are darker and more dull in colour chick hatches with down feathers that range in colour from sooty brown to brownish grey usually with a slightly paler head abdomen is pale black throated loon can be distinguished from pacific loon by white on flanks of former vocalizations male when breeding vocalizes a loud and rhythmic cu cloooee cu cloooee cu whistling song a aaah oo wail can also be heard and a growling or croaking knarr a sound given especially at night alarm call at nest is a rising distribution and habitat black throated loon has a large range breeding taking place across northern europe asia and seward peninsula in alaska when breeding it is found in area around isolated deep freshwater lakes larger than especially those with inlets as it prefers to face only small stretches of open water when it is not breeding this loon moves in a general southward direction and towards ice free sea usually wintering in coasts on north east atlantic ocean and those on eastern and western pacific ocean such as coasts of japan during this time its habitat is usually inshore waters along sheltered coasts although it will sometimes be found inland in places such as mediterranean and black seas behaviour thumb a black throated loon taking off like other loons this bird takes off by pattering on a runway of water while flying it makes a barking flight call breeding this species usually nests on ground within about of lake it breeds at this loon also sometimes nests on vegetation like fulva that have emerged from lakes nest site is often reused next year nest itself is oval shaped and built mostly by female out of heaped plant material like leaves and sticks nest measures about across families of black throated loons often move their nest site from original nest ponds they inhabited to wetlands nearby after chicks reach two weeks of age journey is generally less than in southern portion of its range this loon starts to breed in april whereas in northern parts of its range it waits until spring thaw when there is adequate water for it to take off in it usually arrives before lake thaws in latter case before copulation female hunches its neck and swims close to shore until it finds a suitable place and then lies down on shore male sometimes adopts same posture as female during this time only vocalization made is a one note hum during copulation male coming ashore mounts female and occasionally flaps its wings loudly after this male returns to water and itself female stays ashore for a maximum of about 23 minutes and usually starts to build nest thumb eggs collection museum wiesbaden germany black throated loon lays a clutch of two very rarely one or three eggs that are brown green with darker speckles these eggs are incubated by both parents for a period of 27to 29days with female spending most time out of sexes incubating during incubation this bird turns its eggs interval between when they are turned is very irregular ranging from one minute to about six hours after they hatch mobile young are fed by both parents for a period of weeks chicks fledge about after hatching and achieve sexual maturity after two to three years nesting success whether or not at least one chick will hatch from any given nest is variable year to year rate of success ranging from just under 30 to just more than 90 for clutches of two eggs average nesting success is about 50 whereas in clutches with only one egg this rate is about 60 nesting success is influenced most by first predation and second flooding some of adults that lose their clutch early in incubation period renest most of time only one chick survives to fledge other dying within seven days of hatching in scotland a study concluded that a single pair usually fledges a chick on average 25 of time per year this can be increased although by artificial means such as constructing rafts for loons to nest on whether or not there is at least one chick fledged is influenced by density of fish in breeding lake a lake with a higher density of fish usually reduces chance that a pair will fledge a chick even though this loon feeds mainly on fish there are two factors that might contribute to this first being that aquatic insects an alternative food source for chicks are more dense when there are less fish and second being that a higher density of fish means more northern pike a predator of small chicks feeding a top predator in pelagic zone of some subarctic lakes this bird feeds on fish and sometimes insects molluscs crustaceans and plant matter black throated loon usually forages by itself or in pairs rarely feeding in groups with multiple species it dives from water at depths of no more than just before diving this loon stretches and holds up its neck until it is erect and at full length it usually jumps slightly upwards before diving these dives are frequent with an average of about 1 6 dives per minute most dives about 80 of them are successful and those that are successful are usually shorter than those that are unsuccessful with an average of 17 seconds for each successful dive and 27 seconds for each unsuccessful dive these dives usually only result in small items and those that yield larger pieces of food are usually more than 40 seconds where this bird catches quick swimming fish thumb left a video of a black throated loon foraging when it is breeding adult usually feeds away from nest foraging either at opposite end of breeding or at lakes near breeding lake when foraging for newly hatched chicks adult forages in lake where nest is or in nearby lakes returning after a prey item has been caught when chicks are older they usually accompany both of parents swimming a few metres behind them strategy that predominates immediately after hatching is generally still employed when chicks are older but at a reduced rate chicks are fed only one item of prey at a time young are also able to capture food themselves at least 36 days after hatching although they are still fed daily up until about 70 days of age thumb an adult black throated loon with its chick diet of black throated loon chicks varies prey in breeding lake being a major factor for first eight days chicks are usually fed three spined sticklebacks and common minnows if they are found in breeding lake if they are not present then chicks are brought up mainly on small invertebrates until about eight days when they are able to take trout of about in length although in these chicks trout makes up majority of their diet they are still fed invertebrates in large numbers in all lakes salmonids make up an important part of chicks diet after eight days salmonids especially those between are important in diets of older chicks eels are also an important food for older chicks predators and parasites black throated loon is sometimes parasitized by tubifex a species of nematode that can cause mammalian predators such as red foxes and pine martens are likely cause of about 40 of clutch losses avian predators such as hooded crows also take eggs of this loon status conservation despite fact that its population is declining black throated loon is listed as a species of least concern by iucn this is because species has a large population and an extremely large range and its decline does not appear to be rapid in north america it is protected under migratory bird treaty act of 1918 while in europe and africa it is protected under agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds threats acidification and heavy metal pollution of breeding lake possibly threatens this bird it is also vulnerable to oil pollution especially when near fishing grounds fishing nets are also a cause of mortality this loon is sensitive to windfarms near coast overall annual mortality rate of adult black throated loon is 10 references
