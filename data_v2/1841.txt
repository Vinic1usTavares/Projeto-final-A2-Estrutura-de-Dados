thumb t1000 unit at mortensrud thumb two mx3000 units at majorstuen rolling stock of oslo metro norway has consisted of three classes t1000 t1300 t2000 and mx3000 t1000 was built as 162 single cars from 1964 to 1978 from 1979 to 1985 33 new t1300 trains were built followed by conversion of 16 t1000s six two car t2000 units were delivered in 1994 since 2005 first 83 three car mx3000 units have been replacing older stock and last t1000 was retired in 2007 from 2010 only mx3000 trains are in use t1000 t1300 and t2000 were built by strommens vaerksted with motors from norsk elektrisk brown boveri nebb and aeg respectively and mx3000 were built by siemens all trains receive 750 v dc from a third rail shoe while t1300 and t2000 also have pantographs this allows latter to also operate on suburban lines of oslo tramway which western part of current metro was part of until 1995 all trains feature automatic train protection and step free access from platforms trains can operate up to six cars in length t1000 t1300 and mx3000 are capable of while t2000 can operate at t2000 introduced articulated cars while mx3000 introduced regenerative brakes and air conditioning t1000 t1300 and mx3000 can be run in multiple with each other but not with t2000 mx3000 replaced red color scheme with a white livery history in 1954 oslo city council decided to build a four line metro to new suburbs to east of city center plans called for system to open in 1966 with conversion of ostensjo line and lambertseter line of oslo tramway and new furuset line and grorud line system would feature higher and longer platforms allowing step free access to six car trains automatic train protection and third rail power supply this would make metro incompatible with existing tramways in oslo aspenberg 1994 29 first units in t1000 series were two single car prototypes designated t they were test run on existing tramways from 1959 to 1960 and were then put into service on kolsas line prone to technical faults they were taken out of regular service in 1982 aspenberg 1994 62 63 thumb left t1300 unit near valler serial production of t1000 started in 1964 by strommens vaerksted nebb and aeg until 1978 162 cars were delivered to oslo sporveier these were manufactured in four series designated t1 through t4 with minor changes to specifications during late 1970s western suburban lines which were part of tramway needed new rolling stock oslo sporveier was at time considering connecting metro with these lines and between 1978 and 1981 33 new t1300 cars were built only difference from t1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on tramways they also retained necessary technical appliances to run on metro new t1300 were designated t5 and t6 from 1985 to 1989 16 were rebuilt to t1300 and designated t7 and t8 oslo sporveier was highly satisfied with sl79 articulated trams that had been delivered during 1980s in 1985 work started on development of a modified version for western suburban lines stock on holmenkollen and kolsas lines were first that needed to be replaced at same time company wanted to make trains compatible with metro so they could operate on both systems new stock was considered to be a trial if it met performance expectations future orders could be made to replace t1000 stock after latter reached end of its economical life in about 2000 required specification for new train was published in october 1988 in late 1980s it was decided to upgrade roa and sognsvann lines to metro standard this would allow them to use t1000 stock twelve t2000 were ordered in 1991 and would be sufficient to operate services on holmenkollen and kolsas lines that would retain an overhead wire development costs for t2000 were in part subsidized by government as high tech product from strommens verksted by then part of abb group and aeg was seen as a future export product trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995 same year metro started operating all services through city center connecting western and eastern networks aspenberg 1995 46 thumb left t2000 unit at holmenkollen in 1996 work to establish a financing package for new investments in public transport in akershus and oslo started oslo package 2 was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance among other things new trains for metro initial order by oslo sporveier in 2003 from siemens was for 33 units 99 cars plus options for further orders in 2005 city council voted to replace all existing t1000 and t1300 stock with mx3000 increasing quantity by another 30 units two test units were delivered in october 2005 with first serial deliveries in april 2007 with delivery of new white and gray trains oslo sporveier received criticism that they had been disloyal to old red color of metro and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from 1960s through 1980s following 2006 decision to convert kolsas line to metro standard akershus county municipality announced they would order five units in november 2006 city government proposed that maintenance of new trains be privatized this resulted in protests from employees who campaigned by refusing to work overtime as a result after a few weeks company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service issue was solved when socialist opposition parties along with liberal party agreed to postpone matter until after all new trains were delivered in 2009 as part of agreement a new limited company oslo vognselskap wholly owned by kollektivtransportproduksjon would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by operating companies responsibility for debt accumulated for buying trains is to be managed by oslo vognselskap while operation and management of maintenance contracts was transferred to oslo t banedrift in 2008 city council in oslo decided to upgrade holmenkollen line to metro

unit at roa oslo metro uses 750 volt direct current fed to train via a third rail along a standard gauge track system is not compatible to oslo tramway but t1300 and t2000 have been built to run on both suburban lines of tramway and metro platforms are long and height of train floors are above track allowing step free access to platforms trains speed are controlled by an automatic train protection atp system speed codes are transferred from atp points in infrastructure using 75 hertz pulses in tracks trains pick up signals via antennas speed codes are and they are communicated to engineer via signals in driver s cab in addition system will automatically reduce speed should limit be exceeded driver can put trains in an automatic mode where train itself adjusts its speed to limit driver is always responsible for starting and halting train at stations t1000 thumb t1300 unit at holmenkollen t1000 were built by strommens vaerksted and is long wide and high each car is

doors on each side of each car measuring wide and high in service units either run single with three cars or two units in multiple with six cars each car is equipped with four three phase asynchronous motors giving each three car unit a power output of mx3000 introduced a number of technical innovations to metro regenerative brakes allow dynamic brakes to feed braking energy back to power system via third rail passengers also have air conditioning driver s cabs are more ergonomic than in older models and mirrors to monitor platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens trains livery is white with gray detailing instead of former models red with blue detailing for use in areas without a third rail such as at depots trains are equipped with a 110 v battery this will remove need for shunting at depots and cut costs references bibliography
