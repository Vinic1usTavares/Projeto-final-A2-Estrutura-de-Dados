structural history of roman military concerns major transformations in organization and constitution of ancient rome s armed forces most effective and long lived military institution known to history encyclopaedia britannica eleventh edition 1911 roman army from its origins around 800 bc to its final dissolution in ad 476 with demise of western roman empire rome s military organization underwent substantial structural change at highest level of structure forces were split into roman army and roman navy although these two branches were less distinct than in many modern national defense forces within top levels of both army and navy structural changes occurred as a result of both positive military reform and organic structural evolution these changes can be divided into four distinct phases phase i army was derived from obligatory annual military service levied on citizenry as part of their duty to state during this period roman army would wage seasonal campaigns against largely local adversaries phase ii as extent of territories falling under roman control expanded and size of forces increased soldiery gradually became salaried professionals as a consequence military service at lower non salaried levels became progressively longer term roman military units of period were largely homogeneous and highly regulated army consisted of units of citizen infantry known as legions latin legiones as well as non legionary allied troops known as auxilia latter were most commonly called upon to provide light infantry logistical or cavalry support phase iii at height of roman empire s power forces were tasked with manning and securing borders of vast provinces which had been brought under roman control serious strategic threats were less common in this period and emphasis was placed on preserving gained territory army underwent changes in response to these new needs and became more dependent on fixed garrisons than on march camps and continuous field operations phase iv as rome began to struggle to keep control over its sprawling territories military service continued to be salaried and professional for rome s regular troops however trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded to such an extent that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of armed forces at same time uniformity of structure found in rome s earlier military disappeared soldiery of era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry in regiments of varying size and quality this was accompanied by a trend in late empire of an increasing predominance of cavalry rather than infantry troops as well as a requirement for more mobile operations in this period there was more focus on all frontiers but east on smaller units of independently operating troops engaging less in set piece battles and more in low intensity guerilla actions tribal forces c 752 bc c 578 bc according to historians livy and dionysius of halicarnassus writing at a far later date earliest roman army existed in 8th century bc during this period rome itself was probably little more than a fortified hilltop settlement and its army a relatively small force whose activities were limited mainly to raiding and cattle rustling with occasional skirmish like battle goldsworthy in name of rome p 18 historian theodor mommsen referred to it as rome s curiate army named for its presumed subdivision along boundaries of rome s three founding tribes latin curiae and mommsen history of rome volume 1 p 40 this army s exact structure is not known but it is probable that it loosely resembled a warrior band or group of bodyguards led by a chieftain or king keppie making of roman army p 14 mommsen believes that roman military organization of this period was regimented by laws of apocryphal king v italus mommsen history of rome volume 1 p 22 but these laws though referred to by aristotle have been lost army latin legio consisted according to livy of exactly 3 000 infantry and 300 horsemen one third from each of rome s three founding tribes grant history of rome p 22 boak a history of rome to 565 ad p 69 warriors served under six leaders of division latin who in turn served under a general usually in person of reigning king mommsen uses philological arguments and references from livy and others to suggest that greater mass of foot soldiers probably consisted of javelin throwers with a smaller number possibly serving as archers mommsen history of rome volume 1 p 20 cavalry was far smaller in number and probably consisted solely of town s richest citizens boak a history of rome to 565 ad p 69 army may also have contained earliest form of chariots boak a history of rome to 565 ad p 86 hinted at by references to wheelers

polybius for example was writing some 300 years after events in question and livy some 500 years later additionally what records were kept by romans at this time were later destroyed when city was sacked sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable as they can be for later military history e g from first punic war onwards according to our surviving narratives three kings of rome during etruscan occupation were tarquinius priscus servius tullius and tarquinius superbus during this period army underwent a reformation into a army based on socio economic class livy rise of rome book 1 chapter 42 this reformation is traditionally attributed to servius tullius second of etruscan kings tullius had earlier carried out first roman census of all citizens livy rise of rome book 1 chapter 43 livy tells us that tullius reformed army by transplanting onto it structure derived originally for civil life as a result of this census at all levels military service was at this time considered to be a civic responsibility and a way of advancing one s status within society smith service in post marian roman army p 10 however rome s social classes were qualified rather than created by census it is perhaps more accurate to say therefore that army s structure was slightly refined during this period rather than radically reformed prior to these reforms infantry was divided into classis of rich citizens and infra of poorer citizens latter were excluded from regular line of battle on basis that their equipment was of poor quality during reforms this crude division of poorer and richer citizens was further stratified army thereafter consisted of a number of troop types based upon social class of propertied citizens collectively known as adsidui from poorest in fifth class to richest in first class and equestrians above them military service was compulsory for all gabba republican rome army and allies p 2 however roman citizens at this time generally viewed military service as a proper undertaking of duty to state in contrast to later views of military service as an unwelcome and unpleasant burden grant history of rome p 334 boak a history of rome p 454 whereas there are accounts of romans in late empire mutilating their own bodies in order to exempt themselves from military service campbell crisis of empire p 126 boak a history of rome p 454 there seems to have been no such reluctance to serve in military of early rome this may in part be due to generally lower intensity of conflict in this era to fact that men were fighting close to and often in protection of their own homes or due to as posited by later roman writers a greater martial spirit in antiquity vogt decline of rome p 158 equestrians highest social class of all served in mounted units known as equites first class of richest citizens served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears resembling hoplites and provided first line of battle formation second class were armed similarly to first class but without a breastplate for protection and with an oblong rather than a round shield second class stood immediately behind first class when army was drawn up in battle formation third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting spear and javelins third class stood behind second class in battle formation normally providing javelin support poorest of propertied men of city comprised fifth class they were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones they were deployed in a screen in front of main army covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres men without property who were thereby excluded from qualifying social classes of adsidui were exempted from military service on grounds that they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever however in most pressing circumstances even these proletarii were pressed into service gabba republican rome army and allies p 5 though their military worth was probably questionable troops in all of these classes would fight together on battlefield with exception of most senior troops who were expected to guard city army is said to have increased from 3 000 to 4 000 men in 5th century bc and then again from 4 000 to 6 000 men sometime before 400 bc this later army of 6 000 men were then divided into 60 centuries

it is more likely that changes were product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform grant history of rome faber and faber 1979 p 54 manipular formation was probably copied from rome s samnite enemies to south perhaps as a result of roman defeats in second samnite war sekunda early roman armies p 40 during this period a military formation of around 5 000 men was known as a legion latin legio however in contrast to later legionary formations of exclusively heavy infantry legions of early and middle republic consisted of both light and heavy infantry term manipular legion a legion based on units called maniples is therefore used to contrast later legion of empire that was based around a system of cohort units manipular legion was based partially upon social class and partially upon age and military experience boak a history of rome to 565 a d p 87 it therefore represents a theoretical compromise between earlier class based army and class free armies of later years in practice even slaves were at one time pressed into army of republic out of necessity santosuosso storming heavens p 10 normally a single legion was raised each year but in 366 bc two legions were raised in a single year for first time maniples were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class maniples were small enough to permit tactical movement of individual infantry units on battlefield within framework of greater army maniples were typically deployed into three discrete lines latin triplex based on three heavy infantry types of hastati principes and triarii santosuosso storming heavens p 18 first type hastati typically formed first rank in battle formation they typically wore a brass chest plate though some could afford mail a helmet called a galea and occasionally greaves shin guards they carried an iron bossed wooden shield 120 cm 4 ft tall and rectangular in shape with a curved front to partially protect sides traditionally they were armed with a sword known as a gladius and two throwing spears known as pila one heavy pilum of popular imagination and one a slender javelin polybius history book 6 however exact introduction of gladius and replacement of spear with sword as primary weapon of roman legions is uncertain and it s possible that early manipular legions still fought with hastati and principes wielding hasta or spear romans habitually enroll four legions each year each consisting of about four thousand foot and two hundred horse and when any unusual necessity arises they raise number of foot to five thousand and of horse to three hundred of allies number in each legion is same as that of citizens but of horse three times as great polybius histories 1 268 70 second type principes typically formed second rank of soldiers back from front of a battle line they were heavy infantry soldiers armed and armoured as per hastati triarii who typically formed third rank when army was arrayed for battle were last remnant of hoplite style troops in roman army they were armed and armoured as per principes with exception that they carried a pike rather than two pila a 600 man triarii maniple was divided into two formations each six men across by 10 men deep from maniple to cohort strategy page a manipular legion typically contained between 1 200 2400 hastati 1 200 2400 principes and 600 1200 triarii luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 40 three classes of unit may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within roman society but at least officially three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class young unproven men would serve as hastati older men with some military experience as principes and veteran troops of advanced age and experience as triarii heavy infantry of maniples were supported by a number of light infantry latin velites and cavalry latin equites troops typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion cavalry was drawn primarily from richest class of equestrians but additional cavalry and light infantry were drawn at times from socii and latini of italian mainland equites were still drawn from wealthier classes in roman society there was an additional class of troops latin accensi also and later who followed army without specific martial roles and were deployed to rear of triarii their role in accompanying army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in maniples but they also seem to have acted occasionally as orderlies to officers light infantry of 1 200 velites consisted of unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from youngest and lower social classes they were armed with a sword and shield 90 cm 3 ft diameter as well as several light javelins each with a 90 cm 3 ft wooden shaft diameter of a finger with a c 25 cm 10 in narrow metal point their numbers were swollen by addition of allied light infantry and irregular rorarii roman levy of 403 bc was first to be requested to campaign for longer than a single season livy rise of rome book 5 ch 1 and from this point on such a practice became gradually more common if still not typical a small navy had operated at a fairly low level after second samnite war but it was massively upgraded during this period expanding from a few primarily river and coastal based patrol craft to a full maritime unit after a period of frenetic construction navy to a size of more than 400 ships on carthaginian pattern once completed it could accommodate up to 100 000 sailors and embarked troops for battle navy thereafter declined in size this was partially because a pacified roman mediterranean called for little naval policing and partially because romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by greek cities whose peoples had greater maritime experience webster roman imperial army p 156 of infantry 217 bc 107 bc extraordinary demands of punic wars in addition to a shortage of manpower exposed tactical weaknesses of manipular legion at least in short term smith service in post marian roman army p 2 in 217 bc rome was forced to effectively ignore its long standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service around 213 bc property requirement was reduced from 11 000 to 4 000 asses since romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies it must be assumed that at this point proletarii of poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification by 123 bc financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4 000 asses to just 1 500 asses gabba republican rome army and allies p 7 by this time therefore it is clear that many of property less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into adsidui during 2nd century bc roman territory saw an overall decline in population gabba republican rome army and allies p 9 partially due to huge losses incurred during various wars this was accompanied by severe social stresses and greater collapse of middle classes into lower classes of census and proletarii as a result both roman society and its military became increasingly roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at expense of state since many of soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name and were too poor to afford their own equipment distinction between heavy infantry types of hastati principes and triarii began to blur perhaps because state was now assuming responsibility of providing standard issue equipment to all but first class of troops who alone were able to afford their own equipment by time of polybius triarii or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass but hastati and principes had become indistinguishable in addition shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies socii for provision of allied troops santosuosso storming heavens p 11 where accepted allies could not provide required force types romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside legions webster roman imperial army p 143 marian legion 107 bc 27 bc thumb 205px right bust of marius instigator of marian reforms in a process known as marian reforms roman consul gaius marius carried out a

was created legionary infantry formed a homogeneous force of heavy infantry these legionaries were drawn from citizen stock by this time roman or latin citizenship had been regionally expanded over much of ancient italy and cisalpine gaul luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 27 lighter citizen infantry such as velites and equites were replaced by non citizen auxilia that could consist of foreign mercenaries santosuosso storming heavens p 16 due to concentration of citizen legions into a force of heavy infantry rome s armies depended on auxiliary cavalry attachments for support as a tactical necessity legions were almost always accompanied by an equal or greater number of lighter auxiliary troops tacitus annals iv 5 which were drawn from non citizens of empire s territories one known exception of legions being formed from non citizen provinces during this period was legion that was raised in province of galatia after marius legions were drawn largely from volunteer citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 16 volunteers came forward and were accepted not from citizens of city of rome itself but from surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under roman control santosuosso storming heavens p 29 whereas some long term military professionals were classed as veterans they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns santosuosso storming heavens p 51 legions of late republic remained unlike legions of later empire predominantly roman in origin although some small number of ex auxiliary troops were probably incorporated smith service in post marian roman army p 56 army s higher level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from roman aristocracy unlike earlier in republic legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land instead they received standard pay and were employed by state on a fixed term basis as a consequence military duty began to appeal most to poorest sections of society to whom a guaranteed salary was attractive gabba republican rome army and allies p 25 army therefore consisted of a far higher proportion of poor particularly rural poor than it had previously boak a history of rome p 189 a destabilising consequence of this development was that proletariat acquired a stronger and more elevated position within state this professionalisation of military was necessary to provide permanent garrisons for newly acquired and distant territories such as hispania something not possible under an army of seasonal citizen militia historian r e smith notes that there was a need to raise additional legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats he argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion smith service in post marian roman army p 29 long standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army quickly formed new legions in contrast consisted of younger men perhaps with little or no military experience who hoped for adventure and plunder however no distinction in basic pay discipline or armour is known of between two types of legion practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes legions of late republic were structurally almost entirely heavy infantry legion s main sub unit was called a cohort and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 14 cohort was therefore a much larger unit than earlier maniple sub unit and was divided into six centuriae of 80 men each each centuria was separated further into 10 tent groups latin contubernia of 8 men each legions additionally consisted of a small body typically 120 men of roman legionary cavalry latin equites legionis equites were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry webster roman imperial army p 116 legions also contained a dedicated artillery crew of perhaps 60 men who would operate devices such as ballistae each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied non roman auxiliae troops luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 15 addition of allied troops to roman army was a formalisation of earlier arrangement of using light troops from socii and latini who had received roman citizenship after social war smith service in post marian roman army p 27 auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae or a flexible mixture of two known as cohors equitata cavalry types included mounted archers latin sagittarii and heavy shock cavalry latin or clibanarii infantry could be armed with bows slings throwing spears long swords or thrusting spears auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs and in this period their internal organisation was left to their commanders webster roman imperial army p 146 however most obvious deficiency of roman army remained its shortage of cavalry especially heavy cavalry luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 43 even auxiliary troops were predominantly infantry luttwak argues that auxiliary forces largely consisted of cretan archers balearic slingers and numidian infantry all of whom fought on foot luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 44 as rome s borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry based to largely cavalry based troops infantry based roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage particularly in east after having declined in size following subjugation of mediterranean roman navy underwent short term upgrading and revitalisation in late republic to meet several new demands under caesar an invasion fleet was assembled in english channel to allow invasion of britain under pompey a large fleet was raised in mediterranean sea to clear sea of cilician pirates during civil war that followed as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from greek cities non citizen recruitment 49 bc 27 bc by time of julius caesar in 54 bc regular legionary units were supplemented by a body of scouts and spies who infiltrated enemy camps santosuosso storming heavens p 67 due to demands of civil war extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non citizens was taken by caesar in transalpine gaul latin gallia transalpina by brutus in macedonia and by pompey in pharsalus smith service in post marian roman army p 57 this irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not however typical of recruitment during this period and roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from roman citizens only imperial legions and reformation of auxilia 27 bc 117 ad by turn of millennium emperor augustus primary military concern was to prevent roman generals from further usurping imperial throne smith service in post marian roman army p 71 experience of caesar and earlier marius and sulla had

emergency armies by increasing size of standing armies to a size sufficient to provide territorial defence on their own boak a history of rome to 565 a d p 270 smith service in post marian roman army p 71 perhaps due to similar concerns legions and auxiliaries of army were supplemented under emperor augustus by an elite formation of guards dedicated to protection of emperor first such unit was

of legions remained much same their make up gradually changed whereas early republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible roman citizens imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower likewise whereas republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in italy early imperial legions drew most of their recruits from roman

provincial population of around two million mattingly an imperial possession britain in roman empire pp 166 8 at same time as legions underwent these transformations auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions rather than being raised re actively when required process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets webster roman imperial army p 144 whereas internal organisation of auxilia had previously been left up to their commanders in early empire they were organised into standardised units known as for cavalry alae and centuriae for infantry cohortes although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as legions webster roman imperial army p 152 and often retaining some national flavour size of units at least was standardised to some degree cavalry were formed into either an ala quingenaria of 512 horsemen or an ala millaria of 1 000 horsemen likewise infantry auxilia could be formed into a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1 000 men mixed cavalry infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen and cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen vitality of empire at this point was such that use of native auxilia in roman army did not apparently military as some scholars claim was to happen in late empire webster roman imperial army p 150 on contrary those serving in auxilia during this period frequently strove to themselves they were granted roman citizenship on retirement granting them several social advantages and their sons became eligible for service in legions webster roman imperial army p 147 as with army many non italians were recruited into roman navy partly because romans had never readily taken to sea it appears that navy was considered to be slightly less

natural mercenaries latin vivi ad arma nati tacitus history 4 64 it seems that discipline in legions did slacken with soldiers granted permission to live with wives outside of military lodgings and permitted to adopt a more lavish and comfortable lifestyle in contrast to strict military regimen of earlier years however it is by no means certain that this led to any reduction in effectiveness of legions due to greater ferocity and stature of barbari recruits flavour of roman military however was now dictated by increasing number of regional recruits leading to a partial barbarisation of rome

greater numbers of non citizen troops into military was taken a further step by creation under hadrian of a new type of force in addition to legions and auxilia known as numeri formed in bodies of

auxiliary troops with a pronounced national character luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 122 including native dress and native war cries introduction of numeri was a response to need for cheap troops who were nevertheless fierce and provided a force balance of light infantry and cavalry luttwak grand strategy of roman empire p 123 they were therefore largely less well armed and less well trained than auxilia or legions although more prestigious elite irregular native troops were also utilised alfoldi crisis of empire p 216 however legions still made up around one half of roman army at

additionally emperor gallienus took revolutionary step of forming an entirely cavalry field army which was kept as a mobile reserve at city of milan in northern italy it is believed that gallienus facilitated this concentration of cavalry by stripping legions of their integral mounted element southern and dixon late roman army pp 11 12 a diverse range of cavalry regiments existed including catafractarii or clibanarii and legionary cavalry known as collectively these regiments were known as equites around 275 ad proportion of catafractarii was also increased there is some disagreement over exactly when relative proportion of cavalry increased whether gallienus reforms occurred contemporaneously with an increased reliance on cavalry or whether these are two distinct events alfoldi appears to believe that gallienus reforms were contemporaneous with an increase in cavalry numbers he argues that by 258 gallienus had made cavalry predominant troop type in roman army in place of heavy infantry which dominated earlier armies according to warren treadgold however proportion of cavalry did not change between early 3rd and early 4th centuries treadgold byzantium and its army 284
