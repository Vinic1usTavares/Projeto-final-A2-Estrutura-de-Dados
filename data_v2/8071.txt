a three quarter or sidearm motion koufax threw with a pronounced over top arm action this may have increased his velocity but reduced lateral movement on his pitches especially movement away from left

beginning of his career koufax worked with coaches to eliminate his tendency to tip pitches i e reveal which pitch was coming due to variations in his wind up late in his career and especially as his
