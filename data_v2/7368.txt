arrives at similarities oratorio is similar especially to part vi of christmas oratorio which also begins with an extended opening chorus and a chorale fantasia as a conclusion 1 festive opening chorus is believed to be based on a movement from lost secular cantata movement has no fugue but dance like elements and lombard rhythm 2 bach marks first recitative of bible narration nach dem ersten chor recitative after first chorus it is sung by evangelist which bach assigns to tenor singing secco recitative action begins lord jesus lifted up his hands with jesus blessing disciples and leaving them 3 thumb traverso by boaz berney after an original by thomas lot paris ca 1740 a reflecting recitative for bass ah jesus is your departure shows situation of disciples afraid that jesus will leave

parallel to bass recitative in part i it is also accompanied by flutes and continuo 9 evangelist ends narration they however prayed to him telling of disciples return from mountain which is named mount of olives 10 soprano aria jesus your merciful gaze is also based on wedding cantata it is one of rare pieces in bach s music without basso continuo with two unison flutes oboe and unison strings playing a trio augmented to a quartet by singer original words in wedding cantata mentioned innocence brian robins notes lightly translucent texture reflecting text s allusion to christ leaving his body to ascend to heaven jones thinks that setting without an earthly continuo represents glances of grace of text 11 closing chorale when shall it happen is seventh stanza of written in 1697 by gottfried wilhelm sacer set in first person it expresses desire of speaker for liebe zeit dear time when he sees saviour in his glory continuing saying wir we he imagines to greet him and kiss him it is set as a chorale fantasia soprano sings in long notes on melody of von gott will ich nicht lassen similar to final chorale of christmas oratorio chorale tune in a church mode appears in triumphant context of a different major key text expresses longing for day of being united with jesus in heaven musicologist julian mincham interprets mode of tune as human state of waiting and hoping while concerto represents fulfillment mincham compares writing to opening chorale fantasias of second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas finding composition for lower voices endlessly inventive frequently related to textual images pointing out passionate and clinging representation of kissing saviour beneath caressing flutes in penultimate phrase recordings sortable listing is taken from selection
