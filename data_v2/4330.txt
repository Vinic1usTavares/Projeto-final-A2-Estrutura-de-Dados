tanque argentino mediano tam english argentine medium tank is a medium tank in service with argentine army lacking experience and resources to design a tank argentine ministry of defense contracted german company thyssen henschel vehicle was developed by a german and argentine team of engineers and was based on german marder infantry fighting vehicle tam met argentine army s requirement for a modern lightweight and fast tank with a low silhouette and sufficient firepower to defeat contemporary armored threats development began in 1974 and resulted in construction of three prototypes by early 1977 and full scale production by 1979 assembly took place at local tamse plant founded for purpose by argentine government economic difficulties halted production in 1983 but manufacturing began anew in 1994 until army s order of 200 tanks was fulfilled right thumb argentine tam vca 155 palmaria thumb right a tam vctp may 2008 tam series includes seven different variants such as a self propelled howitzer and a self propelled mortar vehicle in total over 280 such vehicles were built including armored personnel carriers artillery and mortar pieces tam and vctp infantry fighting vehicles based on tam chassis were manufactured for peruvian army only to be integrated into argentine army when peru canceled contract tam also competed for other export orders but tam was ultimately not exported tam has never seen combat although 17 vctps were deployed to croatia for united nations unprofor peacekeeping mission development during 1960s argentina sought to replace its aging fleet of tanks which included british sherman v firefly tanks and american m3a1 half tracks dating from shortly after second world war in their attempts to procure equipment from united states argentina could only secure 50 m41 walker bulldogs undelivered and 250 m113 armored personnel carriers when united states turned down requests for further equipment argentine government turned to other side of atlantic putting their plan europa plan europe into action it was hoped that european technology could stimulate argentine industry so country could produce its own armaments in future argentina procured 80 amx 13 light tanks as well as 180 amx vcis and 24 amx 155 from french government manufacturing around 40 amx 13s and 60 amx vcis at home french amx 30 and german leopard 1 were also examined as possible replacements for argentine sherman fleet in 1973 argentine ministry of defense drew up a series of requirements for a tank to enter service in 1980s armored vehicle would weigh no more than move at a maximum speed of and cover at least on roads it would be armed with a modern 105 mm main gun two machine guns and grenade launchers tank designers also had to take into account argentina s existing infrastructure including railroad capacity bridges and road capacity as well as country s varied terrain in late 1973 proyecto de tanque argentino mediano argentine medium tank project was founded with goal of designing and developing a tank for argentine army lacking experience and necessary technology argentine government sought collaboration with a foreign company resulting in a contract with german company thyssen henschel contract called for a transfer of technology resulting in a program to develop a tank in line with government s requirements and under a technical team that included both german and argentine engineers hull of german marder armored personnel carrier was used and chassis was strengthened to support increased weight of tam two prototypes were manufactured in late 1976 and early 1977 which were put through extensive testing for two years and over a road range of simultaneously another prototype was manufactured to further investigation of new vehicle and complete three prototypes as agreed in contract new tank s firepower requirements were met by fitting a british royal ordnance main gun this gun was later replaced by modified l7a2 and finally by rheinmetall s rh 105 30 gun this gun is manufactured in argentina as fm k 4 modelo 1l rh 105 30 s advantages include low weight compact size and increased lethality unlike rh 105 30 fm k 4 does not have a muzzle brake locally built cannon can be elevated to 18 degrees or depressed to 7 degrees on tam gun s hydraulic recoil mechanism has an extended length of to absorb recoil force it is designed to fire armor piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot which can penetrate a maximum of at it can also fire high explosive anti tank rounds high explosive squash head and smoke rounds tank s secondary armaments include a co axial fn mag 60 40 general purpose machine gun and a second fn mag 60 20 mounted on tam s turret roof as an anti aircraft machine gun fire control system includes a nd yag laser with a range of and a hg ballistic computer to compute gun s fire solutions helping gunner aim and hit target tank commander uses a zeiss peri r ta panoramic periscope with a 2x and 8x zoom right thumb tam with its snorkel installed during an argentine army exposition tam s engine requirements included low weight and volume but with a fast rate of acceleration and high reliability program chose mtu s mb 833 ka 500 diesel engine producing at 2 400 rpm this gives tam a power to weight ratio of 24 horsepower per tonne and a maximum speed of on road and off road with a internal fuel tank tam can travel its range is extended to if vehicle is equipped with two external fuel tanks tam s transmission is a renk 204 automatic with a hydrodynamic torque converter a double brake system includes hydraulic disk brakes on roadwheels and suspension is a torsion bar tam s survivability is related to its low profile turret based on that of leopard and leopard 2 and its physical armor array it has at 75 degrees on glacis plate and 32 degrees on vehicle s sides this offers protection against anti armor shells from up to guns turret front is protected by of steel armor at an angle of 32 degrees although tank s weight and armor protection are light compared to other main battle tanks it has advantage of better tactical mobility over nation s terrain as a private venture thyssen henschel built a fourth prototype designated th 301 completed in 1978 it added a peri r12 periscope originally designed for leopard for tank commander gunner and loader each received a day periscope as well to enable crew to fire effectively at night a low light level television llltv camera which moved in elevation with main gun was fitted to mantlet furthermore tank received a more powerful engine improvement program also made provisions to increase thickness of armor for additional protection upgrades in 2010 a modernization program was announced israeli defense contractor elbit systems was chosen to provide 3 axis gyro stabilization and most probably l7a2 105 mm cannon will be replaced with a more powerful 120 mm cannon like 120 mm cannon first tam unit upgraded by elbit systems was delivered in march 2013 variants a number of variants were built on same chassis as tam tank original program called for design of an infantry fighting vehicle and in 1977 program finished manufacturing prototype of vehiculo de combate transporte de personal personnel transport combat vehicle or vctp vctp is able to transport a squad of 12 men including squad leader and nine riflemen squad leader is situated in turret of vehicle one rifleman sits behind him and another six are seated in chassis eighth manning hull machine gun and ninth situated in turret with gunner all personnel can fire their weapons from inside vehicle and vctp s turret is armed with rheinmetall s rh 202 autocannon vctp holds 880 rounds for autocannon including armor piercing rounds it is also armed with a 7 62 mm fn mag 60 20 machine gun mounted on turret roof infantry can dismount through a door on rear of hull commander has a day sight and seven observation periscopes while gunner has a day sight and three observation periscopes right thumb argentine vctps during peacekeeping operations in croatia variants also include vehiculo de combate de artilleria de 155 mm 155 mm artillery

200 tanks and 312 vctp infantry fighting vehicles economic problems however ended production in 1983 with only 150 tams and 100 vctps built these vehicles were produced by an argentine company tanque argentino mediano sociedad del estado or tamse founded by government in march 1980 70 of tam s components were manufactured in argentina while 30 manufactured in germany corresponded to transmission optics and fire control system in 1983 20 tams and 26 vctps were delivered to argentine army after an original order of 80 tams by peru was canceled due to budgetary issues in 1991 tamse and tam production line were shut down although in 1994 tamse was reactivated to complete an order for 120 of both tams and vctps to replace m4 shermans in 2nd armored cavalry brigade of argentine army by 1995 argentine army was equipped with 200 tam tanks and 216 vctp and vcpc armored vehicles although 25 vca were originally planned for production starting in 1990 only 19 were completed and delivered by 1995 along with 50 no other variants of tam including vclc vac and vcrt were put into production due to budget restrictions tamse plant is a facility factory is completely covered with two warehouses for storing components quality control laboratories a project office an engine test room and a firing range also participating in production of tam and variant components were argentine companies military factories general san martin manufacturing chassis rio tercero turret and armament and bator s a export and combat history right thumb vclc during argentine army exhibition in 2008 tam has never been exported although a number of nations were interested in buying it in 1981 malaysia signed a contract for 102 vehicles of tam family including tank vctp and vcrt renaming these lion tiger and elephant respectively none of these vehicles were delivered and malaysia chose instead to procure poland s pt 91 in mid 1983 peru established a contract for 80 tams due to budgetary problems order was canceled after 20 tanks had been completed a similar order was established by panama in 1984 and was canceled as well in 1989 tam competed in a tank procurement order from ecuador alongside american stingray light tank austrian sk 105 and french amx 13 105 light tank tam achieved 950 out of 1 000 points while its closest competitor earned 750 points but in end ecuador did not procure any of vehicles presented in middle east both iran and saudi arabia expressed interest in tam iranian deal fell through after saudi arabia and iraq successfully appealed to germany to cancel order tamse attempted to sell 60 tanks through a panamanian company offering this company a commission worth 10 of contract s price this failed when tamse lowered price of vehicles angering iranian government which subsequently canceled offer saudi arabian deal was scrapped when israel appealed to germany to cancel order failing to export tank argentine government closed tamse fabrication plant in 1995 tam did not participate in falklands war as it had not entered service before end of conflict seventeen vctps were deployed with an argentina battalion to yugoslavia during united nations peacekeeping
