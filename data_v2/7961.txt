rhein class of ironclad riverine monitors were a pair of ships built by german imperial navy in aftermath of franco prussian war class comprised two ships rhein and mosel both were built by ag weser shipyard in bremen in 1872 1874 they were armed with a pair of bronze cannon in a revolving gun turret ships were intended to protect german border with france in event of a conflict but had short service lives as war did not come they served briefly in defenses of coblenz starting in 1875 before being withdrawn from service two ships were sold for scrap apparently in december 1884 design in aftermath of franco prussian war of 1870 71 imperial german navy decided that it needed to build river gunboats for service on rhine and moselle to defend german border this decision came despite navy having seen french navy s negative experiences with similar gunboats during war german navy decided that two armored gunboats were necessary and awarded contract to ag weser to design and build vessels design staff based their work on a pair of austro hungarian monitors and that had been recently built for service on danube hildebrand rohr steinmetz pp 68 69 characteristics rhein and mosel were long at waterline and long overall and had a beam of at cruising load monitors had a forward draft of an aft draft of and a maximum draft of freeboard was forward and aft ships were designed to partially flood for combat which would submerge hull so only upper casemate and gun turret would be above water this reduced freeboard to and respectively ships had a designed displacement of and at full load they displaced hulls were constructed with transverse iron frames ships had a crew of one officer and twenty two enlisted men and both carried a single boat groner p 136 ships were powered by two horizontal 2 cylinder single expansion steam engines these drove a pair of 3 bladed screws on diameter engines were placed in a single engine room two locomotive boilers with two fireboxes apiece supplied steam to engines they were located in a separate boiler room engines were rated at and a top speed of in service they were capable of 48 nominal horsepower and ships maneuvered slowly and turned poorly especially steaming downstream they did not handle well upstream either particularly in turning against current handling while ships were flooded for combat was especially dangerous ships were each armed with a pair of l 19 bronze cannon manufactured by krupp brassey p 582 they were rifled muzzle loading guns mounted in a single revolving gun turret placed on an armored casemate amidships gardiner p 261 guns fired a 36 pound shot brassey p 217 and were supplied with 300 rounds of ammunition ships were protected with a combination of wrought iron armor and teak turret sides were armored with of iron backed with of teak roofs were thick conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof casemate was protected with 65 mm of armor plate on sides service history intention for rhein and mosel was to use them to defend railway bridges on rhine in event of a french war of revenge after franco prussian war in 1870 1871 ships were both built at ag weser dockyard in bremen under construction numbers 23 and 24 respectively rhine railway company was compelled to contribute 300 000 thalers to construction of ships as they were intended to defend railway bridges company used at rheinhausen both ships were laid down in 1872 and launched later that year they were both commissioned into imperial navy on 25 april 1874 they spent first year of their career at rheinhausen and in april 1875 both vessels embarked on a test cruise to strassburg on 7 april when they were transferred to defenses of coblenz dislere p 81 by time two monitors entered service prospect of a french attack had decreased prompting navy to question usefulness of retaining vessels as a result they were quickly removed from service ultimate fate of two ships is unclear according to naval historian erich groner both ships were sold for 3 500 gold marks in december 1875 robert gardiner however states that ships remained out of service until 1884 when they were sold for scrapping latter version would appear to be correct as j f von kronenfels published an elevation and of rhein in 1881 with inference that rhein and mosel were still extant at that time von kronenfels fig 53 and fig 54 notes references category ironclad warships of imperial german navy category victorian era naval ships of germany category ships built in bremen state category riverine warfare
