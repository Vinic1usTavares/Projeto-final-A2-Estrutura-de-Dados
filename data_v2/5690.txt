lords knights of old republic ii was developed by obsidian entertainment and published by lucasarts it is sequel to bioware s knights of old republic and it uses same odyssey engine as original game bioware suggested that obsidian should be offered knights of old republic license due to their familiarity with obsidian s past work and good relationship between two developers as well as due to finding lucasarts development schedule for sequel to be too tight game was released in pc and xbox versions but due to xbox version being released two months prior to pc version it has multiple unfixed bugs development of game began in october 2003 overview of game s story was originally drafted before first knights of old republic was released after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts in preparation to write knights of old republic ii lead designer chris avellone tried to learn as much about star wars universe as possible he read many books guides modules and graphic novels and obsidian team also relied on first knights of old republic and original star wars films for inspiration avellone said that obsidian recognized one of things that made knights of old republic great was story and companions and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them knights of old republic ii uses same d20 system as first knights of old republic with some changes and level cap has also been removed for most part team didn t want to redo any of design elements from first game as they felt that there was no need to change anything that had already proved successful instead they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon them in a way that retained base style of knights of old republic obsidian put much work into game s graphics including appearances of non player characters other technological improvements include lighting and weather effects in addition to increasing level sizes knights of old republic iis lead artist was aaron meyers he decided which people would join art team after looking through tons of applications resumes and demo reels and he said that he was pleased with number of people who wanted to work for obsidian meyers also complained about short deadline development team had to deal with obsidian s coo chris parker said that schedule set for development team was extremely aggressive and that team felt a lot of pressure because they were making a sequel to game of year for 2003 for music development team felt that symphony orchestra would work best for knights of old republic ii musical score was composed by mark griskey who developed music and themes for characters and places including jedi s theme darth sion s theme and darth nihilus s theme which both have many similarities with emperor s theme from return of jedi he also created a theme for main character which is heard occasionally when he or she experiences internal conflict 55 minute score was recorded by sinfonia orchestra in seattle interview with mark griskey opening crawl utilizes version of john williams main star wars theme that was re recorded for prequel trilogy when obsidian was preparing to present knights of old republic ii at e3 2004 they tried to fit as much information as they could saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was only e3 event it would be showcased at however due to limited time frame they would have to cut it down to a five to ten minute presentation during this time none of levels obsidian designed were ready to be shown so they picked three levels and put them

official website was launched in october when looking back at knights of old republic ii in a 2013 interview avellone said that because of lucasarts forcing obsidian to finish game in a short time frame of 14 to 16 months game ended up being in an unfinished state however avellone said that obsidian was at fault for this due to not cutting out enough things he noted that all minigames should have been removed and also said that there were too many in engine cutscenes obsidian s co founder feargus urquhart said that game was originally going to be released in 2005 but it was later moved up to december 2004 after e3 according to him obsidian had to choose between get ting in trouble or get ting it done due to this several cuts had to be made one of most major was droid planet m4 78 which was entirely removed from game after 2004 e3 event when team realized that they wouldn t be able to fit it into schedule m4 78 s designer kevin saunders explained that he moved assets from that planet
