off delaware coast and sank in ten minutes with loss of her 1 000 000 cargo of of raw hawaiian sugar in days after washingtonians sinking price of sugar in united states increased almost nine percent partly attributed to loss of washingtonians cargo lying under approximately of water washingtonians wreck is one of most popular recreational dive sites on eastern seaboard design and construction in november 1911 american hawaiian steamship company placed an order with maryland steel company of sparrows point maryland for two new cargo ships and washingtonian maryland steel had built three ships georgian and honolulan for american hawaiian in 1909 in what proved to be a satisfactory arrangement for both companies and in september 1911 american hawaiian placed an order for washingtonians four older sister ships and contract cost of ships was set at construction cost plus an eight percent profit for maryland steel but capped at a maximum cost of 640 000 each construction was financed by maryland steel with a credit plan that called for a five percent down payment in cash and nine monthly installments for balance deal had provisions that allowed some of nine installments to be converted into longer term notes or mortgages final cost of washingtonian including financing costs was 71 49 per deadweight ton which totaled just under 733 000 washingtonian maryland steel yard no 131 was second ship built under contract ship was cochran and ginger p 365 and was in length between perpendiculars and abeam she had a deadweight tonnage of and at time of her launch was largest american flagged cargo ship washingtonian had a speed of and was powered by a single steam engine with oil fired boilers which drove a single screw propeller washingtonians cargo holds providing a storage capacity of were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so she could carry perishable products from west coast to east coast such as pacific northwest salmon or fresh produce from southern california farms service when washingtonian began sailing for american hawaiian company shipped cargo from east coast ports via tehuantepec route to west coast ports and hawaii and vice versa shipments on tehuantepec route arrived at mexican ports salina cruz oaxaca for eastbound cargo and coatzacoalcos veracruz for westbound cargo and traversed isthmus of tehuantepec on tehuantepec national railway hovey p 78 eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from hawaii while westbound cargoes were more general in nature cochran and ginger p 355 56 washingtonian sailed in this service but it is not known whether she sailed on east or west side of north america after united states occupation of veracruz on 21 april 1914 which took place while six american hawaiian line ships were being held in various mexican ports huerta led mexican government closed tehuantepec national railway to american shipping this loss of access panama canal was not yet open until later that year caused american hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around south america via strait of magellan in late april cochran and ginger p 360 during u s occupation washingtonian was chartered by u s navy department to serve as a non commissioned refrigerator and supply ship for u s naval fleet off mexico she was outfitted for her first voyage at new york navy yard and sailed with of fresh meat for united states navy and u s army washingtonian sailed in a rotation with commissioned navy stores ships and with official opening of panama canal on 15 august 1914 american hawaiian line ships switched to taking isthmus canal route in late august american hawaiian announced that washingtonian her navy charter ended by this time would sail on a san francisco panama canal boston route sailing opposite vessels honolulan and sister ship pennsylvanian washingtonian sailed from los angeles in early october with a load of california products including canned and dried fruits beans and wine for new york city and boston after delivering that load washingtonian then headed for honolulu hawaii to take on a load of raw sugar valued at about 1 000 000 departing honolulu on 20 december washingtonian arrived at balboa on 17 january 1915 and transited panama canal sailing from cristobal on eastern end two days later she headed for delaware breakwater en route to philadelphia collision at 3 30 a m on 26 january some from fenwick island delaware american schooner elizabeth palmer was a five masted wooden schooner built in bath maine in 1903 and considered one of largest u s sailing ships at time see shomette p 207 was under full sail at on a southwest by south course elizabeth palmers captain saw a large steam vessel washingtonian on an apparent collision course ahead but did not change course since navigational rules require steam powered vessels to yield to vessels under sail power captain of washingtonian two quartermasters and a seaman were all on watch and saw elizabeth palmer but misjudged schooner s rapid pace when washingtonian underway at did not change course or speed elizabeth palmer collided with starboard side of steamer leaving a large hole that sank washingtonian ten minutes later less than a mile 2 km away elizabeth palmer with her jib boom and top of her foremast stripped away by impact began taking on water through her split seams when it became apparent that big schooner would sink her captain ordered her abandonment and she slowly settled and went down about an hour after collision shomette pp 209 10 after washingtonians crew abandoned ship one crewman a water tender was found to be missing and was presumed drowned washingtonians 39 survivors and all 13 crew members from elizabeth palmer were picked up about an hour after collision by passenger liner hamilton of old dominion line which arrived at new york next day collision had repercussions for american hawaiian and world sugar market financial impact of collision on american hawaiian estimated at 2 000 000 was devastating shomette p 211 washingtonians captain and company were at fault because navigation rules required that steam powered vessels yield to sail powered vessels see shomette p 209 contemporary news reports in new york times and wall street journal both told of collision s impact on sugar market claus a spreckels president of federal sugar refining noted that loss of even such a large cargo would not normally have much effect on sugar market however weather in cuba then largest supplier of sugar for united states had reduced that island nation s crop by more than 200 000 tons further affecting situation was world war i then ongoing in europe still neutral united states did not enter world war i until april 1917 which had reduced tonnage of shipping available to transport commodities like sugar with all of these factors asking price for sugar futures contracts for february 1915 delivery was 2 90 cents per pound 6 39 cents per kg a week before washingtonians sinking but had risen to 3 16 cents per pound 6 96 cents per kg day after sinking washingtonians wreck a skeletal framework of hull plates and bulkheads lies upside down in about of water shomette p 206 and is one of most visited wreck sites along eastern seaboard shomette p 212 lying about a mile away from that of washingtonian wreck of elizabeth palmer worm
