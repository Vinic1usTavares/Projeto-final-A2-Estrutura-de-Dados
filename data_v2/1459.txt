heraclius elder died 610 was a byzantine general and father of byzantine emperor heraclius r 610 641 of possible armenian origin heraclius elder distinguished himself in war against sassanid persians in 580s as a subordinate general or hypostrategos heraclius served under command of philippicus during battle of solachon and possibly served under comentiolus during battle of sisarbanon in circa 595 heraclius elder is mentioned as a magister militum per armeniam sent by emperor maurice r 582 602 to quell an armenian rebellion led by samuel vahewuni and atat khorkhoruni in circa 600 he was appointed as exarch of africa and in 608 heraclius elder rebelled with his son against usurper phocas r 602 610 using north africa as a base younger heraclius managed to overthrow phocas beginning heraclian dynasty which would rule byzantium for a century heraclius elder died soon after receiving news of his son s accession to byzantine throne origin heraclius elder was possibly of armenian origin and presumably bilingual armenian and greek at an early age his armenian origin is deduced by a passage of theophylact simocatta which considers him a native of byzantine armenia passage is from book iii of theophylact simocatta s history and so philippicus had learned during his journey that priscus had been accredited as general by emperor maurice on reaching tarsus he composed messages to heraclius elder which indicated that after leaving army he should return to his own city when he came to armenia and surrender army to narses commander of city of anthony kaldellis argues that there is not a single primary source that says that heraclius was an armenian and that assertion is based on an erroneous reading of theophylact simocatta in a letter priscus a general who had replaced heraclius elder wrote to him to leave army and return to his own city in armenia kaldellis interprets it as command headquarters of heraclius elder and not his home town kaldellis anthony 2019 ethnicity and empire in byzantium p 183 harvard university press heraclius elder s own city is not specifically mentioned mary and michael whitby suggest that heraclius elder was at time magister militum per armeniam if so his city was theodosiopolis modern erzurum headquarters of roman forces in armenia theophylact simocatta iii 1 1 ed as chief military stronghold along northeastern border of empire theodosiopolis held an important strategic location that was contested in wars between byzantines and persians emperors anastasius i r 491 518 and justinian i r 527 565 both refortified city and built new defenses during their reigns nothing is known of specific ancestry of heraclius elder but this has not prevented modern historians from speculating on matter cyril mango has supported a theory which suggests that he was a namesake descendant of heraclius of edessa a 5th century roman general a passage from sebeos s history has been understood to suggest an arsacid origin of heraclius elder this theory was strongly supported by cyril toumanoff while considered likely by alexander vasiliev and irfan shahid john of nikiu and constantine manasses seem to consider his son heraclius younger to be a cappadocian which might indicate his place of birth rather than actual ancestry family historia of patriarch nikephoros i of constantinople mentions a single brother of heraclius elder named gregoras who was father of nicetas theophanes confessor mentions epiphania as mother of emperor heraclius thus wife of heraclius elder heraclius elder is mentioned as father of emperor heraclius in several sources including theophylact john of nikiu nikephoros i theophanes agapius historian suda georgios kedrenos joannes zonaras michael syrian chronicle of 1234 and nikephoros kallistos in contrast there is no source mentioning him in same sentence as siblings of emperor heraclius that he was their father can be safely assumed though best attested sibling of heraclius younger was arguably theodore maria sister of heraclius younger is mentioned by nikephoros i and identified as mother of martina whom heraclius younger would go on to marry it should be noted however that both kedrenos and michael syrian consider martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of heraclius younger thus casting some doubt on precise relation finally theophanes briefly mentions another gregoras as a brother of heraclius younger on occasion of former s death at heliopolis modern baalbek circa 652 653 this is only mention of this sibling theophanes however might have misunderstood relation between gregoras and emperor career under philippicus heraclius elder is first mentioned in 586 as a general serving under philippicus during roman persian war of 572 591 heraclius elder commanded center of byzantine army at battle of solachon in spring 586 following battle he was sent on a scouting mission to confirm rumour of arrival of persian reinforcements theophylact simocatta ii 5 9 11 ed thumb right roman persian frontier between 565 and 591 byzantine force went on to invade arzanene philippicus besieged chlomaron chief city of area at this point and two local leaders defected to byzantines they promised to help locate ideal positions for building impregnable forts that would control passage through taurus mountains and allowing byzantines to control routes that connected arzanene with and lower mesopotamia philippicus assigned heraclius elder noted at this point as his second in command hypostrategos to follow guides to strong points indicated theophylact simocatta ii 7 1 7 6 11 ed twenty men accompanied heraclius elder in mission they left without their armour and their party soon encountered kardarigan leading a new persian army theophylact notes that kardarigan was marching against romans having enrolled throngs who were not soldiers but men inexperienced in martial clamour he had in addition assembled a herd of baggage animals and camels and was moving forwards nevertheless kardarigan attempted to attack heraclius ill equipped unit and heraclius had to escape by moving from ridge to ridge by night he sent a messenger to warn philippicus of approaching threat theophylact simocatta ii 8 1 5 ed philippicus forces fled in disorder back into roman territory he managed to reach amida and then set about restoring old forts on mount there possibly due to illness he handed over command of his army to heraclius theophylact narrates theophylact indicates and heraclius elder wintered together at theodosiopolis theophylact simocatta ii 9 16 10 1 10 4 5 ed in spring 587 philippicus was again ill and unable to campaign in person he assigned two thirds of his army to heraclius elder and remainder to generals theodore and andreas and sent them to raid persian territory heraclius elder besieged an unnamed strong fort using his siege engines day and night until it fell after installing a garrison in captured fort theophanes confessor reports that heraclius elder proceeded to join general theodore at siege of but this seems to be an error theophanes seems to have misunderstood relevant passage of theophylact which has theodore and andreas joining at that siege theophylact simocatta ii 10 6 7 18 1 6 ed in late 587 philippicus planned to return to constantinople leaving heraclius elder in charge of army for winter season heraclius elder took measures to restore discipline to troops according to theophylact heraclius inflicted penalties for desertion on vagrants from roman force and those who had bidden farewell to labour and who were aimlessly wandering hither and thither were converted to good sense by punishments in early 588 emperor maurice r 582 602 replaced philippicus with priscus philippicus wrote to heraclius elder ordering him to leave army in care of narses and return to armenia but same letters notified soldiers of an imperial decree which reduced their pay by one quarter theophylact simocatta ii 18 26 and iii 1 1 2 this led to a mutiny of troops who refused to follow priscus orders mutiny was only ended when order was rescinded and philippicus re appointed as commander of eastern army under comentiolus heraclius elder resurfaces a year later under command of comentiolus in battle of sisarbanon autumn 589 in vicinity of nisibis according to account of theophylact comentiolus supposedly fled towards theodosiopolis modern ra s al ayn while battle was still ongoing heraclius elder took charge of remaining troops and led them to victory theophylact however lived and wrote during reign of heraclius younger and is strongly biased in favour of his father his account is thus suspected of exaggerating or even inventing comentiolus cowardice with aim of glorifying heraclius elder contemporary evagrius scholasticus for instance credits comentiolus with being in thick of combat and does not mention heraclius elder at all armenian revolt heraclius elder is mentioned again circa 595 as magister militum per armeniam probably succeeding john history of sebeos provides main account of his term he was sent by maurice to face armenian rebels led by samuel vahewuni and atat khorkhoruni heraclius elder was assisted by hamazasp mamikonian heraclius elder seems to have been replaced by suren his service in armenia was brief but arguably reinforced his ties to country exarch of africa heraclius elder is next mentioned in 608 as patrician and exarch of africa according to patriarch nikephoros heraclius elder had been appointed to position by maurice prior to latter s deposition and death in 602 he might have replaced a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600 appointment suggests that heraclius elder enjoyed favor of maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him heraclius elder and his african court notably lamented death and execution of maurice and posthumously praised fallen emperor exarchs of africa were effectively governor generals with both civilian and military powers their seat of power was carthage historians of late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment even suggesting it would require prominent ties between heraclius elder and africa or wider western roman empire later historians pointed out however that this appointment was part of a wider pattern in 6th century several prominent byzantine military commanders had started their careers in eastern regions of empire often in vicinity of upper mesopotamia then they were transferred to north africa at some point in their respective careers there is therefore no indication that this rotation from eastern to western provinces was unusual charles diehl regarded early 7th century byzantine africa to have undergone an economic and demographic decline being under constant threat by hostile berbers later historians however have had to revise this picture in light of archaeological evidence exarchate was among most affluent areas of byzantine empire though of lesser wealth and significance than egypt it seems to have seen much less warfare than balkans mesopotamia and caucasus did in that era thus allowing its residents a safer way of life there is evidence of ongoing trade between byzantine africa and frankish gaul during 7th century agriculture was thriving particularly in vicinity of medjerda river production of grain olive oil and wine kept local population well fed and probably supplied their maritime trade fishing seems to have been another thriving field local elite seems to have invested in building of churches main testaments to their existence and activities are examples of funerary art particularly mosaics heraclius elder seems to have established ties with this elite his son heraclius younger married his first wife eudokia during 7th century her father was a landowner in exarchate revolt against phocas in 608 exarchate of africa under heraclius elder revolted against emperor phocas subsequent campaign against phocas was portrayed by byzantine historians as avenging death of maurice which might have been part of motivation of this revolt other part however would be what walter emil kaegi termed cold political calculations carthage was at a safe distance from constantinople and phocas could not easily launch an attack against it relative wealth of exarchate of africa could well enough finance a revolt phocas s regime arguably needed grain and revenues from africa while exarchate sustained itself with relative ease meanwhile persian shah khosrau ii had secured control of dara and was mobilizing his troops for a large scale invasion into byzantine territories news of this campaign could have well reached heraclius elder with phocas facing two separate military fronts emperor would be unable to concentrate majority of his troops on either one of them encouraging heraclius elder of his chances to succeed in this confrontation after their revolt heraclius elder and heraclius younger were proclaimed joint consuls there is no indication in sources on how this was achieved i e whether heraclius elder was self appointed or officially proclaimed by senate of carthage whose members had no legal right to designate a roman consul nevertheless significance of proclamation was evident no private individuals had been proclaimed consuls since reign of justinian i r 527 565 since then it was merely another title exclusively used by byzantine emperors by this proclamation heraclius elder was arguably making a first step towards becoming emperor himself while legitimizing his connection to long history of rome mints of carthage and later alexandria produced coins depicting heraclius elder and his namesake son wearing consular robes john of antioch and patriarch nikephoros both report that heraclius elder maintained correspondence with priscus count of excubitors and former commander of army by that time priscus was son in law of phocas but reportedly held a grudge against emperor he allegedly promised heraclius elder support in case of a rebellion and confirmed it once rebellion had started story is somewhat suspect while there was major dissension in constantinople and priscus did in time defect to heraclius elder there is nothing to suggest that priscus helped incite revolt patriarch nikephoros reports that heraclius elder held council with his brother gregoras before proclaiming his revolt possibly indicating that gregoras was acting as his advisor he also reports that gregoras hoped to promote his own son nicetas to throne although this is considered unlikely at best by modern historians situation in 609 610 was quickly becoming dire for phocas and his loyalists their defense against sassanid empire had failed there were persian forces in mesopotamia armenia syria and anatolian provinces rebel byzantine forces held africa and egypt slavs were occupying northern illyricum in thessalonica and various towns of anatolia and syria blues and greens were settling their differences with open conflict in areas of syria jews were revolting and lynching christians even in constantinople crowds taunted phocas for his love of liquor implying alcoholism in 610 persian general shahrbaraz was approaching antioch but rebels of africa posed a more immediate threat than persian front having secured control of egypt they proceeded to invade syria and cyprus while a large fleet under heraclius younger set sail for constantinople supporters from sicily crete and thessalonica were joining his campaign rebels reached constantinople in october 610 only forces available to phocas to defend city were excubitors of his bodyguard and irregular forces of blues and greens city s racing factions priscus commander of excubitors chose moment to reveal his allegiance to heraclius younger greens also changed sides in support of heraclius younger and constantinople fell to with relative ease heraclius younger ultimately became new emperor and phocas was executed along with several of his kinsmen and loyalists according to john of nikiu heraclius elder rejoiced at news of his son rising to throne but died soon afterwards assessment while heraclius elder was a prominent general of his time his military achievements were rather modest byzantine historians covering his career were arguably attempting to magnify their importance to give heraclius younger an exalted ancestry references citations sources external links category 6th century births category 610 deaths category magistri militum category
