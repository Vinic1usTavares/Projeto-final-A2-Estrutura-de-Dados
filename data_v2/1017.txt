numerous members of germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like dacia pannonia germany and italy itself this was not a new thing but this time numbers of settlers required creation of two new frontier provinces on left shore of danube sarmatia and including today s czech republic slovakia and hungary some germanic tribes who settled in ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of

commodus whom he had named caesar in 166 and made co emperor in 177 though choice may have been unknowingly unfortunate this decision which put an end to fortunate series of adoptive emperors was highly criticized by later historians since commodus was a political and military outsider as well as an extreme egotist with neurotic problems birley hadrian to antonines 186 191 for this reason marcus aurelius death is often held to have been end of pax romana at end of his history of marcus aurelius reign cassius dio wrote an encomium to emperor and described transition to commodus to dio s own times with sorrow marcus did not meet with good fortune that he deserved for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign but for my part i admire him all more for this very reason that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved empire just one thing prevented him from being completely happy namely that after rearing and educating his person in best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him this matter must be our next topic for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust as affairs did for romans of that day cassius dio lxxi 36 3 cary ad loc it is possible that marcus aurelius chose commodus simply in absence of other candidates or as a result of fear of succession issues and possibility of civil war michael grant in climax of rome 1968 writes of commodus youth turned out to be very erratic or at least so anti traditional that disaster was inevitable but whether or not marcus aurelius ought to have known this to be so rejections of his son s claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly involved one of civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrous around future successions grant p 15 writings thumb first page of 1792 english translation by richard graves while on campaign between 170 and 180 marcus aurelius wrote his
