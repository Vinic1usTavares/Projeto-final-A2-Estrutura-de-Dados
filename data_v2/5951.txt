lifetime and he had successful exhibitions in glasgow london and new york shortly before his death glasgow herald commented that while hunter was already well known as a painter of landscape and still life his move to portrait painting would cause a good deal of interest and discussion many years after his death solo exhibitions of hunter s paintings were still held and in 1953 display of a selection of watercolours and paintings in glasgow attracted numerous visitors art critic of glasgow herald described varied and uneven genius of painter and praised one painting as having been executed with such a freedom and economy of touch one cannot well see how any amount of extra thought or technical application could have bettered it paintings by hunter have gone on to sell for large sums in early 21st century with one painting described as star lot in a bonhams auction in june 2010 selling for ps144 000 another painting was sold in june 2010 for ps78 000 nick curnow head of pictures at lyon turnbull said of it this is a very special painting so typical of hunter style hunter focused for much of his life on landscapes and on still lifes working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas his still lifes of fruit are particularly distinctive but he also painted a variety of landscapes especially of scotland and france in his earlier paintings hunter was influenced by cezanne to produce domestic landscapes later however in common with other members of scottish colourists movement he was heavily influenced by contemporary french artists like monet and matisse and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour hunter particularly strove to capture in his paintings effects of light and would repeatedly paint same objects or locations under a range of lighting conditions his brush style was influenced by french avant garde and especially in his later work is described by art critics as open and free and energetic references external links
