hair author nora roberts according to literary critic mary ellen snodgrass irish thoroughbred is not as polished as later roberts works snodgrass cites many predictable elements including core confrontation between an overconfident male and an assertive girl woman throughout 1970s and early 1980s romance novel heroines were generally trembling virgins of an inferior class and power level than hero hero often was very rich and powerful while heroine worked in traditional subordinate female roles such as governess or secretary heroine of irish thoroughbred conformed to this pattern in part by being sexually inexperienced immature and poor snodgrass 2010 p 11 but roberts deliberately deviated from rest of stereotype by providing her with a hot tempered and independent personality her later books have continued in same vein as roberts explains my heroine may have problems she may be vulnerable but she has to be strong she has to be intelligent she has to be independent and so does he or i m not interested in telling their stories popularity of this book and roberts s subsequent novels helped transform genre making authors more willing to give heroes and heroines economic
