elwood haynes october 14 1857 april 13 1925 was an american inventor metallurgist automotive pioneer entrepreneur and industrialist he invented metal alloys stellite and martensitic stainless steel and designed one of earliest automobiles made in united states he is recognized for having created earliest american design that was feasible for mass production and with apperson brothers he formed first company in united states to produce automobiles profitably he made many advances in automotive industry early in his career while serving as a field superintendent at gas and oil companies during indiana s gas boom haynes invented several devices important to advance of natural gas industry when working for indiana natural gas and oil company he oversaw construction of first long distance natural gas pipeline in united states connecting chicago with trenton gas field away he began to formulate plans for a motorized vehicle in early 1890s he successfully road tested his first car pioneer on july 4 1894 eight years after first automobile was patented in germany he formed a partnership with elmer and edgar apperson in 1896 to start haynes apperson for commercial production of automobiles he renamed it haynes automobile company in 1905 following loss of his partners working in his laboratory to develop new corrosion resistant metals for auto parts haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium steel and iron resulted in formation of strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion and could endure high temperatures in 1912 he formed haynes stellite company to produce one of new alloys and received lucrative contracts during world war i making haynes a millionaire in 1916 he sold his patent for stainless steel to american stainless steel company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at company s board of directors a position he held for 12 years he merged haynes stellite company with union carbide in 1920 after passing through different owners company was renamed and is now called haynes international haynes returned his focus to his automotive company but in economic recession of 1920s business went bankrupt and was liquidated an outspoken advocate of prohibition he made substantial donations to prohibition party and indiana s prohibitionist leader frank hanly haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in indiana for u s senate in 1916 as a prohibition candidate and remained active in party until prohibition became law later he became a philanthropist and served two terms as president of ymca five years on indiana board of education and was an active member of presbyterian church after his death from complications arising from influenza his kokomo mansion was converted into elwood haynes museum and is open to public where many of his original inventions and automobiles are on display early life family and background haynes was born on october 14 1857 in portland indiana fifth of ten children of jacob m haynes and s haines haynes his family was of english descent he was a ninth generation descendant of walter haynes who immigrated from wiltshire england to sudbury massachusetts in 1638 his father was jay county s school commissioner a lawyer whig politician and a judge of jay and randolph county common pleas court both of haynes parents were dedicated presbyterians and outspoken prohibitionists and educated their children from a young age to avoid liquor his mother was founder of a local women s temperance movement union his paternal grandfather henry haynes was a gunsmith and mechanic and tutored haynes about metallurgy in 1866 family moved from their two room house in portland into countryside outside of town where they purchased a larger home to better accommodate their growing number of children at age 12 haynes built his first vehicle from scrap railroad car parts and operated it on county s railroad tracks local railroad foreman did not approve and later seized vehicle and destroyed it as a child haynes had an interest in chemistry and metallurgy and when he was 15 he built a smelting furnace and began working with copper bronze and iron haynes was also interested in nature and spent considerable time in forest cataloging and observing plants insects and animals because he spent so much time there his family nicknamed him wood a nickname they used for most of his life as he grew older he became an avid reader of books including principles of natural philosophy and chemistry by william wells his early experiments and studies interested him in fundamental properties of matter and he was intrigued by how mixing compounds could create completely different alloys education thumb right haynes francis murphy temperance pledge card haynes attended public schools through eighth grade and received a basic education he had not determined a career path for himself and his parents often criticized him for lacking ambition they insisted that he seek employment he began by working as a custodian at a local church and later for railroad hauling ballast to construction sites at church he joined choir where he met and began to court bertha lanterman when portland s first public high school was opened in 1876 haynes returned to school at age 19 and completed two more years bertha and her family moved to alabama during spring of 1877 and haynes began a regular correspondence with her during summer of that year a series of revival meetings were held in indiana by francis murphy a leader of a national temperance organization known as murphy movement haynes attended meetings probably at his parents urging and became interested in temperance he took two of murphy s pledge cards and carried one for most of his life other he mailed to bertha haynes father attended philadelphia centennial exposition in 1876 where he learned of a school that would fit his son s interests using money he had saved haynes decided to attend college and enrolled in worcester technical institute in worcester massachusetts in september 1878 school was revolutionary for its time combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education although he easily passed difficult entrance exam he found that he was ill prepared for some of his college courses and he struggled with mathematics to earn an income while away from home he worked as a custodian and night guard at local public library he cleaned building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study during his final year at school boarding rates were increased beyond what haynes could afford so with no other option he lived in library for several months he could not afford to return home during his stay at institute so during holidays he spent time with his family and friends in new england thumb left boynton hall at worcester technical institute during his first term he was required to receive a grade of 60 to remain in school although he only achieved a 59 2 after completing his final exams he was permitted to remain because of his recent progress older than other students in his class he often spoke out against their use of alcohol in his final year he took courses in metallurgy ore analysis and assaying and participated in a research project developing razors his graduation thesis was entitled effects of tungsten on iron and steel it laid out basic principles of what would later become his two greatest advances in metallurgy haynes spent many hours in institute s laboratory working with tungsten and other metals before graduating in 1881 he was fourteenth out of twenty one graduates twenty did not pass haynes took a job teaching at jay county public school after returning home soon his income allowed him to buy a home near portland high school where he worked and was promoted to principal in 1882 that summer he took a week long trip to visit bertha in chattanooga tennessee where he became sick with a cold and spent most of his time in bed nursed by bertha learning that her family would be returning to live in portland in 1883 after returning from trip he continued saving money and in 1884 he decided to continue his education by enrolling at johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland he chose school because as it was only eight years old it had one of most modern laboratories available he took courses in chemistry and biology and learned advanced metallurgic techniques his mother died in may 1885 and he decided to leave university without completing his second year as he was not working to attain a degree but only taking courses of interest after he had returned home again he took a position at newly established eastern indiana normal school and commercial college now ball state university and served as head of chemistry department gas boom natural gas was first found in indiana in 1876 but it was not until 1886 that magnitude of discovery was known trenton gas field was largest deposit of natural gas discovered in 19th century and first giant oil reserve found in united states as a professor at a university in trenton field haynes offered his services to drillers and worked to analyze soil samples determine well pressure and give estimates on amount of energy that could be created by gas he delivered several lectures to large crowds about importance of gas discovery and many possible applications of this new source of fuel he began a petition to have local citizens create a corporation to pump fuel from ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses his promotion was successful and portland natural gas and oil company was formed haynes father was named to new company s board of directors in fall of 1886 board hired haynes as superintendent to manage company and oversee creation of wells and piping company was one of first in trenton field and many of others which soon followed modeled themselves on portland company as a fuel and industry natural gas was in its earliest stages haynes invented several devices that became important to success of industry one of his first inventions was a device capable of measuring amount of gas being pumped from wells haynes reputation as an industry leader grew out of his operations at portland and kokomo democrat referred to him as only infallible authority on natural gas in eastern indiana in an 1889 article haynes married bertha lanterman in october 1887 after a ten year relationship ceremony was held at her parents portland home and couple honeymooned in cincinnati their first child marie was born on january 28 1889 but she soon succumbed to illness and died when six months old their second child a son born in 1890 also died in infancy deaths saddened family and caused them to turn more to their religion haynes became increasingly active in presbyterian church and became an elder in december 1892 haynes third child bernice was born a second son march was born 1896 two children were well educated and grew up to assist their father in his enterprises a primary pipeline was laid between portland and a neighboring town during 1889 haynes oversaw construction of ten mile 16 km long pipeline and creation of wells for pumping gas during his numerous buggy rides between two towns he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation his thoughts on topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled he theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse and buggy transportation and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed indiana natural gas and oil company headquartered in chicago hired haynes as their field superintendent in 1890 after company s board of directors discovered that elwood haynes knew more about natural gas than anyone in state he and his wife moved to greentown where he oversaw construction of company s first pumping wells company planned to construct a natural gas line from eastern indiana to chicago a distance of over which would be first long distance natural gas pipeline built in united states haynes supervised design and construction phases of project because of length of line and temperature changes between two points moisture in natural gas condensed on pipe and during colder times would freeze pipes in some locations problem was a significant setback to operation which had to stop pumping during winter months haynes solved problem by creating a refrigeration device that would cause moisture which was a diluted form of gasoline to condense freeze and fall into a reservoir these devices were installed between main lines and pumping stations and effectively removed all moisture from natural gas before it was pumped into lines this prevented water buildup in pipes and allowed pipes to be used year round concept was a significant advance in early refrigeration technology and was further developed by others in later years haynes was offered a higher ranking position within indiana gas at chicago headquarters but by then he had become aware of business s connection to corrupt and disgraced monopolist charles t yerkes a deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption haynes entertained offer only briefly bertha s advice to refuse position persuaded him and he declined offer and instead sought a position more removed from company s chicago leadership after pipeline became fully operational in 1892 haynes moved to kokomo where he was made a supervisor of indiana gas s local operations indiana general assembly began attempts to regulate gas industry and accused field operations of various companies of gross waste indiana gas became primary target of scathing reports haynes helped company compile reports and offered opinions on validity of their claims he was disturbed to find that many of claims proved true and advocated that gas be used more conservatively he specifically recommended that flambeaus flames fed by natural gas to show that gas was flowing be extinguished as they were found to be largest source of waste he calculated that company daily wasted 10 000 in 2009 chained dollars worth of gas by burning flambeaus a figure that shocked company s leaders despite his support of governmental anti waste regulations he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity he personally filed lawsuits against regulations a month after their passage claiming that government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure court case continued until 1896 when indiana supreme court ruled that regulations were unconstitutional entire set of regulations was repealed including anti waste measures gross waste continued among other companies and field s wells began to run dry by 1905 modern experts estimate as much as 90 of one trillion cubic feet 30 km3 of natural gas in field was lost into atmosphere or misused enterprises 1894 first haynes car according to haynes he began laying out plans for construction of a mechanically propelled vehicle for use on highways in 1891 his first idea was for a steam powered vehicle but after careful consideration he decided use of a furnace on device would be too dangerous his second plan was to use electrical power but after research he found that no practical means existed to store electricity required for operation he continued to develop his plans until summer of 1893 when he attended chicago world s fair where he first witnessed a gasoline engine demonstration of newly invented engine inspired him to decide that an internal combustion engine would be most practical method to propel his vehicle a gasoline powered european automobile built by german inventor karl benz who patented first automobile in 1886 also was on display during fair although it is unknown if haynes witnessed this vehicle during his visit haynes ordered a one horsepower marine upright two cycle engine from sintz gas engine company in grand rapids michigan for 225 although engine was intended for use on a small boat haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes engine arrived in fall of 1893 haynes soon had device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen he found when he started engine that its vibrations were too severe for harness it was in and before he could stop engine it had done considerable damage to carriage and floor of his kitchen and filled room with smoke haynes decided he needed a different facility to continue experiment after his wife told him she would not abide his destruction of family kitchen he contacted elmer apperson operator of riverside machine works and arranged to use a space in his shop for continued development he agreed to work on his vehicle only after hours pay 40 cents per hour for help of elmer and his brother edgar and to not hold them responsible should his project fail he started building a new carriage this time with a heavier steel harness he described appearance of vehicle as a small truck wheel axles were also made of steel and entire front axle was constructed to swivel a central column was built of steel and laid across axles in such a way as to allow it move in all directions within a small radius to accommodate any sudden movements by motor or vehicle thumb left elwood haynes driving in his first automobile 1894 pioneer photo taken c 1910 because traction of rubber tires was unknown haynes completed a series of tests with a bicycle on paved roads he used a wagon built to weight of his automobile and a horse to pull a device that would cause wheels to turn thereby providing traction with this he was able to determine ratio of weight to gear sizes needed to enable tires to provide sufficient traction for propulsion once completed his vehicle weighed about he named his car pioneer and first test drove vehicle on july 4 1894 apperson brothers had notified kokomo townspeople of test drive and a crowd gathered to witness event haynes was concerned that his vehicle could injure someone in crowd so he had vehicle towed by a horse and buggy to pike away from crowd car started with haynes driving and elmer apperson riding as a passenger and traveled at 7 mph 11 km h he traveled for and then stopped vehicle to manually turn it around with elmer s help he proceeded to drive it several more miles back into town without stopping his trip convinced him that vehicle was worthwhile and could become a valuable enterprise although he was disappointed in vehicle s handling and decided he needed to improve steering system and find a way to divert motor s exhaust smoke away from carriage haynes car is believed to be second gasoline engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in united states according to its exhibit information at smithsonian institution it was built two years before henry ford s and preceded only by charles duryea s motorized wagon less than a year earlier unlike duryea s car which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse haynes car was designed only to run on its own some automotive historians use this difference to determine that haynes car was first true american automobile sintz company continued to be intrigued by haynes use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published images as an advertisement for one of their engine s possible uses publicity spurred creation of numerous other automobiles across american midwest haynes continued to drive his car as he added improvements to vehicle and constructed pioneer ii in 1895 to incorporate his improved steering designs and an exhaust pipe he built new car with intention of running it in 1895 chicago times herald race first automobile race in united states although over seventy five cars were entered in race most of their owners did not have them completed in time for race so only three cars and six early motorcycles showed up while driving to race haynes had a confrontation with a chicago policeman who insisted that haynes had no right to drive his vehicle on public roads forcing him to requisition a horse to pull car rest of way similar incidents happened with other race s entries so city passed an ordinance a few days later to clear up any ambiguity in laws and allow automobiles equal access to city streets allowing postponed race to take place while giving his car a ride around town on following day haynes was involved in what is believed to be first automobile accident after swerving to miss a street car and striking a sharp curb busting a tire and damaging axle without a spare tire haynes was unable to run in race race was held on november 28 and thousands of spectators turned out duryea s car won first place and a german benz came in second another contest was held in which haynes won a prize for most intuitive design haynes apperson haynes continued to perfect his auto design and in late 1895 he began his work to create a new hard alloy for use as a and other auto parts his intent was to make a metal that would be resistant to rusting he experimented with use of aluminum and found that when used it significantly deadened noise produced by engine parts as his designs progressed he decided to form a partnership for manufacture of his vehicles at end of 1894 haynes joined with elmer and edgar apperson to create an automobile company and began producing cars that year their company is recognized as being first viable automotive company in united states and second company to produce autos commercially duryea motor wagon company had formed a year earlier but went out of business after producing only thirteen vehicles haynes became involved in a dispute with duryea company over advertisements haynes apperson ran claiming to have created first automobile haynes apperson advertisement was clearly false but after duryea s company went bankrupt in 1898 there was no one to continue to dispute claim america s first car remained company s motto for rest of its existence by 1896 company produced one new car every two to three weeks and built vehicles on order for 2 000 as orders increased company formally incorporated as haynes apperson on may 5 1898 with 25 000 in capital from stock issued to portland and kokomo businessmen at end of that year company relocated to a large factory it had built in kokomo two new models were designed and workforce expanded as production increased haynes apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions demand for vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899 192 in 1900 and 240 in 1901 work kept factory open 24 hours a day and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep factory running at capacity by 1902 sales totaled over 400 000 that year thumb right a 1903 haynes apperson car advertisement haynes apperson automobiles were known for their long distance running capability company s cars regularly competed and won prizes in endurance races that demonstrated distance and terrain over which cars could travel haynes had soon designed superior methods of achieving traction and his car could climb hills easier than his competitors in early races last model designed under haynes apperson name had three speeds and was capable of 24 mph on pneumatic tires in 1901 a haynes car was entered in first long island non stop endurance race haynes car took first place in race adding to company s publicity and helping to feed a large jump in sales another event to gain company significant publicity was sale of a car to dr ashley a webber in new york city webber refused to buy any car unless seller could prove car s endurance by driving it to his home haynes and edgar apperson readily agreed to demand and drove car from kokomo to webber s new york home first time an automobile traveled over trip took over a month after driving several days in rain two decided to install a roof on future models haynes began to have disagreements with apperson brothers for reasons that were never made public but were probably over money and design plans haynes wanted to produce luxury cars because much of company s early clientele was wealthy while wanted to produce utilitarian vehicles that could be marketed to businesses disagreement led two brothers to split from haynes and start a company of their own in 1902 loss of his partners necessitated that haynes leave his position at indiana gas to devote more time to his growing business haynes was most interested in working on development and turned over daily management to victor in 1903 haynes spent most of his research efforts developing metals in an attempt to discover lighter and stronger alloys for automobile parts he also investigated other areas and published a 1906 paper on impurities in gasoline and recommended that sulfur content in fuel be lowered to increase engine performance haynes automobile company in 1905 three years after apperson brothers split from haynes haynes apperson was renamed haynes automobile company and haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns a parade of 2 000 cars was organized in new york city during 1908 and haynes whom many recognized as inventor of american automobile led parade down broadway riding in pioneer he was followed by ten haynes cars a model from each year to display advancement in technology on his way to parade haynes was unaware of city s newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too fast in a car with a top speed of 15 mph 17 km h and taken to jail he was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning that he was elwood haynes and had come to lead parade celebration was intended to be a ten year commemoration of invention of automobile although earlier self vehicles dated back nearly twenty years in europe haynes donated pioneer to united states government in 1910 to be placed in smithsonian institution where it is still on display in national museum of american history as second oldest motorized vehicle in united states thumb upright left a 1919 haynes automobile company advertisement haynes model l was his most popular vehicle first designed in 1905 three speed car could travel at 35 mph 58 km h and carry four passengers company sold over 4 300 haynes expanded company significantly in 1908 to accommodate ever increasing sales more stock was issued and more capital raised to build a new and larger factory by 1909 company was producing 650 cars annually with models priced between 2 500 and 5 500 in 1910 haynes auto became first company to build a car with a roof windshield headlights and a speedometer as standard on each vehicle to continue their goal of producing best luxury vehicles more than 1 000 autos were built by haynes automobile company in 1910 and company continued to experience growth until a devastating fire swept company factory in 1911 and killed one employee recovery from blaze was slow and it was not until 1913 that company was able to resume its growth to continue promotion of his cars haynes organized a trip in which he crossed country by automobile in 1914 trip gained considerable attention from press and gave his company publicity and a much needed sales boost in wake of fire almost every town he visited printed newspaper stories on his invention and many hailed him as father of automobile haynes stellite company haynes continued his research into ways to produce corrosion resistant metals while working on alloys for use in spark plugs he created a metal he named stellite realizing value of his discovery he patented his first version in 1907 metal was very resistant to corrosion and had immediate application in tool making and numerous other implementations he continued to experiment with it until 1910 when he published his findings in a paper to international congress of applied chemistry and american institute of metals where he held memberships his final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on june 20 he applied for another patent on an alloy he called stainless steel now known as martensitic stainless steel patent office rejected his application saying that it was not a new alloy haynes conceded their point but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals and it was granted stainless steel at urging of his wife he created first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use first piece of stainless steel was forged by homer dan farmer in haynes laboratory it was a large meat knife and was donated to haynes museum by family of dan grandson of homer dan farmer in later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware british metallurgist harry brearley independently produced an identical alloy around same time and applied for an american patent and found that one already existed brearley had also created other innovations for metal but they were of little value without stainless steel patent he sought out haynes and two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce alloy haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to american stainless steel company a company brearley had created with assistance of investors in pennsylvania in exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until patent expired in 1930 stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among company s board of directors and he installed his son march to represent him income from transaction led haynes to begin accumulation of a large fortune seeing stellite as a far more valuable metal he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded haynes stellite company in kokomo to produce metal in september 1912 many of his initial requests for metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw alloy as best for surgical tools because his company could not produce enough of metal to satisfy demand haynes issued licenses to several companies in united states canada and europe to produce alloy and pay him royalties haynes strictly controlled production and did not permit other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form but to only sell it as specific finished products in that way he remained only vendor who could sell sheets of metal as world war i broke out his company received large government contracts for use of material stellite was found to have excellent applications in airplanes and because it was non corrosive and could protect its contents indefinitely it proved to be best metal available for ammunition casing in 1916 alone company registered 1 3 million in sales rapid growth of business made haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year despite his large income he refused to provide his employees a year end bonus causing a significant stir in factory when a foreman demanded to know reason that their wages were not raised he told him it doesn t pay to give working man too much money it makes him too independent his statement was widely repeated and although he claimed to have made it in jest it alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor problems after war haynes stellite moved to producing tableware jewelry and pocket knives employees of company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what haynes believed was fair threat of labor strikes and haynes desire to avoid problem led him to sell company to union carbide on april 10 1920 in exchange for 25 000 shares of union carbide stock valued at 2 million he later made an additional half million from dividends other details of deal were never made public and haynes may have made as much 4 million on sale after a series of owners company is now called haynes international and is again independent later life prohibition thumb upright right elwood haynes c 1919 haynes was an avid supporter of prohibition and spoke several times on behalf of prohibitionist leader frank hanly lending him both personal and financial support hanly advocated passage of a local option law that allowed most of indiana to ban liquor sales in 1909 he continued in his support of prohibition party and donated it thousands of dollars and an automobile nicknamed prohibition flyer he became increasingly involved in organization and in 1916 he ran for united states senate on prohibition ticket making many speeches and stumping across state he was overwhelmingly defeated receiving only 15 598 votes out of nearly one million cast harry stewart new republican candidate narrowly won election by plurality and haynes was accused of costing incumbent democratic senator john w kern s re election despite his personal electoral failure liquor sales were completely banned in indiana by a 1918 law that went into effect in 1919 with his goals achieved haynes switched to join republican party but was significantly less active in politics thereafter although haynes was a prohibitionist he was a critic of indiana branch of ku klux klan which was in height of its power during 1910s and 1920s in letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists he ridiculed organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti prohibition democratic politicians kokomo politics was dominated by klan during that period and it is unknown if haynes spoke publicly against organization philanthropy thumb right haynes kokomo home haynes purchased a new home on webster street in kokomo in 1915 home known as haynes mansion was large enough to house a personal laboratory for haynes to work in as he grew older and became less involved in his businesses haynes became increasingly philanthropic he made regular large donations to presbyterian church and became a patron of worcester institute he had attended providing scholarships and donating funds for expansion he funded formation of a young men s christian association in kokomo where he and his son became active haynes taught swimming classes and regularly took underprivileged young boys to movies and bought them dinners after several years of active membership at local level he was elected president of national ymca in 1919 and served two one year terms his primary focus during his tenure was launching of several successful membership drives in 1920 he was appointed to indiana state board of education by governor james p goodrich where he advocated increased state funding for vocational education united states economy went into a recession in early 1920s and automobile sales decreased coupled with increasing competition haynes automobile company began running into debt problems haynes had to use his personal savings to rescue company in 1921 and pay off some outstanding accounts a bond drive was launched to raise 1 million to help fund company through period but it fell significantly short of raising enough money haynes was primary purchaser of bonds unlike other large auto companies like ford and general motors haynes auto did not have widespread dealership agreements that were able to sustain their companies through hard times his company relied on customer s ordering directly from factory haynes auto sales quickly began to slip from a peak of nearly 6 000 cars sold in 1922 in 1923 sales dropped to 4 300 and 1 500 in 1924 situation continued to be bleak for company and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in october 1924 haynes sought a merger with multiple other auto companies including henry ford but partners were not forthcoming and haynes was forced to agree to a liquidation in 1925 he was held personally responsible for about 95 000 of company s debt in addition he lost 335 700 in stock he held in company and a substantial amount in investment bonds in total loss cost haynes an estimated quarter of his net worth death and legacy on january 6 1925 haynes apperson brothers and other automotive pioneers were awarded gold medals by national automobile chamber of commerce at a new york city auto exhibition for their contributions to industry on his return trip home he contracted influenza and his health began to deteriorate rapidly in march he asked his son to take over his business interests while he traveled to florida to seek rest in warmer climate his condition steadily worsened causing him to cancel his planned trip to cuba and return to kokomo he remained in his home attended by his personal physician and a nurse until his death from congestive heart failure on april 13 1925 haynes funeral was held in kokomo before his interment at city s memorial park cemetery haynes fortune had shrunk considerably with collapse of his auto company he still held an estimated 2 85 million 35 million in 2009 chained dollars in stocks bonds and other assets but almost all of his cash savings were gone he had already been forced to borrow money using future dividends and royalties as collateral leaving his family with some difficulty in coming up with funds to maintain his home haynes estate was left to his wife who continued to live in family mansion until her own death from a stroke in august 1933 family assets were distributed between bernice and march who separately oversaw their portion of family s interests march inherited family mansion but sold it in 1957 to martin j caserio general manager of delco electronics division of general motors company who lived there until he was transferred to detroit in 1964 general motors purchased house from caserio at that time so that he could purchase a home in detroit gm maintained ownership for about a year it was vacant and then sold mansion in 1965 to bernice who donated it to city of kokomo city converted it into elwood haynes museum and it has been open to public since 1967 in january 1944 ss elwood haynes a liberty ship built during world war ii was named in haynes honor haynes is remembered as a pioneer of american automobile and as creator of first automobile design viable for mass production he is credited as being one of those primarily responsible for rapid growth of natural gas industry in indiana a boom that made northern indiana one of leading industrial regions of united states he is also remembered for his development of stainless steel and stellite materials that are commonly used across world today stellite remains an important metal as its ability to withstand high temperatures has made it a component in american spacecraft in july 2015 he was inducted into 75th class of automotive hall of fame in detroit michigan haynes is grandfather of margaret hillis founder and director of chicago symphony chorus and elwood hillis an eight term congressman representing indiana s 5th district see also
