what remained of season and was sent off in first of those speculation regarding moves to premier league came to nothing by october zigic had appeared just once for valencia in uefa cup and an opportunity arose to join his former club racing santander on an emergency loan this depended on league allowing racing to release luis fernandez on medical grounds because of a degenerative condition

strengths because of niggling hip and groin injuries he made only two more substitute appearances his absence deprived team of what birmingham mails reporter called their most effective style getting ball forward early pressing up pitch and playing off him as they were relegated to championship despite his agent milan s insistence that his client would not be playing in lower divisions zigic underwent groin surgery in close season and resumed his birmingham career in september he told mail that he would be happy to stay and that any move would depend on club which was in increasing

minutes to produce a 94th minute equaliser at home to charlton athletic on opening day and was used more as substitute than starter by new manager lee clark who preferred peter or leroy lita on eve of january transfer window chief executive peter pannu confirmed that player sales were necessary to stave off risk of administration even if club could raise as much as ps6m from sale of england goalkeeper jack butland zigic s wages were more than club could afford and player needed to go out and showcase himself club had failed to include a clause in his contract to reduce his wages in event of relegation and it emerged later that they had agreed to substantial annual increments he did not leave and in february clark publicly criticised him for producing possibly worst training session in terms of a professional footballer i have ever come across despite knowing he was due to start upcoming game against watford up until this incident he had scored six league goals at a rate of one every 165 minutes and been sent off twice clark said that zigic would not be involved against watford but that it was in his hands as to whether he would prepare properly for sheffield wednesday

results to favour them to avoid relegation to league one two goals down with 12 minutes left zigic scored and three minutes into stoppage time his close range header was cleared off line to paul caddis who headed home to preserve birmingham s second tier status birmingham were reported to be quietly confident of retaining his services for another season at a much reduced salary especially as he was believed to be keen on applying for british citizenship which required five years residence but he left at end of his contract he was last remaining member of league cup winning team having been without a club since his departure zigic began training with birmingham again in november 2014 after a successful appeal to be granted a work permit for which he did not qualify automatically he signed a contract on 4 december to expire at end of season he made his second debut as a late substitute in championship match at home to reading on 13 december with birmingham already 6 1 ahead he played only infrequently nine substitute appearances in league and two fa cup matches and club confirmed he would be released when his contract expired international career coach ilija petkovic gave zigic his international debut for serbia and montenegro on 31 march 2004 as an 84th minute substitute in a 1 0 friendly defeat against norway in belgrade his next appearance and first start came some 14 months later in a friendly against italy in canada he ran onto a through ball and went round goalkeeper to open scoring and also hit post in a 1 1 draw he also scored in his next match against poland in another friendly and established himself as a regular selection but it was his substitute appearance in a crucial world cup qualifier against spain in madrid in september 2005 that brought him wider international recognition after a poor first half petkovic said they were lucky to be only a goal down at half time zigic was introduced and tactic of putting him in centre of opposition defence and playing long high balls to him was remarkably successful he pressured goalkeeper into missing a cross which dropped for dejan stankovic to set up kezman s equaliser and 12 minutes later his pass left kezman clear on goal but he mis hit what might have been a winning shot result left serbia montenegro top of group and they confirmed their qualification at home to bosnia and herzegovina when zigic s assist gave kezman a tap in for only goal of game zigic s only start at 2006 world cup came in last fixture when his team had already been eliminated after losing first two group matches he scored early in first half off a long ball from stankovic against ivory coast goal was serbia montenegro s first of tournament but match ended in a 3 2 defeat still an automatic choice under new national manager javier clemente zigic scored only goal in serbia s first competitive match as a separate country a euro 2008 qualifier at home to azerbaijan in september 2006 he scored once missed two more good chances and was then sent off for elbowing an opponent in stoppage time of march 2007 qualifying defeat in kazakhstan so missed next a home draw with portugal and also missed finland fixture in june after surgery on a facial injury he still scored seven goals as serbia failed to qualify zigic played regularly through 2010 world cup qualifying campaign under management of radomir antic contributing three goals and partnering former red star teammate marko pantelic as serbia qualified for a major tournament for first time as an independent nation ahead of tournament proper he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006 i went to germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of tactically i have learned a lot and i m in much better condition both physically and psychologically this is my world cup i think i can play a lead role and i want to show i m a player that can do it in big games after losing to ghana in opening group match serbia went on to face germany within two minutes of miroslav klose s first half dismissal zigic headed a cross down to milan jovanovic who scored what proved to be only goal of game lukas podolski s second half penalty was saved and antic dedicated victory to serbian people in a game of missed chances against australia serbia lost 2 1 and finished bottom of group goals in four of serbia s five internationals in latter part of 2010 brought his total to 20 he was not selected to start other match a euro 2012 qualifier in italy that was abandoned after six minutes because of crowd trouble uefa awarded match to hosts as a 3 0 win after serbia failed to qualify for tournament both stankovic and nemanja vidic retired from international football and zigic was appointed captain of national team he captained team in friendly defeats to mexico and honduras in 2011 his 56th and 57th appearances for his country which proved to be his last style of play zigic s extreme height predisposes him to an aerial game he is dangerous from set pieces scoring many headed goals and knocking ball down for others when he joined red star coach set out team in a 4 3 3 formation with zigic at centre forward and two wingers to feed those strengths he tried to use his physical presence to disrupt opposing defences both for his own benefit and to draw their attentions away from others pep guardiola said in 2009 that zigic was not easy to defend against almost unstoppable in air but best way would be to keep him as far as possible away from penalty area speaking in 2010 radovan then assistant manager of serbia national team described him as king of air play he is finest there is in europe he possesses sense of space and movement without ball and can assist his teammates with headers and set up goal scoring opportunities as exemplified on his debut for racing a performance in which he demonstrated his aerial power he is capable of playing with his back to goal and his height was not incompatible with agility he prefers to play not as a lone striker but in partnership with a shorter speedier teammate racing s fitness coach javier was surprised that zigic was well coordinated to extent that he doesn t seem so tall when i see him in training he prefers to receive ball in air because he can always beat smaller players in air but they can take advantage of better acceleration and quicker reactions on ground according to david pleat a major factor in birmingham s 2011 league cup win was telling him to do what he does best and flick ball on with his head from direct diagonal balls played from both wings nevertheless he is technically competent scoring goals with his feet and providing assists for others a 2009 feature in mundo deportivo assessed zigic as one of those few tall players with a good touch on ball and in 2010 german international defender per mertesacker described him as technically a good player and very smart tactically
