indian head gold pieces or pratt bigelow gold coins were two separate coin series identical in design struck by united states mint a two and a half dollar piece or quarter eagle and a five dollar coin or half eagle quarter eagle was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925 1929 half eagle was struck from 1908 to 1916 and in 1929 pieces remain only us circulating coins with recessed designs these coins were last of their denominations to be struck for circulation ending series that began in 1790s president theodore roosevelt from 1904 vigorously advocated new designs for united states coins and had mint engage his friend sculptor augustus saint gaudens to design five coins four gold pieces and cent that could be changed without congressional authorization before his death in august 1907 saint gaudens completed designs for eagle 10 piece and double eagle although both required subsequent work to make them fully suitable for coining with eagle and double eagle released into circulation by end of 1907 mint turned its attention to half eagle and quarter eagle originally planning to duplicate double eagle s design mint had difficulty fitting required inscriptions on small gold coins president roosevelt in april 1908 convinced mint director frank leach that it would be a better idea to strike a design similar to that of eagle but below background to secure a high relief effect such coins were designed by boston sculptor bela lyon pratt at request of president s friend william sturgis bigelow after some difficulty mint was successful in this work though pratt was unhappy at modifications made by mint s engravers headed by longtime chief engraver charles e barber two pieces were struck until world war i caused gold to vanish from circulation and then again in late 1920s neither coin circulated much quarter eagle saw popularity as a christmas present in 1933 president franklin roosevelt stopped issuance of gold in coin form and recalled many pieces which were in private or bank hands inception in 1904 us president theodore roosevelt complained about artistic quality of american coinage to his secretary of treasury leslie mortier shaw and asked if it were possible to hire a private sculptor such as president s friend augustus saint gaudens to give modern artistic designs to us coins at roosevelt s instigation shaw had mint part of department of treasury hire saint gaudens to redesign five denominations of us coinage that could be changed without an act of congress cent and four gold pieces quarter eagle half eagle eagle and double eagle by mint act of 1792 an eagle was made equivalent to ten dollars mint officials originally assumed that whatever design was selected for double eagle would simply be scaled down for three lower denominations in may 1907 however president roosevelt decided that eagle and double eagle would bear very different designs a departure from past practice in august month of saint gaudens death from cancer outgoing mint director george e roberts wrote no instructions have been received from president as to half and quarter eagle but i expected that eagle design would be used upon them after considerable difficulties mint issued eagle and double eagle based on saint gaudens designs later that year eagle featured liberty wearing an indian headdress on obverse and a perched bald eagle on reverse double eagle featured liberty striding forward on obverse and a flying eagle on reverse due to difficulties with two larger coins little attention was given to half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907 on november 28 1907 treasury secretary george cortelyou wrote in a letter that double eagle design was to be used for two small gold pieces on december 2 mint director frank leach instructed philadelphia mint to prepare coinage dies for small pieces using double eagle design chief engraver charles e barber replied a week later that it would be difficult to put all legends that were required by law on new pieces such as name of country on double eagle e pluribus unum is placed on edge an impractical setting on pieces about size of nickel and dime philadelphia mint superintendent john landis forwarded barber s letter to leach with his own note stating i know it will be difficult to put inscription e pluribus unum on periphery of a quarter eagle but i do not see where else it can go and we must try to do it barber was assigned task of solving these difficulties he planned to use his low relief version of saint gaudens double eagle design but he made slow progress on assignment leach wrote to saint gaudens attorney to ask if sculptor s assistant henry hering could do work hering was willing and asked for enlarged models of double eagle designs barber opposed bringing in outsiders citing delays in preparation of earlier gold coin designs which he attributed to saint gaudens studio it is entirely unnecessary to trouble mr hering any further unless another year is to be wasted in vain endeavor on january 3 1908 leach wrote to hering to inform him that all work would be done by mint innovation president s friend dr william sturgis bigelow had been in japan for most of 1907 on his return to his boston home he heard about saint gaudens coinage from senator henry cabot lodge bigelow was one of a number of roosevelt s friends given early specimens of double eagle he wrote to president on january 8 1908 praising saint gaudens coins and stating that he was working with a boston sculptor bela pratt on an idea that would allow coins to be struck in high relief pieces struck in this manner would have designs protected from wear and be able to stack easily both problems with high relief coins president responded to express his interest on january 10 and pratt was soon busy on a model for him to examine roosevelt did not then tell mint of new proposal thumb 240px left bela pratt s plaster models for half eagle newly released eagle and double eagle had provoked considerable controversy over their omission of motto in god we trust and with congress already preparing to require motto s use leach ordered work suspended on half and quarter eagle on january 18 mint had not expected to have to put in god we trust on small coins of double eagle design on which it was already having trouble finding space for other required legends on assumption bill would succeed leach had barber continue with his work and at least one pattern half eagle was struck on february 26 for leach to show president pratt completed plaster models for coin using obverse design for ten dollar piece as basis but using a photograph of an unknown male indian from his photo collection rather than saint gaudens female liberty he displayed one model in his connecticut studio and sent another to bigelow for presentation to president next time two friends met roosevelt and bigelow had lunch with mint director leach on april 3 president was enthusiastic about proposed coin leach recalled in his memoirs thumb 240px indian head eagle designed by saint gaudens was basis for designs for smaller gold pieces thumb 240px left examples of indian head gold pieces grouped with modern coins for size comparison purposes as a result of white house lunch meeting leach agreed to abandon idea that double eagle design be used for small gold pieces and to cooperate with bigelow and pratt in making of new coins leach even undertook to reimburse pratt s fee of 300 to bigelow from government funds president wanted to see saint gaudens standing eagle from ten dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for smaller pieces and if it did not constitute a change of design used on ten dollar piece as well a project that did not go beyond talking stage bigelow wrote to pratt on may 1 after conferring with leach stating that mint director would likely not object if pratt were to improve saint gaudens standing eagle but i would not if i were you get too far from original as president likes it perhaps you can make him like it better dies had been cut for saint gaudens half eagle causing leach to ask for a legal opinion on whether that constituted a change of design if it did no further change could be made for 25 years without an act of congress opinion must have been satisfactory as roosevelt approved pratt s obverse design in mid may subject to minor changes requested by mint leach decided that both mint and pratt would make versions of standing eagle reverse pratt s was adopted pratt sent models and casts to mint on june 29 barber did not make master dies based on pratt s work until he returned from his august vacation at ocean grove new jersey experimental pieces to a total face value of 75 likely ten half eagles and ten quarter eagles were sent to leach in washington from philadelphia mint on september 21 leach showed pieces to president who kept a half eagle and gave it to bigelow as leach had worked against practices that allowed pattern coins to leave mint coin sent to bigelow may have been only pattern not to be melted present location of coin is not known no pattern coins of indian head gold pieces are presently known to exist leach approved designs subject to some improvements which barber wanted to make mint director wrote to superintendent landis on september 26 after production of new coins began bigelow received one of each he showed them to pratt who wrote to his mother they have knocked spots out of my design at mint they let their die cutter spoil it which he did most thoroughly but they tried to retouch it and gee they made a mess of it with a few deft strokes butcher or blacksmith barber who is at head of things there changed it from a thing that i was proud of to one of which i am ashamed design thumb 240px saint gaudens double eagle design which mint hoped to modify for smaller gold coins half eagle and quarter eagle are identical in design and are unique in american coinage in having engraved as opposed to bas relief designs obverse features head of a native american man wearing a headdress and facing left designer s initials are found just above date reverse features a standing eagle on a bunch of arrows its left talon holding an olive branch in place mint mark is found to left of arrowheads although saint gaudens design for eagle had featured liberty in an indian style headdress no attempt was made to make her features appear to be native american according to numismatist mike in his book on early 20th century american gold coinage obverse of eagle had featured lady liberty topped with a fanciful head covering designed to look like an indian headdress until saint gaudens and pratt s pieces were struck only mint chief engraver james longacre had attempted to depict indians on us circulating coinage in 1850s with his indian head cent and indian princess designs for gold dollar and three dollar pieces after pratt only james earle fraser s depiction of an indian in 1913 on buffalo nickel would appear until 2000 arrival of sacagawea dollar art historian cornelius vermeule in 1970 dismissed complaints made at time of issuance that indian was too thin indian is far from emaciated and coins show more imagination and daring of design than almost any other issue in american history pratt deserves to be admired for his medals and coins vermeule suggests that pratt s design marked a transition in emaciated indian at least to naturalism breen suggests sunken surfaces were similar to those on coins from egypt s fourth dynasty under mint act of 1792 obverse was to bear an impression emblematic of liberty he notes that a native american on obverse was particularly appropriate for after all indians were free peoples before white man s laws made them third class citizens and suggests that pratt s eagle before it was modified by barber was worthy of j j audubon production circulation and collecting thumb 200px mint director frank a leach thought well of new coins despite controversy dies for half eagle were sent to mints in denver and san francisco both western mints reported difficulties in striking new pieces landis wrote to his counterparts at other mints advising them that planchets or blanks needed to be shaved very slightly to strike properly new coins proved to be thinner than earlier coins of their denomination due to field being raised above design this meant that automated sorting machines could not reliably sort them when mixed with earlier coins new gold pieces entered circulation in early november 1908 attracting some negative comment philadelphia numismatist samuel chapman wrote to roosevelt in early december to criticize new coins indentations in new coins would harbor dirt and germs chapman argued coins could be easily counterfeited by carving a disc of metal they could not adequately stack and they were in any event not handsome with indian emaciated according to numismatic historian roger burdette chapman s letter caused some consternation at white house president prepared a reply in which he expressed himself strongly to chapman but bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over bigelow s signature defending new coins bigelow s letter replied to chapman s complaint about indian answer to this is that head was taken from a recent photograph of an indian whose health was excellent perhaps mr chapman has in mind fatter but less characteristic type of indian sometimes seen on reservations chapman wrote again and had correspondence published in numismatic press but no one at lame duck roosevelt white house bothered to reply according to burdette new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty five years or until congress ordered them changed leach wrote to bigelow on january 2 1909 i was somewhat amused by their savage attack and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism however i am pleased to say that adverse criticism of coins is an exception i feel very well pleased with result both half and quarter eagle were struck each year through 1915 while hard money circulated in quantity in west in east banknotes were much more common a common use of small gold pieces was as christmas presents pieces would be produced at various mints late in year be purchased from banks in december and return to vaults by late january establishment of federal reserve system in 1913 increased circulation of banknotes and mint ceased to strike quarter eagles after 1915 and half eagles after 1916 an additional factor was economic unrest caused by world war i causing gold prices to rise and coins made of that metal to vanish from circulation after war gold did not return to circulation and most gold coins struck were double eagles used for international transactions and backing for gold certificates quarter eagle remained popular as a christmas gift but did not initially come back into production as treasury held stocks of pieces from prewar years this surplus was slow to dissipate as gift givers preferred older liberty head quarter eagle that had been struck until 1908 with liberty head pieces becoming rarer and acquiring a premium above face value quarter eagle was finally struck again in 1925 principally to be given as presents 1925 quarter eagle was struck only at denver and it was then struck from 1926 to 1929 only at philadelphia with economic collapse which started depression quarter eagle was not called for in commerce and mint halted production thumb left mint mark is located to left of arrowhead half eagle was not struck again until 1929 at philadelphia coins of that date have a rarity not reflected in mintage of 668 000 as few entered commerce gold coins not released were melted in mid 1930s along with those recalled from banks and private holders after president franklin roosevelt ended issuance of gold coins in 1933 roosevelt s actions put an end to
