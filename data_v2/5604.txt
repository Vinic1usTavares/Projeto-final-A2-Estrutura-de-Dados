gliese 581 is a star of spectral type m3v a red dwarf at center of gliese 581 planetary system about 20 light years away from earth in libra constellation its estimated mass is about a third of that of sun and it is 89th closest known star to sun history of observations gliese 581 is known at least from 1886 when it was included in eduard schonfeld s southern sd fourth part of corresponding designation is bd 7 4003 characteristics name gliese 581 refers to catalog number from 1957 survey gliese catalogue of nearby stars of 965 stars located within 20 parsecs of earth other names of this star include bd 4003 bd catalogue first known publication and ho librae variable star designation it does not have an individual name such as sirius or procyon star is a red dwarf with spectral type m3v located 20 4 light years away from earth it is located about two degrees north of beta librae brightest star in libra constellation its mass is estimated to be approximately a third that of sun and it is 89th closest known star system to sun an m class dwarf star such as gliese 581 has a much lower mass than sun causing core region of star to fuse hydrogen at a significantly lower rate from apparent magnitude and distance astronomers have estimated an effective temperature of 3200 k and a visual luminosity of 0 2 of that of sun however a red dwarf such as gliese 581 radiates primarily in near infrared with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm estimated using wien s displacement law which assumes star radiates as a black body so such an estimate will underestimate star s total luminosity for comparison peak emission of sun is roughly 530 nm in middle of visible part of spectrum when radiation over entire spectrum is taken into account not just part that humans are able to see something known as bolometric correction this star has a bolometric luminosity 1 3 of sun s total luminosity a planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as earth region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly same energy as earth is sometimes termed goldilocks zone or more prosaically habitable zone extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system gliese 581 is a very old star its slow rotation makes it very inactive making it better suited than most red dwarfs for having habitable planets gliese 581 is classified as a variable star of by draconis type and has been given variable star designation ho librae this is a star that exhibits variability because of presence of star spots combined with rotation of star however measured variability is close to margin of error and if real is most likely a long term variability its brightness is stable to 1 gliese 581 emits x rays planets see also habitability of red dwarf systems list of extrasolar planets gliese 876 notes references external links major discovery new planet could harbor water and life space com gliese 581 ho librae solstation com extrasolar planets encyclopaedia gl 581 gliese 581 seti range calculator all wet astronomers claim discovery of earth like planet scientific american position of gliese 581 marked on local space top right corner photo of constellation libra with gliese 581 artist conceptions of planets of gliese 581 speculation about geology geochemistry of gliese 581c geochemical society computer models suggest planetary and extrasolar planet atmospheres a gas gas gas washington university in st louis extrasolar planet interactions by rory barnes richard greenberg lunar and planetary lab university of arizona earth like planet found that may support life ctv ca gliese 581 red dwarf and implications for its earthlike planet gliese 581c earth s twin discovered category m type main sequence stars category by draconis variables librae ho category durchmusterung objects category libra constellation
