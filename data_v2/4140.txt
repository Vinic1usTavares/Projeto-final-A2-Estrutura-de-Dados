joined band he said he had just been filling in for last fifteen years moon s arrival in who changed dynamics of group sandom had generally been peacemaker as daltrey and townshend feuded between themselves but because of moon s temperament group now had four members frequently in conflict we used to fight regularly remembered moon in later years john entwistle and i used to have fights it wasn t very serious it was more of an emotional spur of moment thing moon also clashed with daltrey and townshend we really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music he said in a later interview although townshend described him as a completely different person to anyone i ve ever met pair had a rapport in early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy moon s drumming style affected band s musical structure although entwistle initially found moon s lack of conventional timekeeping problematic it created an original sound moon was particularly fond of touring since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates and was generally restless and bored when not playing live this later carried over to other aspects of his life as he acted them out according to journalist and who biographer dave marsh as if his life were one long tour these antics earned him nickname moon loon musical contributions moon s style of drumming was considered unique by his bandmates although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating entwistle noted that he tended to play faster or slower according to his mood he wouldn t play across his kit he later added he d play zig zag that s why he had two sets of tom toms he d move his arms forward like a skier daltrey said that moon just instinctively put drum fills in places that other people would never have thought of putting them who biographer john atkins wrote that group s early test sessions for pye records in 1964 show that they seemed to have understood just how important was moon s contribution contemporary critics questioned his ability to keep time with biographer tony fletcher suggesting that timing on tommy was all over place who producer jon astley said you didn t think he was keeping time but he was early recordings of moon s drumming sound tinny and disorganised it was not until recording of who s next with glyn johns no nonsense production techniques and need to keep time to a synthesizer track that he began developing more discipline in studio fletcher considers drumming on this album to be best of moon s career unlike contemporary rock drummers such as ginger baker and john bonham moon hated drum solos and refused to play them in concert at a madison square garden show on 10 june 1974 townshend and entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during

singing and wanted to sing lead with rest of group while other three members handled most of onstage vocals moon would attempt to sing backup particularly on i can t explain he provided humorous commentary during song announcements although sound engineer bob pridden preferred to mute his vocal microphone on mixing desk whenever possible moon s knack for making his bandmates laugh around microphone led them to banish him from studio when vocals were being recorded this led to a game in which moon would sneak in to join singing at end of happy jack townshend can be heard saying i saw ya to moon as he tries to sneak into studio drummer s interest in surf music and his desire to sing lead spawned lead vocals on several early tracks including bucket t and barbara ann ready steady who ep 1966 and high backing vocals on other songs such as pictures of lily moon s performance on bell boy quadrophenia 1973 saw him abandon serious vocal performances to sing in character which gave him in fletcher s words full licence to live up to his reputation as a lecherous drunk it was exactly kind of performance who needed from him to bring them back down to earth moon composed i need you
