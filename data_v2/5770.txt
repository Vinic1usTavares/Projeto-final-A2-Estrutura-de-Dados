xerocomellus zelleri commonly known as zeller s bolete is an edible species of mushroom in family boletaceae first described scientifically by american mycologist william alphonso murrill in 1912 species has been juggled by various authors to several genera including boletus boletellus and xerocomus found solely in western north america from british columbia south to mexico fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with uneven surfaces yellow pores on underside of caps and red streaked yellow stems fungus grows in summer and autumn on ground often in douglas fir forests or on their margins development of fruit bodies is gymnocarpic meaning that hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state not enclosed by any protective membrane taxonomy xerocomellus zelleri was first described by american mycologist william alphonso murrill in 1912 based on specimens he found on campus of university of washington murrill named it ceriomyces zelleri before switching genus later that year to boletus in 1944 walter henry snell thought taxon would be more appropriate in genus xerocomus in 1959 mycologists rolf singer snell and esther a dick transferred species to boletellus explaining that microstructure of trama and faint ornamentation of spores were inconsistent with placement in xerocomus american mycologist harry d thiers in his 1976 monograph on north american boletes claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on spores of material he collected and preferred to retain species in boletus in 2011 it was moved to genus xerocomellus specific epithet zelleri was chosen by murrill to honor professor sanford myron zeller mycologist at oregon state university zeller accompanied murrill in his seattle expedition and discovered first specimens of mushroom description cap is typically between in diameter initially convex but flattening somewhat in maturity it is fleshy with an uneven velvety surface and dark brown to nearly black margin of cap is a pale cream color young specimens are covered by a grayish bloom thumb left yellow to dirty yellow flesh inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken tubes that comprise undersurface of cap hymenium are up to long and angular yellow becoming dirty yellow and finally greenish yellow there are 1 2 pores per millimeter on hymenium surface they do not change color when bruised although they may turn slightly brownish when exposed to air for a time flesh is yellow to dirty yellow up to thick and inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken stem is up to tall thick and swollen toward base stem surface is red or yellowish with red lines often white or yellow at base and solid that is not hollow with fibrous flesh in maturity stem ages to yellowish red to dark red spore print is olive brown one source notes that creating a spore print may result in a lot of yellow juice on paper spores are ellipsoid in shape smooth and have dimensions of 12 16 by 4 6 um although occasionally there will be some giant spores with lengths of up to 24 um basidia spore bearing cells are 26 35 by 9 5 12 um and four spored cystidia are roughly cylindrical and thin walled with dimensions of 38 77 by 5 5 14 8 um there are no clamp connections present in hyphae fruit body tissue stains a greenish color when a drop of ammonia solution is applied zelleri is an edible species although care should be taken to ensure that specimens collected for consumption are free of fly larvae in his book 100 edible mushrooms michael kuo gave mushroom an edibility rating of mediocre there is no distinguishable odor and taste is alternately described as pleasant mild or slightly acidic original species description noted that texture was slightly mucilaginous mushroom is suitable for preserving or drying or as a filler to add bulk to a dish it is harvested and sold commercially in local markets in british columbia canada similar species red cracked bolete xerocomellus has an olive brown cap that cracks exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red boletellus found only in eastern north america has a velvety to smooth dark reddish brown cracked cap with pale exposed flesh fruit body development thumb right a collection from banner forest kitsap county washington usa in 1914 zeller published a study of development of mushroom made possible by prolific fruiting of fungus in seattle in fall of 1912 development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development and differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains growth form of xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic meaning that hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state not enclosed by any protective membrane in this type of development cap is formed from hyphae at top of stem and subsequently expands by growth along margins hymenium forms later beneath cap in a direction away from center mushrooms originate as minute fruit bodies called pins due to their shape from a yellow mycelium that forms a mat and tends to engulf pine needles pins typically 1 2 mm in diameter lengthen vertically until they are roughly three or four times longer than they are thick until this point fruit body is a homogenous mass of tissue it differentiates simultaneously into cap and stem along a cleavage plane an axis along which any cell division occurs from outside inward which gives rise to deep furrow encircling fruit body hymenium is formed in roof of this furrow growing inward and upward from outside edge cap develops from upper section of this division stem from lower habitat and distribution thumb left in lincoln county oregon this species grows solitarily or in small groups on ground or in forest duff in mature coniferous forests occasionally abundant on grassy edges of forest rarely on badly decayed conifer logs it is an ectomycorrhizal mushroom meaning that fungal hyphae form sheaths around rootlets of certain trees exchanging nutrients with them in a mutualistic relationship fungus associates with alder poplar and other hardwoods and has been shown in laboratory culture to form ectomycorrhizae with western hemlock tsuga heterophylla however fungus may have saprobic tendencies as it has been noted to grow under california redwood sometimes in rotted wood of old trunks a tree not known to form it is known to form long rhizomorphs aggregations of hyphae that resemble roots and has been noted to be more abundant in sites with buried wood than without in british columbia it occurs from summer to early winter although it also appears infrequently in early spring in california mushroom often fruits after rainy period in autumn through to march or april dark coloring of cap make this species difficult to notice unless a glimpse of yellow hymenium is obtained fruit bodies are eaten by american shrew mole xerocomellus zelleri is distributed in north america in pacific northwest south to california and mexico in mexico it has been reported in high altitude cloud forests of mexican beech fagus mexicana a rare and endangered habitat it has also been reported from tibet but this may be based on a misidentification zelleri has been shown to contain phenethylamine alkaloid compounds n and although significance of this is not clear see also list of north american boletes references
