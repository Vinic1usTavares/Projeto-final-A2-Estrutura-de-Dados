andrea doria class usually called caio duilio class in italian sources was a pair of dreadnought battleships built for royal italian navy regia marina between 1912 and 1916 two ships andrea doria and caio duilio were completed during world war i class was an incremental improvement over preceding like earlier ships andrea doria and caio duilio were armed with a main battery of thirteen guns two ships were based in southern italy during world war i to help ensure that austro hungarian navy s surface fleet would be contained in adriatic neither vessel saw any combat during conflict after war they cruised mediterranean and were involved in several international incidents including at corfu in 1923 in 1933 both ships were placed in reserve in 1937 ships began a lengthy reconstruction modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring out rest of guns to strengthening their armor protection installing new boilers and steam turbines and lengthening their hulls reconstruction work lasted until 1940 by which time italy was already engaged in world war ii two ships were moored in taranto on night of 11 12 november 1940 when british launched a carrier strike on italian fleet in resulting battle of taranto caio duilio was hit by a torpedo and forced to beach to avoid sinking andrea doria was undamaged in raid repairs for caio duilio lasted until may 1941 both ships escorted convoys to north africa in late 1941 including operation m42 where andrea doria saw action at inconclusive first battle of sirte on 17 december fuel shortages curtailed further activities in 1942 and 1943 and both ships were interned at malta following italy s surrender in september 1943 italy was permitted to retain both battleships after war and they alternated as fleet flagship until early 1950s when they were removed from active service both ships were scrapped after 1956 design and description thumb left right elevation and deck plan as depicted in brassey s naval annual 1923 andrea doria class ships were designed by naval architect vice admiral generale del genio navale giuseppe valsecchi and were ordered in response to french plans to build s design of preceding s was generally satisfactory and was adopted with some minor changes these mostly concerned reduction of superstructure by shortening forecastle deck consequent lowering of amidships gun turret and upgrading of secondary armament to sixteen guns in lieu of eighteen guns of older ships giorgerini p 278 general characteristics ships of andrea doria class were long at waterline and overall they had a beam of and a draft of they displaced at normal load and at deep load gardiner gray p 260 they were provided with a complete double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse bulkheads ships had two rudders both on centerline they had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men giorgerini pp 270 272 propulsion ships were fitted with three parsons steam turbine sets arranged in three engine rooms center engine room housed one set of turbines that drove two inner propeller shafts it was flanked by compartments on either side each housing one turbine set powering outer shafts steam for turbines was provided by 20 yarrow boilers 8 of which burned oil and 12 of which burned coal sprayed with oil designed to reach a maximum speed of from neither of ships reached this goal on their sea trials only achieving speeds of ships could store a maximum of of coal and of fuel oil that gave them a range of at giorgerini pp 272 73 278 armament as built ships main armament comprised thirteen 46 caliber 305 millimeter guns preston p 179 designed by armstrong whitworth and vickers friedman p 234 in five gun turrets turrets were all on centerline with a twin gun turret superfiring over a triple gun turret in fore and aft pairs and a third triple turret amidships designated a b q x and y from front to rear turrets had an elevation capability of 5 to 20 degrees and ships could carry 88 rounds for each gun sources disagree regarding these guns performance but naval historian giorgio giorgerini says that they fired armor piercing ap projectiles at rate of one round per minute and that they had a muzzle velocity of which gave a maximum range of giorgerini pp 268 276 278 secondary armament on two ships consisted of sixteen 45 caliber guns also designed by armstrong whitworth friedman p 240 mounted in casemates on sides of hull underneath main guns their positions tended to be wet in heavy seas especially rear guns these guns could depress to 5 degrees and had a maximum elevation of 20 degrees they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute they could fire a high explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of ships carried 3 440 rounds for them for defense against torpedo boats ships carried nineteen 50 caliber guns they could be mounted in 39 different positions including on turret roofs and upper decks these guns had same range of elevation as secondary guns and their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute they fired a ap projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of ships were also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes one on each broadside and third in stern giorgerini pp 268 277 78 armor andrea doria class ships had a complete waterline armor belt with a maximum thickness of that reduced to towards stern and towards bow whitley p 162 above main belt was a strake of armor thick that extended up to lower edge of main deck above this strake was a thinner one 130 millimeters thick that protected casemates ships had two armored decks main deck was thick in two layers on flat that increased to on slopes that connected it to main belt second deck was thick also in two layers fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected belt to decks giorgerini p 271 frontal protection of gun turrets was in thickness with thick sides and an roof and rear their barbettes had armor above deck that reduced to between forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below upper deck forward conning tower had walls thick those of aft conning tower were thick modifications and reconstruction thumb andrea doria in 1943 during world war i a pair of 50 caliber 76 millimeter guns on high angle mounts were fitted as anti aircraft aa guns one gun at bow and other on top of x turret in 1925 number of low angle 50 caliber 76 millimeter guns was reduced to 13 all mounted on turret tops and six new 40 caliber 76 millimeter guns were installed abreast aft funnel two license built 2 pounder aa guns were also fitted in 1926 rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on port side of forecastle for a macchi m 18 seaplane whitley p 164 by early 1930s regia marina had begun design work on new s but it recognized that they would not be complete for some time as a stop gap measure in response to new french s navy decided to modernize its old battleships work on two surviving conte di began in 1933 and two andrea dorias followed in 1937 garzke dulin p 379 work lasted until july 1940 for duilio and october 1940 for andrea doria existing bow was dismantled and a new longer bow section was built which increased their overall length by to on cavour class new bow had been grafted over existing one instead their beam increased to whitley pp 162 164 and their draft at deep load increased to brescia p 62 changes made during their reconstruction increased their displacement to for andrea doria and for duilio at deep load ships crews increased to 70 officers and 1 450 enlisted men two of propeller shafts were removed and existing turbines were replaced by two sets of belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at boilers were replaced by eight superheated yarrow boilers on their sea trials ships reached a speed of although their maximum speed was about in service ships now carried of fuel oil which provided them with a range of at a speed of center turret and torpedo tubes were removed and all of existing secondary armament and aa guns were replaced by a dozen guns in four triple gun turrets and ten aa guns in single turrets in addition ships were fitted with fifteen 54 caliber breda light aa guns in six twin gun and three single mounts and sixteen breda model 35 aa guns also in twin mounts 305 millimeter guns were bored out to 320 millimeters 12 6 in and their turrets were modified to use electric power they had a fixed loading angle of 12 degrees but there is uncertainty on their new maximum elevation with some sources citing a maximum value of 27 degrees whitley pp 158 164 65 while others claim one of 30 degrees campbell p 324 320 millimeter ap shells weighed and had a maximum range of with a muzzle velocity of campbell p 322 in early 1942 rearmost 20 millimeter mounts were replaced by twin 37 millimeter gun mounts and 20 millimeter guns were moved to roof of turret b while rpc motors from stabilized mounts of 90 mm guns were removed whitley p p 343 forward superstructure was rebuilt with a new forward conning tower protected with thick armor atop conning tower there was a fire control director fitted with three large rangefinders deck armor was increased during reconstruction to a total of armor protecting secondary turrets was thick existing underwater protection was replaced by pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb blast of a torpedo warhead whitley p 158 these modernizations have been criticized by some naval historians because these ships would eventually prove to be inferior to british battleships they were meant to face namely since by time decision to proceed was taken a war between italy and united kingdom seemed more likely in addition cost of reconstruction would be not much less than cost of building a brand new littorio class battleship moreover reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in providing of steel plates that caused substantial delays in construction of modern battleships which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date ships ship namesake builder laid p 179

on side of triple entente though neither saw action since italy s principal naval opponent austro hungarian navy largely remained in port for duration of war admiral paolo thaon di revel italian naval chief of staff believed that austro hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate effectively in narrow waters of adriatic halpern p 150 threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use fleet in an active way instead revel decided to implement a blockade at relatively safer southern end of adriatic with battle fleet while smaller vessels such as mas torpedo boats conducted raids on austro hungarian ships and installations meanwhile revel s battleships would be preserved to confront austro hungarian battle fleet in event that it sought a decisive engagement halpern pp 141 42 andrea doria and caio duilio both cruised in eastern mediterranean after war and both were involved in postwar disputes over control of various cities caio duilio was sent to provide a show of force during a dispute over control of izmir in april 1919 and andrea doria assisted in suppression of gabriele d annunzio s seizure of fiume in november 1920 caio duilio cruised black sea after izmir affair until she was replaced in 1920 by battleship giulio cesare andrea doria and caio duilio were present during corfu incident in 1923 as part of naval demonstration protesting murder of general enrico tellini and four other italians in january 1925 andrea doria visited lisbon portugal to represent italy during celebration marking 400th anniversary of death of explorer vasco da gama two ships performed normal routine of peacetime cruises and goodwill visits throughout 1920s and early 1930s both were placed in reserve in 1933 whitley pp 165 67 both andrea doria and caio duilio went into drydock in late 1930s for extensive modernizations this work lasted until october and april 1940 respectively by that time italy had entered world war ii on side of axis powers two ships joined 5th division based at taranto caio duilio participated in a patrol intended to catch british battleship and a convoy bound for malta but neither target was found she and andrea doria were present during british attack on taranto on night of 11 12 november 1940 a force of twenty one fairey swordfish torpedo bombers launched from attacked ships moored in harbor andrea doria was undamaged in raid but caio duilio was hit by a torpedo on her starboard side she was grounded to prevent her from sinking in harbor and temporary repairs were effected to allow her to travel to genoa for permanent repairs which began in january 1941 whitley pp 166 p 47 in february she was attacked by british force h several warships attempted to shell caio duilio while she was in dock but they scored no hits ireland p 64 repair work lasted until may 1941 when she rejoined fleet at taranto whitley p 166 thumb left caio duilio in 1948 in meantime andrea doria participated in several operations intended to catch british convoys in mediterranean including operation excess convoys in january 1941 by end of year both battleships were tasked with escorting convoys from italy to north africa to support italian and german forces fighting there these convoys included operation m41 on 13 december and operation m42 on 17 19 december during latter andrea doria and giulio cesare engaged british cruisers and destroyers in first battle of sirte on first day of operation neither italians nor british pressed their attacks and battle ended inconclusively caio duilio was assigned to distant support for operation and was too far away to actively participate in battle convoy escort work continued into early 1942 but thereafter fleet began to suffer from a severe shortage of fuel which kept ships in port for next two years caio duilio sailed away from taranto on 14 february with a pair of light cruisers and seven destroyers in order to intercept british convoy mw 9 bounded from alexandria to malta but force could not locate british ships and so returned to port after learning of caio duilio departure however british escorts scuttled transport rowallan castle previously disabled by german aircraft woodman pp 285 286 both ships were interned at malta following italy s surrender on 3 september 1943 they remained there until 1944 when allies allowed them to return to italian ports andrea doria went to syracuse sicily and caio duilio returned to taranto before joining her sister at syracuse italy was allowed to retain two ships after end of war and they alternated in role of fleet flagship until 1953 when they were both removed from service andrea doria carried on as a gunnery training ship but caio duilio was placed in reserve both battleships were stricken from naval register in september 1956 and were subsequently broken up for scrap whitley pp 167 chesneau p 284 notes footnotes references further reading external links category battleship classes
