columnist for star ledger said meetings themselves were very entertaining and allowed for good character development between april and andy and ron and april however he said main plot with leslie and historic mansion was not tied strongly enough to leslie s fear that mark and ann would get married matt fowler of ign praised episode especially callbacks to previous episodes and interaction of characters during meetings although show was only on hiatus for about a month he said man it feels so good to have parks and recreation back i don t think there s another comedy on tv right now that contains such miss able characters a v club writer leonard pierce said 94 meetings was a particularly strong episode that focused equally on show s premise and developing relationships between characters he particularly praised susan yeagley but said tom haverford was underused and felt scenes between ann and mark were lacking new york magazine writer steve kandell said it was a fast paced and funny episode calling jokes about complaining residents rapid fire scenes kandell criticized mark who he said has been resorted to boring straight man services and said he did not mind that paul schneider was leaving series kona gallagher of tv squad appreciated that episode reintroduced fact that leslie once was in love with mark and criticized show for ignoring that fact all season
