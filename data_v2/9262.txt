arktocara is an extinct genus of river dolphin from oligocene epoch of alaska containing one species a yakataga having been discovered in 25 million year old strata near 60th parallel north it is perhaps oldest known crown toothed whale and river dolphin discovered it was a member of now extinct family allodelphinidae along with genera allodelphis goedertius ninjadelphis and zarhinocetus it measured approximately comparable to its closest living relative south asian river dolphin which measures however animal probably had an elongated beak and neck so it may have been longer animal is known only from a partially preserved skull its ecology may have been similar to modern day dall s porpoise and it may have competed with contemporaneous its remains were found in poul creek formation which has also yielded several mollusk species taxonomy type specimen only specimen of arktocara yakataga an incomplete skull was collected by geologist donald j miller in 1951 in poul creek formation who was mapping yakataga district from where species name yakataga derives from on behalf of united states geological survey usgs genus name arktocara derives from ancient greek arktos north and cara face translating to face of north yakataga translates to canoe road in tlingit language which is apparently a reference to reefs which form a canoe passage to a village arktocara was later described 65 years after collection of skull labelled as specimen usnm by smithsonian paleontologists alexandra boersma and nicholas in 2016 being recognized as a new species cladogram align left style font

otekaikea huata 2 otekaikea 2 3 other toothed whales arktocara was a river dolphin of superfamily platanistoidea and extinct family allodelphinidae sole surviving member of platanistoidea is south asian river dolphin which inhabits tropics making it its closest living relative allodelphinidae also included genera allodelphis goedertius ninjadelphis and zarhinocetus its discovery further reinforces theory that platanistoidea river dolphins originated in oceans of characteristics it shared with other platanistoids was a cylindrical projection of periotic bone in ear deeply grooved rostral sutures on beak widening of cranium a depression on roof of orbit in eye socket a smaller exposed palatine bone in roof of mouth an elongated and convex spine in tympanic bulla of ear single rooted back teeth and more than 25 teeth was around in length based on distance from cheekbone to cheekbone and it may have had a similar size to modern day south asian river dolphin which is in length and in weight based on other it probably had a long beak and it also had a long neck as identified by elongated unfused cervical vertebrae in neck this is unusual in other cetaceans which generally have a short neck with short and fused cervical vertebrae this elongated neck may have made it longer than estimated size unlike other platanistoids arktocara had a sagittal crest and its frontal sinuses were positioned behind nasals nostrils were oriented vertically and premaxilla formed a rectangular plateau surrounding them nostrils were perhaps lacrimal bone in eye socket wrapped around outer edge of brow ridge and was fused to cheek bones it further differed from other platanistoids in that it had a smaller process of squamosal that is a projection from its skull suture between eyes on brow ridge which separates frontal bone from nasal bone was u shaped sutures indicate that specimen was an adult it lacked on upper side of its head a condyloid fossa a depression between head and neck and had a symmetrical vertex upper part of head also contrary to other platanistoids arktocara lacked thin plate which extended from hard palate in roof of mouth and attached to greater wing of sphenoid bone in ear it lacked a maxillary crest a bony projection from maxillary and palatine bones in roof of mouth that runs along nasal septum which separates two nostrils it did not have a large recess which in cetaceans receives an air filled sinus originating from middle ear groove for mandibular branch nerve wrapped around sides of pterygoid fossa which is located behind eyes laterally on sphenoid bone paleobiology despite being labelled as a river dolphin arktocara much like other ancient platanistoids was likely a coastal ocean going cetacean its lifestyle and diet is speculated to have been similar to modern day dall s porpoise dalli which is an opportunistic twilight to surface predator of soft bodied fish and squid paleontologists ewan fordyce and christian de muizon speculated in 2001 that since modern day south asian river dolphin inhabits rivers ancient platanistoids such as arktocara faced some competition from other dolphins of superfamily delphinoidea and were eventually outcompeted in marine environments however this theory has not been properly explored yet paleoecology thumb map of poul creek formation in alaska found near 60th parallel north arktocara inhabited subarctic waters of alaska and is northernmost river dolphin known arktocara lived somewhere between 29 and 24 million years ago mya from rupelian to chattian ages of oligocene epoch making it oldest crown toothed whale odontoceti besides possibly waipatia hectori from 25 2 mya this time period is thought to have been characterized by diversification of cetaceans many mollusks were found in poul creek formation that were contemporaneous with arktocara such as nautilus species alaskensis and a angustata gastropod species such as alaskensis and and
