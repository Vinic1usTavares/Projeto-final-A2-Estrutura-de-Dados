peterloo massacre took place at st peter s field manchester lancashire england on monday 16 august 1819 when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60 000 80 000 who had gathered to demand reform of parliamentary representation after end of napoleonic wars in 1815 there had been periods of famine and chronic unemployment exacerbated by introduction of first of corn laws in 1819 political radicalism was rising in popularity because of poor economic conditions coupled with relative lack of suffrage in northern england manchester patriotic union was agitating for parliamentary reform and they organised a demonstration in response to be addressed by well known radical orator henry hunt shortly after meeting began local magistrates called on manchester and salford yeomanry to arrest hunt and several others on stage with him yeomanry charged into crowd knocking down a woman and killing a child and finally apprehended hunt cheshire magistrates chairman william hulton then summoned 15th hussars to disperse crowd they charged with sabres drawn and 18 people were killed and 400 700 were injured in ensuing confusion event was first labelled peterloo massacre on a front page headline on manchester observer newspaper portmanteau juxtaposing name of site with battle of waterloo which had taken place four years earlier and attack on unarmed civilians historian robert poole has called peterloo massacre one of defining moments of its age london and national papers shared horror felt in manchester region but peterloo s immediate effect was to cause government to pass six acts which were aimed at suppressing any meetings for purpose of radical reform it also led directly to foundation of manchester guardian but had little other effect on pace of reform in a survey conducted by guardian in 2006 peterloo came second to putney debates as event from radical british history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial for some time peterloo was commemorated only by a blue plaque criticised as being inadequate referring only to dispersal by military of an assembly in 2007 city council replaced blue plaque with a red plaque with less euphemistic wording explicitly referring to a peaceful rally being attacked by armed cavalry and mentioning 15 deaths and over 600 injuries in 2019 shortly before 200th anniversary of massacre manchester city council quietly unveiled a new peterloo memorial by artist jeremy deller featuring eleven concentric circles engraved with names of victims background suffrage in 1819 lancashire was represented by two members of parliament mps voting was restricted to adult male owners of freehold land with an annual rental value of 40 shillings ps2 or more and votes could only be cast at county town of lancaster by a public spoken declaration at hustings constituency boundaries were out of date and so called rotten boroughs had a hugely disproportionate influence on membership of parliament of united kingdom compared to size of their populations old sarum in wiltshire with one voter elected two mps as did dunwich in suffolk which by early 19th century had almost completely disappeared into sea major urban centres of manchester salford bolton blackburn rochdale ashton under lyne oldham and stockport with a combined population of almost one million were represented by either two county mps for lancashire or two for cheshire in case of stockport by comparison more than half of all mps were returned by a total of just 154 owners of rotten or closed boroughs in 1816 thomas oldfield s representative history of great britain and ireland being a history of house of commons and of counties cities and boroughs of united kingdom from earliest period claimed that of 515 mps for england and wales 351 were returned by patronage of 177 individuals and a further 16 by direct patronage of government all 45 scottish mps owed their seats to patronage data re presented in document 168 table of parliamentary patronage 1794 1816 in these inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform economic conditions after end of napoleonic wars in 1815 a brief boom in textile manufacture was followed by periods of chronic economic depression particularly among textile weavers and spinners textile trade was concentrated in lancashire weavers who could have expected to earn 15 shillings for a six day week in 1803 saw their wages cut to 5 shillings or even 4s 6d by 1818 industrialists who were cutting wages without offering relief blamed market forces generated by aftershocks of napoleonic wars exacerbating matters were corn laws first of which was passed in 1815 imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect english grain producers cost of food rose as people were forced to buy more expensive and lower quality british grain and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued increasing desire for political reform both in lancashire and in country at large radical mass meetings in manchester economic conditions in 1817 led to a group who became known as blanketeers to organise a march from manchester to london so they could petition prince regent for parliamentary reform a crowd of 25 000 including 5 000 men who intended to march gathered in st peter s fields after magistrates read riot act crowd was dispersed by king s dragoon guards ringleaders were arrested and subsequently released when serious charges against them were not forthcoming in april 1819 three leading blanketeers were convicted of sedition and conspiracy when witnesses alleged they had advocated principal towns of kingdom should elect representatives to a national convention to demand their rights and if refused enforce them sword in hand during a meeting in stockport in september 1818 by beginning of 1819 pressure generated by poor economic conditions was at its peak and had enhanced appeal of political radicalism among cotton loom weavers of south lancashire in january 1819 a crowd of about 10 000 gathered at st peter s fields to hear radical orator henry hunt and called on prince regent to choose ministers who would repeal corn laws meeting conducted in presence of cavalry passed off without incident in july 1819 town s magistrates wrote to lord sidmouth warning they thought a general rising was imminent deep distress of manufacturing classes was being worked on by unbounded liberty of press and harangues of a few desperate demagogues at weekly meetings possessing no power to prevent meetings magistrates admitted they were at a loss as to how to stem doctrines being disseminated august meeting against this background a great assembly was organised by manchester patriotic union formed by radicals from manchester observer newspaper s founder joseph johnson was union s secretary he wrote to henry hunt asking him to chair a meeting in manchester on 2 august 1819 johnson wrote unknown to johnson and hunt letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned and government responded by ordering 15th hussars to manchester thumb right samuel bamford led a group from his native middleton to st peter s field following his imprisonment for inciting a riot bamford emerged as a prominent voice for radical reform mass public meeting planned for 2 august was delayed until 9 august manchester observer reported it was called to take into consideration most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining radical reform in common house of parliament and to consider propriety of unrepresented inhabitants of manchester electing a person to represent them in parliament magistrates led by william hulton had been advised by acting home secretary henry hobhouse that election of a member of parliament without king s writ was a serious misdemeanour encouraging them to declare assembly illegal as soon as it was announced on 31 july radicals sought a second opinion on meeting s legality which was that intention of choosing representatives contrary to existing law tends greatly to render proposed meeting seditious under those circumstances it would be deemed justifiable in magistrates to prevent such meeting on 3 august hobhouse conveyed view of attorney general that magistrates were incorrect to declare 9 august meeting illegal as it was called to consider election of a representative and it was not intention to elect an mp that was illegal but execution of that intention on 4 august hobhouse advised against any attempt to forcibly prevent 9 august meeting if it went ahead or do anything beyond collecting evidence for subsequent prosecution unless meeting got out of hand meeting on 9 august was postponed after magistrates banned it to discourage radicals but hunt and his followers were determined to assemble and a meeting was organised for 16 august with its declared aim solely to consider propriety of adopting most legal and effectual means of obtaining a reform in common house of parliament press had mocked earlier meetings of working men because of their ragged dirty appearance and disorganised conduct but organisers were determined that those attending st peter s field meeting would be neatly turned out and march to event in good order samuel bamford a local radical who led middleton contingent wrote that it was deemed expedient that this meeting should be as morally effective as possible and that it should exhibit a spectacle such as had never before been witnessed in england instructions were given to various committees forming contingents that cleanliness sobriety order and peace and a prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence were to be observed throughout demonstration each contingent was drilled and rehearsed in fields of townships around manchester adding to concerns of authorities a royal proclamation forbidding practice of drilling had been posted in manchester on 3 august but on 9 august an informant reported to rochdale magistrates that at hill previous day 700 men were drilling in companies and going through usual evolutions of a regiment and an onlooker had said men were fit to contend with any regular troops only they wanted arms assembly to st peter s field use a cursor to explore this altrincham middleton 3

enable last section of peter street to be constructed piles of brushwood had been placed at end of field nearest to friends meeting house but remainder of field was clear thomas worrell manchester s assistant surveyor of paving arrived to inspect field at 7 00 am his job was to remove anything that might be used as a weapon and he duly had about a quarter of a load of stones carted away monday 16 august 1819 was a hot summer s day with a cloudless blue sky fine weather almost certainly increased size of crowd significantly marching from outer townships in cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect manchester magistrates met at 9 00 am to breakfast at star inn on deansgate and to consider what action they should take on henry hunt s arrival at meeting by 10 30 am they had come to no conclusions and moved to a house on southeastern corner of st peter s field from where they planned to observe meeting they were concerned that it would end in a riot or even a rebellion and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops and militia yeomanry to be deployed military presence comprised 600 men of several hundred infantrymen a royal horse artillery unit with two six pounder guns 400 men of cheshire yeomanry 400 special constables and 120 cavalry of manchester and salford yeomanry manchester salford yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen most numerous of which were publicans recently mocked by manchester observer as generally speaking fawning dependents of great with a few fools and a greater proportion of who imagine they acquire considerable importance by wearing regimentals they were subsequently variously described as younger members of tory party in arms and as hot headed young men who had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of radicalism socialist writer mark has described them as local business mafia on horseback r j white described them as exclusively cheesemongers ironmongers and newly enriched manufacturers who people of manchester thought a joke british army in north was under overall command of general sir john byng when he had initially learned that meeting was scheduled for 2 august he wrote to home office stating that he hoped manchester magistrates would show firmness on day revised meeting date of 16 august however coincided with his visit to horse races at york a fashionable event at which byng had entries in two races he once again wrote to home office saying that although he would still be prepared to be in command in manchester on day of meeting if it was thought really necessary he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander lieutenant colonel guy l estrange meeting crowd that gathered in st peter s field arrived in disciplined and organised contingents each village or chapelry was given a time and a place to meet from where its members were to proceed to assembly points in larger towns or townships and from there on to manchester contingents were sent from all around region largest and best dressed of which was a group of 10 000 who had travelled from oldham green comprising people from oldham royton which included a sizeable female section crompton lees saddleworth and mossley other sizeable contingents marched from middleton and rochdale 6 000 strong and stockport 1 500 5 000 strong marlow 1969 pp 120 121 reports of size of crowd at meeting vary substantially contemporaries estimated it from 30 000 to as many as 150 000 modern estimates are 60 000 80 000 scholar joyce marlow describes event as most numerous meeting that ever took place in great britain and elaborates that generally accepted figure of 60 000 would have been six per cent of population of lancashire or half population of immediate area around manchester assembly was intended by its organisers and participants to be a peaceful meeting henry hunt had exhorted everyone attending to come armed with no other weapon but that of a self approving conscience and many were wearing their sunday best clothes samuel bamford recounts following incident which occurred as middleton contingent reached outskirts of manchester although some observers like rev w r hay chairman of salford quarter sessions claimed that active part of meeting may be said to have come in wholly from country others such as john shuttleworth a local cotton manufacturer estimated that most were from manchester a view that would subsequently be supported by casualty lists of casualties whose residence was recorded sixty one per cent lived within a three mile radius of centre of manchester some groups carried banners with texts like no corn laws annual parliaments universal suffrage and vote by ballot first female reform societies were established in textile areas in 1819 and women from manchester female reform society dressed in white accompanied hunt to platform society s president mary fildes rode in hunt s carriage carrying its flag only banner known to have survived is in middleton public library it was carried by thomas redford who was injured by a yeomanry sabre made of green silk embossed with gold lettering one side of banner is inscribed liberty and fraternity and other unity and strength thumb right a print published on 27 august 1819 depicting hunt s arrest by constables at about noon several hundred special constables were led onto field they formed two lines in crowd a few yards apart in an attempt to form a corridor through crowd between house where magistrates were watching and hustings two wagons lashed together believing that this might be intended as route by which magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest speakers some members of crowd pushed wagons away from constables and pressed around hustings to form a human barrier hunt s carriage arrived at meeting shortly after 1 00 pm and he made his way to hustings alongside hunt on speakers stand were john knight a cotton manufacturer and reformer joseph johnson organiser of meeting john thacker saxton managing editor of manchester observer publisher richard carlile and george swift reformer and shoemaker there were also a number of reporters including john tyas of times john smith of liverpool mercury and edward baines jr son of editor of leeds mercury by this time st peter s field an area of was packed with tens of thousands of men women and children crowd around speakers was so dense that their hats seemed to touch large groups of curious spectators gathered on outskirts of crowd rest of manchester was like a ghost town streets and shops were empty cavalry charge william hulton chairman of magistrates watching from house on edge of st peter s field saw enthusiastic reception that hunt received on his arrival at assembly and it encouraged him to action he issued an arrest warrant for henry hunt joseph johnson john knight and james moorhouse on being handed warrant constable jonathan andrews offered his opinion that press of crowd surrounding hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution hulton then wrote two letters one to major thomas trafford commanding officer of manchester and salford yeomanry cavalry and other to overall military commander in manchester lieutenant colonel guy l estrange contents of both notes were similar notes were handed to two horsemen who were standing by manchester and salford yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in portland street and so received their note first they immediately drew their swords and galloped towards st peter s field one trooper in a frantic attempt to catch up knocked down ann fildes in cooper street causing death of her son when he was thrown from her arms two year old william fildes was first casualty of peterloo sixty cavalrymen of manchester and salford yeomanry led by captain hugh hornby birley a local factory owner arrived at house from where magistrates were watching some reports allege that they were drunk andrews chief constable instructed birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute birley was asked to take his cavalry to hustings to allow speakers to be removed it was by then about 1 40 pm thumb left 300px a map of st peter s field and surrounding area on route towards hustings between special constables was narrow and as inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into crowd they reared and plunged as people tried to get out of their way arrest warrant had been given to deputy constable joseph nadin who followed behind yeomanry as cavalry pushed towards speakers stand they became stuck in crowd and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres on his arrival at stand nadin arrested hunt johnson and a number of others including john tyas reporter from times their mission to execute arrest warrant having been achieved yeomanry set about destroying banners and flags on stand according to tyas yeomanry then attempted to reach flags in crowd cutting most indiscriminately to right and to left to get at them only then said tyas were thrown at military from this point manchester and salford yeomanry lost all command of temper from his vantage point william hulton perceived unfolding events as an assault on yeomanry and on l estrange s arrival at 1 50 pm at head of his hussars he ordered them into field to disperse crowd with words good god sir don t you see they are attacking yeomanry disperse meeting 15th hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across eastern end of st peter s field and charged into crowd at about same time cheshire yeomanry charged from southern edge of field at first crowd had some difficulty in dispersing as main exit route into peter street was blocked by 88th regiment of foot standing with bayonets fixed one officer of 15th hussars was heard trying to restrain by now out of control manchester and salford yeomanry who were cutting at every one they could reach for shame for shame gentlemen forbear forbear people cannot get away on other hand lieutenant jolliffe of 15th hussars said it was then for first time that i saw manchester troop of yeomanry they were scattered singly or in small groups over greater part of field literally hemmed up and powerless either to make an impression or to escape in fact they were in power of those whom they were designed to overawe and it required only a glance to discover their helpless position and necessity of our being brought to their rescue further jolliffe asserted that nine out of ten of sabre wounds were caused by hussars however far greater amount of injuries were from pressure of routed multitude within 10 minutes crowd had been dispersed at cost of 11 dead and more than 600 injured only wounded their helpers and dead were left behind a woman living nearby said she saw a very great deal of blood for some time afterwards there was rioting in streets most seriously at new cross where troops fired on a crowd attacking a shop belonging to someone rumoured to have taken one of women reformers flags as a souvenir peace was not restored in manchester until next morning and in stockport and macclesfield rioting continued on 17th there was also a major riot in oldham that day during which one person was shot and wounded victims thumb left 280px a

sources claim 11 15 killed and 400 700 injured manchester relief committee a body set up to provide relief for victims of peterloo gave number of injured as 420 while radical sources listed 500 true number is difficult to estimate as many of wounded hid their injuries for fear of retribution by authorities three of william marsh s six children worked in factory belonging to captain hugh birley of manchester yeomanry and lost their jobs because their father had attended meeting james lees was admitted to manchester infirmary with two severe sabre wounds to head but was refused treatment and sent home after refusing to agree with surgeon s insistence that he had had enough of manchester meetings a particular feature of meeting at peterloo was number of women present female reform societies had been formed in north west england during june and july 1819 first in britain many of women were dressed distinctively in white and some formed all female contingents carrying their own flags of 654 recorded casualties at least 168 were women four of whom died either at st peter s field or later as a result of their wounds it has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of crowd was made up of women suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3 1 richard carlile claimed that women were especially targeted a view apparently supported by large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons eleven of fatalities listed occurred on st peter s field others such as john lees of oldham died later of their wounds and some

soldier john lees who died from his wounds on 9 september had been present at battle of waterloo shortly before his death he said to a friend that he had never been in such danger as at peterloo at waterloo there was man to man but there it was downright murder when news of massacre began to spread population of manchester and surrounding districts was horrified and outraged after events at peterloo many commemorative items such as plates jugs handkerchiefs and medals were produced they were carried by radical supporters and may also have been sold to raise money for injured people s history museum in manchester has one of these peterloo handkerchiefs on display all mementos carried iconic image of peterloo cavalrymen with swords drawn riding down and slashing at defenceless civilians reverse of peterloo medal carried a biblical text derived from psalm 37 14 peterloo was first public meeting at which journalists from important distant newspapers were present and within a day or so of event accounts were published in london leeds and liverpool london and national papers shared horror felt in manchester region and feeling of indignation throughout country became intense james wroe editor of manchester observer was first to describe incident as peterloo massacre coining his headline by creating ironic portmanteau from st peter s field and battle of waterloo that had taken place four years earlier he also wrote pamphlets entitled peterloo massacre a faithful narrative of events priced at 2d each they sold out every print run for 14 weeks and had a large national circulation sir francis burdett a reformist mp was jailed for three months for publishing a seditious libel percy bysshe shelley was in italy and did not hear of massacre until 5 september his poem masque of anarchy subtitled written on occasion of massacre at manchester was sent for publication in radical periodical examiner but because of restrictions on radical press it was not published until 1832 ten years after poet s death political immediate effect of peterloo was a crackdown on reform government instructed police and courts to go after journalists presses and publication of manchester observer wroe was arrested and charged with producing a seditious publication found guilty he was sentenced to 12 months in prison and fined ps100 outstanding court cases against manchester observer were rushed through courts and a continual change of sub editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids often on suspicion that someone was writing a radical article manchester observer closed in february 1820 hunt and eight others were tried at york assizes on 16 march 1820 charged with sedition after a two week trial five defendants were found guilty hunt was sentenced to 30 months in ilchester gaol bamford johnson and healey were given one year each and knight was jailed for two years on a subsequent charge a civil case on behalf of a weaver wounded at

ruled their actions had been justified to disperse an illegal gathering thumb left alt ban on military exercises notice to inhabitants of hundred of salford published by magistrates day after massacre government declared its support for actions taken by magistrates and army manchester magistrates held a supposedly public meeting on 19 august so that resolutions supporting action they had taken three days before could be published cotton merchants archibald prentice later editor of manchester times and absalom watkin a later corn law reformer both members of little circle organised a petition of protest against violence at st peter s field and validity of magistrate s meeting within a few days it had collected 4 800 signatures nevertheless home secretary lord sidmouth on 27 august conveyed to magistrates thanks of prince regent for their action in preservation of public peace that public exoneration was met with fierce anger and criticism during a debate at hopkins street robert wedderburn declared prince is a fool with his wonderful letters of thanks what is prince regent or king to us we want no king he is no use to us in an open letter richard carlile said for a few months following peterloo it seemed to authorities that country was heading towards an armed rebellion encouraging them in that belief were two abortive uprisings in huddersfield and burnley yorkshire west riding revolt during autumn of 1820 and discovery and foiling of cato street conspiracy to blow up cabinet that winter by end of year government had introduced legislation later known as six acts to suppress radical meetings and publications and by end of 1820 every significant working class radical reformer was in jail civil liberties had declined to an even lower level than they were before peterloo historian robert reid has written that it is not fanciful to compare restricted freedoms of british worker in post peterloo period in early nineteenth century with those of black south african in post sharpeville period of late twentieth century peterloo massacre also influenced naming of 1821 cinderloo uprising in coalbrookdale coalfield of east shropshire uprising saw 3 000 protesting workers confronted by shropshire yeomanry leading to deaths of 3 crowd members one direct consequence of peterloo was foundation of manchester guardian newspaper in 1821 by little circle

and religious liberty warmly advocate cause of reform endeavour to assist in diffusion of just principles of political economy and support without reference to party from which they emanate all serviceable measures events such as rising march of blanketeers and spa fields meeting all serve to indicate breadth diversity and widespread geographical scale of demand for economic and political reform at time peterloo had no effect on speed of reform but in due course all but one of reformers demands annual parliaments were met following great reform act of 1832 newly created manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two mps five candidates including william cobbett stood and whigs charles poulett thomson and mark philips were elected manchester became a municipal borough in 1838 and what remained of manorial rights were purchased by borough council in 1846 on other hand r j white has affirmed true significance of peterloo as marking point of final conversion of provincial england to struggle for enfranchisement of working class ship which had tacked and lain for so long among shoals and shallows of hunger marching strikes and sabotage was coming to port henceforth people were to stand with ever greater fortitude behind that great movement which stage by stage throughout nineteenth century was to impose a new political order upon society with peterloo and departure of regency england parliamentary reform had come of age commemorations skelmanthorpe flag believed to have been made in skelmanthorpe in west riding of yorkshire in 1819 was made to honour victims of peterloo massacre and was flown at mass meetings held in area demanding reform of parliament free trade hall home of anti corn law league was built partly as a cenotaph raised on shades of victims of peterloo until 2007 massacre was commemorated by a blue plaque on wall of present building third to occupy site now radisson hotel it was regarded as a less than appropriate memorial because it under reported incident as a dispersal and deaths were omitted completely in a 2006 survey conducted by guardian peterloo came second to st mary s church putney venue for putney debates as event from radical british history that most deserved a proper monument euphemism on blue plaque was described by comedian mark thomas as an act of historical vandalism akin to stalin airbrushing dissidents out of photographs a peterloo massacre memorial campaign was set up to lobby for a more appropriate monument to an event that has been described as manchester s tiananmen square
