palladium is a chemical element with symbol pd and atomic number 46 it is a rare and lustrous silvery white metal discovered in 1803 by william hyde wollaston he named it after asteroid pallas which was itself named after epithet of greek goddess athena acquired by her when she slew pallas palladium platinum rhodium ruthenium iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as platinum group metals pgms these have similar chemical properties but palladium has lowest melting point and is least dense of them more than half supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters which convert as much as 90 of harmful gases in automobile exhaust hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide into less noxious substances nitrogen carbon dioxide and water vapor palladium is also used in electronics dentistry medicine hydrogen purification chemical applications groundwater treatment and jewelry palladium is a key component of fuel cells which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity heat and water ore deposits of palladium and other pgms are rare most extensive deposits have been found in norite belt of bushveld igneous complex covering transvaal basin in south africa stillwater complex in montana united states sudbury basin and thunder bay district of ontario canada and norilsk complex in russia recycling is also a source mostly from scrapped catalytic converters numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest characteristics palladium belongs to group 10 in periodic table but

incomplete electron shell with all shells above it empty palladium is a soft silver white metal that resembles platinum it is least dense and has lowest melting point of platinum group metals it is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold worked palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid in hot concentrated sulfuric acid and when finely ground in hydrochloric acid it dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia palladium does not react with oxygen at standard temperature and thus does not tarnish in air palladium heated to 800 degc will produce a layer of palladium ii oxide pdo it may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time likely due to formation of a surface layer of its monoxide palladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having tc 3 2 k b phys rev lett 42 1769 1979 isotopes naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes six of which are stable most stable radioisotopes are 107pd with a half life of 6 5 million years found in nature with 17 days and with 3 63 days eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 90 64 u to 122 64 u these have half lives of less than thirty minutes except half life 8 47 hours half life 13 7 hours and half life 21 hours for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of most abundant stable isotope primary decay mode is electron capture with primary decay product being rhodium primary mode of decay for those isotopes of pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with primary product of this decay being silver radiogenic 107ag is a decay product of 107pd and was first discovered in 1978 in santa clara meteorite of 1976 discoverers suggest that coalescence and differentiation of iron cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event 107pd versus ag correlations observed in bodies which have been melted since accretion of solar system must reflect presence of short lived nuclides in early solar system compounds palladium compounds primarily exist in 0 and 2 oxidation state other less common states are also recognized generally compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element small structure of a

upright left william hyde wollaston william hyde wollaston noted discovery of a new noble metal in july 1802 in his lab book and named it palladium in august of same year wollaston purified a quantity of material and offered it without naming discoverer in a small shop in soho in april 1803 after harsh criticism from richard chenevix that palladium is an alloy of platinum and mercury wollaston anonymously offered a reward of ps20 for 20 grains of synthetic palladium alloy chenevix received copley medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium wollaston published discovery of rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium he disclosed that he was discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805 it was named by wollaston in 1802 after asteroid 2 pallas which had been discovered two months earlier wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from south america by dissolving ore in aqua regia neutralizing solution with sodium hydroxide and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride he added mercuric cyanide to form compound palladium ii cyanide which was heated to extract palladium metal palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at rate of 0 065 g per day approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight this treatment had many negative side effects and was later replaced by more effective drugs most palladium is used for catalytic converters in automobile industry in run up to year 2000 russian supply of palladium to global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted for political reasons export quota was not granted on time ensuing market panic drove price to an all time high of 1340 per troy ounce in january 2001 around that time ford motor company fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage stockpiled metal when prices fell in early 2001 ford lost nearly us 1 billion world demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300 tons in 2000 global production of palladium from mines was 222 tonnes in 2006 according to united states geological survey many were concerned about a steady supply of palladium in wake of russia s annexation of crimea partly as sanctions could hamper russian palladium exports any restrictions on russian palladium exports could have exacerbated what was already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014 those concerns pushed palladium prices to their highest level since 2001 in september 2014 they soared above 900 per ounce mark in 2016 however palladium cost around 614 per ounce as russia managed to maintain stable supplies in january 2019 palladium futures climbed past 1 344 per ounce for first time on record mainly due to strong demand from automotive industry

carbon fluorine bonds thumb upright 1 8 catalytic cycle for kumada cross coupling reaction which is widely used in synthesis of fine chemicals palladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications although its use is growing as a tool for synthetic biology in 2017 effective in vivo catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease electronics second greatest application of palladium in electronics is in multi layer ceramic capacitors in which palladium and palladium silver alloy is used for electrodes palladium sometimes alloyed with nickel is used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics and in soldering materials electronic sector consumed 1 07 million troy ounces 33 2 tonnes of palladium in 2006 according to a johnson report technology hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium and membrane reactors with pd membranes are used in production of high purity hydrogen palladium is used in palladium hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies palladium ii chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors hydrogen storage palladium readily adsorbs hydrogen at room temperatures forming palladium hydride with x less than 1 while this property is common to many transition metals palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches 1 this property has been investigated in designing an efficient inexpensive and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to magnetic susceptibility which decreases with increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for 62 at any higher ratio solid solution becomes diamagnetic mott n f and jones h 1958 theory of properties of metals and alloys oxford university press p 200 dentistry palladium is used in small amounts about 0 5 in some alloys of dental amalgam to decrease corrosion and increase metallic lustre of final restoration jewelry palladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in alloys called white gold where naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating palladium is much less dense than platinum similar to gold palladium can be beaten into leaf as thin as 100 nm in unlike platinum palladium may discolor at temperatures above due to oxidation making it more brittle and thus less suitable for use in jewelry to prevent this palladium intended for jewelry is heated under controlled conditions thumb upright fine art palladium photographic portrait of marguerite by margaret watkins 1925 prior to 2004 principal use of palladium in jewelry was manufacture of white gold palladium is one of three most popular alloying metals in white gold nickel and silver can also be used palladium gold is more expensive than nickel gold but seldom causes allergic reactions though certain cross allergies with nickel may occur when platinum became a strategic resource during world war ii many jewelry bands were made out of palladium palladium was little used in jewelry because of technical difficulty of casting with casting problem resolved use of palladium in jewelry increased originally because platinum increased in price while price of palladium decreased in early 2004 when gold and platinum prices rose steeply china began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry consuming 37 tonnes in 2005 subsequent changes in relative price of platinum lowered demand for palladium to 17 4 tonnes in 2009 demand for palladium as a catalyst has increased price of palladium to about 50 higher than that of platinum in january 2019 in january 2010 hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in united kingdom and became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium articles can be marked as 500 950 or 999 parts of palladium per thousand of alloy fountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver rather than gold appearance is desired sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering gold completely photography in printing process photographers make fine art black and white prints using platinum or palladium salts often used with platinum palladium provides an alternative to silver toxicity palladium is a metal with low toxicity as conventionally measured e g ld50 recent research on mechanism of palladium toxicity suggests high toxicity if measured on a longer timeframe and at cellular level in liver and kidney et al 2016 8 252 259 doi 10 1039 mitochondria appear to have a key role in palladium toxicity via mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and depletion of cellular glutathione gsh level until that recent work it had been thought that palladium was poorly absorbed by human body when ingested plants such as water hyacinth are killed by low levels of palladium salts but most other plants tolerate it although tests show that at levels above 0 0003 growth is affected high doses of palladium could be poisonous tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic though until recent research cited above no clear evidence indicated that element harms humans precautions like other platinum group metals bulk pd is quite inert although contact dermatitis has been reported data on effects are limited it has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel making it advisable to avoid use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic some palladium is emitted with exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters between 4 and 108 ng km of palladium particulate is released by such cars while total uptake from food is estimated to be less than 2 ug per person a day second possible source of palladium is dental restoration from which uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than 15 ug per person per day people working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake for soluble compounds such as palladium chloride 99 is eliminated from body within 3 days median lethal dose ld50 of soluble palladium compounds in mice is 200 mg kg for oral and 5 mg kg for intravenous administration see also
