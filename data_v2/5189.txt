modern view of ruins of ludlow castle which was once controlled by josce thumb right 275px josce de dinan died 1166 was an anglo norman nobleman who lived during and after civil war between king stephen of england and his cousin matilda over throne of england he was a landholder in welsh marches when he was married by stephen to widow of pain fitzjohn a union that gave josce control of ludlow castle control of castle was contested by other noblemen and resulting warfare between nobles forms background to a late medieval romance known as fouke le fitz waryn which is mainly concerned with actions of josce s grandson but also includes some material on josce s lifetime josce eventually lost control of ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by matilda and her son king henry ii of england who succeeded stephen in 1154 background and early life following king henry i s death in 1135 succession was disputed between king s nephews stephen and his elder brother theobald ii count of champagne and henry s surviving legitimate child matilda usually known as empress matilda because of her first marriage to holy roman emperor henry v king henry s only legitimate son william had died in 1120 after matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father who married her to geoffrey count of anjou all magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry s heir but after king s death in 1135 stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald or matilda could react norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy and theobald contented himself with his possessions in france but matilda was less sanguine and secured support of her maternal uncle scottish king david i and in 1138 also that of her half brother robert earl of gloucester an illegitimate son of henry i nobles in welsh marches revolted against stephen in 1136 but revolt was not settled until 1138 in 1139 matilda invaded southern england with her half brother

but he rebelled against stephen and fortified ludlow against king josce s position was so strong that when stephen granted much of surrounding lands to robert de beaumont earl of leicester ludlow was specifically exempted stephen told robert that he would have a royal grant of castle if he could secure josce s submission as a vassal chibnall empress matilda pp 123 124 custody of ludlow was
