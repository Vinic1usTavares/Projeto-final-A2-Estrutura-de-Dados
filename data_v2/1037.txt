released as a b side of respect according to drummer jackson redding wrote respect after a conversation they had during a break in recording session in which he told redding you re on road all time all you can look for is a little respect when you come home an alternative story is told by redding s friend and road manager earl speedo sims who states that song came from a group i was singing with and that even though redding rewrote it a lot of lyric was still there sims adds he told me i would get a credit but i never did sims also states that he sang backing chorus of hey hey hey song used for fifth track i ve been loving you too long had been previously recorded in mono with booker t jones on piano and released as a single in april 1965 becoming a number two hit on billboards r b chart it was rerecorded in stereo for album music and lyrics majority of tracks on otis blue are cover versions including three by sam cooke who had been shot dead previous december album opens with mournfully harried ole man trouble for claudrena n harold of popmatters song is one of his most tunes lyrics deal with a man who is unable to escape brutal realities of blues and has been compared with paul robeson s ole man river respect was inspired by a quote of drummer al jackson jr who allegedly said to redding after a tour what are you griping about you re on road all time all you can look for is a little respect when you come home essentially a ballad respect is an uptempo and energetic song which took a day to write 20 minutes to arrange and one take to record according to redding aretha franklin covered this song in 1967 and with it topped billboard r b and pop charts redding shouted to a woman for more respect while franklin ironically countered song and transformed it into a feminist hymn next song is an energetic version of sam cooke s ballad change gonna come a protest against racial segregation and disrespect for black people down in valley is a funky cover of solomon burke s original with whom redding toured before recording nate patrin of pitchfork felt that song ratchets up both gospel and secular lust love song i ve been loving you too long was co written by redding and impressions lead singer jerry butler in a hotel near atlanta airport redding s rendition of cooke s shake is again more funky song is about club dancing in so called discotheques which debuted in early 1960s song was described as a hard swinging full throated 2 40 of precision ferocity with a force that would flat out explode during his live sets last five songs are all covers by popular artists temptations my girl written by smokey robinson and ronald white cooke s wonderful world b b king s rock me baby rolling stones satisfaction on which redding sings fashion instead of faction and william bell s you don t miss your water which was characterized as sorrowful country blues and has one of most devastating pleading man lead vocals in entire stax catalog satisfaction sounded so plausible that a journalist even accused stones of stealing song from redding and that they performed it after redding music writer robert christgau describes it as an anarchic reading of stones original release otis blue was released on september 15 1965 stax s subsidiary label volt released it in us while atlantic records released album in uk album s commercial
