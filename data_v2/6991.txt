trade places with gods on mount olympus who have grown elderly and ignored actors turn out to be comically inept rulers having seen ensuing mayhem down below angry gods return sending actors back to earth as eminent tragedians whom no one ever goes to see gilbert would return to this theme twenty five years later in his last opera with sullivan grand duke in which a theatre company temporarily replaces ruler of a small country and decides to revive classic memories of athens at its best seasonal works like thespis were not normally expected to endure and apart from a benefit performance

mount olympus elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on earth mercury complains that older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him while he gets no credit for all his drudgery jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis but he is unsure what can be done about it just then gods see a swarm of mortals ascending mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance thespis s acting company enters for a picnic celebrating marriage of two of its members sparkeion and nicemis actors being cheap have failed to contribute substantial food items to

a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages or he will lose his authority jupiter mars and apollo enter all of actors flee in terror except for thespis jupiter asks thespis whether he is impressed with father of gods thespis replies that gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to mingle and judge for themselves what people think of them they agree to invest actors with their powers as they take a merry holiday below on earth thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on mount olympus during gods absence each actor takes place

entanglements of actors in real life conflict with those of gods that they are playing venus played by pretteia is supposed to be married to mars but actor playing mars is her father a possible solution is discovered in venus having actually married vulcan but vulcan is her grandfather sparkeion who took on role of apollo accompanies his wife nicemis who plays diana on her nightly duties so that sun is up during night mercury informs thespis that substitute gods have received many complaints from mortals because some are not performing their functions and others ill judged experiments have wreaked havoc in world below for instance timidon replacement for mars is a pacifist and a coward substitute for hymen refuses to marry anyone and ersatz pluto is too tenderhearted to let anyone die daphne who plays muse calliope comes to thespis and claims based on a bowdlerised edition of greek myths that calliope was married to apollo she points out that apollo played by sparkeion is brother of diana played by sparkeion s wife nicemis thespis decides that sparkeion is married to daphne while they are gods but his marriage to nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again when gods return they are furious and tell thespis that he has deranged whole scheme of society thespis says that they should calm down as list of mortals complaints is about to be read gods watch

with seven operas and plays premiering that year and over a dozen other burlesques farces and extravaganzas under his belt he was well known to london theatregoers as a comic dramatist goldberg p 144 sullivan however was at this point mainly known for his serious music his completed music that year included choral cantata on shore and sea a suite of incidental music for shakespeare s merchant of

were to begin sullivan however had more time on his hands after a manchester production of merchant of venice for which he supplied incidental music had its premiere on 9 september ainger p 91 both gilbert and sullivan recalled that thespis was written in some haste sullivan recalled simply that both music and libretto were very hurriedly written lawrence p 85 in his 1883 autobiography gilbert

pantomime at crystal palace on 21 december which included many of performers who would be in thespis lastly thespis was to play as afterpiece to an h j byron comedy dearer than life which shared many of its actors including toole and fred sullivan and had to be rehearsed at same time rees pp 19 21 despite short time available for rehearsals sullivan recalled that gilbert insisted that chorus play a major role as it would do in their later savoy operas reception opening night premiere was under rehearsed as several critics noted and work was also evidently in need of cutting gaiety management

happier entertainments will be found rees p 76 some critics could not see past production s state of disarray hornet captioned its review thespis or gods grown old and wearisome morning advertiser

had a mostly favourable reaction observer commented we have authors and musicians quite as talented as french subject of thespis is unquestionably funny mr arthur sullivan has entered with heart into spirit of mr gilbert s fun he has brightened it up with most fanciful and delightful music subsequent performances many writers in early 20th century perpetuated a myth that thespis ran only a month

music was they would do with all their operas gilbert and sullivan made cuts and alterations after first performance two days after opening sullivan wrote to his mother i have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon stage first night i had a great reception but music went badly and singer sang half a tone sharp so that enthusiasm of audience did not sustain itself towards me last night i cut out song music went very well and consequently i had a hearty call before curtain at end of act ii sullivan flower pp 68 69 piece eventually settled into a respectable state and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night by third night london figaro could report i must say that not a single hitch in performance is now to be perceived and that applause and evident

favour and deservedly so on 9 january daily telegraph reported a visit by his royal highness duke of edinburgh by 27 january illustrated times noted that a chance playgoer will certainly not find a

interrupted on 14 february 1872 ash wednesday since london theatres refrained from presenting costumed performances out of respect for religious holiday instead a miscellaneous entertainment was given

simon gilbert sullivan a selling exhibition of memorabilia accessed 30 october 2007 on 17 february henry sutherland edwards wrote in musical world in almost all conjunctions of music and words there is a sacrifice of one to other but in thespis sufficient opportunities have been given for music and music serves only to adorn piece similar reports continued to appear through early march when thespis closed final performance during authors lifetimes was given less than two months later on 27 april at a matinee for benefit of mlle clary original sparkeion on such an occasion a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well as beneficiary was entitled to income after expenses and tickets were generally offered at inflated prices rees pp 81 82 actress was a gaiety

manager to produce trial by jury in 1875 when that work was a surprise success there were discussions of quickly reviving thespis for 1875 christmas season gilbert wrote to sullivan proposed revival was mentioned in several more letters throughout autumn of 1875 until on 23 november gilbert wrote i have heard no more about thespis it is astonishing how quickly these capitalists dry up under magic influence of words cash down ainger p 114 in 1895 with richard d oyly carte struggling to rediscover success at savoy he once again proposed a revival of thespis but idea was not pursued stedman p 95 no mention of whereabouts of music of thespis exists since 1897 and scholars have searched for it among many of extant collections tillett spencer p 3 except for two songs and some ballet music it is presumed lost reasons why thespis went are not known some commentators speculate that sullivan used music in his other operas walbrook p 27 fitz gerald p 2 dunhill p 45 allen first night p 6 if this were true then for this reason alone a revival would have become impossible rees p 88 however evidence that sullivan did so has eluded discovery tillett spencer p 3 stedman pp 95 96 another possible explanation is that gilbert and sullivan came to regard thespis with its brazen girls in tights and short skirts and broad burlesque style humour as kind of work they wished to avoid they later renounced travesti roles and revealing dresses on their actresses and made publicly known their disapproval of them in 1885 hollingshead wrote to pall mall gazette mr gilbert is somewhat severe on a style of burlesque which he did much to popularise in old days before he invented what i may call burlesque in long clothes mr gilbert never objected to dresses in robert devil nor to dresses in thespis correspondence pall mall gazette 26 january 1885 p 4 in 1879 sullivan gilbert and carte were in midst of a legal battle with former directors of comedy opera company which had produced h m s

said they are yours as our run is over now will you please let me have them and parts of thespis also at once i am detaining parts of pinafore so that directors shall not take them away from comique tomorrow and i base my claim on precedent you set rees p 89 modern productions after its last performance at gaiety in 1872 thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953 although an attempted reconstruction from 1940s has been discovered tillett spencer p 4 tillett and spencer who discovered ballet music identified twenty separate reconstructions of thespis between 1953 and 2002 about half of these use music adapted from sullivan s other works others use new music for all but surviving songs or in a few cases re compose those as well tillett spencer p 6 no version has become predominant in recent productions theatre historian terence rees developed a version of libretto that attempts to correct many errors noted in surviving libretto rees p 101 45 rees also prepared a performance version based on libretto which included a few interpolated lyrics from gilbert s non sullivan operas in an attempt to replace missing songs a score was supplied by garth morton based on

assessment more than usual burlesque thumb left w s gilbert in about 1871 thespis was an advance on types of burlesques to which gaiety audiences were accustomed francois cellier recalled much later several critics suggested that piece may have been too sophisticated for its audience or at least audience that greeted its first performance on boxing night times wrote dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us so much so in fact that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night it met however with an excellent reception and on any other occasion than boxing night numerous merits of piece cannot fail to secure for it in public estimation a high place among novelties of season allen first night p 4 other reviews of first night took up a similar theme sporting life suggested that it may be that they looked for something less polished than mr gilbert s verse and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author s humour it may be too that thespis was a little i only say just a little over their heads rees p 77 orchestra carried a similar sentiment in fact both music and idea were somewhat over heads of audience libretto thumb right 300px first of gilbert s comic mythologist articles in illustrated magazine fun plot of thespis with its elderly gods tired of their life in olympus is similar to some of offenbach s operas notably orphee aux enfers orpheus in underworld in orphee like thespis classical mythology particularly olympian gods are ruthlessly parodied williams p 44 in thespis gods swap places with actors and descend to earth in orphee gods head to hell for a pleasant holiday away from boring perfection offenbach s plot for although cremieux and halevy wrote libretto idea was offenbach s places orpheus great musician in centre however gilbert s plot focuses on thespis father of drama while this may be a coincidence it could also be seen as a response to offenbach as his plot places music at centre of his operetta but gilbert s elevates dramatist crowther 2000 p 71 72 libretto has been praised by several biographers and historians one said that dialogue contains many an authentic gilbertian touch walbrook p 31 another found it a gay sparkling libretto goldberg p 152 sidney dark and rowland gray wrote that book of thespis is genuine gilbert gilbert whom nowadays all world loves thespis once more emphasizes fact that gilbert s artistry was hardly affected with passing of years many of its songs might well have appeared in later operas they point out mercury s i m celestial drudge which anticipates giuseppe s rising early in morning in gondoliers and find real brand of gilbertian topsy in song about former head of a railway company i once knew a chap who discharged a function dark gray p 65 isaac goldberg thought that thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward it forecasts characteristic methods and now and then a character of later series its dialogue is comical and if anything somewhat above heads of gaiety audiences of 1871 goldberg p 148 goldberg wrote in 1929 that libretto seems to have no specific ancestry neither in his burlesques nor in his ballads had gilbert played with gods and goddesses of greek mythology goldberg p 146 however gilbert did write a series of humorous sketches parodying greek myths mainly heroes of iliad for illustrated magazine fun in 1864 stedman p 23 see also gilbert w s 1864 comic mythologist from fun 5 november 1864 and pygmalion and galatea which he produced just before thespis was a more serious treatment of greek mythology jane w stedman points out that thespis looks backward to french opera bouffe but it is fundamentally a gilbertian invasion plot in which outsiders penetrate and affect a given society often for worse she compares theatrical company in thespis to politicians that remodel fairyland in gilbert s 1873 play happy land and englishmen who reform island nation of utopia in utopia limited 1893 elements of thespis also appear in gilbert and sullivan s last opera together grand duke 1896 where a theatre company replaces ruler and decides to revive classic memories of athens at its best crowther 2000 p 165 music sullivan s score generally came in for praise though critics as they would throughout his life that theatrical scores were beneath his ability in standard a e t watson wrote left thumb arthur sullivan in about 1871 clement scott in daily telegraph found opera not marred by ambitious music but he added tuneful throughout always pretty frequently suggestive songs and dances are quite in character with author s design some of numbers will certainly live and impression caused by music as a whole is that it will have far more than a passing interest many critics praised originality of title character s song in first act about head of a railway company which may have been a joke about duke of sutherland who was fond of running railway engines goldberg p 150 scott called song a ludicrous ballad but quite in spirit of well known compositions of bab and as it has been fitted with a lively tune and a rattling chorus a hearty encore was inevitable though ditty was long audience would have been well content to hear it all over again pall mall gazette found orchestration very novel including as it does employment of a railway bell a railway whistle and some new instrument of music imitating agreeable sound of a train in motion jacobs p 73 similarly sunday times noted entire company join in chorus music of which admirably expresses whirl and thunder of a railway train at express speed rees p 64 era called it a screaming whistling and shouting chorus that fairly brings down house similarity to french models was much commented upon vanity fair thought that music in piece itself is charming throughout and promises for first time a rival to offenbach thespis is quite as good as orphee aux enfers rees p 58 another wrote morning advertiser thought that there is an evident attempt to copy creations of a foreign composer who is so popular at present time and who has written some charming music for gods and goddesses en bouffes rees p 59 others accused sullivan of blatant copying athenaeum wrote that music was arranged and composed by mr a s sullivan first verb

sullivan this is a musical gem left song enjoyed long standing popularity wyndham writes little maid of arcadee was popular for a quarter of a century wyndham p 119 sullivan s first biographer suggested that thespis will be best remembered by exquisite musical setting to simple little gilbertian ballad several later commentators write favourably of song walbrook finds it one of of gilbert s ditties packed with cynicism and slyness expressed in terms of sentimental tenderness walbrook p 33 goldberg says that it is dainty simple and quite in vein of gilbert s words to which as in almost every later instance sullivan s setting provides an original rhythmic goldberg p 151 fitz gerald considers it quite a forerunner of gilbert at his easiest fitz gerald p 4 while dark and gray call it a typically dainty gilbertian love song worthy to be compared to best that he ever wrote jacobs dissents as music it is as trivial as sullivan ever wrote separately published version had several

transplanted in 1879 into one of gilbert and sullivan s most successful operas pirates of penzance in 1902 gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally he and sullivan had arrived in new york to produce new opera but composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in england fortunately entrance chorus from thespis fitted situation almost exactly so it was substituted instead several scholars have doubted that explanation in sullivan s autograph score for later work first part of climbing over rocky mountain is actually taken from a thespis copyist score with thespis words cancelled and new words written in which raises question of why sullivan had a thespis score to hand if not for that purpose march jerry part of thespis score discovered savoyard vol xx no 1 march 1981 p 25 also cited in stedman p 95 n 52 some suggest that other music from thespis could have been used in pirates goldberg suggests that it is reasonable to believe that sullivan made generous use of his thespis music in other operettas perhaps owing to circumstances under which pirates of penzance was written it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from unlucky of lucky pair reginald allen says that it seems certain from its rhythmic structure that part of act i finale of thespis here s a pretty tale for future and odysseys became original act ii finale in pirates at length we are provided with unusual felicity which was later deleted allen first night p 6 tillett and spencer propose that most of act i of pirates was taken from thespis tillett spencer 2002 however there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions except for climbing over rocky mountain neither author admitted to borrowing from thespis for later works stedman pp 95 96 ballet an engraving from graphic of a rehearsal that was used by spencer and tillett to help identify missing movements of ballet left thumb five movement ballet occurred somewhere in act ii staged by w h payne payne was a well known actor dancer and father of harry and fred payne regulars at gaiety who portrayed preposteros and stupidas in thespis see stewart maurice spark that lit bonfire in gilbert and sullivan news london spring 2003 a heading in libretto chorus and ballet attaches it to last section of finale but does not indicate how it figured in plot most press accounts placed it at about this point although some placed it slightly earlier in act at some performances ballet was performed in act i but it was certainly in act ii on opening night and it seems finally to have settled there rees pp 68 70 in 1990 roderick spencer and selwyn tillett discovered ballet from act ii of thespis two of five movements in same hand that had copied score of climbing over rocky mountain were found together with surviving performance materials for sullivan s 1864 ballet l ile enchantee another section was found in material for his 1897 ballet victoria and merrie england page numbering of surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for missing pieces and a contemporary engraving seen at left along with other circumstantial evidence allowed plausible identifications of two remaining movements a dragon costume used nowhere in libretto is presumably from ballet and harp visible in orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for gaiety s orchestra movements of appropriate length that made sense of these oddities were found in sullivan s other ballets tillett 1998 pp 28 34 and reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on cd sullivan tended to re use his ballet music of five movements that tillett and spencer identified only one waltz no 3 is not known to have been used in any other work three of movements had previously been used in l ile enchantee two of those and one other were eventually re used in victoria and merrie england one was also used in his incidental music to macbeth tillett 1998 p 34 sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a french language production of mikado in brussels which he duly did tillett suggests that thespis ballet was almost certainly music that sullivan provided given that it was only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera and that three weeks after producing gondoliers he is unlikely to have written something original tillett 1998 pp 35 37 text thumb 200px even version of libretto printed in 1911 is not free of sloppy editing note line he s you re brother surviving libretto is not version heard by audiences at gaiety theatre there are numerous discrepancies between original libretto and what was described as happening on stage and reviewers repeatedly quoted dialogue that has no equivalent in published libretto at least one song is missing rees pp 67 68 and an entire character venus is mentioned in at least five reviews as stout elderly and heavily made up she does not appear in libretto but was listed in first night programme stage directions in original are slip shod characters reappear without an entrance being noted rees p 46 or enter twice in quick succession without having exited rees pp 56 57 in addition sullivan told his mother that at least one song was cut after opening night and there must certainly have been other cuts given undue length of first performance but text of libretto as published remained virtually unchanged between december 1871 and march 1872 allen first night p 26 in a letter to percy strzelecki on 23 april 1890 gilbert apologised for condition of libretto he wrote i was in united states when it was published i had no opportunity of correcting proofs this will explain presence of innumerable typographical other errors but several scholars conclude that gilbert must have been remembering a trip following year as in fall of 1871 it would have been impossible for gilbert to travel to america and back in time for rehearsals of thespis ainger p 93 see also allen first night p 26 rees pp 90 91 even after first printing there does not seem to have been any effort to correct errors there were four separate issues of libretto between december and march but no corrections were made gilbert s final disposition of libretto came in 1911 when it was included in fourth volume of his original plays w s gilbert original plays fourth series london chatto windus 1911 pp 443 75 however gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition and so it reprinted 1871 text correcting only a few spelling mistakes rees pp 90 94 musical numbers music is known to survive for numbers shown in bold a ballet also survives but its location in order of musical numbers is uncertain reviews of opera hint at three additional numbers not in libretto but as their names and exact locations are unknown they are not listed rees pp 67 69
