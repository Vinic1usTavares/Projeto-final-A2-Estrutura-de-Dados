thumb para upright left john mosby alt old picture of american civil war officer in early 1863 confederate generals robert e lee and james ewell brown jeb stuart gave permission for john singleton mosby to lead a group of 15 partisan rangers that would operate within enemy lines in northern virginia mosby had been one of stuart s best scouts and his new cavalry unit became known as mosby s rangers mosby said that purpose of his unit was not to win major battles but to compel enemy either greatly to contract his lines or to reinforce them either of which would be of great advantage to southern cause this goal was accomplished through incessant attacks at night or day when his enemy was not prepared for conflict as partisan rangers mosby s rangers made quick strikes and then disappeared mosby patterned his technique after general francis marion a leader in american revolutionary war who learned his fighting style from cherokee indians mosby s rangers had no camp and typically scattered among local farmhouses especially in fauquier and loudoun counties mosby s weapon of choice was colt 6 shot revolver each of his men usually had two or more revolvers and no shooting was done until target was within range of weapon mosby disdained sabers and union cavalry standard procedure of getting close enough to use their sabers helped his men get their enemy within range of their revolvers mosby was a small town virginian before war his mosby s rangers operated primarily in a region surrounding warrenton that included clarke fauquier loudoun prince william and warren counties although mosby s rangers had existed for less than half a year mosby had already conducted successful raids including capture of general edwin h stoughton after his raid in fairfax

america another 1st virginia cavalry preferred that states remain in a union and was therefore loyal to federal government of united states 1st virginia cavalry that was loyal to union was often noted with union or loyal near its name and later with west on june 20 new state of west virginia consisting of northwestern counties of virginia joined union and loyal 1st virginia cavalry became 1st west virginia cavalry although many still called it 1st virginia 1st west virginia cavalry was most active and one of most effective west virginia regiments by end of american civil war it had 14 medal of honor winners most of any west virginia regiment however it took years for it to become an effective military unit one ohio soldier writing about some fighting that occurred in early 1862 said that 1st west virginia cavalry s original regiment commander was one of foreign adventurers who so largely officered our army at its beginning and were absolutely useless for any purpose except to draw their pay and to wear gold braid later in 1862 a report by union general james shields sent to secretary of war edwin m stanton said first virginia cavalry good for nothing 1st west virginia s first two commanders were court martialed and during may 1863 it had no permanent commander regiment was under temporary command of lieutenant colonel john s krepps according to a may 5 after action report of brigadier general john j abercrombie but a report by regiment s major benjamin f chamberlain lists himself as commanding neither is mentioned in three union after action reports as being present when may 3 attack on a detachment of regiment occurred major josiah steele is regiment s highest ranking officer discussed in reports and also mosby mentions commanding officer maj steel in his memoirs on may 3 1863 detachment was less than west of washington dc near junction of orange and alexandria and manassas gap railroads this junction was called warrenton junction and it is about east of town of warrenton a detachment of about 100 men finished their mission for day although it was still early in morning around 9 00am their horses were unsaddled and feeding and few precautions had been taken for union force s security based on a newspaper article detachment included men from f g and l report of general stahel mentions two captains from 1st west virginia cavalry william harris

charge and his men raised a yell surprised men from 1st west virginia cavalry ran for their weapons and sought cover in three nearby buildings a small stream slowed mosby enough that all but about 20 of surprised soldiers could get behind cover most of 20 men that were too far from buildings were quickly captured cavalry s major josiah steele seeing that it was impossible to saddle horses in time to meet attack cut horses loose to prevent them from being captured men who sought cover in two smallest buildings soon found that they had little protection and quickly surrendered many of union soldiers took cover in largest building which was located near railroad tracks mosby s men used their revolvers to attack overcrowded building and both sides fought fiercely fighting continued for about half an hour steele and captain william a mccoy of company c initially refused mosby s demand that they surrender a few of mosby s men entered first floor of building steele and mccoy were wounded as were many of men on first floor although men in first floor surrendered men on second floor continued fight so mosby had his men set structure on fire this caused remaining members of 1st

after mosby collected prisoners from burning house when hammond arrived many of rangers were trying to collect horses and discarded weapons mosby had about 40 prisoners that he was about to take back to warrenton this time it was mosby who was unprepared his rangers were scattered and he had not designated a second in command he did not see new yorkers until they were about away unable to rally his troops he was forced to give up much of what he captured while his men fled in every direction fight became a running battle with union cavalry pursuing mosby s rangers 5th new york s captain abram h krom was shot twice face and leg and his horse killed yet krom and continued fighting with his saber mosby suffered significant losses including some of his more skilled men and 40 horses some rangers escaped by crawling to safety or hiding 1st vermont cavalry arrived after initial fighting and joined pursuit of mosby s men more men from 5th new york cavalry joined pursuit after they retrieved their horses newspaper reports later believed mosby was wounded and his best officer and best spy were among casualties casualties casualties for union totaled to 19 1st west virginia had 2 killed and 14 wounded including 2 officers one of officers steele was mortally wounded 5th new york cavalry had 3 wounded including two officers mosby was still able to keep 2 prisoners from 1st west virginia mosby had over 30 of his men including several officers taken prisoner and at least one killed it was also believed that some of mosby s wounded and killed were hidden by locals about 40 horses were also captured about 16 of prisoners were severely wounded templeton notorious spy actually madison templeman was killed although one general s report and a newspaper account claimed mosby was wounded that was not true aftermath at least one source believes that union leaders hid incompetency of 1st west virginia cavalry writing that in an effort to excuse lax security they later reported that front rank of rangers were dressed in union uniforms union general j j abercrombie s report that said mosby s front rank was dressed in uniform of united states soldiers a newspaper article also stated that mosby s men were mistaken for 1st vermont cavalry mosby agrees that his men were mistaken for union cavalry but wrote that his men were all dressed in gray of confederate army union sergeant edwin havens described mosby s men that were captured as having no regularity of uniforms being clad in everything they could find and had no mention of blue uniforms worn by united

richmond reinstated richmond was reinstated as regimental commander on june 12 later in june after new state of west virginia joined union 1st west virginia cavalry became known as 1st west virginia cavalry all three union cavalry regiments involved in warrenton junction raid 5th new york 1st vermont 1st west virginia fought at battle of gettysburg as part of same brigade richmond proved to be a good leader and assumed temporary command of brigade at gettysburg after commander was killed he led brigade for part of pursuit after battle during that pursuit 1st west virginia cavalry charged down a mountain and captured a confederate artillery piece and an entire wagon train in 1865 1st west virginia cavalry was in third brigade of third division of general philip sheridan s army of shenandoah this army eliminated general jubal early s army of valley at battle of waynesboro virginia when third brigade charged and cut off over half of early s force which forced that portion of rebels to surrender regiment also prepared for battle but did not fight in battle of appomattox court house as general robert e lee s army of northern virginia surrendered in his memoirs mosby noted that major hammond was wise to attack immediately at warrenton junction not waiting for rest of his command which enabled 5th new york cavalry to catch mosby in disorder and scattered hammond assumed command of 5th new york cavalry on june 1 1863 he had an important role in battle of hanover when brigade was traveling to gettysburg his regiment s historian said he was known for his coolness and bravery and considered him a great equestrian and leader in 1864 new york herald said that colonel hammond was one of best officers in service hammond was not only officer in warrenton junction raid that would eventually command a regiment abram krom a captain in 5th new york cavalry became a major and briefly commanded regiment in 1864 after hammond left mosby learned thumb 250px right mosby historical marker in virginia alt historical marker mentioning normally scouted gathered intelligence and planned thoroughly at warrenton junction he was distracted by an unexpected opportunity he later wrote when i ordered charge at warrenton junction i had no idea whether i was attacking a hundred or a thousand men not only was this reckless it also prevented mosby from accomplishing his goal of attacking hooker s supply wagons he also wrote it was a mistake my making this fight even if i had been completely successful mosby also learned that working with 100 men was different than working with 15 his men were from various units and had none of cohesion and discipline that springs from organization since he had designated no unit commanders or even a second in command it became difficult to rally his men when they were scattered about during fight he also neglected to establish a security detail pickets surrounding area of fighting which resulted in his surprise by 5th new york cavalry mosby learned from his mistakes and mosby s rangers became a constant concern for union commanders in virginia general ulysses s grant narrowly escaped capture by mosby s men and decided to avoid traveling to washington from his headquarters with army of potomac during september and first half of november 1864 mosby claimed to have captured not less than seven hundred prisoners two of sheridan s division commanders general george custer and general william h powell became especially frustrated with mosby retaliations and injustices occurred depending on one s point of view and powell threatened to execute 22 prisoners for every one of his men he considered murdered by outlawed guerrillas after receiving a letter from mosby sheridan agreed to a truce in brutality committed by both sides against prisoners although more attempts were made to eliminate mosby s rangers rangers were active until end of war after war was over mosby became a republican and worked several jobs
