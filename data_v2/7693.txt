new york dolls is debut album by american hard rock band new york dolls it was released on july 27 1973 by mercury records in years leading up to album new york dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in lower manhattan after forming in 1971 however most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion group later appeared in exaggerated drag on album cover for shock value after signing a contract with mercury new york dolls recorded their first album at record plant in new york city with producer todd rundgren who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of band despite stories of conflicts during recording sessions lead singer david johansen and guitarist sylvain sylvain later said rundgren successfully captured how band sounded live their music on album incorporated carefree rock and roll brill building pop influences and campy sensibilities while johansen s colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth teen alienation adolescent romance and authenticity new york dolls was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners band proved difficult to market outside their native new york and developed a reputation for rock star excesses while touring united states in support of album despite its commercial failure new york dolls was an influential precursor to 1970s punk rock movement and has since been named in various publications as one of best debut records in rock music and one of greatest albums of all time background in 1971 vocalist david johansen formed new york dolls with guitarists johnny thunders and rick rivets bassist arthur kane and drummer billy murcia rivets was replaced by sylvain sylvain in 1972 band was meant to be a temporary project for members who were club going youths that had gone to new york city with different career pursuits as sylvain recalled we just said hey maybe this will get us some chicks that seemed like a good enough reason he and murcia originally planned to work in clothing business and opened a boutique on lexington avenue that was across street from a toy repair shop called new york dolls hospital which gave them idea for their name group soon began playing regularly in lower manhattan and earned a cult following within a few months with their reckless style of rock music nonetheless record companies were hesitant to sign them because of their onstage cross dressing and blatant vulgarity in october 1972 they garnered interest of critics when they opened for english rock band faces at empire pool in wembley however on new york dolls first tour of england that year murcia died after consuming a lethal combination of alcohol and methaqualone they enlisted jerry nolan as his replacement while managers marty thau steve leber and david krebs still struggled to find band a record deal thumb left todd rundgren pictured in 1978 was hired to produce new york dolls after returning to new york new york dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as max s kansas city and mercer arts center in what sylvain called a determined effort to fake it until they could make it we had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous we acted like we were already rock stars arthur even called his bass excalibur after king arthur it was crazy their performance at mercer arts center was attended by journalist and mercury records publicity director bud scoppa and paul nelson an a r executive for label scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of rolling stones i split after first set paul stuck around for second set though and after show he called me and said you should have stayed i think they re really special then after that i fell in love with them anyway in march 1973 group signed a two album deal with a us 25 000 advance from mercury according to sylvain some of members parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves for new york dolls debut album mercury wanted to find a record producer who could make most out of group s sound and hype they had received from critics and fans in new york at band s first board meeting in chicago johansen fell asleep in mercury s conference room while record executives discussed potential producers he awoke when they mentioned todd rundgren a musician and producer who by 1972 had achieved unexpected rock stardom with his double album something anything and its hit singles i saw light and hello it s me rundgren had socialized at venues such as max s kansas city and first saw new york dolls when his girlfriend at time model bebe buell brought him there to see them play known for having refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions rundgren had become increasingly interested in progressive rock sounds by time he was enlisted to produce new york dolls debut album consequently his initial impression of group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by standards of other unsophisticated new york bands dolls weren t out to expand any musical horizons said rundgren although he enjoyed thunders attitude and johansen s charismatic antics onstage johansen referred to rundgren as an expert on second rate rock n roll but also said band was kind of persona non grata at time with most producers they were afraid of us i don t know why but todd wasn t we all liked him from max s todd was cool and he was a producer sylvain on other hand felt decision to enlist him was based on availability time and money it wasn t a long list todd was in new york and seemed like he could handle pace upon being hired rundgren declared that only person who can produce a new york record is someone who lives in new york recording and production mercury booked new york dolls at record plant in new york city where they recorded their self titled debut album in april 1973 rundgren was originally concerned that they had taken worst sounding studio in city at that time because it was only one available to them with short time given to record and release album he later said that expectations for band and festive atmosphere of recording sessions proved to be more of a problem dolls were critics darlings and press had kind of adopted them plus there were lots of extra people around socializing which made it hard to concentrate new york dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of 17 000 equivalent to in with a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for album band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows in johansen s own words we went into a room and just recorded it wasn t like these people who conceptualize things it was just a document of what was going on at time in studio new york dolls dressed in their usual flashy clothes rundgren who did not approve of their raucous sound at one point yelled at them during sessions to get glitter out of your asses and play sylvain recalled rundgren inviting buell and their chihuahua to studio and putting latter atop an expensive mixing console while johansen acknowledged that his recollections of sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them it was like 1920s with palm tree decor and stuff well that s how i remember it anyway he also said rundgren directed band from control room with engineer jack douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded album according to scopa group s carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with rundgren s professional work ethic and schedule he doesn t put up with bullshit i mean band rarely started their live sets before midnight so who knows todd was very much in charge in studio however and i got impression that everybody was looking to him although sylvain said rundgren was not an interfering producer he occasionally involved himself to improve a take sylvain recalled moments when rundgren went into isolation booth with nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him to use as a click track during another session he stopped a take and walked out of control room to plug in kane s bass cabinet scoppa who paid afternoon visits to studio overheard rundgren say yeah that s all you needed okay let s try it again and ultimately found exchange funny and indicative of rundgren s opinion of band todd was such a musician while they were just getting by on attitude and energy but as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got job done really well rundgren felt johansen s wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in sense that johansen demonstrated a propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into music particularly on personality crisis while recording song johansen walked back into control room and asked rundgren if his vocals sounded ludicrous enough because new york dolls had little money sylvain and thunders played austerely designed and affordable gibson les paul junior guitars on record they jokingly referred to them as automatic guitars due to their limited sound shaping features to amplify their guitars they ran a marshall standalone amplifier through speaker cabinets of a fender dual showman and occasionally used a fender twin reverb some songs were embellished with additional instruments including buddy bowser s brassy saxophone on lonely planet boy johansen sang into distorted guitar pickups for additional vocals and overdubbed them into song he also played an asian gong for vietnamese baby and harmonica on pills for personality crisis sylvain originally played on record plant s yamaha grand piano before rundgren added his own piano flourishes to both that song and private world rundgren also contributed to background vocals heard on trash and played synthesizers on vietnamese baby and frankenstein orig which sylvain recalled i remember him getting those weird sounds from this beautiful old moog synthesizer he brought in he said it was a model that only he and beatles had new york dolls was mixed in less than half a day rundgren felt band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from mixing session for final mix he minimized sound of nolan s drumming in retrospect rundgren said quality of mix was poor because band had hurried and questioned him while mixing record it s too easy for it to become a free for all with every musician only hearing their own part and not whole they all had other places to be so rather than split they rushed thing and if that wasn t enough they took it to crappy mastering lab that mercury had put them in thunders famously complained to a journalist that rundgren fucked up mix on new york dolls adding to stories that two had clashed during album s recording both johansen and scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between two and that thunders typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted johansen later praised rundgren for how he enhanced and equalized each instrument giving listeners impression that they re in a room and there s a band playing while sylvain said his mix accurately captured how band sounded live music and lyrics new york dolls features ten original songs and one cover 1963 bo diddley song pills johansen described album as a little jewel of urban folk art rundgren on other hand said band s sensibilities were different from urban new york thing because they had been raised outside manhattan and drew on carefree rock and roll and brill building pop influences such as shangri las their songs as punky as they were usually had a lot to do with same old boy girl thing but in a much more inebriated way johansen quoted lyric you d best believe i m in love l u v from shangri las give him a great big kiss 1964 when he opened looking for a kiss which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs on subway train he used lyrics from american folk standard someone s in kitchen with dinah in opinion of critic stephen thomas erlewine album s rowdy hard rock songs also revamped riffs from chuck berry and rolling stones resulting in music that sounded edgy and threatening in spite of new york dolls wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities personality crisis featured raunchy dual guitars boogie woogie piano and a histrionic pause while trash was a punky pop rock song with brassy singing several songs on new york dolls function as what robert hilburn deemed colorful if exaggerated expressions of teen alienation according to robert christgau because many of manhattan s white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy only ill behaved young people from outer boroughs like band could capture oppressive excitement manhattan holds for a half formed human being private world an escapist plea for stability was co written by kane who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in music business johansen band s main lyricist said frankenstein orig was about how kids come to manhattan from all over they re kind of like whipped dogs they re very repressed their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other it s a love song its titular monster was interpreted by critic frank kogan to be personification of new york and its ethos ostentation and terror dreams and fear while johansen asking listeners if they could make it with frankenstein involved more than sexual slang david was asking if you if i could make it with monster of life whether i could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster sylvain jokingly said frankenstein was titled with parenthetical qualifier because rock musician edgar winter had released his song of same name before band could record their own our song frankenstein was a big hit in our live show now his thing didn t sound at all like ours but i m sure he stole our title although new york dolls exhibited tongue in cheek qualities gary graff observed a streetwise realism in album s songs in christgau s opinion johansen s colloquial and morally superior lyrics were imbued with humor and a sense of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme was authenticity this theme was explored in stories about lost youths as on subway train or in a study of a specific subject such as on personality crisis he argued that beneath band s decadent and campy surface were lyrics about modern world one nuclear bomb could blow it all away pills and personality crises weren t evils easy necessary or whatever they were strategies and and positive pleasures according to journalist steve taylor vietnamese baby dealt with impact of vietnam war at time on everyday activities for people whose fun was undermined by thoughts of collective guilt on songs such as subway train and trash johansen used ambiguity as a lyrical mode in kogan s opinion johansen sang in an occasionally unintelligible manner and wrote in a perplexing fictional style that was lazy yet ingenious as it provided his lyrics an abundance of emotional meaning and interpretation david never provides an objective framework he s always jumping from voice to voice so you re hearing a character addressing another character or narrator addressing character or character or narrator addressing us all jammed up together so you re hearing bits of conversation and bits of subjective description in no kind of chronological order but as someone says in vietnamese baby everything connects on trash johansen undercut his vaguely pansexual beliefs with possibility of going to fairyland if he took a lover s leap with song s subject release and reception right thumb new york dolls performing on in 1973 new york dolls was released on july 27 1973 in united states and on october 19 in united kingdom its controversial cover featured band dressed in exaggerated drag including high wigs messy make up high heels and garters photo was used for shock value and on back of album band is photographed in their usual stage wear to announce album s release mercury published an advertisement slogan that read introducing new york dolls a band you re gonna like whether you like it or not while other ads called them band you love to hate two double a sided 7 singles were released trash personality crisis in july and jet boy vietnamese baby in november 1973 neither of which charted new york dolls was commercially unsuccessful and only reached number 116 on american top lps while in uk it failed to chart altogether record sold over 100 000 copies at time and fell well short of expectations in press according to rolling stone in 2003 it ended up selling fewer than 500 000 copies music journalist phil strongman said its commercial failure could be attributed to new york dolls divisive effect on listeners including writers from same magazine in a feature story on band for melody maker mark plummer dismissed their playing as poorest he had ever seen while magazine s reporter michael watts viewed them as an encouraging albeit momentary presence in what he felt was a lifeless rock and roll scene at time in readers poll album earned band awards in categories of best new group of year and worst new group of year new york dolls nonetheless received widespread acclaim from contemporary reviewers in a rave review for nme nick kent said band s raunchy style of rock and roll was vividly recorded by rundgren on an album that besides iggy and stooges raw power 1973 served as only one so far to fully define just exactly where 1970s rock should be coming from trouser press founder and editor ira robbins viewed new york dolls as an innovative record brilliantly chaotic and well produced by rundgren ellen willis writing for new yorker said it was by far year s most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs were immediate classics particularly personality crisis and trash which she called transcendent in newsday christgau hailed new york dolls as best hard rock band in country and maybe world right now writing that their special genius was combining shrewd songwriting savvy of early 1960s popular music with anarchic sound of late 1960s heavy metal he claimed record s frenzied approach various emotions and wild noise conveyed manhattan s harsh deviant thrill better than velvet underground rolling stone critic tony glover believed band s impressive live sound was mostly preserved on album but he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs feeling they made some lyrics incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous although he was surprised rundgren s production worked well with group s raunchy sound on most of songs glover ultimately asked whether or not record alone will impress as much as seeing them live they re a highly watchable group after album s release new york dolls toured us as a supporting act for english rock band mott hoople reviews complimented their songwriting thunders and sylvain s guitar interplay and noted their campy fashion and resemblance of johansen and thunders to mick jagger and keith richards however some critics panned them as an unserious group of amateurs who could not play or sing during their appearance on old grey whistle test in england show s host bob harris dismissed their music as mock rock in his on air comments they also developed a reputation for rock star excesses including drugs groupies trashed hotel rooms and public disturbances and according to ben edmonds of creem became most walked out on band in history of show business strongman wrote that band and album were difficult to market because of their kitschy style and how murcia s death had exacerbated their association with hard drugs which wasn t altogether true in early days they remained most popular band in new york city where their halloween night concert at waldorf astoria in 1973 drew hundreds of young fans and local television coverage legacy and influence new york dolls has since been often cited as one of greatest debut albums in rock music one of genre s most popular cult records and a foundational work for late 1970s punk rock movement it was a pivotal influence on many of rock and roll punk and glam rock groups that followed including ramones kiss sex pistols damned and guns n roses according to mojo collection 2007 record ignited punk rock and could still inspire more movements because of music s abundant attitude and passion while encyclopedia of popular music writer colin larkin deemed it a major landmark in rock history oozing attitude vitality and controversy from every note chuck eddy named it one of records crucial to evolution of rock music in 101 albums that changed popular music 2009 chris smith wrote that new york dolls pioneered punk s aesthetic of amateurish musicianship on album which undermined musical sophistication that had developed over past decade in popular music and had been perfected months earlier on pink floyd s dark side of moon 1973 in guardians list of 1000 albums to hear before you die newspaper credited record for serving as an efficacious antidote to excesses of prog rock in a retrospective review for allmusic erlewine website s senior editor claimed that new york dolls was a more quintessential proto punk album than any of stooges releases because of how it plunders history while celebrating it creating a sleazy urban mythology along way david fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than david bowie s ziggy stardust 1972 or anything by marc bolan because of how band captured both glory and sorrow of glam high jinx and wasted youth with electric in rolling stone album guide 2004 joe gross called it an absolutely essential record and epic sleaze sound of five young men shaping big city in their own scuzzy image sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how rundgren recorded his guitar through left speaker and thunders guitar on right side an orientation which he said younger bands such as ramones and sex pistols adopted rundgren was amused by how record became considered a precursor to punk movement irony is that i wound up producing seminal punk album but i was never really thought of as a punk producer and i never got called by punk acts they probably thought i was too expensive for what they were going for but dolls didn t really consider themselves punk new york dolls has frequently been named one of greatest albums of all time according to acclaimed music it is 167th most prominently ranked record on critics all time lists in 1978 it was ranked as 199th greatest record ever in paul
