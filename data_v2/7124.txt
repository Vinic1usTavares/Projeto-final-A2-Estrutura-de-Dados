share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame my confession follows and takes place on a crucifix that i ultimately come down from this is not a mocking of church it is no different than a person wearing a cross or taking up cross as it says in bible my performance is neither anti christian sacrilegious or blasphemous rather it is my plea to audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see world as a unified whole i believe in my heart that if jesus were alive today he would be doing same thing my specific intent is to bring attention to millions of children in africa who are dying every day and are living without care without medicine and without hope i am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can
