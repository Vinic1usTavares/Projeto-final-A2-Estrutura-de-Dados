to keep his technology out of government s hands downey and favreau who had been handed a script and worked from it on first movie conceived part of film s story themselves on stark being a hero downey said it s kind of heroic but really kind of on his own behalf so i think there s probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said i am iron man that he s now really wondering what that means if you have all this cushion like he does and public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power i think he s way too insulated to be okay downey put on 20 pounds of muscle to reprise role six year old davin ransom portrays tony stark as a child gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts stark s closest friend budding love interest and business partner pepper is promoted to ceo of stark industries on her character s promotion paltrow opined when we start iron man 2 pepper and tony are very much in same vibe as movie progresses pepper is given more responsibility and she s promoted and it s nice to see her sort of grow up in that way i think it really suits her job fits her really well paltrow expressed excitement about working with johansson don cheadle as james rhodey rhodes war machine an officer in u s air force and tony stark s close personal friend who later operates war machine armor cheadle replaces terrence howard from first film cheadle only had a few hours to accept role and did not even know what storyline rhodes would undergo he commented that he is a comic book fan but had not previously participated in comics themed films due to scarcity of black superheroes cheadle said he thought iron man was a robot before first film came out on how he approached his character cheadle stated i go what s common denominator here and common denominator was really his friendship with tony and that s what we really tried to track in this one how is their friendship impacted once tony comes out and owns i am iron man cheadle said his suit was of metal and that he could not touch his face while wearing it scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff black widow an undercover spy for s h i e l d posing as stark s new assistant johansson dyed her hair red before she landed part hoping that it would help convince favreau that she was right for role on why she chose role johansson said black widow character resonated with me she is a superhero but she s also human she s small but she s strong she is dark and has faced death so many times that she has a deep perspective on value of life it s hard not to admire her she stated that she had a bit of a freak out moment when she first saw cat suit when asked about fighting in costume johansson responded a big part of me is like can i move in this can i run in it can i like throw myself over things with this and i think just prep you just have to put in hours that s what i realized is that just putting in hours and doing training and repetition and basically just befriending stunt team and spending all day every day just over and over and over and over until you sell it sam rockwell as justin hammer a rival weapons manufacturer sam rockwell was considered for role of tony stark in first film and he accepted role of hammer without reading script he had never heard of character before he was contacted about part and was unaware hammer is an old englishman in comics rockwell said i worked with jon favreau on this film called made and justin theroux who wrote script is an old friend of mine they sort of cooked up this idea and pitched it to kevin feige what they did they were maybe going to do one villain like they did with jeff bridges but then they decided to split villains and really mickey rourke is main villain but i come to his aid rockwell described his character as plucky comic relief but he s got a little bit of an edge mickey rourke as ivan vanko whiplash a russian physicist and ex convict who builds a pair of arc reactor based electric whips to exact vengeance on stark family character is an amalgam of whiplash and crimson dynamo rourke visited prison to research role and he suggested half of character s dialogue be in russian he also suggested addition of tattoos gold teeth and a fondness for a pet cockatoo paying for teeth and bird with his own money rourke explained that he did not want to play a one dimensional bad guy and wanted to challenge audience to see something redeemable in him not knowing anything about computers rourke described pretending to be tech savvy as hardest part of role samuel l jackson as nick fury director of s h i e l d jackson signed a nine film contract to play character on subject of his character not seeing any action in film jackson said we still haven t moved nick fury into bad ass zone he s still just kind of a talker director jon favreau reprises his role as happy hogan tony stark s bodyguard and chauffeur while clark gregg and leslie bibb reprise their roles as s h i e l d agent phil coulson and reporter christine everhart respectively john slattery appears as tony s father howard stark and garry shandling appears as united states senator stern who wants stark to give iron man s

an unnamed character who was subsequently cut from film favreau then gave her role of chess roberts a reporter covering stark expo yevgeni lazarev appears as ivan vanko s father anton vanko kate mara portrays a process server who summons tony to government hearing and stan lee appears as himself but is mistaken for larry king additionally news anchor christiane and political commentator bill o reilly play themselves in newscasts adam goldstein appears as himself and film is dedicated to his memory further cameos include tesla motors ceo elon musk and oracle corporation ceo larry ellison favreau s son max appears as a child wearing an iron man mask whom stark saves from a drone this was retroactively made as introduction of a young peter parker to mcu as confirmed in june 2017 by eventual spider man actor tom holland feige and spider man homecoming director jon watts production development thumb right jon favreau meeting with members of u s air force while filming at edwards air force base jon favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for iron man with obadiah stane jeff bridges becoming iron monger during sequels after a meeting between favreau and various comic book writers including mark millar stane became main villain in iron man millar argued mandarin whom favreau originally intended to fill that role was too fantastical favreau concurred deciding i look at mandarin more like how in star wars you had emperor but darth vader is guy you want to see fight then you work your way to time when lightning bolts are shooting out of fingers and all that stuff could happen but you can t have what happened in return of jedi happen in a new hope you just can t do it favreau also discussed in interviews how films version of mandarin allows us to incorporate whole pantheon of villains he mentioned that s h i e l d would continue to have a major role during development favreau said film would explore stark s alcoholism but it would not be demon in a bottle version while promoting first film downey stated that stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age effects of revealing he is iron man and pepper getting a boyfriend downey later clarified that film was not a strict adaptation of demon in a bottle storyline from comic book series but was instead about interim space between origin and demon story arc shane black gave some advice on script and suggested to favreau and downey that they model stark on j robert oppenheimer who became depressed with being destroyer of worlds after working on manhattan project pre production immediately following iron mans release marvel studios announced that they were developing a sequel with an intended release date of april 30 2010 in july
