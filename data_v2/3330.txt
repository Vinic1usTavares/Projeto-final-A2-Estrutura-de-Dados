production development thumb right zooey deschanel was cast against her previous types as a glamour girl writer director martin hynes referred to film as very uncomfortably autobiographical he had learned that his mother was diagnosed with cancer when making his 1999 film big split his marriage ended soon after his mother died which hynes saw as a huge amount of loss after deciding that i have to do less he took a road trip spending much of his time writing as he traveled he wrote really different things some of which were pieced together and led to his script for go getter which he wrote in 2004 within six months of script s completion producer lucy barzun donnelly had raised entire budget of film without any actors attached at time barzun donnelly recommended to hynes that he consider lou taylor pucci for lead role of mercer believing that he was perfect hynes watched pucci s 2005 film and thought that we d be so lucky to have him he contacted pucci about role but was leaving for norway in less than a week to attend a friend s wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving pucci was in san francisco on a press tour and hynes flew from los angeles to have lunch with him hynes said of meeting i think we really got each other and pucci accepted role a week later jena malone signed on to portray joely because she loved script and was keen to play a woman on cusp of learning to toy with her sexual manipulation she only later learned that hynes had written role with her in mind having previously worked with her on short film al as in al hynes said that zooey deschanel maura tierney and bill duke each joined cast because they read script and really liked it he made a deliberate attempt to cast deschanel and malone against their previous types he described deschanel as a glamour girl and malone as a sexually mature woman filming thumb right a scene with pucci and malone was filmed at reno arch four months before filming began hynes asked barzun donnelly to set us 20 000 25 000 aside from film s budget so that he could perform a test shoot hynes cinematographer byron shah a camera assistant and a stand in for mercer as pucci had not yet been cast traveled to every location in film except for mexico over they shot of film testing different filters lenses film stocks and shooting styles hynes wrote an 85 page shot list scop ing out entire film he called test shoot an incredible boon and remarked that not one frame of it ended up on movie but it paid for itself time and time again after returning to los angeles he visited each of locations including mexico again with principal and technical crews principal photography began in mid october 2005 and continued through november over a total period of 25 days film was shot in sequence with production starting in eugene oregon and then moving to reno nevada and subsequently ensenada mexico hynes called filming a high wire act whole way and said that one of biggest challenges was transporting crew of 40 from oregon to mexico sometimes changing locations twice a day with few hours of daylight a crew member lost project s filming permit on last day of shooting in mexico and filming at rush hour was halted by police hynes took a smaller camera to film several blocks away from original set but second assistant director soon arrived warning that police were coming and that they would be taken to prison because they did not have paperwork for filming hynes and crew scatter ed leaving pucci alone further down street which hynes claims is his strangest experience in film industry crew later returned to los angeles to shoot final scenes and to commence post production music thumb right upright hynes described m ward s music as mercer s sound when searching for film s music one of producers suggested to hynes that he go to a bright eyes concert singer and guitarist m ward opened show as a supporting act and hynes recalled thinking holy shit that s guy that s it he s perfect hynes sent an unsolicited script of film to ward who read it and signed on to project when there was no financing behind film nor any actors attached he told hynes that any of his songs could be used in film hynes said that in post production he tested every one of ward s songs including instrumental versions in final cut in beginning of film mercer comes across a band hynes had always intended for whichever song they were playing to become overture of film ward s song vincent o brien became that overture and described continuous presence of ward s music as a reminder of home he decided that when joely entered it was right to step away from mercer s sound m ward and convey that this movie has been overtaken by forces outside his control using black keys 10 a m automatic and keep me in addition to replacements color me impressed hynes was able to obtain at a low cost banshee beat by animal collective and late elliott smith s song coast to coast after writing a heartfelt letter to smith s mother and sister his main estate holders he also used a mighty fortress is our god by novelty singer corn mo at insistence of nick offerman who plays three minor

4 stars commending film for being emotionally truthful painfully funny and vibrantly alive and labeling it a near perfect road movie stephen holden of new york times believed that much of dialogue is so quirky it sounds overheard instead of scripted and called cast correspondingly spontaneous new york magazine s chief film critic david edelstein praised hynes talent for deadpan jaw droppers that aren t self consciously quirky and thought that in go getter filmmaking itself feels like manifest destiny todd mccarthy writing for variety was impressed by pucci s performance and shah s

less positive los angeles times carina chocano felt that despite flashes of genuine emotion go getter eventually succumbs to its own and that moments of beauty were outweighed by mannered dialogue and hamstrung performances owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly graded film as a c saying that it travels but it doesn t go anywhere and likening pucci to a wan passive johnny depp hollywood reporter critic frank scheck praised film s appealing performances sun dappled cinematography and occasional witty dialogue but thought that it was contrived and derivative and a little too pleased with itself
