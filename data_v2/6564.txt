mercedes benz clr was a set of racing cars developed for mercedes benz through a collaboration with in house tuning division mercedes amg and motorsports specialists hwa gmbh designed to meet le mans grand touring prototype lmgtp regulations clrs were intended to compete in sports car events during 1999 most notably at 24 hours of le mans which mercedes had last won in it was third in a series of sports cars raced by mercedes following clk gtrs and clk lms that had debuted in 1997 and 1998 respectively like its predecessors clr retained elements of mercedes benz s production cars including a v8 engine loosely based on a design used in some models as well as bodywork based on clk and cl classes clr s bodywork was lower in overall height than that used on to produce less drag three clrs were entered for le mans in 1999 after team performed nearly of testing cars suffered aerodynamic instabilities along circuit s long high speed straight sections car of australian mark webber became airborne and crashed in qualifying requiring it to be rebuilt webber and repaired clr returned to track in a final practice session on morning of race but during its first lap around circuit car once again became airborne and landed on its roof mercedes withdrew damaged clr but chose to continue in race despite accidents remaining cars were hastily altered and drivers were given instructions to avoid closely following other cars nearly four hours into race scotsman peter dumbreck was battling amongst race leaders when his clr suffered same instability and became airborne this time vaulting circuit s safety barriers and crashing in an open field after several somersaults this and earlier incidents led mercedes not only to withdraw its remaining car from event immediately but also to cancel entire clr programme and move company out of sports car racing accidents led to changes in regulations dictating design of le mans racing cars as well as alterations to circuit itself to increase safety background thumb left a clk gtr competing in fia gt championship in 1996 mercedes benz s motorsports programmes included support for cars in formula one indycar and international touring car championship itcc following collapse of itcc at end of 1996 season mercedes attention shifted to a new international series fia gt championship racing partners amg were tasked with developing a design to meet federation internationale de l automobile s gt1 regulations for new championship new cars known as clk gtrs were designed for use both as racing and road cars available to public as series regulations required racing cars to be based on production models clk gtrs were successful in their debut season winning seven of eleven races and earning both drivers and teams championships for 1998 season amg refined clk gtr s design with launch of new clk lm a major change for new design was replacement of clk gtr s v12 engine with a smaller v8 thought by mercedes to be more suitable to take on longer endurance events such as 24 hours of le mans a race not part of fia gt calendar despite earning pole position for le mans new cars were unreliable and both lasted less than three hours before retiring from mechanical failures race was won by mercedes fia gt rivals porsche mercedes did go on to win its second straight fia gt championships later that year after winning all ten races after dominance of mercedes most of gt1 class competitors chose to not return to fia gt championship for 1999 leading fia to eliminate category from series automobile club de l ouest aco organisers of 24 hours of le mans chose to follow fia s lead and no longer allow gt1 category cars to enter le mans while fia gt concentrated solely on its lower gt2 category in 1999 aco created a new category of race car known as a le mans grand touring prototype lmgtp lmgtp regulations for closed cockpit cars were similar to former gt1 regulations but shared many elements with aco s existing open cockpit le mans prototype lmp category mercedes no longer able to compete in fia gt championship with clk lms chose to concentrate on aco s new lmgtp category development thumb left low profile of clr work on designing a new car to meet lmgtp regulations began in september 1998 as mercedes was closing out its second fia gt championship season development was led by hwa gmbh motorsports division of amg which became an independent company following year lmgtp rules did not require road versions of cars to be built so gerhard ungar chief designer for hwa was free to develop clr without concern for road legality issues or inclusion of driver comforts transition from gt1 to lmgtp also allowed a decrease in minimum allowed weight from to new design had a much smaller cockpit monocoque made from carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque derived design of its lower half from clk lm s combination of carbon fibre and steel tube frame but required a full carbon and aluminium upper half because of new load tests mandatory for lmgtp cockpits bodywork of clr was also shorter in overall height compared to clk lm while nose was substantially lower and flatter than its predecessor due to a shorter wheelbase allowing longer overhangs aerodynamic development on design was carried out at university of stuttgart s wind tunnel and assisted by aerodynamic specialists fondmetal technologies aerodynamic emphasis was placed on low drag for maximum top speed mercedes benz s brand image was also retained with reuse of clk class tail lights from clk lm and a front grill and headlights based on then new cl class engine for clr was also a variant of design used on clk lm 32 valve naturally aspirated v8 engine was loosely based on m119 engine used in mercedes benz road cars at that time a previous variant of m119 had won le mans for mercedes in 1989 displacement was increased from to to compensate for new air restrictor limitations in lmgtp category which allowed engine to produce approximately first engine was completed and began testing in december 1998 6 speed sequential gearbox came directly from clk lm while bridgestone continued as team s tyre supplier suspension setup from clk lm was largely carried over to clr although a central spring was added to rear suspension mercedes publicly announced its clr programme in february 1999 just days before first car began private testing at california speedway in united states testing continued into march at california as well as homestead miami speedway in florida before team moved to circuit de nevers magny cours in france at magny cours three clrs completed a 30 hour test session covering on 20 april clr was shown to press for first time during a test session at hockenheimring in germany by that point in development process clrs had covered in testing without any major failures preparation initial schedule for clrs consisted of participation in may pre qualifying and testing session at le mans in preparation for race in june at team s hockenheim test session plans were announced to enter several races after le mans first scheduled for july was to be an exhibition event consisting of two races at norisring street circuit in nuremberg germany mercedes planned to enter four clrs in event team would then end its season with final three races of american le mans series 10 hour petit le mans endurance at road atlanta and shorter races at laguna seca raceway and las vegas motor speedway more than 200 personnel from mercedes benz and hwa formed crew for three cars although team was officially known as amg mercedes as part of its launch announcement in february 1999 mercedes named nine drivers to team retained from fia gt programme were christophe bouchut jean marc gounon bernd schneider marcel tiemann and mark webber nick heidfeld then a test driver for mclaren mercedes formula one team was added to team for his first experience with sports cars former macau grand prix winner and all japan formula three champion peter dumbreck also came from an open wheel racing background pedro lamy 1998 fia gt2 champion was drafted from oreca chrysler team to participate at le mans and in deutsche masters for mercedes while franck lagorce transferred from nissan s le mans squad darren turner also a test driver for mclaren served as team s reserve driver for le mans le mans practice and qualifying by winning 1998 fia gt championship mercedes were awarded a single guaranteed entry for le mans which was assigned to gounon tiemann and webber in clr no 4 bouchut dumbreck and heidfeld in no 5 and lagorce lamy and schneider in no 6 entries would have to pre qualify for event while no 4 was free to use pre qualifying session for testing purposes pre qualifying involved all 62 entry applicant teams setting lap times over a long session final entry for le mans would be made of 48 cars combining guaranteed entries and fastest cars in pre qualifying within their respective classes prototype category combining lmp and lmgtp cars only allowed 28 cars from 31 entries competitors in prototype category for 1999 included factory supported lmgtp programmes from toyota and audi and lmp entries from nissan bmw audi and panoz toyota set fastest pre qualifying time overall followed by panoz and bmw mercedes no 6 was sixth fastest car while nos 4 and 5 were 14th and 15th respectively although cars succeeded in passing pre qualifying one clr suffered a setback when a suspension linkage was torn from front of monocoque suspension failure was first major fault suffered by clrs since their testing debut in february several weeks after pre qualifying mercedes returned for two days of practice and qualifying sessions in week leading up to race sessions would set starting grid for race based on fastest overall lap time by each car at end of first day mercedes entries were fifth sixth and eighth on provisional grid toyota led session over four seconds ahead of fastest mercedes early in second day of sessions webber driving clr no 4 was following audi of frank through portion of circuit connecting mulsanne corner and indianapolis complex when he moved out of audi s slipstream to overtake clr suddenly lifted its nose and front wheels off circuit and became airborne flipping upwards and somersaulting backwards before rotating onto its side car impacted tarmac with its right side while perpendicular to circuit then flipped back onto its wheels before skidding into safety barriers on side of circuit webber was extracted from car by track marshals and taken to a nearby hospital suffering from a sore neck chest and back accident occurred in an area not generally accessible to public and was not seen by television cameras thumb right upright locations of clr accidents on circuit de la sarthe webber s qualifying accident webber s warm up accident dumbreck s race accident due to accident no 4 car was unable to improve its qualifying time from previous day which relegated car to tenth on starting grid as competitors improved their times mercedes no 5 also did not improve its lap time and finished session seventh bernd schneider was able to go quicker than his time from previous day with a 3 31 541 lap for no 6 car toyota took pole position with a 3 29 930 lap while schneider s car was placed fourth on final starting grid wreckage of clr no 4 was returned to mercedes at end of qualifying session and team issued a press release confirming that they could repair car before start of race two days later a spare clr monocoque taken from a test car was used to rebuild no 4 webber was able to recover from his injuries by spending following day in physical training and was cleared on saturday morning to participate in race warm up on morning of race a warm up session lasting half an hour was held as a final preparation for teams mercedes no 4 repaired after its thursday accident joined its two teammates on circuit as session began webber was once again driving no 4 car as trio made their way down mulsanne straight approaching mulsanne corner webber trailed his two teammates but was approximately behind a chrysler viper gts r entered by team oreca cresting a hill at approach to corner webber s car lifted its nose into air once again and rose over above track somersaulting backwards before twisting towards its right and hitting tarmac with right rear of car while inverted shedding its engine cover rear wing and nose car skidded on its roof into a run off area just short of roundabout next to mulsanne corner before coming to a halt marshals were eventually able to right mercedes and extract webber who sustained no major injuries television cameras located at mulsannes corner captured aftermath of accident and broadcast pictures of clr on its roof to worldwide audience photographers in same location also captured car as it flipped aco later published these photographs in its 1999 yearbook mercedes immediately withdrew clr no 4 from event as race was only a few hours from beginning norbert haug head of mercedes benz s motorsport activities contacted adrian newey chief aerodynamicist of mclaren formula one team for consultation on modifying remaining clrs to prevent further accidents drivers were also consulted on whether they believed cars were too dangerous to race bouchut felt that front of car could become light at high speeds and voiced his concerns to team but other drivers had not felt this issue with cars mercedes opted to make modifications to front bodywork of two remaining cars by adding dive planes to fenders for increased downforce but sacrificing overall top speed drivers were also instructed not to follow other cars too closely race with only two clrs remaining mercedes started from fourth and seventh place grid positions schneider was able to move into third place behind two toyotas in opening laps while bouchut progressed to fourth toyotas made pit stops first followed by schneider and bouchut then two bmws one of toyotas eventually suffered transmission issues which dropped it down in field leaving top six positions to be swapped amongst two remaining toyotas two mercedes and two bmws as they made pit stops on different schedules driver changes during later pit stops had lagorce getting in no 6 to replace schneider while dumbreck replaced bouchut in no 5 schneider reported that despite some initial problems dealing with car s new aerodynamics it was running well by end of his stint towards close of fourth hour of race dumbreck s mercedes came into contact with gts class porsche 911 gt2 of estoril racing team at ford chicanes but continued with no apparent damage on lap 76 dumbreck was in third place and catching thierry s toyota in second place mercedes and toyota were nose to tail on run from mulsannes corner to indianapolis at nearly with both drivers partially blinded by setting sun ahead of them at a slight right kink in straight dumbreck s clr ran over small apex kerbing and suddenly lifted its front wheels from ground before somersaulting backwards as entire car became airborne mercedes rotated three times as it flew in air reaching a height of nearly car continued its trajectory as circuit curved to right clearing a marshaling post and safety barrier on left side of track and missing a large advertising billboard bridging track just ahead of it television cameras broadcasting live world feed captured clr s aerobatics before it went out of view behind trees car impacted ground in an area of woods alongside circuit that had been cut and cleared only two weeks prior and was inaccessible to spectators car dug a rut in dirt as it continued to tumble in clearing impact forced a tree limb to penetrate monocoque between driver s seat and fuel tank clr came to rest right side up and track marshals rushed to stopped car track officials quickly slowed race with caution flags and safety cars to dispatch recovery vehicles dumbreck was knocked unconscious after initial impact but awoke and climbed from car where he was found by marshals and local gendarmerie officers in area dumbreck was later given a breathalyser test by officers due to le mans use of public roads before being transported by ambulance to a local hospital for examinations before being released at end of 76th lap lagorce was ordered by team to bring remaining clr directly to its garage upon car s arrival amg mercedes shut last of its three garage doors signifying its official retirement from event national rivals bmw went on to win race following day aftermath thumb right clr no 6 appeared at a track day event held at nurburgring in 2009 dive planes added to car before start of le mans are still on front fenders following race aco and federation francaise du sport automobile ffsa national motorsport body investigated incidents ffsa questioned aco s decision to allow mercedes to continue to compete after two accidents prior to race start but aco argued that there were no indications that problems that befell clr no 4 were shared by other mercedes entries aco argued that design of clr with longest front and rear overhang amongst prototype field was cause of problem a porsche 911 gt1 similar in design to clr had suffered a nearly identical accident year before at road atlanta in united states aco changed regulations for lmgtp category in 2000 decreasing allowable length of overhang fia also instructed its advisory expert group to develop new regulations to prevent similar airborne accidents in other racing cars lmgtp class itself was abandoned by teams in 2000 as toyota cancelled its programme and audi concentrated on open cockpit lmp cars class reappeared in 2001 peter dumbreck in response to his accident initially blamed height of kerbs he had run on when his car became airborne but mercedes benz responded by stating that blame did not lie with circuit kerbs as well as entire le mans circuit were all approved by fia after 2000 race aco and french government did make modifications to route nationale 138 which forms mulsanne straight by decreasing height of a hill by on approach to mulsanne corner where webber had his warm up accident before race had concluded mercedes benz addressed criticism from other drivers and teams of its decisions haug believed that team s data from webber s practice incident had been adequately analysed and that drivers did not feel there were problems with their cars in traffic that could cause same incidents prompting his decision to continue he also stated his belief that contact between clr no 5 and estoril porsche may have damaged front diffuser and led to aerodynamic instabilities shortly after le mans mercedes conducted its own examination of accidents by running remaining clr on an airfield to verify wind tunnel data although no conclusions were published by mercedes company cancelled rest of its 1999 programme withdrawing from norisring exhibition event and final three rounds of american le mans series team s change in plans for norisring eventually led to entire event being cancelled over a lack of manufacturer involvement mercedes returned to touring car racing from 2000 onwards and has not participated at le mans in any capacity since 1999 despite failure of clr project christophe bouchut felt that cars were his favorite to drive in a 21 year career at le mans praising cars handling and technology following damage to clrs nos 4 and 5 during le mans week remaining car has rarely been seen but has begun to make reappearances in recent years as part of a 2008 celebration for retirement of bernd schneider clr no 6 was publicly displayed in sankt germany car appeared in hands of a private owner in 2009 at a modena event held at nurburgring and was driven on circuit failures of clrs have become lore for le mans and motorsport in general speed channel
