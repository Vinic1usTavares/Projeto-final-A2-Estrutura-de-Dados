genres or maybe i do bluegrass is swag bluegrass is all way swag ocean described making of his mixtape as a labor of love stating that it was like difficult to make not like writing songs or arranging songs that had a level of difficulty too but just piecing together all levels to do it at level quality of records i wanted to make but it was a process i appreciate so much in his own words ocean calls album nostalgic he explains it s a longing for past that s what this record felt like lyrical content according to ocean relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships i wasn t trying to make a record that people could relate to i was just trying to make a record with shit that i wanted to express shit that i wanted to get off my chest a lot of this record is influenced by one relationship but i don t owe that whole project to one situation it doesn t matter what details of it are discussing writing process behind album he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories he continued you gotta make sure listener is listening to you so if you put it into a song often times if song is striking enough then you can really deliver story most effectively while keeping ear of listener whole time i guess it all starts with stories for me when asked by quietus if songs from album drew from his personal experiences frank commented my kitchen is usually pretty clean you know but you have fun with imagery and for me whole concept that everything has to be like nobody gets upset with a director when a director s film isn t about his life people think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life but it s not it s imagery and a little bit of satire when asked if he made r b music ocean replied that he disliked how that in united states if you re a singer and you re black you re an r b artist period ocean stated that songs on mixtape do contain r b influences but that it is not an r b album entirely songs album begins with a melodic cover of strawberry swing by english alternative rock band coldplay connor o neill of miscellany news writes that cover begins album with so much
