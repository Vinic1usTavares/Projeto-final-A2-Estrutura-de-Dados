unbibium also known as element 122 or eka thorium is hypothetical chemical element in periodic table with placeholder symbol of ubb and atomic number 122 unbibium and ubb are temporary systematic iupac name and symbol respectively which are used until element is discovered confirmed and a permanent name is decided upon in periodic table of elements it is expected to follow unbiunium as second element of superactinides and fourth element of 8th period similarly to unbiunium it is expected to fall within range of island of stability potentially conferring additional stability on some isotopes especially 306ubb which is expected to have a magic number of neutrons 184 despite several attempts unbibium has not yet been synthesized nor have any naturally occurring isotopes been found to exist there are currently no plans to attempt to synthesize unbibium in 2008 it was claimed to have been discovered in natural thorium samples but that claim has now been dismissed by recent repetitions of experiment using more accurate techniques chemically unbibium is expected to show some resemblance to its lighter congeners cerium and thorium however relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ for example it is expected to have a ground state electron configuration of og 7d1 8s2 8p1 despite its predicted position in g block superactinide series history synthesis attempts fusion evaporation first attempts to synthesize unbibium were performed in 1972 by flerov et al at joint institute for nuclear research jinr using heavy ion induced hot fusion reactions no atoms these experiments were motivated by early predictions on existence of an island of stability at n 184 and z 120 no atoms were detected and a yield limit of 5 nb 5 000 pb was measured current results see flerovium have shown that sensitivity of these experiments were too low by at least 3 orders of magnitude in 2000 gesellschaft fur schwerionenforschung gsi center for heavy ion research performed a very similar experiment with much higher sensitivity no atoms these results indicate that synthesis of such heavier elements remains a significant challenge and further improvements of beam intensity and experimental efficiency is required sensitivity should be increased to 1 fb in future for more quality results another unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbibium was carried out in 1978 at gsi helmholtz center where a natural erbium target was bombarded with xenon 136 ions no atoms in particular reaction between and 136xe was expected to yield alpha emitters with half lives of microseconds that would decay down to isotopes of flerovium with half lives perhaps increasing up to several hours as flerovium is predicted to lie near center of island of stability after twelve hours of irradiation nothing was found in this reaction following a similar unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbiunium from 238u and it was concluded that half lives of superheavy nuclei must be less than one microsecond or cross sections are very small more recent research into synthesis of superheavy elements suggests that both conclusions are true two attempts in 1970s to synthesize unbibium were both propelled by research investigating whether superheavy elements could potentially be naturally occurring compound nucleus fission several experiments studying fission characteristics of various superheavy compound nuclei such as 306ubb were performed between 2000 2004 at flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions two nuclear reactions were used namely 248cm 58fe and 242pu 64ni results reveal how superheavy nuclei fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132sn z 50 n 82 it was also found that yield for fusion fission pathway was similar between 48ca and 58fe projectiles suggesting a possible future use of 58fe projectiles in superheavy element formation see flerov lab annual reports 2000 2004 inclusive http www1 jinr ru

shortening half lives until around z 124 increasing contribution of spontaneous fission instead of alpha decay from z 122 onward until it dominates from z 125 and proton drip line around z 130 white ring denotes expected location of island of stability two squares outlined in white denote 291cn and 293cn predicted to be longest lived nuclides on island with half lives of centuries or millennia every element from mendelevium onward was produced in fusion evaporation reactions culminating in discovery of heaviest known element oganesson in 2002 and most recently tennessine in 2010 these reactions approached limit of current technology for example synthesis of tennessine required 22 milligrams of 249bk and an intense 48ca beam for six months intensity of beams in superheavy element research cannot exceed 1012 projectiles per second without damaging target and detector and producing larger quantities of increasingly rare and unstable actinide targets is impractical consequently future experiments must be done at facilities such as under construction superheavy element factory she factory at joint institute for nuclear research jinr or riken which will allow experiments to run for longer stretches of time with increased detection capabilities and enable otherwise inaccessible reactions it is possible that fusion evaporation reactions will not be suitable for discovery of unbibium or heavier elements various models predict increasingly short alpha and spontaneous fission half lives for isotopes with z 122 and n 180 on order of microseconds or less rendering detection nearly impossible with current equipment increasing dominance of spontaneous fission also may sever possible ties to known nuclei of livermorium or oganesson and make identification and confirmation more difficult a similar problem occurred in road to confirmation of decay chain of 294og which has no anchor to known nuclei for these reasons other methods of production may need to be researched such as multi nucleon transfer reactions capable of populating longer lived nuclei a similar switch in experimental technique occurred when hot fusion using 48ca projectiles was used instead of cold fusion in which cross sections decrease rapidly with increasing atomic number to populate elements with z 113 nevertheless several fusion evaporation reactions leading to unbibium have been proposed in addition to those already tried unsuccessfully though no institution has immediate plans to make synthesis attempts instead focusing first on elements 119 120 and possibly 121 because cross sections increase with asymmetry of reaction a chromium beam would be most favorable in combination with a californium target especially if predicted closed neutron shell at n 184 could be reached in more neutron rich products and confer additional stability in particular reaction between 54cr and 252cf would generate compound nucleus 306ubb and reach shell at n 184 though analogous reaction with a 249cf target is more feasible because of presence of unwanted fission products from 252cf and difficulty in accumulating required amount of target material one possible synthesis of unbibium could occur as follows 3 should this reaction be successful and alpha decay remain dominant over spontaneous fission resultant would decay through which may be populated in cross bombardment between 249cf and 50ti although this reaction is one of most promising options for synthesis of unbibium in near future maximum cross section is predicted to be 3 fb one order of magnitude lower than lowest measured cross section in a successful reaction more symmetrical reactions 244pu 64ni and 248cm 58fe have also been proposed and may produce more neutron rich isotopes with increasing atomic number one must also be aware of decreasing fission barrier heights resulting in lower survival probability of compound nuclei especially above predicted magic numbers at z 126 and n 184 claimed discovery as a naturally occurring element in 2008 a group led by israeli physicist amnon marinov at hebrew university of jerusalem claimed to have found single atoms of unbibium 292 in naturally occurring thorium deposits at an abundance of between 10 11 and 10 12 relative to thorium this was first time in sixty nine years that a new element had been claimed to be discovered in nature after marguerite perey s 1939 discovery of francium claim of marinov et al was criticized by a part of scientific community and marinov says he has submitted article to journals nature and nature physics but both turned it down without sending it for peer review royal society of chemistry heaviest element claim criticised chemical world unbibium 292 atoms were claimed to be or isomers with a half life of at least 100 million years a criticism of technique previously used in purportedly identifying lighter thorium isotopes by mass spectrometry was published in physical review c in 2008 a rebuttal by marinov group was published in physical review c after published comment a repeat of thorium experiment using superior method of accelerator mass spectrometry ams failed to confirm results despite a 100 fold better sensitivity this result throws considerable doubt on results of marinov collaboration with regards to their claims of long lived isotopes of thorium roentgenium and unbibium it is still possible that traces of unbibium might exist in some thorium samples though given current understanding of superheavy elements this is very unlikely naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements unbibium should instead be known as eka thorium after recommendations of iupac in 1979 element has since been largely referred to as unbibium with atomic symbol of ubb as its temporary name until element is officially discovered and synthesized and a permanent name is decided on scientists largely ignore this naming convention and instead simply refer to unbibium as element 122 with symbol of 122 or sometimes even or 122 predicted properties nuclear stability and isotopes thumb upright 2 75 alt a 2d graph with rectangular cells colored in black and white colors spanning from llc to urc with cells mostly becoming lighter closer to latter a chart of nuclide stability as used by dubna team in 2010 characterized isotopes are shown with borders beyond element 118 oganesson last known element line of known nuclides is expected to rapidly enter a region of instability with no half lives over one microsecond after element 121 this poses difficulties in identifying heavier elements such as unbibium elliptical region encloses predicted location of island of stability stability of nuclei decreases greatly with increase in atomic number after plutonium heaviest primordial element so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half life under a day with an exception of dubnium 268 no elements with atomic numbers above 82 after lead have stable isotopes nevertheless because of reasons not very well understood yet there is a slight increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110 114 which leads to appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as island of stability this concept proposed by university of california professor glenn seaborg explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted in this region of periodic table n 184 has been suggested as a closed neutron shell and various atomic numbers have been proposed as closed proton shells such as z 114 120 122 124 and 126 island of stability would be characterized by longer half lives of nuclei located near these magic numbers though extent of stabilizing effects is uncertain due to predictions of weakening of proton shell closures and possible loss of double magicity more recent research predicts island of stability to instead be centered at beta stable copernicium isotopes 291cn and 293cn which would place unbibium well above island and result in short half lives regardless of shell effects increased stability of elements 112 118 has also been attributed to oblate shape of such nuclei and resistance to spontaneous fission same model also proposes 306ubb as next spherical doubly magic nucleus thus defining true island of stability for spherical nuclei thumb left upright 1 4 regions of differently shaped nuclei as predicted by interacting boson approximation a quantum tunneling model predicts alpha decay half lives of unbibium isotopes 284 to be on order of microseconds or less for all isotopes lighter than highlighting a significant challenge in experimental observation of this element this is consistent with many predictions though exact location of 1 microsecond border varies by model additionally spontaneous fission is expected to become a major decay mode in this region with half lives on order of predicted for some even even isotopes due to minimal hindrance resulting from nucleon pairing and loss of stabilizing effects farther away from magic numbers a 2016 calculation on half lives and probable decay chains of isotopes 280 yields corroborating results 280 will be proton unbound and possibly decay by proton emission 298 314ubb will have alpha half lives on order of microseconds and those heavier than 314ubb will predominantly decay by spontaneous fission with short half lives for lighter alpha emitters which may be populated in fusion evaporation reactions some long decay chains leading down to known or reachable isotopes of lighter elements are predicted additionally isotopes 308 are predicted to have half lives under 1 microsecond too short for detection as a result of significantly lower binding energy for neutron numbers immediately above n 184 shell closure alternatively a second island of stability with total half lives of approximately 1 second may exist around z 124 and n 198 though these nuclei will be difficult or impossible to reach using current experimental techniques however these predictions are strongly dependent on chosen nuclear mass models and it is unknown which isotopes of unbibium will be most stable regardless these nuclei will be hard to synthesize as no combination of obtainable target and projectile can provide enough neutrons in compound nucleus even for nuclei reachable in fusion reactions spontaneous fission and possibly also cluster decay might have significant branches posing another hurdle to identification of superheavy elements as they are normally identified by their successive alpha decays chemical unbibium is predicted to be a heavier congener of cerium and thorium and thus to have a similar chemistry to them although it may be more reactive additionally unbibium is predicted to belong to a new block of valence g electron atoms although g block s position left of f block is speculative and 5g orbital is not expected to start filling until element 125 predicted ground state electron configuration of unbibium is og 7d1 8s2 8p1 in contrast to expected og 8s2 in which 5g orbital starts filling at element 121 in superactinides relativistic effects might cause a breakdown of aufbau principle and create overlapping of 5g 6f 7d and 8p orbitals experiments on chemistry of copernicium and flerovium provide strong indications of increasing role of relativistic effects as such chemistry of elements following unbibium becomes more difficult to predict unbibium would most likely form a dioxide and tetrahalides such as and main oxidation state is predicted to be iv similar to cerium and thorium a first ionization energy of 5 651 ev and second ionization energy of 11 332 ev are predicted for unbibium this and other calculated ionization energies are lower than analogous
