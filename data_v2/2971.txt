by sony atv music publishing you and i is set in common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute it is written in key of a major during song gaga s voice spans from notes of e3 to c5 song begins with an a g a chord progression which changes to a bm a d a bm during chorus and back to former chords afterwards opening lyrics it s been a long time since i came around it s been a long time but i m back in town and this time i m not leaving without you describe a whiskey breathed lover for whom she is pining gil kaufman of mtv news described it as tune eschewed most of her dance flavor right

sit back down on couch where we made love first time noting differences between live performances of song and studio version neil mccormick of daily telegraph observed that piano parts were replaced mostly by fizzing synths a stomping beat sampled from we will rock you thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls kitty empire of guardian described song as an umlaut toting digital country power ballad with two bruce springsteen references born to run and nebraska critical reception left thumb upright brian may guitarist for rock band queen played guitars on you and i alt greyscale image of a middle aged man playing guitar you and i received acclaim from music critics after hearing white tie and tiara ball performance entertainment weekly leah greenblatt complimented song for its torchy slow burn cabaret quality and for lacking auto tune fancy production or performance gimmicks mccormick noting differences between gaga s live and studio versions of song described studio version as bigger bolder and less quirkily emotive a custom built radio rock ballad to induce hand claps in packed stadiums this is not music for underground it is cheesy high gloss pop rock for mainstream middle a kind of instant eighties retro classic to seduce middle aged rockers possibly last demographic to remain sceptical about her appeal jody rosen of rolling stone called song a confessional power ballad with a torrid sturm und drang vocal turn in his review for guardian tim jonze said song aims for a hey jude style singalong but owing to its determination to have someone playing kitchen sink in background ends up as bloated as oasis all around world dan aquilante of new york post wrote a less than favorable review of born this way but complimented you and i and uniquely earthy quality that lange brought to album kitty empire said song is gaga s unlikely heartland moment a bid perhaps to locate herself as an all american balladeer as well as an art disco avatar with tent pegs under her skin referring to prosthetics featured in music video for song born this way dartmouth kate sullivan wrote that you and i may be gaga s most honest song to date shirley halperin of hollywood reporter wondered whether pop radio would play song considering gaga s popularity halperin felt that track a sense of that listeners don t always get with gaga s redone produced heavily synthetic sounds conversely she felt that live piano and background vocals by gaga and lange added an undeniably lush quality while lyrics drives song home and potentially into hit territory kerri mason of billboard felt that country ballad made no contextual sense nekesa mumbi moody while reviewing born this way for florida today compared song to speechless a similar tempo song included on fame monster 2009 robert copsey a writer for website digital spy gave song four out of five stars calling it a torchy retro classic all american power ballad custom

premiere video features gaga s two alter egos jo calderone gaga s male ego and yuyi a mermaid she had hinted would appear in video in july 2011 following video s premiere on mtv gaga explained some of its scenes and her inspiration video is quite complex in way that story is told and it s meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing which is way that love is regarding sexual intercourse scenes between actor taylor kinney and singer as a mermaid gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work no matter what you do there s this giant boundary between you and someone else so that s what it s about perceiving in your imagination that there s something magical inside of you that you can make it work she said after revealing that wedding dress shown in video belonged to her mother gaga explained scenes involving ice cream truck according to her they represented destruction of her youth experiences she had shared in earlier interviews explaining her decision to include them gaga said that s how i wanted to open video because i think it really sets up rest of story it allows you to imagine you yourself are not just one person you re so many that person has so many stories and memories to draw from and they all affect your journey profusely i m battered quite brutally at beginning of video but at end i m not battered i m a bit strange it s not meant to be an answer video it s meant to be a profuse number of question synopsis thumb left 300px lady gaga as yuyi mermaid in music video music video begins with

stone felt video was an improvement over her earlier videos judas and edge of glory saying best moments of video put a distinctly gaga ish spin on iconography of americana and traditional love stories jillian mapes of billboard wrote video has torture contraptions mermaid sex a wedding bondage in a barn an ice cream truck and to top it all off children of corn and religious overtones thrown in for good measure and thought video setting was strangest representation of nebraska leah collins of dose felt video was a great opportunity for singer to finally find out what it s like to make out with herself kyle anderson of entertainment weekly noted of scene in which gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego she s just stefani joanne angelina germanotta playing a piano in middle of a corn field with a little making out on side of course gil kaufman of mtv news believed that gaga was not joking when she talked about video being about torture of being away from one you love and man based on bruising final product she wasn t kidding kaufman concluded jocelyn vena of mtv found influences of gaga s past videos in various avatars she plays you and i she explained that when gaga stands at a crossroads in a big hat image is reminiscent of telephone gaga when she sits nearly makeup free at her piano in cornfields there are touches of teary eyed makeup less gaga from bad romance video flashes of her wedding may remind fans of wedding dress she wore in judas clip robot gaga s facial structures recall some of steampunk looks of her alejandro video those are only a few of nods to past personae from her own videography devin brown of cbs news felt that gaga had finally returned to form with video after some visually pleasing but generally lackluster videos she has finally come out with something to write home about you and i is arguably best song on her sophomore release born this way and now has a video to match a slant magazine writer commented that

head of gaga s record label asked for song and reinhart received her permission before performance reviews of reinhart s performance were mostly positive len melisurgo of star ledger considered it a risky choice since song had not been released but accepted that reinhart sounded amazing by hitting some really high notes brian mansfield of usa today described reinhart s performance as an old fashioned dance hall groove kind of like a mid 70s elton john number it s perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of haley s style by end of song she turns it into a gospel style rocker and she takes it to house mansfield also noted that american idol judges randy jackson jennifer lopez and steven tyler reacted positively to it on contrary jim farber of new york
