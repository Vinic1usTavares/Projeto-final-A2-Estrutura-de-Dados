southern hemisphere monsoon trough associated with australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in february oriented along a west northwest east southeast axis effect of wind surges increases in relative vorticity or spin with monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within convergence zone of monsoon trough wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence a strengthening or equatorward movement in subtropical ridge can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards location of monsoon trough as fronts move through subtropics and tropics of one hemisphere during their winter normally as shear lines when their temperature gradient becomes minimal wind surges can cross equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in other hemisphere s summer chih chen effects of northeast monsoon on equatorial westerlies over indonesia retrieved on 2008 05 03 a key way of detecting whether a wind surge has

will occur at its periphery such a circulation which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a monsoon depression in northern hemisphere monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery light and variable winds cover a large area near their center while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of

ocean surface streamline pattern retrieved on 2006 11 26 failure of monsoon trough or itcz to move south of equator in eastern pacific ocean and atlantic ocean during southern hemisphere summer is considered one of factors causing tropical cyclones to not normally form in those regions it has also been noted that when monsoon trough lies near 20 degrees north latitude in pacific frequency of tropical cyclones is 2 to 3 times greater than when it lies closer to 10 degrees north references category tropical meteorology category atmospheric dynamics
