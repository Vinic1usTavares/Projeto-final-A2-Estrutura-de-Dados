right thumb thomas cranmer 1489 1556 henry viii s archbishop of canterbury and editor and co author of first and second books of common prayer english reformation was a series of events in 16th century england by which church of england broke away from authority of pope and roman catholic church these events were in part associated with wider european protestant reformation a religious and political movement that affected practice of christianity across western and central europe causes included decline of feudalism and rise of nationalism rise of common law invention of printing press and increased circulation of bible and transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars upper and middle classes and readers in general however various phases of english reformation which also covered wales and ireland were largely driven by changes in government policy to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself based on henry viii s desire for an annulment of his marriage first requested of pope clement vii in 1527 english reformation was at outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute reality of political differences between rome and england allowed growing theological disputes to come to fore reformation must not be confused with changes introduced into church of england during reformation parliament of 1529 36 which were of a political rather than a religious nature designed to unite secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power anglican church did not until later make any substantial change in doctrine until break with rome it was pope and general councils of church that decided doctrine church law was governed by canon law with final jurisdiction in rome church taxes were paid straight to rome and pope had final word in appointment of bishops break with rome was effected by a series of acts of parliament passed between 1532 and 1534 among them 1534 act of supremacy which declared that henry was supreme head on earth of church of england this title was renounced by mary i in 1553 in process of restoring papal jurisdiction when elizabeth i reasserted royal supremacy in 1559 her title was supreme governor final authority in doctrinal and legal disputes now rested with monarch and papacy was deprived of revenue and final say on appointment of bishops theology and liturgy of church of england became markedly protestant during reign of henry s son edward vi largely along lines laid down by archbishop thomas cranmer under mary whole process was reversed and church of england was again placed under papal jurisdiction soon after elizabeth reintroduced protestant faith but in a more moderate manner structure and theology of church was a matter of fierce dispute for generations violent aspect of these disputes manifested in english civil wars ended when last roman catholic monarch james ii was deposed and parliament asked william iii and mary ii to rule jointly in conjunction with english bill of rights in 1688 in glorious revolution from which emerged a church polity with an established church and a number of non conformist churches whose members at first suffered various civil disabilities that were removed over time legacy of previous roman catholic heritage and establishment as state church remained an issue for some time and still exists today a substantial but dwindling minority from late 16th to early 19th centuries remained roman catholic in england their church organisation remained illegal until relief act of 1829 early reform movements reformation was a clash of two opposed schemes of salvation catholic church taught that contrite person could cooperate with god towards their salvation by performing good works medieval catholic worship was centred on mass church s offering of sacrifice of christ s body and blood mass was also an offering of prayer by which living could help souls in purgatory protestants taught that fallen humanity was helpless and under condemnation until given grace of god through faith they believed catholic emphasis on purgatory was an obstacle to true faith in god and identification of mass with christ s sacrifice a blasphemous perversion of eucharist in place of mass protestant worship was centred on bible to them only road to faith in christ either read or presented in sermons lollardy anticipated some protestant teachings derived from writings of john wycliffe a 14th century theologian and bible translator lollardy stressed primacy of scripture and emphasised preaching over sacrament of altar holding latter to be but a memorial unlike protestants early lollards lacked access to printing press and failed to gain a foothold among church s most popular communicators friars unable to gain access to levers of power lollards were much reduced in numbers and influence by 15th century they sometimes faced investigation and persecution and rarely produced new literature after 1450 lollards could still be found especially in london and thames valley in essex and kent coventry bristol and even in north and many would be receptive to protestant ideas more respectable and orthodox calls for reform came from renaissance humanists such as erasmus who lived in england for a time john colet dean of st paul s and thomas more humanists downplayed role of rites and ceremonies in achieving salvation and criticised superstitious veneration of relics erasmus and colet emphasised a simple personal piety and a return ad fontes back to sources of christian faith scriptures as understood through textual and linguistic scholarship colet s commentaries on pauline epistles emphasized double predestination and worthlessness of human works anne boleyn s own religious views were shaped by french humanists such as jacques lefevre d etaples whose 1512 commentaries on paul s epistles stated that human works were irrelevant to salvation five years before luther published same views humanist scholarship provided arguments against papal primacy and support for claim that popes had usurped powers that rightfully belonged to kings in 1534 lorenzo valla s on donation of constantine which proved that one of pillars of papacy s temporal authority was a hoax was published in london thomas cromwell paid for an english translation of marsiglio of padua s defensor pacis in 1535 conservative cleric stephen gardiner used marsiglio s theory of a unitary realm to defend royal power over spiritual as well as secular affairs by early 1520s views of german reformer martin luther were known and disputed in england main plank of luther s theology was justification by faith alone rather than by good works in this view only faith itself a gift from god can secure grace of god justification by faith alone threatened whole basis of roman catholic penitential system with its doctrine of purgatory prayer for dead indulgences and sacrificial character of mass early protestants portrayed catholic practices such as confession to priests clerical celibacy and requirements to fast and keep vows as burdensome and spiritually oppressive not only did purgatory lack any biblical basis according to protestants but clergy were accused of using fear of purgatory to make money from prayers and masses catholics countered that justification by faith alone was a licence to sin english catholicism was strong and popular in early 1500s and those who held protestant sympathies would remain a religious minority until political events intervened protestant ideas were popular among some parts of english population especially among academics and merchants with connections to continental europe first open demonstration of support for luther took place at cambridge in 1521 when a student defaced a copy of papal bull of condemnation against luther also at cambridge was a group of reform minded university students that met at white horse tavern from mid 1520s known by moniker little germany its members included robert barnes hugh latimer john frith thomas bilney george joye and thomas arthur right thumb tyndale bible was basis for later english translations publication of william tyndale s english new testament in 1526 helped to spread protestant ideas printed abroad and smuggled into country tyndale bible was first english bible to be mass produced there were probably 16 000 copies in england by 1536 tyndale s translation was highly influential forming basis of all later english translations an attack on traditional religion tyndale s translation included an epilogue explaining luther s theology of justification by faith and many translation choices were designed to undermine traditional catholic teachings tyndale translated greek word charis as favour rather than grace to de emphasize role of grace giving sacraments his choice of love rather than charity to translate agape de emphasized good works when rendering greek verb into english tyndale used repent rather than do penance former word indicated an internal turning to god while latter translation supported sacrament of confession between 1530 and 1533 thomas england s first protestant martyr thomas bilney richard bayfield john tewkesbury james thomas benet thomas harding john frith and andrew were burned to death in 1531 william tracy was posthumously convicted of heresy for denying purgatory and affirming justification by faith and his corpse was disinterred and burned while protestants were only a small portion of population and suffered persecution rift between king and papacy in 1530s gave protestants opportunities to form new alliances with government officials henrician reformation annulment controversy thumb left upright 0 7 king henry viii of

acceded to english throne in 1509 at age of 17 he made a dynastic marriage with catherine of aragon widow of his brother arthur in june 1509 just before his coronation on midsummer s day unlike his father who was secretive and conservative young henry appeared epitome of chivalry and sociability an observant roman catholic he heard up to five masses a day except during hunting season of powerful but unoriginal mind he let himself be influenced by his advisors from whom he was never apart by night or day he was thus susceptible to whoever had his ear he believed he that he could keep his own secrets but he was often deceived and he deceived himself this contributed to a state of hostility between his young contemporaries and lord chancellor cardinal thomas wolsey as long as wolsey had his ear henry s roman catholicism was secure in 1521 he had defended roman catholic church from martin luther s accusations of heresy in a book he wrote probably with considerable help from conservative bishop of rochester john fisher entitled defence of seven sacraments for which he was awarded title defender of faith fidei defensor by pope leo x successive english and british monarchs have retained this title to present even after anglican church broke away from roman catholicism in part because title was re conferred by parliament in 1544 after split wolsey s enemies at court included those who had been influenced by lutheran ideas among whom was attractive charismatic anne boleyn anne arrived at court in 1522 as maid of honour to queen catherine having spent some years in france being educated by queen claude of france she was a woman of charm style and wit with will and savagery which made her a match for henry her music book contained an illustration of a falcon pecking at a pomegranate falcon was her badge pomegranate that of granada catherine s badge anne was a distinguished french conversationalist singer and dancer she was cultured and is disputed author of several songs and poems by 1527 henry wanted his marriage to catherine annulled henry wanted an annulment a formal and legal declaration of marriage s invalidity yet word contemporaries used divorce captures better legal and emotional turmoil she had not produced a male heir who survived longer than two months and henry wanted a son to secure tudor dynasty before henry s father henry vii ascended throne england had been beset by civil warfare over rival claims to english crown henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over succession catherine of aragon s only surviving child was princess mary thumb right anne boleyn henry viii s second wife by an unknown artist national portrait gallery london henry claimed that this lack of a male heir was because his marriage was blighted in eyes of god catherine had been his late brother s wife and it was therefore against biblical teachings for henry to have married her leviticus 20 21 a special dispensation from pope julius ii had been needed to allow wedding in first place henry argued marriage was never valid because biblical prohibition was part of unbreakable divine law and even popes could not dispense with it writes inconveniently for henry another old testament verse 25 5 seemingly qualified prohibition commanding a man to take to wife his deceased brother s widow if there had been no child in 1527 henry asked pope clement vii to annul marriage but pope refused according to canon law pope could not annul a marriage on basis of a canonical impediment previously dispensed clement also feared wrath of catherine s nephew holy roman emperor charles v whose troops earlier that year had sacked rome and briefly taken pope prisoner combination of his scruple of conscience and his captivation by anne boleyn made his desire to rid himself of his queen compelling indictment of his chancellor cardinal wolsey in 1529 for praemunire taking authority of papacy above crown and subsequent death in november 1530 on his way to london to answer a charge of high treason left henry open to opposing influences of supporters of queen and those who sanctioned abandonment of roman allegiance for whom an annulment was but an opportunity parliamentary debate and legislation in 1529 king summoned parliament to deal with annulment thus bringing together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take it became known as reformation parliament there were common lawyers who resented privileges of clergy to summon laity to their courts there were those who had been influenced by lutheranism and were hostile to theology of rome thomas cromwell was both henry s chancellor thomas more successor to wolsey also wanted reform he wanted new laws against heresy thumb thomas cromwell 1st earl of essex c 1485 1540 henry viii s chief minister 1532 40 cromwell was a lawyer and a member of parliament a protestant who saw how parliament could be used to advance royal supremacy which henry wanted and to further protestant beliefs and practices cromwell and his friends wanted one of his closest friends was thomas cranmer soon to be made an archbishop in matter of annulment no progress seemed possible pope seemed more afraid of emperor charles v than of henry anne and cromwell and their allies wished simply to ignore pope but in october 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that parliament could not empower archbishop to act against pope s prohibition henry thus resolved to bully priests actions against clergy having brought down his chancellor cardinal wolsey henry viii finally resolved to charge whole english clergy with praemunire to secure their agreement to his annulment statute of praemunire which forbade obedience to authority of pope or of any foreign rulers enacted in 1392 had been used against individuals in ordinary course of court proceedings now henry having first charged queen catherine s supporters bishops john fisher nicholas west and henry standish and archdeacon of exeter adam travers decided to proceed against whole clergy henry claimed ps100 000 from convocation of canterbury a representative body of english clergy for their pardon which was granted by convocation on 24 january 1531 clergy wanted payment spread over five years but henry refused convocation responded by withdrawing their payment altogether and demanded henry fulfil certain guarantees before they would give him money henry refused these conditions he agreed only to five year period of payment and added five articles that specified that clergy recognise henry as sole protector and supreme head of church and clergy of england gives this as their singular protector only and supreme lord and as far as law of christ allows even supreme head king had spiritual jurisdiction privileges of church were upheld only if they did not detract from royal prerogative and laws of realm king pardoned clergy for violating statute of praemunire and laity were also pardoned in parliament bishop fisher championed catherine and clergy he had inserted into first article phrase as far as word of god allows in convocation however william warham archbishop of canterbury requested a discussion but was met by a stunned silence then warham said he who is silent seems to consent to which a clergyman responded then we are all silent convocation granted consent to king s five articles and payment on 8 march 1531 that same year parliament passed pardon to clergy act 1531 royal supremacy breaking of power of rome proceeded little by little in 1532 cromwell brought before parliament supplication against ordinaries which listed nine grievances against church including abuses of power and convocation s independent legislative power finally on 10 may king demanded of convocation that church renounce all authority to make laws on 15 may submission of clergy was subscribed which recognised royal supremacy over church so that it could no longer make canon law without royal licence i e without king s permission thus it as a law making body parliament subsequently passed this in 1534 and again in 1536 day after this more resigned as chancellor leaving cromwell as henry s chief minister cromwell never became chancellor his power came and was lost through his informal relations with henry several acts of parliament then followed act in conditional restraint of annates proposed that clergy pay no more than 5 percent of their first year s revenue annates to rome this was initially controversial and required that henry visit house of lords three times to browbeat commons after prolonged debate in house of commons it was clear they would not reach unanimity over bill so henry ordered a division he commanded those in favour of his success and welfare of realm to one side of house and those who opposed him and bill to other thus he obtained a majority thumb right thomas more with john fisher leader of political resistance against break with rome both were executed in 1535 act in restraint of appeals drafted by cromwell apart from outlawing appeals to rome on ecclesiastical matters declared that this declared england an independent country in every respect english historian geoffrey elton called this act an essential ingredient of tudor revolution in that it expounded a theory of national sovereignty act in absolute restraint of annates outlawed all annates to rome and also ordered that if cathedrals refused king s nomination for bishop they would be liable to punishment by praemunire finally in 1534 acts of supremacy made henry supreme head in earth of church of england and disregarded any usage custom foreign laws foreign authority or prescription meanwhile having taken anne to france on a pre nuptial honeymoon henry married her in westminster abbey in january 1533 this was made easier by death of archbishop warham a strong opponent of an annulment henry appointed thomas cranmer to succeed him as archbishop of canterbury cranmer was prepared to grant annulment of marriage to catherine as henry required going so far as to pronounce judgment that henry s marriage with catherine was against law of god on 23 may anne gave birth to a daughter princess elizabeth in september 1533 pope responded to marriage by excommunicating both henry and cranmer from roman catholic church 11 july 1533 catholic encyclopedia henry viii accessed 21 august 2009 henry was excommunicated again in december 1538 consequently in same year act of first fruits and tenths transferred taxes on ecclesiastical income from pope to crown act concerning peter s pence and dispensations outlawed annual payment by landowners of one penny to pope this act also reiterated that england had no superior under god but only your grace and that henry s imperial crown had been diminished by unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions of pope in case any of this should be resisted parliament passed treasons act 1534 which made it high treason punishable by death to deny royal supremacy following year thomas more and john fisher were executed under this legislation finally in 1536 parliament passed act against pope s authority which removed last part of papal authority still legal this was rome s power in england to decide disputes concerning scripture moderate religious reform break with rome not only gave henry viii power to administer english church to tax it appoint its officials and control its laws it also gave him control over church s doctrine and ritual despite reading protestant books such as simon fish s supplication for beggars and tyndale s obedience of a christian man and seeking protestant support for his annulment borrowing from luther tyndale argued that papal and clerical claims to independent power were unscriptural and that king s law is god s law in 1531 henry sought through robert barnes luther s opinion on his annulment theologian did not approve henry s religious views remained conservative nevertheless to promote and defend royal supremacy he embraced language of continental reformation all while maintaining a middle way between religious extremes king relied on men with protestant sympathies such as thomas cromwell and thomas cranmer to carry out his religious programme since 1529 cranmer had risen to prominence as part of team working on annulment having begun task as a catholic humanist cranmer s religious views had shifted toward protestantism by 1531 in part due to personal contacts made with continental reformers while on a diplomatic mission to emperor charles v in 1532 cranmer visited lutheran nuremberg where he became friends with theologian andreas osiander it was at this time that cranmer became interested in lutheranism and he renounced his priestly vow of celibacy to secretly marry osiander s niece lutherans however were not in favour of annulment forcing cranmer and henry to also seek support from other emerging protestant churches in germany and switzerland this brought him into contact with martin bucer of strasbourg after warham s death cranmer was made archbishop of canterbury with papal consent in 1533 in 1534 a new heresy act ensured that no one could be punished for speaking against pope and also made it more difficult to convict someone of heresy however and anabaptists continued to be vigorously persecuted what followed was a period of doctrinal confusion as both conservatives and reformers attempted to shape church s future direction reformers were aided by cromwell who in january 1535 was made vicegerent in spirituals effectively king s vicar general cromwell s authority was greater than that of bishops even archbishop of canterbury largely due to anne boleyn s influence a number of protestants were appointed bishops between 1534 and 1536 these included latimer thomas goodrich john nicholas shaxton william barlow john and edward foxe during same period most influential conservative bishop stephen gardiner was sent to france on a diplomatic mission and thus removed from an active role in english politics for three years cromwell s programme assisted by anne boleyn s influence over episcopal appointments was not merely against clergy and power of rome he persuaded henry that safety from political alliances that rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with german lutheran princes of schmalkaldic league henry was no innocent he sought influence in european affairs and in pursuance of it his relationship with french was ambivalent and essentially treacherous there also seemed to be a possibility that emperor charles v might act to avenge his rejected aunt queen catherine and enforce pope s excommunication negotiations did not lead to an alliance but did bring lutheran ideas to england in 1536 convocation adopted first doctrinal statement for church of england ten articles this was followed by bishops book in 1537 these established a semi lutheran doctrine for church justification by faith qualified by an emphasis on good works following justification was a core teaching traditional seven sacraments were reduced to three only baptism eucharist and penance catholic teaching on praying to saints purgatory and use of images in worship was undermined right thumb st paul s cross in lower left corner of painting was a prominent preaching cross on grounds of old st paul s cathedral in august 1536 same month ten articles were published cromwell issued a set of royal injunctions to clergy minor feast days were changed into normal work days including those celebrating a church s patron saint and most feasts during harvest time july through september rationale was partly economic as too many holidays led to a loss of productivity and were occasion of vice and idleness in addition protestants considered feast days to be examples of superstition clergy were to discourage pilgrimages and instruct people to give to poor rather than make offerings to images clergy were also ordered to place bibles in both english and latin in every church for people to read this last requirement was largely ignored by bishops for a year or more due lack of any authorised english translation only complete vernacular version was coverdale bible finished in 1535 and based on tyndale s earlier work it lacked royal approval however historian diarmaid macculloch in his study of later reformation in england 1547 1603 argues that after 1537 england s reformation was characterized by its hatred of images as margaret aston s work on iconoclasm and has repeatedly and eloquently demonstrated in february 1538 famous rood of grace was condemned as a mechanical fraud and destroyed at st paul s cross in july statues of our lady of walsingham our lady of ipswich and other marian images were burned at chelsea on cromwell s orders in september cromwell issued a second set of royal injunctions ordering destruction of images to which pilgrimage offerings were made prohibition of lighting votive candles before images of saints and preaching of sermons against veneration of images and relics afterwards shrine and bones of thomas becket considered by many to have been martyred in defense of church s liberties were destroyed at canterbury cathedral dissolution of monasteries thumb right remains of finchale priory a benedictine monastery near durham that was closed in 1535 for cromwell and cranmer a step in protestant agenda was attacking monasticism which was associated with doctrine of purgatory while king was not opposed to religious houses on theological grounds there was concern over loyalty of monastic orders which were international in character and resistant to royal supremacy franciscan observant houses were closed in august 1534 after that order refused to repudiate papal authority between 1535 and 1537 18 carthusians were killed for doing same crown was also experiencing financial difficulties and wealth of church in contrast to its political weakness made confiscation of church property both tempting and feasible seizure of monastic wealth was not unprecedented it had happened before in 1295 1337 and 1369 church owned between one fifth and one third of land in all england cromwell realised that he could bind gentry and nobility to royal supremacy by selling to them huge amount of church lands and that any reversion to pre royal supremacy would entail upsetting many of powerful people in realm in 1534 cromwell initiated a visitation of monasteries ostensibly to examine their character but in fact to value their assets with a view to expropriation visiting commissioners claimed to have uncovered sexual immorality and financial impropriety amongst monks and nuns which became ostensible justification for their suppression there were also reports of possession and display of false relics such as hailes abbey s vial of holy blood upon investigation announced to be honey clarified and coloured with saffron compendium compiled by visitors documented ten pieces of true cross seven portions of virgin mary s milk and numerous saints girdles leading reformers led by anne boleyn wanted to convert monasteries into places of study and good letters and to continual relief of poor but this was not done in 1536 dissolution of lesser monasteries act closed smaller houses valued at less than ps200 a year henry used revenue to help build coastal defences see device forts against expected invasion and all land was given to crown or sold to aristocracy thirty four houses were saved by paying for exemptions monks and nuns affected by closures were transferred to larger houses and monks had option of becoming secular clergy thumb right chapter house of forde abbey a cistercian monastery closed in 1539 and converted into a country house royal supremacy and abolition of papal authority had not caused widespread unrest but attacks on monasteries and abolition of saints days and pilgrimages provoked violence mobs attacked those sent to break up monastic buildings suppression commissioners were attacked by local people in several places in northern england there were a series of uprisings against dissolutions in late 1536 and early 1537 lincolnshire rising occurred in october 1536 and culminated in a force of 40 000 rebels assembling at lincoln they demanded an end to taxation during peacetime repeal of statute of uses an end to suppression of monasteries and that heresy be purged and heretics punished henry refused to negotiate and revolt collapsed as nervous gentry convinced common people to disperse pilgrimage of grace was a more serious matter revolt began in october at yorkshire and spread to other northern counties around 50 000 strong rebels under robert aske s leadership restored 16 of 26 northern monasteries that had been dissolved due to size of rebellion king was persuaded to negotiate in december duke of norfolk offered rebels a pardon and a parliament to consider their grievances aske then sent rebels home promises made to them however were ignored by king and norfolk was instructed to put rebellion down forty seven of lincolnshire rebels were executed and 132 from pilgrimage of grace in southern england smaller disturbances took place in cornwall and walsingham in 1537 failure of pilgrimage of grace only sped up process of dissolution and may have convinced henry viii that all religious houses needed to be closed in 1540 last monasteries were dissolved wiping out an important element of traditional religion former monks were given modest pensions from court of augmentations and those that could sought work as parish priests former nuns received smaller pensions and as they were still bound by vows of chastity forbidden to marry henry personally devised a plan to form at least thirteen new dioceses so that most counties had one based on a former monastery or more than one though this scheme was only partly carried out new dioceses were established at bristol gloucester oxford peterborough westminster and chester but not for instance at shrewsbury leicester or waltham reforms reversed according to historian peter marshall henry s religious reforms were based on principles of unity obedience and refurbishment of ancient truth yet outcome was disunity and disobedience impatient protestants took it upon themselves to further reform priests said mass in english rather than latin and were marrying in violation of clerical celibacy not only were there divisions between traditionalists and reformers but protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held lutheran beliefs and radicals who held anabaptist and views reports of dissension from every part of england reached cromwell daily developments he tried to hide from king in september 1538 stephen gardiner returned to england and official religious policy began to drift in a conservative direction this was due in part to eagerness of establishment protestants to disassociate themselves from religious radicals in september two lutheran princes elector of saxony and landgrave of hesse sent warnings of anabaptist activity in england a commission was swiftly created to seek out anabaptists henry personally presided at trial of john lambert in november 1538 for denying real presence of christ in eucharist at same time he shared in drafting of a proclamation ordering anabaptists and sacramentaries to get out of country or face death discussion of real presence except by those educated in universities was forbidden and priests who married were to be dismissed it was becoming clear that king s views on religion differed from those of cromwell and cranmer henry made his traditional preferences known during easter of 1539 where he crept to cross on good friday later that year parliament passed six articles reaffirming roman catholic beliefs and practices such as transubstantiation clerical celibacy confession to a priest votive masses and withholding communion wine from laity on 28 june 1540 cromwell henry s longtime advisor and loyal servant was executed different reasons were advanced that cromwell would not enforce act of six articles that he had supported robert barnes hugh latimer and other heretics and that he was responsible for henry s marriage to anne of cleves his fourth wife many other arrests under act followed on 30 july reformers barnes william jerome and thomas gerrard were burned at stake in a display of religious impartiality thomas abell richard featherstone and edward powell all roman catholics were hanged and quartered while protestants burned european observers were shocked and bewildered french diplomat charles de wrote that henry s religious policy was a climax of evils and that thumb right 14th century chantry chapel of st mary virgin in wakefield west yorkshire chantries were endowments that paid priests to say masses for dead to lessen their time in purgatory despite setbacks protestants managed to win some victories in may 1541 king ordered copies of great bible to be placed in all churches failure to comply would result in a ps2 fine protestants could celebrate growing access to vernacular scripture as most churches had bibles by 1545 iconoclastic policies of 1538 were continued in autumn when archbishops of canterbury and york were ordered to destroy all remaining shrines in england furthermore cranmer survived formal charges of heresy in prebendaries plot of 1543 traditionalists nevertheless seemed to have upper hand by spring of 1543 protestant innovations had been reversed and only break with rome and dissolution of monasteries remained unchanged in may 1543 a new formulary was published to replace bishops book this king s book rejected justification by faith alone and defended traditional ceremonies and use of images this was followed days later by passage of act for advancement of true religion which restricted bible reading to men and women of noble birth henry expressed his fears to parliament in 1545 that word of god is disputed rhymed sung and jangled in every ale house and tavern contrary to true meaning and doctrine of same by spring of 1544 conservatives appeared to be losing influence once again in march parliament made it more difficult to prosecute people for violating six articles cranmer s exhortation and litany first official vernacular service was published in june 1544 and king s primer became only authorised english prayer book in may 1545 both texts had a reformed emphasis argues that litany and primer were largely traditional devotions and that popularity of primer suggest a continued vitality in conventional religion however argues that both litany and primer were reformed in outlook especially in their reduced emphasis on invocation of saints they were successful he writes in taking an old fashioned form and subverting its traditional purposes agrees with marshall after death of conservative edward lee in september 1544 protestant robert holgate replaced him as archbishop of york in december 1545 king was empowered to seize property of chantries trust funds endowed to pay for priests to say masses for dead while henry s motives were largely financial england was at war with france and desperately in need of funds passage of chantries act was an indication of how deeply doctrine of purgatory had been eroded and discredited in 1546 conservatives were once again in a series of controversial sermons preached by protestant edward crome set off a persecution of protestants that traditionalists used to effectively target their rivals it was during this time that anne askew was tortured in tower of london and burnt at stake even henry s last wife katherine parr was suspected of heresy but saved herself by appealing to king s mercy with protestants on defensive traditionalists pressed their by banning protestant books conservative persecution of queen katherine however backfired by november 1546 there were already signs that religious policy was once again tilting towards protestantism argues that cranmer believed that had he lived henry would have pursued a radical iconoclastic policy and a transformation of mass into a protestant communion service king s will provided for a regency council to rule after his death which would have been dominated by traditionalists such as duke of norfolk lord chancellor bishop gardiner and bishop tunstall after a dispute with king bishop gardiner leading conservative churchman was disgraced and removed as a councilor later duke of norfolk most powerful conservative nobleman was arrested by time henry died in 1547 protestant edward seymour brother of jane seymour henry s third wife and therefore uncle to future edward vi managed by a number of alliances such as with lord lisle to gain control over privy council edwardian reformation thumb king edward vi of england in whose reign reform of english church moved in a more protestant direction when henry died in 1547 his nine year old son edward vi inherited throne because edward was given a protestant humanist education protestants held high expectations and hoped he would be like josiah biblical king of judah who destroyed altars and images of baal edward s tutors included reformers john cheke richard cox and roger ascham during seven years of edwards reign a protestant establishment would gradually implement religious changes that were designed to destroy one church and build another in a religious revolution of ruthless thoroughness initially however edward was of little account politically real power was in hands of regency council which elected edward seymour 1st duke of somerset to be lord protector protestant somerset pursued reform hesitantly at first partly because his powers were not unchallenged six articles remained law of land and a proclamation was issued on 24 may reassuring people against any innovations and changes in religion nevertheless seymour and cranmer did plan to further reformation of religion in july a book of homilies was published from which all clergy were to preach from on sundays homilies were explicitly protestant in their content condemning relics images rosary beads holy water palms and other superstitions it also directly contradicted king s book by teaching we be justified by faith only freely and without works despite objections from gardiner who questioned legality of bypassing both parliament and convocation justification by faith had been made a central teaching of english church iconoclasm and abolition of chantries in august 1547 thirty commissioners nearly all protestants were appointed to carry out a royal visitation of england s churches royal injunctions of 1547 issued to guide commissioners were borrowed from cromwell s 1538 injunctions but revised to be more radical historian eamon duffy calls them a significant shift in direction of full blown protestantism church processions one of most dramatic and public aspects of traditional liturgy were banned injunctions also attacked use of sacramentals such as holy water it was emphasised that they imparted neither blessing nor healing but were only reminders of christ lighting votive candles before saints images had been forbidden in 1538 and 1547 injunctions went further by outlawing those placed on rood loft reciting rosary was also condemned injunctions set off a wave of iconoclasm in autumn of 1547 while injunctions only condemned images that were abused as objects of worship or devotion definition of abuse was broadened to justify destruction of all images and relics stained glass shrines statues and roods were defaced or destroyed church walls were whitewashed and covered with biblical texts condemning idolatry upright 0 9 thumb right this statue in lady chapel of ely cathedral was vandalized during reformation conservative bishops edmund bonner and gardiner protested visitation and both were arrested bonner spent nearly two weeks in fleet prison before being released gardiner was sent to fleet prison in september and remained there until january 1548 however he continued to refuse to enforce new religious policies and was arrested once again in june when he was sent to tower of london for rest of edward s reign when a new parliament met in november 1547 it began to dismantle laws passed during henry viii s reign to protect traditional religion act of six articles was repealed denial of real physical presence of christ in eucharist old heresy laws were also repealed allowing free debate on religious questions in december sacrament act allowed laity to receive communion under both kinds wine as well as bread this was opposed by conservatives but welcomed by protestants chantries act of 1547 abolished remaining chantries and confiscated their assets unlike 1545 chantry act 1547 act was intentionally designed to eliminate last remaining institutions dedicated to praying for dead confiscated wealth funded rough wooing of scotland chantry priests had served parishes as auxiliary clergy and schoolmasters and some communities were destroyed by loss of charitable and pastoral services of their chantries historians dispute how well this was received a g dickens contended that people had ceased to believe in intercessory masses for souls in purgatory but eamon duffy argued that demolition of chantry chapels and removal of images coincided with activity of royal visitors evidence is often ambiguous in ludlow in shropshire parishioners complied with orders to remove rood and other images in 1547 and in that same year spent money on making up canopy to be carried over blessed sacrament on feast of corpus christi in some places chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so some parishes took steps to conceal images and relics in order to rescue them from confiscation and destruction opposition to removal of images was widespread so much so that when during commonwealth william dowsing was commissioned to task of image breaking in suffolk his task as he records it was enormous 1549 prayer book second year of edward s reign was a turning point for english reformation many people identified year 1548 rather than 1530s as beginning of english church s schism from roman catholic church on 18 january 1548 privy council abolished use of candles on candlemas ashes on ash wednesday and palms on palm sunday on 21 february council explicitly ordered removal of all church images on 8 march a royal proclamation announced a more significant change first major reform of mass and of church of england s official eucharistic theology order of communion was a series of english exhortations and prayers that reflected protestant theology and were inserted into latin mass a significant departure from tradition was that individual confession to a priest long a requirement before receiving eucharist was made optional and replaced with a general confession said by congregation as a whole effect on religious custom was profound as a majority of laypeople not just protestants most likely ceased confessing their sins to their priests by 1548 cranmer and other leading protestants had moved from lutheran to reformed position on eucharist significant to cranmer s change of mind was influence of strasbourg theologian martin bucer this shift can be seen in communion order s teaching on eucharist laypeople were instructed that when receiving sacrament they spiritually eat flesh of christ an attack on belief in real bodily presence of christ in eucharist communion order was incorporated into new prayer book largely unchanged thumb 250px title page of 1549 book of common prayer that prayer book and liturgy book of common prayer was authorized by act of uniformity 1549 it replaced several regional latin rites then in use such as use of sarum use of york and use of hereford with an english language liturgy authored by cranmer this first prayer book was a temporary compromise with conservatives it provided protestants with a service free from what they considered superstition while maintaining traditional structure of mass cycles and seasons of church year continued to be observed and there were texts for daily matins morning prayer mass and evensong evening prayer in addition there was a calendar of saints feasts with collects and scripture readings appropriate for day priests still wore vestments prayer book recommended cope rather than chasuble many of services were little changed baptism kept a strongly sacramental character including blessing of water in baptismal font promises made by godparents making sign of cross on child s forehead and wrapping it in a white chrism cloth confirmation and marriage services followed sarum rite there were also remnants of prayer for dead and requiem mass such as provision for celebrating holy communion at a funeral nevertheless first book of common prayer was a radical departure from traditional worship in that it eliminated almost everything that had till then been central to lay eucharistic piety communion took place without any elevation of consecrated bread and wine elevation had been central moment of old liturgy attached as it was to idea of real presence in addition prayer of consecration was changed to reflect protestant theology three sacrifices were mentioned first was christ s sacrifice on cross second was congregation s sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving and third was offering of ourselves our souls and bodies to be a reasonable holy and lively sacrifice to god while medieval canon of mass explicitly identified priest s action at altar with sacrifice of christ prayer book broke this connection by stating church s offering of thanksgiving in eucharist was not same as christ s sacrifice on cross rather than being church s sacrifice eucharist was merely a means of partaking in and receiving benefits of christ s sacrifice there were other departures from tradition at least initially there was no music because it would take time to replace church s body of latin music most of liturgical year was simply bulldozed away with only major feasts of christmas easter and whitsun along with a few biblical saints days apostles evangelists john baptist and mary magdalene and only two marian feast days purification and annunciation assumption corpus christi and other festivals were gone in 1549 parliament also legalised clerical marriage something already practised by some protestants including cranmer but considered an abomination by conservatives rebellion enforcement of new liturgy did not always take place without a struggle in west country introduction of book of common prayer was catalyst for a series of uprisings through summer of 1549 there were smaller upheavals elsewhere from west midlands to yorkshire prayer book rebellion was not only in reaction to prayer book rebels demanded a full restoration of pre reformation catholicism they were also motivated by economic concerns such as enclosure in east anglia however rebellions lacked a roman catholic character kett s rebellion in norwich blended protestant piety with demands for economic reforms and social justice insurrections were put down only after considerable loss of life somerset was blamed and was removed from power in october it was wrongly believed by both conservatives and reformers that reformation would be overturned succeeding somerset as de facto regent was john dudley 1st earl of warwick newly appointed lord president of privy council warwick saw further implementation of reforming policy as a means of gaining protestant support and defeating his conservative rivals further reform thumb right alt a painting edward vi and pope an allegory of reformation this elizabethan work of propaganda depicts handing over of power from henry viii who lies dying in bed to edward vi seated beneath a cloth of state with a slumping pope at his feet in top right of picture is an image of men pulling down and smashing idols at edward s side are his uncle lord protector edward seymour and members of privy council from that point on reformation proceeded apace since 1530s one of obstacles to protestant reform had been bishops bitterly divided between a traditionalist majority and a protestant minority this obstacle was removed in 1550 1551 when episcopate was purged of conservatives edmund bonner of london william rugg of norwich nicholas heath of worcester john vesey of exeter cuthbert tunstall of durham george day of chichester and stephen gardiner of winchester were either deprived of their bishoprics or forced to resign thomas thirlby bishop of westminster managed to stay a bishop only by being translated to diocese of norwich where he did virtually nothing during his episcopate traditionalist bishops were replaced by protestants such as nicholas ridley john ponet john hooper and miles coverdale newly enlarged and emboldened protestant episcopate turned its attention to ending efforts by conservative clergy to counterfeit popish mass through loopholes in 1549 prayer book book of common prayer was composed during a time when it was necessary to grant compromises and concessions to traditionalists this was taken advantage of by conservative priests who made new liturgy as much like old one as possible including elevating eucharist conservative bishop gardiner endorsed prayer book while in prison and historian eamon duffy notes that many lay people treated prayer book as an english missal to attack mass protestants began demanding removal of stone altars bishop ridley launched campaign in may 1550 when he commanded all altars to be replaced with wooden communion tables in his london diocese other bishops throughout country followed his example but there was also resistance in november 1550 privy council ordered removal of all altars in an effort to end all dispute while prayer book used term altar protestants preferred a table because at last supper christ instituted sacrament at a table removal of altars was also an attempt to destroy idea that eucharist was christ s sacrifice during lent in 1550 john hooper preached as long as altars remain both ignorant people and ignorant and evil persuaded priest will dream always of sacrifice in march 1550 a new ordinal was published that was based on martin bucer s own treatise on form of ordination while bucer had provided for only one service for all three orders of clergy english ordinal was more conservative and had separate services for deacons priests and bishops during his consecration as bishop of gloucester john hooper objected to mention of all saints and holy evangelist in oath of supremacy and to requirement that he wear a black chimere over a white rochet hooper was excused from invoking saints in his oath but he would ultimately be convinced to wear offensive consecration garb this was first battle in vestments controversy which was essentially a conflict over whether church could require people to observe ceremonies that were neither necessary for salvation nor prohibited by scripture 1552 prayer book and parish confiscations 1549 book of common prayer was criticised by protestants both in england and abroad for being too susceptible to roman catholic re interpretation martin bucer identified 60 problems with prayer book and italian peter martyr vermigli provided his own complaints shifts in eucharistic theology between 1548 and 1552 also made prayer book unsatisfactory during that time english protestants achieved a consensus rejecting any real bodily presence of christ in eucharist some influential protestants such as vermigli defended zwingli s symbolic view of eucharist less radical protestants such as bucer and cranmer advocated for a spiritual presence in sacrament cranmer himself had already adopted receptionist views on lord s supper quotes cranmer as explaining and therefore in book of holy communion we do not pray that creatures of bread and wine may be body and blood of christ but that they may be to us body and blood of christ and also i do as plainly speak as i can that christ s body and blood be given to us in deed yet not and but spiritually and effectually in april 1552 a new act of uniformity authorised a revised book of common prayer to be used in worship by november 1 this new prayer book removed many of traditional elements in 1549 prayer book resulting in a more protestant liturgy communion service was designed to remove any hint of consecration or change in bread and wine instead of unleavened wafers ordinary bread was to be used prayer of invocation was removed and minister no longer said body of christ when delivering communion rather he said take and eat this in remembrance that christ died for thee and feed on him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving christ s presence in lord s supper was a spiritual presence limited to subjective experience of communicant anglican bishop and scholar colin buchanan interprets prayer book to teach that only point where bread and wine signify body and blood is at reception rather than reserving sacrament which often led to eucharistic adoration any leftover bread or wine was to be taken home by curate for ordinary consumption in new prayer book last vestiges of prayers for dead were removed from funeral service unlike 1549 version 1552 prayer book removed many traditional sacramentals and observances that reflected belief in blessing and exorcism of people and objects in baptism service infants no longer received minor exorcism and white chrisom robe anointing was no longer included in services for baptism ordination and visitation of sick these ceremonies were altered to emphasise importance of faith rather than trusting in rituals or objects clerical vestments were simplified ministers were only allowed to wear surplice and bishops had to wear a rochet throughout edward s reign inventories of parish valuables ostensibly for preventing embezzlement convinced many government planned to seize parish property just as was done to chantries these fears were confirmed in march 1551 when privy council ordered confiscation of church plate and vestments for as much as king s had presently of a mass of money no action was taken until 1552 1553 when commissioners were appointed they were instructed to leave only bare essentials required by 1552 book of common prayer a surplice tablecloths communion cup and a bell items to be seized included copes chalices patens monstrances and candlesticks many parishes sold their valuables rather than have them confiscated at a later date money funded parish projects that could not be challenged by royal authorities among many examples in haddenham cambridgeshire a chalice paten and processional cross were sold and proceeds devoted to flood defences in wealthy rayleigh parish ps10 worth of plate was sold to pay for cost of required reforms need to buy a parish chest bible and communion table in many parishes items were concealed or given to local gentry who had in fact lent them to church at long melford sir john clopton a patron of church bought up many of images probably to preserve them confiscations caused tensions between protestant church leaders and warwick now duke of northumberland cranmer ridley and other protestant leaders did not fully trust northumberland northumberland in turn sought to undermine these bishops by promoting their critics such as jan laski and john knox cranmer s plan for a revision of english canon law reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum failed in parliament due to northumberland s opposition despite such tensions a new doctrinal statement to replace king s book was issued on royal authority in may 1553 forty two articles reflected reformed theology and practice taking shape during edward s reign which historian christopher haigh describes as a restrained calvinism it affirmed predestination and that king of england was supreme head of church of england under christ edward s succession king edward became seriously ill in february and died in july 1553 before his death edward was concerned that mary his devoutly catholic sister would overturn his religious reforms a new plan of succession was created in which both of edward s sisters mary and elizabeth were bypassed on account of illegitimacy in favour of protestant jane grey granddaughter of edward s aunt mary tudor and daughter in law of duke of northumberland this new succession violated third succession act of 1544 and was widely seen as an attempt by northumberland to stay in power northumberland was unpopular due to church confiscations and support for jane collapsed on 19 july privy council proclaimed mary queen to acclamation of crowds in london marian restoration right thumb queen mary i of england restored english allegiance to rome reconciling with rome both protestants and roman catholics understood that accession of mary i to throne meant a restoration of traditional religion before any official sanction latin masses began reappearing throughout england despite 1552 book of common prayer remaining only legal liturgy mary began her reign cautiously by emphasising need for tolerance in matters of religion and proclaiming that for time being she would not compel religious conformity this was in part mary s attempt to avoid provoking protestant opposition before she could consolidate her power while protestants were not a majority of population their numbers had grown through edward s reign historian eamon duffy writes that protestantism was a force to be reckoned with in london and in towns like bristol rye and colchester and it was becoming so in some northern towns such as hull and halifax following mary s accession duke of norfolk along with conservative bishops bonner gardiner tunstall day and heath were released from prison and restored to their former dioceses by september 1553 hooper and cranmer were imprisoned northumberland himself was executed but not before his conversion to catholicism break with rome and religious reforms of henry viii and edward vi were achieved through parliamentary legislation and could only be reversed through parliament when parliament met in october bishop gardiner now lord chancellor initially proposed repeal of all religious legislation since 1529 house of commons refused to pass this bill and after heated debate parliament repealed all edwardian religious laws including clerical marriage and prayer book in first statute of repeal by 20 december mass was reinstated by law there were disappointments for mary parliament refused to penalise non attendance at mass would not restore confiscated church property and left open question of papal supremacy if mary was to secure england for roman catholicism she needed an heir and her protestant half sister elizabeth had to be prevented from inheriting crown on advice of her cousin charles v holy roman emperor she married his son philip ii of spain in 1554 there was opposition and even a rebellion in kent led by sir thomas wyatt even though it was provided that philip would never inherit kingdom if there was no heir received no estates and had no coronation right thumb cardinal reginald pole presided over english church s reconciliation with rome by end of 1554 henry viii s religious settlement had been re instituted but england was still not reunited with rome before reunion could occur church property disputes had to be settled which in practice meant letting nobility and gentry who had bought confiscated church lands keep them cardinal reginald pole queen s cousin arrived in november 1554 as papal legate to end england s schism with roman catholic church on 28 november pole addressed parliament to ask it to end schism declaring i come not to destroy but to build i come to reconcile not to condemn i come not to compel but to call again in response parliament submitted a petition to queen next day asking that this realm and dominions might be again united to church of rome by means of lord cardinal pole on 30 november pole spoke to both houses of parliament absolving members of parliament with whole realm and dominions thereof from all heresy and schism afterwards bishops absolved diocesan clergy and they in turn absolved parishioners on 26 december privy council introduced legislation repealing religious legislation of henry viii s reign and implementing reunion with rome this bill was passed as second statute of repeal catholic recovery historian eamon duffy writes that marian religious programme was not one of reaction but of creative reconstruction absorbing whatever was considered positive in reforms of henry viii and edward vi result was subtly but distinctively different from catholicism of 1520s according to historian christopher haigh catholicism taking shape in mary s reign reflected mature erasmian catholicism of its leading clerics who were all educated in 1520s and 1530s marian church literature church benefactions and churchwarden accounts suggest less emphasis on saints images and prayer for dead there was a greater focus on need for inward contrition in addition to external acts of penance cardinal pole himself was a member of a catholic reform movement that shared with protestants an emphasis on man s total dependence on god s grace by faith and augustinian views on salvation cardinal pole would eventually replace cranmer as archbishop of canterbury in 1556 jurisdictional issues between england and rome having prevented cranmer s removal mary could have had cranmer tried and executed for treason he had supported claims of lady jane grey but she resolved to have him tried for heresy his recantations of his protestantism would have been a major coup unhappily for her he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at last minute as he was to be burned at stake thus ruining her government s propaganda victory as papal legate pole possessed authority over both his province of canterbury and province of york which allowed him to oversee counter reformation throughout all of england he re installed images vestment and plate in churches around 2 000 married clergy were separated from their wives but majority of these were allowed to continue their work as priests pole was aided by some of leading catholic intellectuals spanish members of dominican order pedro de soto juan de villagarcia and bartolome carranza thumb conservative bishop edmund bonner in 1556 pole ordered clergy to read one chapter of bishop bonner s a profitable and necessary doctrine to their parishioners every sunday modelled on king s book of 1543 bonner s work was a survey of basic catholic teaching organized around apostle s creed ten commandments seven deadly sins sacraments lord s prayer and hail mary bonner also produced a children s catechism and a collection of homilies right thumb westminster abbey was one of seven monasteries re founded during marian restoration from december 1555 to february 1556 cardinal pole presided over a national legatine synod that produced a set of decrees entitled reformatio angliae or reformation of england actions taken by synod anticipated many of reforms enacted throughout catholic church after council of trent pole believed that ignorance and lack of discipline among clergy had led to england s religious turmoil and synod s reforms were designed to remedy both problems clerical absenteeism practice of clergy failing to reside in their diocese or parish pluralism and simony were condemned preaching was placed at centre of pastoral office and all clergy were to provide sermons to people rectors and vicars who failed to were fined most important part of plan was order to establish a seminary in each diocese which would replace disorderly manner in which priests had been trained previously council of trent would later impose seminary system upon rest of catholic church it was also first to introduce altar tabernacle used to reserve eucharistic bread for devotion and adoration mary did what she could to restore church finances and land taken in reigns of her father and brother in 1555 she returned to church first fruits and tenths revenue but with these new funds came responsibility of paying pensions of ex religious she restored six religious houses with her own money notably westminster abbey for benedictines and syon abbey for however there were limits to what could be restored only seven religious houses were re founded between 1555 and 1558 though there were plans to re establish more of 1 500 ex religious still living only about a hundred resumed monastic life and only a small number of chantries were re founded re establishments were hindered by changing nature of charitable giving a plan to re establish greyfriars in london was prevented because its buildings were occupied by christ s hospital a school for orphaned children there is debate among historians over how vibrant restoration was on local level according to historian a g dickens parish religion was marked by religious and cultural sterility though historian christopher haigh observed enthusiasm marred only by poor harvests that produced poverty and want recruitment to english clergy began to rise after almost a decade of declining ordinations repairs to long neglected churches began in parishes restoration and repair continued new bells were bought and church ales produced their bucolic profits great church feasts were restored and celebrated with plays pageants and processions however bishop bonner s attempt to establish weekly processions in 1556 was a failure haigh writes that in years during which processions were banned people had discovered better uses for their time as well as better uses for their money than offering candles to images focus was on crucified christ in mass rood and corpus christi devotion obstacles protestants who refused to conform remained an obstacle to catholic plans around 800 protestants fled england to find safety in protestant areas of germany and switzerland establishing networks of independent congregations safe from persecution these marian exiles carried on a propaganda campaign against roman catholicism and queen s spanish marriage sometimes calling for rebellion those who remained in england were forced to practice their faith in secret and meet in underground congregations right thumb frontispiece of john foxe s book of martyrs in 1555 initial reconciling tone of regime began to harden with revival of medieval heresy laws which authorized capital punishment as a penalty for heresy persecution of heretics was uncoordinated sometimes arrests were ordered by privy council others by bishops and others by lay magistrates protestants brought attention to themselves usually due to some act of dissent such as denouncing mass or refusing to receive sacrament a particularly violent act of protest was william flower s stabbing of a priest during mass on easter sunday 14 april 1555 individuals accused of heresy were examined by a church official and if heresy was found given choice between death and signing a recantation in some cases protestants were burnt at stake after renouncing their recantation around 284 protestants were burnt at stake for heresy several leading reformers were executed including thomas cranmer hugh latimer nicholas ridley john rogers john hooper robert ferrar rowland taylor and john bradford lesser known figures were also among victims including around 51 women such as joan waste and agnes prest historian o t hargrave writes that marian persecution was not excessive by contemporary continental standards however it was unprecedented in english experience historian christopher haigh writes that it failed to intimidate all protestants whose bravery at stake inspired others however it was not a disaster if it did not help catholic cause it did not do much to harm it after her death queen became known as bloody mary due to influence of john foxe one of marian exiles published in 1563 foxe s book of martyrs provided accounts of executions and in 1571 convocation of canterbury ordered that foxe s book should be placed in every cathedral in land mary s efforts at restoring roman catholicism were also frustrated by church itself pope paul iv declared war on philip and recalled pole to rome to have him tried as a heretic mary refused to let him go support she might have expected from a grateful pope was thus denied from 1557 pope refused to confirm english bishops leading to vacancies and hurting marian religious program despite these obstacles 5 year restoration was successful there was support for traditional religion among people and protestants remained a minority consequently protestants secretly ministering to underground congregations such as thomas bentham were planning for a long haul a ministry of survival mary s death in november 1558 childless and without having made provision for a roman catholic to succeed her meant that her protestant sister elizabeth would be next queen elizabethan settlement thumb right queen elizabeth i of england reached a moderate religious settlement elizabeth i inherited a kingdom in which a majority of people especially political elite were religiously conservative and england s main ally was catholic spain for these reasons proclamation announcing her accession forbade any breach alteration or change of any order or usage presently established within this our realm this was only temporary new queen was protestant though a conservative one she also filled her new government with protestants queen s principal secretary was sir william cecil a moderate protestant her privy council was filled with former edwardian politicians and only protestants preached at court when queen s first parliament opened in january 1559 its chief goal was difficult task of reaching a religious settlement in february house of commons passed a reformation bill that would restore royal supremacy as well as 1550 ordinal and a slightly revised 1552 prayer book bill was challenged in house of lords where opposition was led by 20 catholic bishops lords amended bill by leaving mass unchanged and refusing to grant queen title of supreme head though she was free to adopt it herself this bill would have returned church to its position at death of henry viii rather than to that when edward vi died rather than accept this government decided to split bill into one dealing with royal supremacy and another dealing with religious reform act of supremacy 1558 this act made null and void with certain specific exceptions marian act of 1554 that had repealed all henry viii s legislation from 1529 onwards which had denied authority of see of rome and also confirmed elizabeth as supreme governor of church of england supreme governor was a suitably equivocal title that made elizabeth head of church without ever saying she was this was important for two reasons 1 it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule church and 2 it acted in a conciliatory way toward english roman catholics for clergy all but a few were ordained with roman rite elizabeth s changes were more wholesale than those of her half brother edward had been all but one anthony kitchin of bishops lost their posts a hundred fellows of oxford colleges were deprived many dignitaries resigned rather than take oath bishops who were removed from ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to reforms since government was concerned that continuity of orders continue without a break mathew parker was consecrated archbishop of canterbury by two bishops who had been consecrated in mid 1530s using pontifical barlow and hodgkins and two with english ordinal of 1550 and coverdale who were consecrated on same day by cranmer ridley and hodgkins who were consecrated in 1533 1537 and 1548 respectively with roman rites in pontifical on question of images elizabeth s initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and restoration of roods but some of new bishops whom she had elevated protested in 1560 edmund grindal one of marian exiles now made bishop of london was allowed to enforce demolition of rood lofts in london and in 1561 queen herself ordered demolition of all lofts she herself retained a cross and candlesticks in her own chapel thereafter determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by more thoroughgoing destruction of roods vestments stone altars dooms statues and other ornaments queen also appointed a new privy council removing many roman catholic counsellors by doing so under elizabeth factionalism in council and conflicts at court greatly diminished act of supremacy was passed without difficulty act of uniformity 1558 act of uniformity 1558 which forced people to attend sunday service in a parish church with a new version of book of common prayer passed by only three votes no bishops voted in favour two were prevented from voting at all and two other ecclesiastics were absent majority were all laymen bill of uniformity was more cautious than initial reformation bill it revoked harsh laws proposed against roman catholics it removed abuse of pope from litany and kept wording that allowed for an interpretation of real presence of christ in eucharist without making any declaration about matter is actually condemned in thirty nine articles sacrifices of masses was denounced reference to holy communion as an oblation was restricted to an optional prayer of oblation after communion in which congregation asked god to accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving without defining specifically what this referred to or to any connection to sacramental gifts as was case in traditional doctrine as for a eucharistic theory of real presence most agreeable to anglican opinion for centuries without ever being official as there never has been one on issue it was a form of receptionism a term not actually coined until 1867 which asserts that christ is truly present but after a spiritual manner i e invisible and non corporeal or not carnal as understood to be in his natural body so ambivalent we most heartily thank thee for thou does feed us in these holy mysteries with spiritual food of most precious body and blood of our saviour jesus christ book of common prayer prayer of thanksgiving after communion while bread and wine remain in their natural substances referred to as calvinist receptionism or richard hooker greatest defender of elizabethan religious settlement brushed aside transubstantiation and while insisting that sacrament is a true and real participation of christ who thereby himself even his whole person as a mystical head unto every soul that him and less to dispute manner how what these elements are skillet not refusal to burden holy things with too many details is typically anglican at time this was a strategy to try to please as many people as possible but over time it became a virtue resolutely refusing definitively to describe itself as protestant or catholic her church would not move with continental times whether protestant or catholic church of england as dictated to by government became content to define catholicity as adherence to first four ecumenical councils as seen in historic creeds teachings of church fathers and catholic bishops injunctions of 1571 scripture and tradition it would not be a confessional church based on writings of a charismatic leader nor have a magisterium as in papacy instead in light of hooker s writings there would be reason as authority to act continuity over reformation divide and hospitality to sacramental modes of thought in particular place of incarnation anglicanism would come to see itself as primarily a liturgical tradition as expressed in prayer book and axiom law of praying is law of believing although not a creation of queen she laid foundation for church of england as anglican via media under early stuart monarchs after parliament was dismissed elizabeth and cecil drafted royal injunctions these were additions to settlement and largely stressed continuity with catholic past clergy were ordered to wear surplice and use of cope was allowed in cathedrals and collegiate chapels especially since all clergy upon her accession throne were roman catholic men were ordained to three traditional orders of deacon priest and bishop and so referred to in prayer book rites ornaments rubric was introduced and states that ornaments of church and ministers thereof shall remain as they were in second year of reign of edward vi i e in 1548 when mass was still celebrated oxford movement in 19th century interpreted this as permission to wear and other vestments wafers as opposed to ordinary baker s bread were to be used as bread at communion communion would be taken kneeling black rubric which denied real and essential presence of christ in consecrated elements but allowed kneeling as long as this act did not imply adoration was removed from forty two articles of religion and nor replaced until 1662 with modified language denying physical presence of christ in his earthly body queen had rubric removed as an offense to her personal beliefs there had been opposition to settlement in rural england which for most part was largely roman catholic so changes aimed for acceptance of settlement what succeeded more than anything else was sheer length of elizabeth s reign while mary had been able to impose her programme for a mere five years elizabeth had forty five those who delayed looking for a new day when restoration would again be commanded were defeated by passing of years puritans and roman catholics elizabeth s reign saw emergence of puritanism which encompassed those protestants who whilst they agreed that there should be one national church felt that church had been but partially reformed puritanism ranged from hostility to content of prayer book and popish ceremony to a desire that church governance be radically reformed grindal was made archbishop of canterbury in 1575 and chose to oppose even queen in his desire to forward puritan agenda he ended a 6 000 word reproach to her with bear with me i beseech you madam if i choose rather to offend your earthly majesty than to offend heavenly majesty of god he was placed under house arrest for his trouble and though he was not deprived his death in 1583 put an end to hopes of his supporters grindal s successor archbishop whitgift more reflected queen s determination to discipline those who were unprepared to accept her settlement a conformist he imposed a degree of obedience on clergy that apparently alarmed even queen s ministers such as lord burghley puritan cause was not helped even by its friends pseudonymous martin marprelate tracts which attacked conformist clergy with a libellous humorous tone outraged senior puritan clergy and set government on an unsuccessful attempt to run writer to earth john cant whitgift was accused of sodomitical relations with master of peterhouse cambridge defeat of spanish armada in 1588 incidentally made it more difficult for puritans to resist conclusion that since god blew with his wind and they were scattered he could not be too offended by religious establishment in land on other side there were still huge numbers of roman catholics some conformed bending with times hoping that there would be a fresh reverse vestments were still hidden golden candlesticks bequeathed chalices kept mass was still celebrated in some places alongside new communion service but was more difficult than before both roman catholic priests and laity lived a double life apparently conforming but avoiding taking oath of conformity only as time passed did recusancy refusal to attend protestant services became more common jesuits and seminary priests trained in douai and rome to make good losses of english priests encouraged this by 1570s an underground church was growing fast as church of england became more protestant and less bearable for roman catholics who were still a sizeable minority only one public attempt to restore old religion occurred revolt of northern earls in 1569 it was a botched attempt in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted rebels in durham rebellion did not spread assistance they sought did not materialise their communication with allies at court was poor they came nowhere near to freeing mary stuart whose presence might have rallied support from her imprisonment in tutbury argues that initial impetus for rebellion was scarcely religious at all but political what swelled support however was a rejection of prayer book and a desire to restore mass roman catholic church s refusal to countenance occasional attendance at protestant services as well as excommunication of elizabeth by pope pius v in 1570 presented choice to roman catholics more starkly arrival of seminary priests while it was a lifeline to many roman catholics brought further trouble elizabeth s ministers took steps to stem tide fines for refusal to attend church were raised from 12 d per service to ps20 a month fifty times an artisan s wage it was now treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled to rome execution of priests began first in 1577 four in 1581 eleven in 1582 two in 1583 six in 1584 fifty three by 1590 and seventy more between 1601 and 1608 england judicially murdered more roman catholics than any other country in europe it became treasonable for a roman catholic priest ordained abroad to enter country because papacy had called for deposing of queen choice for moderate roman catholics lay between treason and damnation list of catholic martyrs of english reformation was extensive there is some distance between legislation and its enforcement governmental attacks on recusancy were mostly upon gentry few recusants were actually fined fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates persecution eased catholic priests came to recognise that they should not refuse communion to occasional conformists persecutions did not extinguish faith but they tested it sorely huge number of roman catholics in east anglia and north in 1560s disappeared into general population in part because recusant priests largely served great roman catholic houses which alone could hide them without mass and pastoral care yeomen artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism roman catholicism supported by foreign or expatriate priests came to be seen as treasonous legacy thumb polemical popular print with a catalogue of sects 1647 by time of elizabeth s death a third party had emerged perfectly hostile to puritans but not adherent to rome it preferred revised book of common prayer of 1559 which was without some of matters offensive to roman catholics procter f frere w h a new history of book of common prayer macmillan 1965 p recusants had been removed from centre of stage new dispute was now between puritans who wished to see an end of prayer book and episcopacy and this third party considerable body of people who looked kindly on elizabethan settlement who rejected whose spirituality had been nourished by prayer book and who preferred governance of bishops it was between these two groups that after elizabeth s death in 1603 a new more savage episode of reformation was in process of gestation during reigns of stuart kings james i and charles i battle lines were to become more defined leading ultimately to english civil war first on english soil to engulf parts of civilian population war was only partly about religion but abolition of prayer book and episcopacy by a puritan parliament was an element in causes of conflict as historian macculloch has noted legacy of these tumultuous events can be recognised throughout commonwealth 1649 60 and restoration that followed it and beyond this third party was to become core of restored church of england but at price for further division historiography historiography of english reformation has seen vigorous clashes among dedicated protagonists and scholars for five centuries main factual details at national level have been clear since 1900 as laid out for example by james anthony history of england from fall of wolsey to defeat of spanish armada 12 volumes 1893 online free and albert pollard r a f pollard henry viii 1905 online free pollard history of england from accession of edward vi to death of elizabeth 1547 1603 1910 online free reformation historiography has seen many schools of interpretation with protestant catholic anglican historians using their own religious perspectives in addition there has been a highly influential whig interpretation based on liberal secularized protestantism that depicted reformation in england in words of ian hazlitt as midwife delivering england from dark ages to threshold of modernity and so a turning point of progress finally among older schools was a neo marxist interpretation that stressed economic decline of old elites in rise of landed gentry and middle classes all these approaches still have representatives but main thrust of scholarly historiography since 1970s falls into four groupings or schools according to hazlett geoffrey elton leads first faction with an agenda rooted in political historiography it concentrates on top of early modern church state looking at it at mechanics of policymaking and organs of its implementation and enforcement key player for elton was not henry viii but rather his principal secretary of state thomas cromwell elton downplays prophetic spirit of religious reformers in theology of keen conviction dismissing them as meddlesome intrusions from fanatics and bigots deals with elton secondly geoffrey dickens and others were motivated by a primarily religious perspective they prioritize religious and subjective side of movement while recognizing reformation was imposed from top just as it was everywhere else in europe it also responded to aspirations from below dickens has been criticized for underestimating strength of residual and revived roman catholicism but has been praised for his demonstration of close ties to european influences in dickens school david loades has stressed theological importance of reformation for anglo british development a g dickens john tonkin and kenneth powell eds reformation in historical thought 1985 revisionists comprise a third school led by christopher haigh jack scarisbrick and numerous other scholars their main achievement was discovery of an entirely new corpus of primary sources at local level leading them to emphasis on reformation as it played out on a daily and local basis with much less emphasis on control from top they emphasize turning away from elite sources they emphasize local parish records diocesan files guild records data from boroughs courts and especially telltale individual wills finally patrick collinson and others have brought much more precision to theological landscape with calvinist puritans who were impatient with anglican caution sent compromises indeed puritans were a distinct subgroup who did not comprise all of calvinism church of england thus emerged as a coalition of factions all
