video games on personal computers pcs which at time was province of dedicated home video game consoles carmack and his coworkers john romero and tom hall along with jay wilbur and lane roathe developed a demo of a pc version of super mario bros 3 but failed to convince nintendo to invest in a pc port of their game soon afterwards however they were approached by scott miller of apogee software to develop an original game to be published through apogee shareware model hall designed three part game john carmack and romero programmed it wilbur managed team and artist adrian carmack helped later in development team worked continuously for almost three months on game working late into night at office at softdisk and taking their work computers to john carmack s home to continue developing it released by apogee on december 14 1990 trilogy of episodes was an immediate success apogee whose monthly sales had been around us 7 000 made us 30 000 on commander keen alone in first two weeks and us 60 000 per month by june while first royalty check convinced development team then known as ideas from deep to quit their jobs at softdisk team founded id software shortly thereafter

vorticon king and other vorticons you haven t slaughtered then award him a medal for saving them development genesis thumb upright left john romero in 2012 alt face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses in september 1990 john carmack a game programmer for gamer s edge video game subscription service and disk magazine at softdisk in shreveport louisiana with aid of a copy of michael abrash s power graphics programming developed from scratch a way to create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game at time ibm compatible general purpose computers were not able to replicate common feat of video game consoles such as nintendo entertainment system that of redrawing entire screen fast enough for a smooth side scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware carmack rejecting clever little shortcuts that other programmers had attempted to solve problem created adaptive tile refresh a way to slide majority of visible screen to side both horizontally and vertically when player character moved as if it had not changed and only redraw newly visible portions of screen other scrolling computer games had previously redrawn whole screen in chunks or like carmack s earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction he discussed idea with coworker tom hall who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating first level of recently released super mario bros 3 on a computer pair did so in a single overnight session with hall recreating graphics of game replacing player character of mario with dangerous dave a character from an eponymous previous gamer s edge game while carmack optimized code next morning september 20 carmack and hall showed resulting game dangerous dave in copyright infringement to another coworker john romero romero recognized carmack s programming feat as a major accomplishment nintendo was one of most successful companies in japan largely due to success of their mario franchise and ability to replicate gameplay of series on a computer could have large implications scrolling technique did not meet softdisk s coding guidelines as it needed at least a 16 color ega graphics processor and programmers in office who did not work on games were not as impressed as romero romero felt that potential of carmack s idea should not be wasted on softdisk while other members of gamer s edge team more or less agreed he especially felt that their talents in general were wasted on company which needed money their games brought in but in his opinion neither understood nor appreciated video game design as distinct from general software programming manager of team fellow programmer jay wilbur recommended that they take demo to nintendo itself to position themselves as capable of building a pc version of super mario bros for company group composed of carmack romero hall wilbur and gamer s edge editor lane roathe decided to build a full demo game to send to nintendo as they lacked computers to build project at home and could not work on it at softdisk they borrowed their work computers over weekend taking them in their cars to a house shared by carmack wilbur and roathe group then spent next 72 hours working non stop on demo which copied super mario bros 3 with some shortcuts taken in artwork sound and level design and a title screen that credited game to programmers under name ideas from deep a name romero had used for some prior softdisk projects response from nintendo a few weeks later was not as hoped for while nintendo was impressed with their efforts they wanted mario series to remain exclusive to nintendo consoles thumb john carmack in 2006 around same time group was rejected by nintendo romero was receiving fan mail about some of games he had developed for gamer s edge upon realizing that all letters came from different people but shared same address that of scott miller of apogee software he wrote back an angry reply only to receive a phone call from miller soon after miller explained that he was trying to get in contact with romero unofficially as he expected that softdisk would screen his mail to him at company he wanted to convince romero to publish more levels for his previous pyramids of egypt an adventure game in which player navigates mazes while avoiding egyptian themed traps and monsters through apogee s shareware model miller was pioneering a model of game publishing in which part of a game would be released for free with remainder of game available for purchase from apogee romero said he could not as pyramids of egypt was owned by softdisk but that it did not matter as game he was now working on was much better romero sent miller mario demo and two agreed that ideas from deep would create a new game for apogee group negotiated that miller would front them money for development costs which miller later claimed was all money apogee had miller sent group a us 2 000 advance in return for an agreement that they would create a game before christmas of 1990 only a few months away this advance was team s entire budget for development game was planned to be split into three parts to match apogee s shareware model of giving away first part for free to attract interest in whole creation ideas from deep convened to come up with design for game and hall suggested a console style platformer in vein of super mario bros as they had technology made for it he further recommended a science fiction theme john carmack added idea of a genius child protagonist saving world and hall quickly created a short summary for game a dramatic introduction about eight year old genius billy blaze defending earth with his spaceship when he read out summary in an over dramatic voice to group they laughed and applauded and group agreed to begin work on commander keen in invasion of vorticons ideas from deep team who referred to themselves as ifd guys could not afford to leave their jobs to work on game full time so they continued to work at softdisk making gamer s edge games during day while working on commander keen at night they also continued to take home their work computers to carmack s house on weekends putting them in their cars at night and bringing them back in morning before anyone else arrived they even began to request upgrades to computers from softdisk nominally for their work group split into different roles hall became game designer and creative director john carmack and romero were programmers and wilbur manager they invited artist adrian carmack from softdisk to join them late in development while roathe was soon kicked out of group romero self appointed leader of team liked him but felt that his work ethic did not match well with rest of team and pushed for his removal ideas from deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at softdisk from october through december 1990 working on commander keen with wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks several members of team have mentioned in interviews as an example of team s commitment a night during development when a heavy storm flooded path to get to house preventing them from working and john romero waded through a flooding river to make it to house anyway as principal designer hall s personal experiences and philosophies strongly impacted game keen s red shoes and green bay packers football helmet were items hall wore as a child dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences and enemies were based loosely on his reading of sigmund freud s psychological theories such as that of id other influences on hall for game were duck dodgers in 24 1 2th century 1953 and other chuck jones cartoons and available data on worp reaction a 1953 short story by lion miller about a child constructing a spaceship keen s bean with bacon spaceship was taken from a george carlin skit about using bay leaves as deodorant so as to smell like soup keen was intended to be a reflection of hall as he had wanted to be as a child team separated game from its super mario bros roots by adding non linear exploration and additional mechanics like pogo stick a suggestion from miller that part of popularity of super mario bros was presence of secrets and hidden areas in game led hall to add several secrets such as an entire hidden level in first episode and a galactic alphabet in which signs in game were written which if deciphered by players revealed hidden messages jokes and instructions level maps were designed using a custom made program called tile editor ted which was first created for dangerous dave and was used for entire keen series as well as several other games as game neared completion miller began to market game to players strongly encouraged by updates team was sending him he began heavily advertising game in all bulletin board systems bbs and game magazines he had access to as well as sending team us 100 checks every week labelled pizza bonus after one of game s food items to keep them motivated game was completed in early december 1990 and on afternoon of december 14 miller began uploading completed first episode to bbss with other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for us 30 reception commander keen was an immediate hit for apogee company s previous sales levels had been around us 7 000 per month but by christmas keen already had sales of almost us 30 000 miller described game as a little atom bomb to magazine editors and bbs controllers when asked about it its success led him to recruit his mother and hire his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players and to quit his other job and move apogee from his house into an office by june 1991 game was bringing in over us 60 000 per month chris parker of pc magazine later in 1991 referred to game s release as a tremendous success apogee announced plans to license game to another publisher for a nintendo entertainment system port in an advertising flyer that year but no such version was ever created scott miller estimates that trilogy eventually sold between 50 000 and 60 000 copies a contemporary review by barry simon of pc magazine praised game s graphical capabilities as having a nintendo feel though he termed graphics as well drawn but not spectacular in terms of resolution he noted that game was very much an arcade game that players would not purchase for its scintillating plot or ground breaking originality but said that all three episodes were very fun to play and that scrolling graphics set it apart from similar games a short summary of trilogy in 1992 in pc world termed it one of most spectacular games available and praised superb sound and graphics while a similar summary in cq amateur radio described it as nintendo comes to pc and best action adventure game reviewer had ever seen in october 1992 shareware industry awards gave commander keen series best entertainment software and best overall award a review of entire commander keen series in 1993 by sandy petersen in first eye of monitor column for dragon described series as action games with hilarious graphics acknowledging its debt to super mario bros he called it including vorticon trilogy one of best games of its type and praised it for not being mindlessly hard though still requiring some thought to play through and especially for humor in graphics and gameplay legacy ideas from deep s first royalty check from apogee in january 1991 for us 10 500 convinced them that they no longer needed their day jobs at softdisk but could devote themselves full time to their own ideas hall and wilbur were concerned about risk of being sued if they did not break news gently to softdisk but romero and john carmack were dismissive of possibility especially as they felt they had no assets for which they could be sued shortly thereafter john carmack was confronted by their boss softdisk owner al vekovius who had become suspicious of group s increasingly erratic disinterested and surly behavior at work as well as their multiple requests for computer upgrades vekovius had been told by another employee that group were making their own games and he felt that carmack was generally incapable of lying carmack in turn bluntly admitted that they had made keen with softdisk computers that they felt no remorse for their actions and that they were all planning on leaving vekovius felt that company was reliant on gamer s edge subscriptions and tried to convince group to instead form a new company in partnership with softdisk when ideas from deep made no secret of offer in office other employees threatened to all quit if team was rewarded for stealing from company after several weeks of negotiation ideas team agreed to produce a series of games for softdisk one every two months and on february 1 1991 founded id software in 2017 history of digital games author andrew williams claims that vorticons signaled a new direction for computer games in general as well as setting a tone of gameplay mechanics for future id games by introducing a sense of effortless movement as players explored through large open spaces instead of disconnected screens like prior platforming computer games in summer of 1991 id hosted a seminar for game developers with intention of licensing commander keen engine they did so forming spiritual predecessor to both quakecon and id s standard of licensing their game engines id software also produced several more games in commander keen series first of these commander keen in keen dreams was published in 1991 through their agreement with softdisk commander keen in goodbye galaxy composed of episodes secret of oracle and armageddon machine was published through apogee in december 1991 and final id developed keen game commander keen in aliens ate my babysitter was published through formgen
