portland aerial tram or ohsu tram is an aerial tramway in portland oregon carrying commuters between city s south waterfront district and main oregon health science university ohsu campus located in marquam hill neighborhood it is one of only two commuter aerial tramways in united states other being new york city s roosevelt island tramway tram travels a horizontal distance of and a vertical distance of in a ride that lasts three minutes tram was jointly funded by ohsu city of portland and by south waterfront property owners with most of funding coming from ohsu it is owned by city and operated by ohsu while most passengers are affiliated with ohsu it is open to public and operated as part of portland s public transportation network that includes portland streetcar max light rail and trimet buses after opening in december 2006 tram carried its one millionth passenger on october 17 2007 and its ten millionth rider on january 8 2014 a round trip ticket costs 5 15 but is free for ohsu patients and certain visitors ohsu employees and students ride free by showing their id badges tram cost 57 million to build a nearly fourfold increase over initial cost estimates which was one of several sources of controversy concerning project description route thumb 300px route elevation tram s route goes over three major highways an interstate and several neighborhoods westbound driving route is cyan where it differs from eastbound route tram consists of two stations and a single intermediate tower two tram cars operate in a mode on parallel track ropes and are pulled in unison by a haul rope which is driven by an engine at lower terminal when one car is at upper terminal other is at lower terminal and vice versa lower station is located beside an ohsu facility in south waterfront neighborhood adjacent to a stop on portland streetcar line which connects south waterfront neighborhood with downtown portland upper station is located adjacent to ohsu hospital on university s marquam hill campus two stations are exactly east and west of each other separated by a horizontal distance of and a vertical distance of maximum vertical clearance between tram and ground is tram route crosses over interstate 5 as well as major thoroughfares such as barbur boulevard oregon route 10 naito parkway and oregon route 43 macadam avenue intermediate tower is located east of interstate 5 close to south waterfront station as a result of this configuration much of journey is significantly elevated above ground making tram easily visible for some distance and providing tram riders with good views of eastern metropolitan area and cascade mountains of oregon and washington alternative to riding tram is via public roadways which require a route with numerous and intersections this route includes a short stretch of busy u s route 26 as well as twisty sam jackson park road which ascends side of tualatin mountains to hospital campus structures and cabling thumb terminal at south waterfront lower south waterfront station houses tram s engines in a reinforced concrete basement and also has ticketing facilities and control room upper station is a freestanding steel and concrete tower above grade and houses tram s counterweight it is structurally separate from nearby ohsu hospital and connects to hospital s ninth floor via a skybridge over sw campus drive which winds through middle of university structural separation between tram and hospital is necessary to avoid vibrations from tram machinery interfering with delicate microsurgery performed in hospital intermediate tower allows tram to gain elevation quickly once leaving lower station to provide adequate clearance over interstate 5 tower is wide and long at its base at its narrowest point nearly two thirds up tower and at top it rests on a pier cap thick supported by 35 piers tower was fabricated in nearby vancouver washington and barged in three pieces up willamette river nearly of steel and of concrete are in two platforms and intermediate tower lateral loads on upper platform range from or each tram car travels on a pair of steel track ropes totaling four cables track ropes combined are tensioned at over a fifth cable haul rope is a continuous loop which winds around drive bullwheel at lower station connects to one car winds through a counterweighted bullwheel at upper station then to other car before joining itself haul rope length is over cars thumb upright portland aerial tram s interior tram cars each weigh approximately with cabin dimensions of each car has a capacity of over and there is sufficient room in cabin for 78 passengers and one operator tram cars were built by ag of bern in switzerland and were shaped and painted to look like architectural firm s vision of bubbles floating through sky surface of cabins reflects and refracts light minimizing their visual impact to neighborhood underneath north and south cars are named jean and walt http www com about respectively after jean richardson first female engineering graduate from oregon state university and walt reynolds first african american to graduate from ohsu then known as university of oregon medical school drive and safety systems tram is propelled by three independent drive systems primary drive is a variable frequency electric motor two hydrostatic diesel engines are also part of design one is a standby drive permitting operation during a power outage other is an emergency evacuation drive a counterweight offsets weight of cars tram is capable of operating at speeds up to in addition to redundant drive system tram has numerous other design features intended to ensure safety of passengers and persons on ground under its route communications systems permit tram car operators to communicate with control room automatic supervisory and control systems monitor condition of ropes and drive systems tram was designed to safely operate in earthquake prone pacific northwest with a structural design exceeding u s earthquake standards and operate in sustained winds of up to operational information tram operates from monday through friday from 5 30 am to 9 30 pm and on saturdays from 9 00 am to 5 00 pm pacific time tram is closed on sundays and major holidays except afternoon summer sunday service is available tram is free for ohsu employees students patients and visitors trimet c tran and portland streetcar monthly and annual passes are honored a ride on tram normally lasts three minutes transportation officials originally estimated tram would carry over 1 500 people a day a figure that was expected to rise to 5 500 by 2030 those initial estimates proved to be conservative tram attracted one million riders in its first 10 1 2 months of operation and averaged 10 000 riders per weekday as of 2016 history thumb upright intermediate tram support tower under construction tower is adjacent to northbound lanes of interstate 5 in late 2001 ohsu purchased property in south waterfront then known as north macadam area with plans to expand there after studying several ways including shuttle buses gondola lifts tunnels and even to connect ohsu s primary campus on marquam hill with this area of planned expansion university sought city support of an aerial tram planning and design in early 2002 portland aerial transportation inc pati was formed as a non profit board one of its first public actions was to request portland bureau of transportation at time known as portland office of transportation and abbreviated as to undertake an independent analysis of connectivity options considered earlier by university and its development supporters in may 2002 city council accepted pdot s process proposal and also accepted pati as project sponsor pdot s assessment led to same conclusion ohsu had reached earlier an aerial tram was preferred approach pdot also recommended a second tram linking marquam hill area with a nearby transit center on sw barbur boulevard in july 2002 city council accepted pdot s recommendations and asked pdot and pati to proceed to design phase including a design competition both were also asked to work with residents of affected neighborhoods to identify ways to mitigate tram s impact and identify other desired neighborhood improvements which should accompany project one of results of that process was gibbs street pedestrian bridge which was completed mid 2012 design competition started out by identifying four firms which would participate in contest competition officially began in january 2003 with firms from new york city amsterdam and los angeles zurich as finalists winner los angeles zurich based angelil graham scholl was announced on march 26 2003 in november pati chose doppelmayr to design fabricate and install tram first public review of project s status was november 2003 construction and opening construction began in august 2005 with work on both platforms and intermediate tower occurring through summer of that year bulk of construction occurred in 2006 installation of engines and other equipment occurred during spring and early summer of 2006 which was followed by installation of cables during late summer and early fall on october 29 2006 tram s two cars arrived from switzerland after a week long delay an inaugural run of tram was conducted on november 9 2006 four tram construction workers were first to test ride tram while harnessed to roof and suspending arm testing on tram continued through november tram opened to ohsu employees on december 15 2006 tram opened to public on january 27 2007 funding and cost overruns project suffered significant cost overruns during its construction final cost was nearly four times initial estimate a development that nearly led to tram s cancellation mid construction operating costs are nearly twice original projections when city approved tram project it was understood that ohsu would pay for most of it while taxpayer share has grown ohsu paid for 85 of total cost of tram though it is operated as public transit facility initial estimates and funding initial budget for tram published in november 2002 was 15 5 million excluding soft costs such as project management and architect s fees funding sources for 15 5 million include a direct 4 million cash contribution from ohsu 9 5 from local improvement districts set up to fund tram construction of which ohsu s share is 4 8 million and 2 million from city of portland via portland development commission other property owners in south waterfront local improvement district pay remaining 3 7 million in april 2004 second public review was held to present project recommendations prior to a may review by city council costs by then were estimated to be 28 5 million including soft costs city s share at that time was 3 5 million in april 2005 price was readjusted again to 40 million with a construction delay of six months higher steel costs weakening us dollars and engineering modifications were blamed by october oregonian reported that steel costs had led to bids pushing project s price with contingency funds to 45 million increased cost was expected to be met through south waterfront urban renewal contributions which would have otherwise been spent on streets and parks review of project thumb a tram car docking with upper terminal in january 2006 portland city commissioner sam adams who inherited city s oversight of project undertook several actions in response to spiraling costs executive director of pati was ousted and a month long independent audit and risk assessment was undertaken its results were published february 1 2006 by this point construction was over one third completed audit revealed that ohsu managers knew as early as 2003 that tram would cost well in excess of original 15 5 million figure partially due to a change in location of upper terminal to accommodate planned hospital construction but had withheld that information from city leaders this resulted in harsh public criticism of ohsu management with city commissioner randy leonard accusing university leadership of an outrageous shell game all at expense of taxpayers as a result city of portland threatened to withdraw funding from tram mid construction which would probably have scuttled project ohsu protested vigorously threatening a lawsuit should tram be canceled and claimed city was responsible for making up any budget shortfall negotiations between city ohsu and contractors ensued with a revised funding plan and budget being agreed upon in april 2006 by a 3 2 vote of city council this revised funding plan required concessions from all parties involved and called for a final budget of 57 million with contributions from city at 8 5 million or nearly 15 of overall budget this final budget was met operating costs tram s operating costs are also higher than expected originally it was expected to cost 915 000 annually but is now expected to be 1 7 million as a result fare originally estimated at 1 70 is set at 4 70 about same as an all day ticket on tri met 5 00 fare is waived for ohsu employees students patients and visitors and those with monthly or annual transit passes on tri met c tran or portland streetcar operating costs are divided between city and ohsu in proportion to ridership if 85 of passengers are ohsu related ohsu pays 85 of operating cost community response even prior to cost increases which plagued design and construction of tram project has been subject to criticism from public many residents in neighborhoods under tram s route object to tram s presence cost increases themselves and perceived machinations of public officials have been controversial some consider project an unworthy use of public funds at any price either due to a lack of benefit for those not associated with ohsu or due to opposition to such projects in general objections from underlying neighborhoods thumb auld s controversial protest banner viewed from tram itself many residents of corbett terwilliger and lair hill neighborhoods over which tram passes were concerned cars would be an invasion of privacy and lead to lower property values initially residents were promised that overhead power lines would be buried as part of project but as cost overruns mounted this plan was scrapped neighborhood opponents of tram have cited other reasons for opposing tram s construction including fact that north corbett neighborhood is a historic district listed on national register of historic places some residents filed a lawsuit against city and ohsu claiming that they own airspace above their properties city later offered to purchase homes directly under tram route at fair market value in initial years after its completion tram was unpopular with some living underneath its route in april 2007 homeowner justin auld living under tram route placed a sign on his backyard fence stating fuck tram in large block letters sign is not visible from street only from air publicity surrounding sign prompted city officials to quietly negotiate with homeowner and sign has since been moved and expletive covered concerns over cost both ohsu and city of portland have taken much public criticism for ballooning development costs local television station katu questioned relative price of portland tram compared to a new tram at jackson hole mountain resort which was built by same company and as of 2007 was projected to carry 28 percent more passengers but costing only 25 million tram s supporters however claimed that many of increases are justified or due to circumstances beyond developers control auditor s report commissioned in 2006 complimented tram as a dramatic one of a kind facility that will become a portland landmark and noted that design was difficult to construct requiring tall thin complex tower and tall heavily loaded upper terminal to be built within very tight tolerances in addition it has been claimed that re planning delayed tram s completion one of designers of tram noted that if we added up all times we went back to try to save money we probably lost a year maybe we saved 2 million but what did we lose if we had an extra year that would have meant a lot concerns over corporate welfare thumb upright upper station with ohsu hospital on left some critics at time of construction cited tram as an example of corporate welfare for ohsu with limited public benefit a 2001 study done by ohsu prior to tram s being designed projected that tram would have 4 700 riders per day by 2030 with less than one fifth 850 of those being non ohsu users while lower station has easy public access access to upper station requires navigating through ohsu hospital cascade policy institute a local libertarian research group criticized project for being railroaded through political process by small groups of private interests and expressed doubt that tram construction would lead to new jobs others argue that while issues of increasing public costs are real importance of continued growth of ohsu for city s economy must be factored in as well not only is it largest employer in city but ohsu is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding totaling more than 168 million dollars for 2005 and a highly skilled workforce to area growth in current campus on marquam hill is limited by access roads and parking an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to surrounding communities architectural and visual impacts tram has been praised for its visual impact critic jeff jahn of net called tram most significant new piece of architecture to be added to portland since michael graves portland building in 1980 tram has also won several architectural awards including american institute of architects los angeles chapter s 2006 next honor award and 2007 presidential award of excellence from american institute of steel construction according to city commissioner adams a cheaper alternative which would have changed tower s designs to a lattice style used in electrical transmission towers was not considered because result would look like an ugly ski lift at a bad ski resort and leave city with what adams called an ugly postcard that could last 100 years critics of tram have also expressed concern over tram s
