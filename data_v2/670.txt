chrysiridia rhipheus madagascan sunset moth is a day flying moth of family uraniidae it is considered one of most impressive and appealing looking lepidopterans famous worldwide it is featured in most coffee table books on lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors though many older sources species name as ripheus it is very colourful though iridescent parts of wings do not have pigment rather colours originate from optical interference adults have a wingspan of dru drury who described moth in 1773 placed it in genus papilio considering it a butterfly jacob hubner placed it in moth genus chrysiridia in 1823 later led to junior synonyms such as chrysiridia madagascariensis lesson 1831 at first moth was thought to be from china or bengal but was later found to be endemic to madagascar it is found throughout year in most parts of island with peak populations between march and august and smallest numbers between october and december females lay about 80 eggs under leaves of omphalea spp caterpillars are whitish yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club ended black setae silk spun from mouth helps caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to plant when they fall this silk has also been known to cause a euphoric high to those who consume it after completing four instars caterpillars spin an open network cocoon pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days chrysiridia rhipheus is sole specialist herbivore of four species of omphalea in madagascar omphalea is toxic toxins are sequestered by feeding caterpillar and retained in pupal and adult stages thousands of these moths migrate between eastern and western ranges of their host plants taxonomy madagascan sunset moth was first described by british entomologist dru drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a captain may of hammersmith because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies drury described species as papilio rhipheus specimen drury received had head of a different species attached probably that of a butterfly which had clubbed antennae this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies once inaccuracy in drury s specimen was found moth was placed in genus urania until 1823 when german entomologist jacob hubner placed it in a new genus chrysiridia moth has also been described under other names because drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless william swainson thought it was a different species than complete specimen described by pieter cramer in 1833 swainson named butterfly rhipheus and moth orientalis other synonyms include u crameri by in 1879 and u ripheus var madagascariensis by lesson in 1831 native malagasy people call it or from lolo for spirit or butterfly and andriana for noble or king therefore meaning noble butterfly noble spirit king butterfly or king spirit genus chrysiridia is entirely african and only other species in genus is east african c croesus chrysiridia is one of three diurnal uraniine genera other two genera are urania its sister taxon and alcides most basal in group use of endospermum is an ancestral state a more basal alcides feed on endospermum and omphalea while urania and chrysiridia feed only on omphalea description chrysiridia rhipheus has a wingspan of and sometimes up to moths from highlands have a median wingspan of moths from lower altitudes have a median wingspan of like many other uraniine moths sunset moth has an uncanny resemblance to swallowtail butterflies especially in its tails and colourful wings and can easily be mistaken for a butterfly sunset moth is black with iridescent red blue and green markings there is a fringe of white scales on wing edges wider on hindwings moth has six tails very often lost or damaged during its life pattern variations are common and moth is often partly asymmetrical one of factors causing this is temperature shock during pupal stage wing microstructure unlike in many other moths colour of c rhipheus wings does not come from pigments colour originates from coherent scattering and interference of light by microstructure of ribbon like scales covering moth s wings these structural characteristics make this species and its neotropical relative urania common subjects of research in optical science colours on madagascan sunset moth s wings are produced by conjunction of two optical phenomena thumb both sides of chrysiridia rhipheus an air cuticle multilayer in scales creates optical interference each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that hold them in place and maintain an air gap between them layers and air gaps are narrower than wavelength of visible light structure varies from one layer at proximal end of each scale to about six layers at distal end this multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light which are determined by thicknesses of layers and angle at which light hits scale scales are highly curved which creates inter scale reflection this mechanism is unusual among lepidoptera proximal part of each scale is almost flat scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at distal end covering proximal part of next row of scales because of this shape adjacent rows of scales have valley like grooves between them this allows light to strike one scale reflect at a roughly 90deg angle strike next scale and be reflected away from wing because angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes near top of curved part of scale colour seen in each part of wing is combination of colours reflected by these two effects because cuticle layers are arranged in rows with a cylindrical curve amount of second type of reflection is dependent on polarization of incoming light this makes moth s overall colour polarization dependent many insects can detect polarization of light so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths this has not yet been studied however distribution and habitat thumb upright distribution of four species of omphalea in madagascar drury s specimen was given to him by captain may of hammersmith and believed to have come from china cramer believed specimen came from chandernagore in bengal however giving rise to french name page de it is now known that chrysiridia rhipheus is endemic to madagascar thousands of adult moths seasonally migrate between geographically isolated populations of their host plant omphalea spp they can be found almost everywhere on island except in south west and extreme south of where their host plant is absent they migrate from three species in dry deciduous forest in west o ankaranensis o occidentalis and o palmata to eastern rainforest species o oppositifolia western species are largely in protected areas eastern species on other hand is mostly unprotected and dispersed in widely scattered populations threatened by deforestation being only evergreen species o oppositifolia is probably crucial for moth s survival jamaican moth urania from same subfamily most likely became extinct after loss of one of its host plant species moths migrate in response to changes in host plants chrysiridia larvae defoliate whole plant and even eat flowers and fruit and thus have a considerable negative impact on reproduction and survival of seedlings plants probably react by changing their nutrient and secondary compound levels becoming toxic to larvae and causing high mortality omphalea populations that are not damaged by moths for long periods of time have lower toxicity these factors cause mass increases in local population followed by sudden crashes population crashes might result from increased larval mortality but are more likely caused by emigration of adult moths through semiochemicals plant may recruit hymenopteran parasitoids as a protection hence playing a role in population dynamics of moth host plants like c croesus and species of genus urania c rhipheus is a specialist species whose caterpillars feed strictly on species of pantropical genus omphalea euphorbiaceae four species of genus omphalea are endemic to madagascar o ankaranensis a shrub from limestone karst of northern madagascar o palmata a dry forest shrub closely related to o ankaranensis but from western madagascar o occidentalis also a dry forest species of western madagascar o oppositifolia a tree from east coast rainforest of madagascar omphalea like many other members of euphorbiaceae possesses leaf nectaries that attract wasps which are predators of early instar caterpillars leaf nectaries also attract ants ants usually protect their host plant eating both nectar and plant eating insects on it however they generally completely ignore chrysiridia caterpillars making it likely that caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence this chemical deterrent comes from host plants omphalea species contain alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by caterpillar pupa and adult moth behaviour unlike most moths sunset moth is day flying and bright aposematic colours warn predators of its toxicity a strategy seen in many diurnal moths another habit moth has in common with many butterflies is night resting posture wings are held vertically over back during their migrations they roost in a group for night moth flies over crown of trees and in clearings sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100 m 300 ft it then falls inert and wings closed to ground life cycle thumb left final instar larva shown here on leaf of omphalea oppositifolia thumb left adult chrysiridia rhipheus at madagascar near mahajanga continuous generations of moth are present all year highest populations are found from march to august fall and winter while lowest are from october to december spring females lay their eggs late in afternoon or at nightfall and locate potential oviposition sites visually like eggs of other uraniidae sunset moth s eggs are domed with projecting ribs a single egg weighs about and usually has 17 ribs but sometimes 18 or less often 16 eggs are usually laid on lower surface of omphalea leaves but occasionally on upper surface eggs are laid in groups of 60 to 110 usually about 80 after they hatch small caterpillars only eat tissue parenchyma between veins of leaves they do this to avoid sticky and toxic latex produced by plant s and transported in veins after 3 4 days caterpillars also eat flowers fruit tendrils petioles and young stems as well as continuing to eat leaves defoliating entire plant they are particularly fond of glands at base of leaf near petiole they can deal with chemical defences in latex which does not cause problem of mouthpart coagulation caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an motion of head as they walk this keeps them from falling from smooth surface of leaves silk also permits them to climb back to plant should they fall strong rain makes them fall despite silk there are four instars and caterpillar stage lasts from two months in warm season to two and a half to three months in cold season caterpillar is whitish yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club ended black setae it has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10 and six true legs attached to thorax after completing all but its last moult caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk cocoon can be in tree crown or between two leaves but is most often near ground between moss and bark it is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh in warm season cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes these durations are slightly longer in cold season chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in november warmest month and 23 days in july coldest month five to six days before eclosion motifs of wings start to become visible moth emerges during night or in low light by splitting pupal case from top once out of pupal pupal exoskeleton moth finds a horizontal surface from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs wings are deployed in about 10 minutes by pumping haemolymph into wing veins moth then beats them a few times waits 45 minutes to let them harden then beats them lightly again moth finally takes flight between one and a half and two hours later nectar sources adult moths prefer white or whitish yellow flowers as a nectar source which indicates that visual cues play a large role in their selection most flowers visited are inflorescences of small flowers or have dense filaments giving them appearance of a bottle brush often because of conspicuous projecting stamens as in many leguminosae mimosoideae myrtaceae and combretaceae however not all white flowers elicit a response white and showy flowers of omphalea oppositifolia are not visited by adult moths nectar sources include flowers of terminalia indian almond camellia sinensis tea plant japonica eucalyptus spp especially e saligna sydney blue gum mangifera indica common mango tree all these flowers are white with exception of camellia sinensis which has a yellow centre and all either have dense filaments or are formed of tight clusters of small flowers in culture thumb right a cigarette card featuring a chrysiridia madagascariensis fairy in 1928 this spectacular moth is considered one of most impressive and beautiful lepidoptera rivalling almost any of butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form it is featured in most coffee table books on lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors it is collected in wild and raised commercially for international butterfly trade its wings were used to make jewellery in victorian era madagascan sunset moth appeared on a 6 postage stamp in lesotho postal services butterflies of africa issue of 20 august 2007 only one of four species of host plants omphalea oppositifolia is used to raise moth commercially mainly using plants collected in wild but also some cultivated for purpose in malagasy lolo is for butterfly or moth and soul there is little doubt that this is because a pupa resembles a covered corpse and that adult emerges from it like soul from body of dead malagasy people believe soul of dead or of ancestors appears in form of a lepidopteran and thus to attack it is to attack ancestors footnotes meaning of specific epithet rhipheus was not given by author dru drury possibilities include latin montes ural mountains or ripheus
