crocodilia or crocodylia is an order of mostly large predatory semiaquatic reptiles known as crocodilians they first appeared 95 million years ago in late cretaceous period cenomanian stage and are closest living relatives of birds as two groups are only known survivors of archosauria members of order s total group clade pseudosuchia appeared about 250 million years ago in early triassic period and diversified during mesozoic era order crocodilia includes true crocodiles family crocodylidae alligators and caimans family alligatoridae and gharial and false gharial family gavialidae although term crocodiles is sometimes used to refer to all of these crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group large solidly built lizard like reptiles crocodilians have long flattened snouts laterally compressed tails and eyes ears and nostrils at top of head they swim well and can move on land in a high walk and a low walk while smaller species are even capable of galloping their skin is thick and covered in non overlapping scales they have conical peg like teeth and a powerful bite they have a four chambered heart and somewhat like birds a unidirectional looping system of airflow within lungs but like other reptiles they are ectotherms crocodilians are found mainly in lowlands in tropics but alligators also live in southeastern united states and yangtze river in china they are largely carnivorous various species feeding on animals such as fish crustaceans molluscs birds and mammals some species like indian gharial are specialised feeders while others like saltwater crocodile have generalised diets crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial though cooperative feeding does occur during breeding dominant males try to monopolise available females females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and unlike most other reptiles care for their hatched young some species of crocodilians are known to have attacked humans largest number of attacks comes from nile crocodile humans are greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around world since at least ancient egypt earliest known mention of story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in 9th century it was later spread by sir john mandeville in 1400 and then by william shakespeare in late 16th century and early 17th century spelling and etymology crocodilia and crocodylia have been used interchangeably for decades starting with schmidt s redescription of group from formerly defunct term schmidt k p 1953 a checklist of north american amphibians and reptiles sixth edition amer soc chicago university of chicago press schmidt used older term crocodilia based on owen s original name for group owen r 1842 report on british fossil

relatives now in larger groups called crocodylomorpha and pseudosuchia under its current definition crocodylia is restricted to only most recent ancestor of today s modern day crocodilians alligators crocodiles and gharials this distinction is more important for paleontologists studying crocodilian evolution as such alternate spellings crocodilia and crocodylia are still used interchangeably in literature crocodilia appears to be a of greek which means both lizard and nile crocodile crocodylia as coined by wermuth in regards to genus crocodylus appears to be derived from ancient greek kroke kroke meaning shingle or pebble and or dr e ilos for worm name may refer to animal s habit of basking on pebbled shores of nile kelly 2006 p xiii morphology and physiology thumb right mounted skeleton and taxidermy of nile crocodile thumb right crocodilians like this spectacled caiman can hide in water with only their nostrils eyes and ears at surface crocodilians range in size from paleosuchus and osteolaemus species which reach to saltwater crocodile which reaches and weighs up to though some prehistoric species such as late cretaceous deinosuchus were even larger at up to about and they tend to be sexually dimorphic with males much larger than females grigg and gans pp 326 327 though there is diversity in snout and tooth shape all crocodilian species have essentially same body morphology they have solidly built lizard like bodies with elongated flattened snouts and laterally compressed tails their limbs are reduced in size front feet have five digits with little or no webbing and hind feet have four webbed digits and a rudimentary fifth kelly pp 70 75 skeleton is somewhat typical of tetrapods although skull pelvis and ribs are specialised in particular cartilaginous processes of ribs allow thorax to collapse during diving and structure of pelvis can accommodate large masses of food or more air in lungs both sexes have a cloaca a single chamber and outlet at base of tail into which intestinal urinary and genital tracts open it houses penis in males and clitoris in females grigg and gans p 336 crocodilian penis is permanently erect and relies on cloacal muscles for eversion and elastic ligaments and a tendon for recoil testes or ovaries are located near kidneys huchzermeyer p 19 eyes ears and nostrils of crocodilians are at top of head this allows them to stalk their prey with most of their bodies underwater crocodilians possess a tapetum lucidum which enhances vision in low light while eyesight is fairly good in air it is significantly weakened underwater fovea in other vertebrates is usually circular but in crocodiles it is a horizontal bar of tightly packed receptors across middle of retina when animal completely submerges nictitating membranes cover its eyes in addition glands on nictitating membrane secrete a salty lubricant that keeps eye clean when a crocodilian leaves water and dries off this substance is visible as tears ears are adapted for hearing both in air and underwater and eardrums are protected by flaps that can be opened or closed by muscles grigg and gans p 335 crocodilians have a wide hearing range with sensitivity comparable to most birds and many mammals they have only one olfactory chamber and vomeronasal organ is absent in adults indicating all olfactory perception is limited to olfactory system behavioural and experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air borne and water soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting when above water crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile by gular pumping a rhythmic movement of floor of pharynx well developed trigeminal nerve allows them to detect vibrations in water such as those made by potential prey tongue cannot move freely but is held in place by a folded membrane while brain of a crocodilian is fairly small it is capable of greater learning than most reptiles though they lack vocal folds of mammals and syrinx of birds huchzermeyer p 13 crocodilians can produce vocalisations by vibrating three flaps in larynx they appear to have lost their pineal organ but still show signs of melatonin rhythms melatonin rhythms in australian freshwater crocodile ncbi locomotion thumb right 250px nile crocodile swimming sequence runs from right to left crocodilians are excellent swimmers during aquatic locomotion muscular tail undulates from side to side to drive animal through water while limbs are held close to body to reduce drag when animal needs to stop steer or manoeuvre in a different direction limbs are splayed out crocodilians generally cruise slowly on surface or underwater with gentle sinuous movements of tail but when pursued or when chasing prey they can move rapidly mazzotti pp 43 46 crocodilians are less well adapted for moving on land and are unusual among vertebrates in having two different means of terrestrial locomotion high walk and low walk their ankle joints flex in a different way from those of other reptiles a feature they share with some early archosaurs one of upper row of ankle bones astragalus moves with tibia and fibula other calcaneum is functionally part of foot and has a socket into which a peg from astragalus fits result is that legs can be held almost vertically beneath body when on land and foot can swivel during locomotion with a twisting movement at ankle sues p 21 thumb left crocodilians like this american alligator can high walk with limbs held almost vertically unlike other reptiles high walk of crocodilians with belly and most of tail being held off ground is unique among living reptiles it somewhat resembles walk of a mammal with same sequence of limb movements left fore right hind right fore left hind low walk is similar to high walk but without body being raised and is quite different from sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards animal can change from one walk to other instantaneously but high walk is usual means of locomotion on land animal may push its body up and use this form immediately or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising body higher unlike most other land vertebrates when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase speed at which lower half of each limb rather than whole leg swings forward by this means stride length increases while stride duration decreases though typically slow on land crocodilians can produce brief bursts of speed and some can run at for short distances kelly pp 81 82 a fast entry into water from a muddy bank can be effected by plunging to ground twisting body from side to side and splaying out limbs in some small species such as freshwater crocodile a running gait can progress to a bounding gallop this involves hind limbs launching body forward and fore limbs subsequently taking weight next hind limbs swing forward as spine flexes dorso ventrally and this sequence of movements is repeated during terrestrial locomotion a crocodilian can keep its back and tail straight since scales are attached to vertebrae by muscles whether on land or in water crocodilians can jump or leap by pressing their tails and hind limbs against substrate and then launching themselves into air grigg and gans p 329 jaws and teeth thumb right skull of american alligator snout shape of crocodilians varies between species crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts while alligators and caimans have mostly broad ones gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated muscles that close jaws are much more massive and powerful than ones that open them and a crocodilian s jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily conversely jaws are extremely difficult to pry open kelly p 69 powerful closing muscles attach at median of portion of lower jaw and jaw hinge attaches to atlanto occipital joint allowing animal to open its mouth fairly wide huchzermeyer pp 7 10 crocodilians have some of strongest bite forces in animal kingdom in a study published in 2003 an american alligator s bite force was measured at up to in a 2012 study a saltwater crocodile s bite force was measured even higher at this study also found no correlation between bite force and snout shape nevertheless gharial s extremely slender jaws are relatively weak and built more for quick jaw closure bite force of deinosuchus may have measured even greater than that of theropod dinosaurs like tyrannosaurus crocodilian teeth vary from blunt and dull to sharp and needle like broad snouted species have teeth that vary in size while those of slender snouted species are more uniform teeth of crocodiles and gharials tend to be more visible than those of alligators and caimans when jaws are closed grigg and gans pp 227 228 easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line teeth on lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in upper jaw so only upper teeth are visible when mouth is closed teeth on lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves on outside of top jaw making both upper and lower teeth visible when mouth is closed crocodilians are meaning each of their teeth is of same type they do not possess different tooth types such as canines and molars and and able to replace each of their approximately 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75 year lifespan they are only non mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets next to each full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth and an stem cell in dental lamina in standby which can be activated when required tooth replacement slows significantly and eventually stops as animal grows old skin and scales thumb right skin of a juvenile nile crocodile skin of crocodilians is thick and cornified and is clad in non overlapping scales known as scutes arranged in regular rows and patterns these scales are continually being produced by cell division in underlying layer of epidermis stratum and surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically outer surface of scutes consists of relatively rigid beta keratin while hinge region between scutes contains only more pliable alpha keratin many of scutes are strengthened by bony plates known as osteoderms which are same size and shape as superficial scales but grow beneath them they are most numerous on back and neck of animal and may form a protective armour they often have prominent lumpy ridges and are covered in hard wearing beta keratin head lacks actual scales and is instead covered in a tight sheet of highly keratinised skin that cracks due to mechanical stress of jaws skin on neck and flanks is loose while that on abdomen and underside of tail is sheathed in large flat square scutes arranged in neat rows scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation research also suggests that alkaline ions released into blood from calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis some scutes contain a single pore known as an integumentary sense organ crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies while alligators and caimans only have them on head their exact function is not fully understood but it has been suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to skin there are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on throat and others in side walls of cloaca various functions for these have been suggested they may play a part in communication as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics and immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days kelly p 85 circulation crocodilian has perhaps most complex vertebrate circulatory system it has a four chambered heart and two ventricles an unusual trait among extant reptiles grigg and gans pp 331 332 and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called foramen of panizza like birds and mammals crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through heart chambers they also have unique cog teeth like valves that when interlocked direct blood to left aorta and away from lungs and then back around body this system may allow animals to remain submerged for a longer period but this explanation has been questioned other possible reasons for peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs prevention of pulmonary oedema or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis retaining carbon dioxide within body permits an increase in rate of gastric acid secretion and thus efficiency of digestion and other gastrointestinal organs such as pancreas spleen small intestine and liver also function more efficiently when submerged a crocodilian s heart rate slows down to one or two beats a minute and blood flow to muscles is reduced when it rises and takes a breath its heart rate speeds up in seconds and muscles receive newly oxygenated blood kelly p 78 unlike many marine mammals crocodilians have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles during diving muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in blood to release oxygen respiration thumb left x ray video of a female american alligator showing contraction of lungs while breathing crocodilians were traditionally thought to breathe like mammals with airflow moving in and out tidally but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within lungs when a crocodilian inhales air flows through trachea and into two primary bronchi or airways which branch off into narrower secondary passageways air continues to move through these then into even narrower tertiary airways and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed first time air then flows back into primary airways and is exhaled back out these aerodynamic valves within bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without aid of avian like air sacs lungs of crocodilians are attached to liver and pelvis by diaphragmaticus muscle analogous of diaphragm in mammals during inhalation external intercostal muscles expand ribs allowing animal to take in more air while muscle causes hips to swing downwards and push belly outward and diaphragmaticus pulls liver back when exhaling internal intercostal muscles push ribs inward while rectus pulls hips and liver forwards and belly inward because lungs expand into space formerly occupied by liver and are compressed when it moves back into position this motion is sometimes referred to as a hepatic piston crocodilians can also use these muscles to adjust position of their lungs thereby controlling their buoyancy in water an animal sinks when lungs are pulled towards tail and floats when they move back towards head this allows them to move through water without creating disturbances that could alert potential prey in addition they can also spin and twist by moving their lungs laterally swimming and diving crocodilians appear to rely on lung volume more for buoyancy than oxygen storage just before diving animal exhales to reduce its lung volume and achieve negative buoyancy when submerging nostrils of a crocodilian shut tight all species have a palatal valve a membranous flap of skin at back of oral cavity that prevents water from flowing into throat oesophagus and trachea this enables them to open their mouths underwater without drowning crocodilians typically remain underwater for fifteen minutes or less at a time but some can hold their breath for up to two hours under ideal conditions maximum diving depth is unknown but crocodiles can dive to at least digestion crocodilian teeth are adapted for seizing and holding prey and food is swallowed unchewed digestive tract is relatively short as meat is a fairly simple substance to digest stomach is divided into two parts a muscular gizzard that grinds food and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it mazzotti p 54 stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths which play a role in mechanical breakdown of food digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently low energy requirements this allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal digesting food slowly they can withstand extended fasting living on stored fat between meals even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food losing 23 of their bodyweight during this time an adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of amount of food necessary for a lion of same weight and can live for half a year without eating thermoregulation thumb right captive indian gharial basking and gaping crocodilians are ectotherms producing relatively little heat internally and relying on external sources to raise their body temperatures sun s heat is main means of warming for any crocodilian while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction or cool animal in hot weather main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural for example an alligator in temperate regions may start day by basking in sun on land a bulky animal it warms up slowly but at some time later in day it moves into water still exposing its dorsal surface to sun at night it remains submerged and its temperature slowly falls basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer for crocodiles in tropics avoiding overheating is generally main problem they may bask briefly in morning but then move into shade remaining there for rest of day or submerge themselves in water to keep cool gaping with mouth can provide cooling by evaporation from mouth lining mazzotti pp 48 51 by these means temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between and mainly stays in range grigg and gans p 330 ranges of american and chinese alligator extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter being ectothermic internal body temperature of crocodilians falls as temperature drops and they become sluggish they may become more active on warm days but do not usually feed at all during winter in cold weather they remain submerged with their tails in deeper less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through surface if ice forms on water they maintain ice free breathing holes and there have been occasions when their snouts have become frozen into ice temperature sensing probes implanted in wild american alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when weather warms up osmoregulation thumb left saltwater crocodile resting on beach no living species of crocodilian can be considered truly marine although saltwater crocodile and american crocodile are able to swim out to sea their normal habitats are river mouths estuaries mangrove swamps and hypersaline lakes though several extinct species have had marine habitats including recently extinct gavialis papuensis which occurred in a fully marine habitat in solomon islands coastlines all crocodilians need to maintain concentration of salt in body fluids at suitable levels osmoregulation is related to quantity of salts and water exchanged with environment intake of water and salts takes place across lining of mouth when water is drunk incidentally while feeding and when present in foods water is lost from body during breathing and both salts and water are lost in urine and faeces through skin and via salt excreting glands on tongue though these are only present in crocodiles and gharials mazzotti pp 52 55 kelly p 68 skin is a largely effective barrier to both water and ions gaping causes water loss by evaporation from lining of mouth and on land water is also lost through skin large animals are better able to maintain homeostasis at times of osmotic stress than smaller ones newly hatched crocodilians are much less tolerant of exposure to salt water than are older juveniles presumably because they have a higher surface area to volume ratio kidneys and excretory system are much same as in other reptiles but crocodilians do not have a bladder in fresh water osmolality concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution s osmotic pressure in plasma is much higher than it is in surrounding water animals are well hydrated and urine in cloaca is abundant and dilute nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate grigg and gans pp 333 334 sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through skin in freshwater conditions in seawater opposite is true osmolality in plasma is lower than surrounding water which is dehydrating for animal cloacal urine is much more concentrated white and opaque with nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid distribution and habitat thumb left spectacled caiman immersed in vegetation covered water crocodilians are amphibious reptiles spending part of their time in water and part on land last surviving fully terrestrial genus mekosuchus became extinct about 3000 years ago after humans had arrived on its pacific islands making extinction possibly anthropogenic typically they are creatures of tropics main exceptions are american and chinese alligators whose ranges extend as far north as south eastern united states and yangtze river respectively florida in united states is only place that crocodiles and alligators live side by side most crocodilians live in lowlands and few are found above where temperatures are typically about 5 degc 9 degf lower than at coast none of them permanently reside in sea though some can venture into it and several species can tolerate brackish water of estuaries mangrove swamps and extreme salinity of hypersaline lakes alcala and dy liacco pp 136 139 saltwater crocodile has widest distribution of any crocodilian with a range extending from eastern india to new guinea and northern australia much of its success is due to its ability to swim out to sea and colonise new locations but it is not restricted to marine environment and spends much time in estuaries rivers and large lakes ross p 68 various types of aquatic habitats are used by different crocodilians some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps ponds and edges of lakes where they can bask in sun and there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna others spend more time in water and inhabit lower stretches of rivers mangrove swamps and estuaries these habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food asian gharials find fish on which they feed in pools and backwaters of swift rivers south american dwarf caimans inhabit cool fast flowing streams often near waterfalls and other caimans live in warmer turbid lakes and slow moving rivers crocodiles are mainly river dwellers and chinese alligator is found in slow moving turbid rivers flowing across china s floodplains american alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps rivers or lakes with clear or turbid water climatic factors also affect crocodilians distribution locally during dry season caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months in rainy season much of savannah in venezuelan llanos is flooded and they disperse widely across plain alcala and dy liacco p 141 desert crocodiles in mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during driest periods when it rains reptiles gather at thumb right american crocodiles basking dry land is also important as it provides opportunities for basking nesting and escaping from temperature extremes gaping allows evaporation of moisture from mouth lining and has a cooling effect and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating alcala and dy liacco pp 144 146 four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline type of vegetation bordering rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas these forests are of great importance to crocodilians creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish roots of trees absorb water when it rains releasing it back slowly into environment when forests are cleared to make way for agriculture rivers tend to silt up water runs off rapidly water courses can dry up in dry season and flooding can occur in wet season destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than hunting alcala and dy liacco pp 148 152 ecological roles thumb right gharial camouflaged with floating weed being highly efficient predators crocodilians tend to be top of food chain in their watery environments pooley pp 76 80 nest mounds built by some species of crocodilian are used by other animals for their own purposes american alligator mounds are used by turtles and snakes both for basking and for laying their own eggs florida red bellied turtle specialises in this and alligator mounds may have several clutches of turtle eggs developing alongside owner s eggs alcala and dy liacco p 145 alligators modify some wetland habitats in flat areas such as everglades by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes these create wetter or drier habitats for other organisms such as plants fish invertebrates amphibians reptiles and mammals in limestone depressions of cypress swamps alligator holes tend to be large and deep those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow while those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable man made holes do not appear to have as large an effect in amazon basin when caimans became scarce as a result of overhunting in mid 20th century number of local fish such as important arapaima arapaima gigas also decreased these are nutrient poor waters and urine and faeces of caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients thus presence of reptiles could have benefited fish stock number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with fish population alcala and dy liacco pp 146 148 behavior and life history spacing adult crocodilians are typically territorial and solitary individuals may defend basking spots nesting sites feeding areas nurseries and overwintering sites male saltwater crocodiles establish year round territories that encompass several female nesting sites some species are occasionally gregarious particularly during droughts when several individuals gather at remaining water sites individuals of some species may share basking sites at certain times of day feeding thumb left nile crocodile ambushing migrating wildebeest crossing mara river crocodilians are largely carnivorous and diets of different species can vary with snout shape and tooth sharpness species with sharp teeth and long slender snouts like indian gharial and australian freshwater crocodile are specialised for feeding on fish insects and crustaceans while extremely broad snouted species with blunt teeth like chinese alligator and broad snouted caiman specialise in eating hard shelled molluscs species whose snouts and teeth are intermediate between these two forms such as saltwater crocodile and american alligator have generalised diets and opportunistically feed on invertebrates fish amphibians other reptiles birds and mammals though mostly carnivorous several species of crocodilian have been observed to consume fruit and this may play a role in seed dispersal in general crocodilians are stalk and ambush predators though hunting strategies vary depending on individual species and prey being hunted terrestrial prey is stalked from water s edge and then grabbed and drowned grigg and gans pp 229 330 gharials and other fish eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey and these animals can leap out of water to catch birds bats and leaping fish small animals can be killed by whiplash as predator shakes its head caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water they may also dig for bottom dwelling invertebrates and smooth fronted caiman will even hunt on land some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest building birds nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively and several individuals may feed on same carcass most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers thumb right a gharial eating a fish crocodilians are unable to chew and need to swallow food whole so prey that is too large to swallow is torn into pieces they may be unable to deal with a large animal with a thick hide and may wait until it becomes putrid and comes apart more easily to tear a chunk of tissue from a large carcass a crocodilian spins its body continuously while holding on with its jaws a manoeuvre known as death roll during cooperative feeding some individuals may hold on to prey while others perform roll animals do not fight and each retires with a piece of flesh and awaits its next feeding turn pooley pp 88 91 food is typically consumed by crocodilians with their heads above water food is held with tips of jaws tossed towards back of mouth by an upward jerk of head and then down nile crocodiles may store carcasses underwater for later consumption reproduction and parenting thumb left mother american alligator with nest and young crocodilians are generally polygynous and individual males try to mate with as many females as they can monogamous pairings have been recorded in american alligators dominant male crocodilians patrol and defend territories which contain several females males of some species like american alligator try to attract females with elaborate courtship displays during courtship crocodilian males and females may rub against each other circle around and perform swimming displays copulation typically occurs in water when a female is ready to mate she arches her back while her head and tail submerge male rubs across female s neck and then grasps her with his hindlimbs placing his tail underneath hers so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted mating can last up to 15 minutes during which time pair continuously submerge and surface kelly pp 86 88 while dominant males usually monopolise reproductive females multiple paternity is known to exist in american alligators where as many as three different males may sire offspring in a single clutch within a month of mating female crocodilian begins to make a nest thumb right nile crocodile eggs depending on species female crocodilians may construct either holes or mounds as nests latter made from vegetation litter sand or soil nests are typically found near dens or caves those made by different females are sometimes close to each other particularly in hole nesting species number of eggs laid in a single clutch ranges from ten to fifty crocodilian eggs are protected by hard shells made of calcium carbonate incubation period is two to three months temperature at which eggs incubate determines sex of hatchlings constant nest temperatures above produce more males while those below produce more females however sex in crocodilians may be determined in a short interval and nests are subject to changes in temperature most natural nests produce hatchlings of both sexes though single sex clutches do occur young may all hatch in a single night crocodilians are unusual among reptiles in amount of parental care provided after young hatch mother helps excavate hatchlings from nest and carries them to water in her mouth newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother kelly pp 89 90 for spectacled caimans in venezuelan llanos individual mothers are known to leave their young in same nurseries or creches and one of mothers guards them hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during day and disperse at nightfall to feed time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary for american alligators groups of young associate with adults for one to two years while juvenile saltwater and nile crocodiles become independent in a few months communication social life of a crocodilian begins while it is still in egg because young start communicating with each other before they are hatched it has been shown that a light tapping noise near nest will be repeated by young one after another such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously once it has broken out of egg a juvenile produces yelps and grunts either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls lang pp 104 109 vocalisations are frequent as juveniles disperse and again as they congregate in morning nearby adults presumably parents also give signals warning of predators or alerting youngsters to presence of food range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species alligators are noisiest while some crocodile species are almost completely silent adult female new guinea crocodiles and siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult while nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation american alligator is exceptionally noisy it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows each a couple of seconds long at ten second intervals it also makes various grunts and hisses males create vibrations in water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals enlarged boss of male gharial may serve as a sound resonator another form of acoustic communication is this typically starts with an animal in water elevating its snout and remaining stationary after some time jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound and this is immediately followed by a loud splash after which head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced some species then roar while others slap water with their tails episodes of spread through group purpose varies but it seems to be associated with maintaining social relationships and is also used in courtship dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at water surface and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with jaws open before retreating underwater growth and mortality thumb upright young saltwater crocodiles in captivity mortality is high for eggs and hatchlings and nests face threats from floods overheating and predators flooding is a major cause of failure of crocodilians to breed successfully nests are submerged developing embryos are deprived of oxygen and juveniles get washed away numerous predators both mammalian and reptilian may raid nests and eat crocodilian eggs pooley and ross pp 94 97 despite maternal care they receive hatchlings commonly fall to predation kelly p 91 while female is transporting some to nursery area others are picked off by predators that lurk near nest in addition to terrestrial predators hatchlings are also subject to aquatic attacks by fish birds take their toll and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive in northern australia survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty five percent but with each succeeding year of life this improves reaching sixty percent by year five mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes jaguar and giant p 22 may prey on caimans in south america in other parts of world elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians adults do not normally eat their own offspring but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults in nile crocodiles rival males sometimes kill each other during breeding season growth in hatchlings and young crocodilians depends on food supply and sexual maturity is linked with length rather than age female saltwater crocodiles reach maturity at while males mature at australian freshwater crocodiles take ten years to reach maturity at spectacled caiman matures earlier reaching its mature length of in four to seven years crocodilians continue to grow throughout their lives males in particular continue to gain in weight as they get older but this is mostly in form of extra girth rather than length huchzermeyer p 31 crocodilians can live 35 75 years and their age can be determined by growth rings in their bones taxonomy and classification evolution main distinguishing characteristic of diapsid tetrapods is presence of two openings temporal fenestrae on either side of skull behind eye living diapsids include modern reptiles and birds feature that distinguishes archosaurs from other diapsids is an extra pair of openings in skull antorbital fenestrae in front of eye sockets archosauria is crown group containing most recent common ancestor of crocodilians and birds and all its descendants it comprises pseudosuchia false crocodiles and which in turn comprises dinosaurs and their relatives pterosaurs and birds pseudosuchia is defined as living crocodilians and all archosaurs more closely related to crocodilians than to birds pseudosuchia bird split is assumed to have occurred close to permian triassic mass extinction event china fossil shows bird crocodile family trees split earlier than thought in modern crocodilians antorbital fenestrae are walled off externally and exist merely as sinuses they were present in most of their fossil ancestors as small openings buffetaut pp 26 37 thumb right restoration of early crocodylomorph crocodylomorphs are only pseudosuchians to have survived triassic jurassic extinction event 201 3 million years ago during early jurassic period dinosaurs became dominant on land and crocodylomorphs underwent major adaptive to fill ecological niches vacated by recently extinguished groups unfolding fossil evidence shows that mesozoic crocodylomorphs had a much greater diversity of forms than modern crocodilians some became small fast moving insectivores others specialist fish eaters still others marine and terrestrial carnivores and a few became herbivores earliest stage of crocodilian evolution was protosuchians which evolved in late triassic and early jurassic they were followed by mesosuchians which diversified widely during jurassic and tertiary another group eusuchians appeared in late cretaceous 80 million years ago and includes all crocodilians living today thumb right skeletal mount of giant crocodylian deinosuchus from late cretaceous of north america protosuchians were small mostly terrestrial animals with short snouts and long limbs they had bony armor in form of two rows of plates extending from head to tail and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians their vertebrae were convex on two main articulating surfaces and their bony palates were little developed mesosuchians saw a fusion of palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of nasal passages to near pterygoid bones this allowed animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under water eusuchians continued this process with interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in pterygoid bones vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface allowing for a ball and socket type joint between vertebrae bringing greater flexibility and strength oldest known is from lower cretaceous of isle of wight in united kingdom it was followed by crocodilians such as planocraniidae so called hoofed crocodiles in palaeogene spanning cretaceous and palaeogene periods is genus borealosuchus of north america with six species though its phylogenetic position is not settled three primary branches of crocodilia had diverged by end of mesozoic earliest known members of group is from cenomanian 95 million years ago and after are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in north america and europe during campanian around 83 6 72 1 million years ago first known appeared in cenomanian around 72 1 66 0 million years ago that lineage must have been present during campanian and earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms which indicates that time of actual divergence between three lineages must have been a pre campanian event relationships thumb upright 1 3 borealosuchus wilsoni phylogenetic relationships of crocodilians has been subject of debate and conflicting results many studies and their resulting cladograms or family trees of crocodilians have found short snouted families of crocodylidae and alligatoridae to be close relatives with long snouted gavialidae as a divergent branch of tree resulting group of short snouted species name brevirostres was supported mainly by studies which analyzed skeletal features alone in 2012 erickson et al produced a phylogeny formed from dna sequencing to give a maximum likelihood cladogram of relationships among living crocodilians excluding yacare caiman for which no dna evidence was available in this existence of a distinct group brevirostres was rejected with long snouted more closely related to crocodiles than to alligators taxonomy extant thumb male gharial has a long narrow snout with a boss at tip family gavialidae genus gavialis gharial gavialis genus tomistoma false gharial tomistoma there are two

volia interactions with humans farming and ranching thumb upright aerial view of a crocodile farm in cambodia alligators and crocodiles were first farmed in early 20th century but facilities involved were zoo like and their main source of income was from tourism by early 1960s feasibility of farming these reptiles on a commercial scale was investigated in response to decline of many crocodilian species around world farming involves breeding and rearing captive stock on a self contained basis whereas ranching means use of eggs juveniles or adults taken each year from wild commercial organisations must satisfy criteria of convention on international trade in endangered species cites by demonstrating that in area concerned they do not adversely impact wild population alligator and crocodile farming began because of demand for their hides but now nearly all parts of animal are put to use side and belly skin make best leather meat is eaten gall bladders are valued in east asia and heads are sometimes made into ornaments in traditional chinese medicine alligator meat is said to cure common cold and prevent cancer while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties attacks crocodilians are opportunistic predators that are at their most dangerous in water and at edge of water several species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories nests or young by mistake while attacking domestic animals such as dogs or for food as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans species on which there is most data are saltwater crocodile nile crocodile and american alligator other species which have sometimes attacked humans are black caiman morelet s crocodile mugger crocodile american crocodile gharial and freshwater crocodile thumb right sign in florida warning of alligators nile crocodile has a reputation as biggest killer of large animals including humans on african continent it is widely distributed found in many habitats and cryptically coloured from a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above water it can lunge at drinking animals fishermen bathers or people collecting water or washing clothes once seized and dragged into water there is little chance for victim to escape analysis of attacks show that most take place during breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young pooley hines and shield pp 174 177 although many attacks go unreported there are estimated to be over 300 per year 63 of which are fatal wild saltwater crocodiles in australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004 these animals have also caused fatalities in malaysia new guinea and elsewhere they are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles humans or boats such as canoes attacks may come from animals of various sizes but larger males are generally responsible for fatalities as their size increases so does their need for larger mammalian prey pigs cattle horses and humans are all within size range they seek most of people attacked were either swimming or wading but in two instances they were asleep in tents american alligators are recorded as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid 2004 causing sixteen human fatalities ten of these were in water and two were on land circumstances of other four are not known most attacks were in warmer months of year though in florida with its warmer climate attacks can happen at any time of year alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either nile or saltwater crocodile kelly pp 61 62 but increase in density of human population in everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased risk of alligator attacks conversely in mauritania where crocodiles growth is severely stunted by arid conditions local people swim with them without being attacked as pets several species of crocodilian are traded as exotic pets they are appealing when young and pet store owners can easily sell them but crocodilians do not make good pets they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep as they grow older pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in united states and cuba most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles kelly pp 108 111 in medicine blood of alligators and crocodiles contains peptides with antibiotic properties these may contribute to future antibacterial drugs conservation thumb left handbag made from skin of west african dwarf crocodile osteolaemus tetraspis at natural history museum london main threat to crocodilians around world is human activity including hunting and habitat destruction early in 1970s more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded driving down majority of crocodilian populations in some cases almost to extinction starting in 1973 cites attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals such as skins of crocodiles this proved to be problematic in 1980s as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of africa and it was legal to hunt them at conference of parties in botswana in 1983 it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell lawfully hunted skins in late 1970s crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries started from eggs taken from wild by 1980s farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy unlawful trade in wild crocodilians by 2000 skins from twelve crocodilian species whether harvested lawfully in wild or farmed were traded by thirty countries and unlawful trade in products had almost vanished thumb right young gharial in reserve forest gharial has undergone a chronic long term decline combined with a rapid short term decline leading iucn to list species as critically endangered in 1946 gharial population had been widespread numbering around 5 000 to 10 000 by 2006 however it had declined 96 98 reduced to a small number of widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals this long term decline had a number of causes including egg collection and hunting such as for indigenous medicine rapid decline of about 58 between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and loss of riverine habitat gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites but as of 2013 numbers are rising due to protection of nests against egg predators chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout eastern yangtze river system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds in 1972 species was declared a class i endangered species by chinese government and received maximum amount of legal protection since 1979 captive breeding programs were established in china and north america creating a healthy captive population in 2008 alligators bred in bronx zoo were successfully reintroduced to chongming island philippine crocodile is perhaps most threatened crocodilian and is considered by iucn to be critically endangered hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009 in same year 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into wild to help boost population support from local people is crucial for species survival american alligator has also suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range threatening it with extinction in 1967 it was listed as an endangered species but united states fish and wildlife service and state wildlife agencies in southern united states stepped in and worked towards its recovery protection allowed species to recuperate and in 1987 it was removed from endangered species list much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at rockefeller wildlife refuge a large area of marshland in state of louisiana resulting data has increased understanding of penning stocking rates egg incubation hatching rearing and diet and this information has been used at other establishments around world income from alligators kept at rockefeller wildlife refuge contributes to conservation of marshland a study examining alligator farms in united states showed that they have

crocodile in mediaeval rochester bestiary late 13th century ancient historians have described crocodilians from earliest historical records though often their descriptions contain as much legend as fact ancient greek historian herodotus c 440 bc described crocodile in detail though much of his description is fanciful he claimed that it would lie with its mouth open to permit a trochilus bird possibly an egyptian plover to enter and remove any leeches it found crocodile was one of beasts described in late 13th century rochester bestiary based on classical sources including pliny s historia naturalis c 79 ad and isidore of seville s etymologies isidore asserts that crocodile is named for its saffron colour latin saffron and that it is often twenty cubits long he further claimed that crocodile may be killed by fish with serrated crests sawing into its soft underbelly and that male and female take turns guarding eggs crocodiles have been reputed to weep for their victims since 9th century bibliotheca by photios i of constantinople story was repeated in later accounts such as that of bartholomeus anglicus in 13th century it became widely known in 1400 when english traveller sir
