lawsuit left thumb larysa kondracki decided to make whistleblower after hearing bolkovac s account of sex trafficking in bosnia herzegovina director larysa kondracki and co screenwriter eilis kirwan learned of bolkovac s story while attending columbia university eight years before film s production kondracki subsequently devoted significant time to research human trafficking and sex trade after bolkovac sold her film rights for 100 she resolved to adapt story for screen financing for project was initially difficult to secure although situation improved after rachel weisz was cast as bolkovac i was young and naive kondracki said of her initial attempts to secure funding i thought of course they re going to make my film it s brilliant whistleblower was described as a fictionalized dramatic presentation of a late 1990s scandal producers based it on bolkovac s experiences rather than on her memoir vanessa redgrave played madeleine rees a un human rights official one of film s few heroic characters who helps bolkovac uncover sex trade raya roxana condurache and luba paula schramm two ukrainian young women who are trafficked into bosnia are primary representations of trafficking victims encountered by bolkovac neither is based on a particular person they are composites of young women forced to work in bosnian brothels kondracki s younger sister rayisa also played a trafficking victim for legal reasons pseudonym democra security was used for dyncorp international organization whose employees reportedly sexually enslaved women although producers kept film factual they debated how much to include details on bureaucracy were removed kondracki said it was too much information and frankly people were bored another concern was how much violence against sex trafficking victims should be depicted in film kondracki chose to bluntly portray inhumane treatment of young women which she described as accurate representations of what happened this included a graphic scene in which raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture weisz thought reality had been toned down in real life there were girls doing this as young as 8 years old kondracki agreed saying that she had lightened events depicted out of fear that viewers would tune it out thumb madeleine rees pictured and kathryn bolkovac testified that dyncorp democra security in film employees had participated in sex trafficking of women in bosnia alt middle aged woman with short very light hair speaking into a microphone kondracki said that her goal for whistleblower was information and exposure on human trafficking she said no one is putting pressure on governments to stop it and there is no accountability it s laziness filming whistleblower is a canadian german co production weisz received script from producer amy kaufman in 2007 since she was pregnant with her son at time she initially turned down offer she said story haunted her and she later contacted kaufman to ask if project was still available she signed on in august 2009 and shooting began in october 2009 bolkovac visited set in bucharest romania where most of movie was filmed weisz said that she made a point to spend every waking moment with her to accurately portray her weisz and bolkovac are dissimilar in appearance former is dark haired and slight and latter is blond and much more voluptuous and much taller as a result actress focused on emulating bolkovac s accent and determination bolkovac later said she commended choice to portray her and appreciated weisz s efforts to be accurate left thumb alt aerial photo of mountains valley and two lakes carpathian mountains in romania were used to depict much of bosnian landscape filming took around six weeks relatively short for a thriller weisz said most take about three months to complete producers used hand held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for genre kondracki said filming in eastern europe was crucial in a story such as this it s more about what you don t see so you need to create that world carpathian mountains in romania served as backdrop for war ravaged sarajevo of late 1990s scenes set in un buildings were filmed in toronto most outdoor scenes are set at night daytime shots often appear bleak gray and overcast this coupled with a grainy texture helped create a documentary feel weisz had to separate herself emotionally from atrocities depicted in film it s something you learn she said it s true between action and cut and after cut it s just not true anymore bolkovac echoed weisz s sentiments adding that distancing oneself emotionally is a necessity when working on a police force however producers wanted audience to be affected by scenes depicting brutal treatment of women forced into prostitution and character of raya was created to give a human face to victims much of rape scene was cut after its brutality caused a viewer to faint during film s first screening in toronto weisz responded themes right 150px thumb alt man in black shirt victor malarek s book natashas inspired kondracki to produce a film on sex trafficking whistleblower focuses on sexual slavery human trafficking and corruption kondracki wanted her first project to concern sex trafficking but was unsure how to create a moving original plot her mother was born in ukraine and she was aware of what she described as country s epidemic of trafficking victor malarek s book natashas inspired her to produce a film on subject she said of her initiative being a challenge no one wants to watch a film of an enslaved girl being raped for two hours bolkovac s experiences gave kondracki a framework for film and added themes of corruption and wide scale cover ups film critic rex reed said that abuse of power featured prominently in whistleblower a number of government officials participate in sex trade or turn a blind eye to it including peacekeepers un members and mercenaries wallace baine of santa cruz sentinel wrote that these aspects portrayal made movie slippery and true to life she said there are clear and vivid monsters in this film but there are also those existing in shades of gray middle nice enough guys tolerating crimes of unspeakable barbarity justice another prominent theme does not materialize by end sex trafficking victim raya is killed and none of peacekeepers who participated in trafficking are prosecuted although several are sent home according to baine viewers are left with impression that worst violence in bolkovac s story was violence done to justice bolkovac is portrayed as imperfect a noble but screwed up individual in film which roughly mirrors her real life her personal life is in disarray she has lost custody of her children to her ex husband and goes to bosnia to earn money to move closer to them while there she has an affair with a fellow peacekeeper kondracki wanted to promote idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers looked other way her flaws are offset by her determination to fight sex trade and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three dimensional character weisz compared bolkovac s story of one lone woman fighting injustice to that of david and goliath her favorite film genre in film as in real life bolkovac begins by investigating a case of a kidnapped girl as story unfolds she discovers a wide ranging web of corruption and faces growing obstacles sex trade is facilitated by a large influential organization when she tries to report her findings to un and local officials she receives threats and is shunned by coworkers and thwarted by higher ups weisz explained that she liked idea of an ordinary person doing something extraordinary she said i love that kind of thriller ordinary person who because of their character it s their character that leads them release thumb 200px alt smiling young woman with long dark hair rachel weisz at film s 2010 toronto film

positive review appeared in balkan chronicle allison willmore of a v club gave whistleblower a negative review criticizing producers for making its antagonists one dimensional there s no hint of erosion of morality that led to this point peter rainer of christian science monitor called film s pace frustratingly uneven but commended actors performances condurache makes raya s fears palpable stephen holden of new york times wrote that film tells a story so repellent that it is almost beyond belief its conclusion that in moral quagmire of war and its aftermath human trafficking and corruption are collateral damage is depressing he praised weisz s performance as strongest element of production actors performances received overall praise from reviewers courtney of christianity today was dismayed that main character engaged in a sexual relationship with a married man but weisz is wonderful as bolkovac a no nonsense civil servant who is stunned at what she walks into while vanessa redgrave is a needed touch of strength and warmth as her mentor madeleine and david strathairn is at his government thriller best as peter ward an internal affairs agent raya is heart breaking as young victim steve rea of post and courier praised redgrave s acting in supporting role of madeleine rees as forceful elegant precise mick lasalle of san francisco chronicle said weisz gives a psychologically astute performance as a woman who can t leave things alone rex reed of observer called her superb in lead role kondracki s graphic depiction of violence was controversial bob mondello of npr called it sobering but felt scenes detracted from film and should have been more subtle ryan rojas of tonight at movies described film as gritty and merciless and cautioned that certain scenes might offend some viewers while scenes do work as reinforcing horror of events it really just made it obvious that way that director was going to win over fans was to simply shock them into numbness as scenes showing rape mutilation and murder are shown in very disturbing fashion christian of crosswalk com wrote a review in balkan chronicle an internet based newspaper reporting from balkans disagreed with opinion that violence was unnecessarily explicit or sensationalized it would do no one any good grisly authenticity is one of film s greatest aspects later when bolkovac spoke at a screening of film in bosnia it was reported that her message was well received and discussion about events that occurred in late 1990s did not fail to engage and provoke home media 20th century fox
