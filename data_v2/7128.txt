creek whaler carcharhinus fitzroyensis is a common species of requiem shark and part of family carcharhinidae endemic to northern australia it frequents shallow waters close to shore including estuaries this small stocky shark usually grows to long and is brownish in color without conspicuous fin markings it can be identified by its long snout large triangular pectoral fins and large anteriorly positioned first dorsal fin diet of creek whaler consists mainly of small teleost fishes and crustaceans it is viviparous with unborn young being sustained through a placental connection defined mating season lasts from may to july females give birth to one to seven pups annually following a gestation period of seven to 9 months a small number of creek whalers are caught incidentally in inshore gillnets and used for food but effect of fishing on its population seems to be inconsequential as a result iucn has listed this species under least concern taxonomy and phylogeny creek whaler was described by australian ichthyologist gilbert percy whitley in a 1943 volume of proceedings of linnean society of new south wales he assigned new species to subgenus of genus galeolamna and gave it specific epithet fitzroyensis because type specimen a 1 2 m long female was collected from connor s creek in fitzroy river estuary subsequent authors have synonymized galeolamna with carcharhinus evolutionary relationships of creek whaler have yet to be fully resolved in comparative morphological studies published by jack garrick in 1982 and leonard compagno in 1988 it was tentatively placed in a grouping defined by whitecheek shark c dussumieri and blackspot shark c sealei shane lavery in a 1992 study based on allozymes reported that this species was close to nervous shark c cautus and blacktip reef shark c melanopterus ximena velez and ingi in a 2011 study based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes found it to be basal member of a clade also containing graceful shark c amblyrhynchoides blacktip shark c limbatus and australian blacktip shark c tilstoni description body of creek whaler is spindle shaped and rather stocky long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small nipple shaped flaps of skin eyes are circular and of medium size and are equipped with nictitating membranes arched mouth has very short furrows at corners there are 30 upper and 28 30 lower tooth rows upper teeth are long and triangular with strongly serrated edges and become increasing angled towards sides of jaw lower teeth are slender and upright with finely serrated edges five pairs of gill slits are short pectoral fins are distinctively large and triangular with rounded to pointed tips large first dorsal fin originates over rear of pectoral fin bases second dorsal fin is relatively tall and long and originates over or slightly behind anal fin origin there is no ridge between dorsal fins anal fin is larger than second dorsal fin there is a crescent shaped notch on caudal peduncle just before origin of upper caudal fin lobe asymmetrical caudal fin has a well developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near tip skin is densely covered by overlapping dermal denticles each bearing three to five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth this species is bronze to brownish gray above and pale below and lacks an obvious lighter band on flanks rarely individuals may be light bluish gray above it may reach in length though is typical distribution and habitat range of creek whaler is restricted to northern australia between gladstone in central queensland and cape cuvier in western australia it is a common species that inhabits estuaries and inshore waters from intertidal zone to a depth of at least biology and ecology thumb threadfin breams are among prey taken by creek whaler creek whaler feeds predominantly on small teleost fishes including threadfin breams and and crustaceans including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps cephalopods are also infrequently consumed known parasites of this species include tapeworm callitetrarhynchus gracilis and a nematode in genus like other members of its family creek whaler is viviparous with developing embryos receiving nourishment from mother through a placental connection formed from depleted yolk sac females produce litters of one to seven young every year mating occurs between may and july with females storing sperm until ovulation takes place between july and september after a gestation period of seven to 9 months birthing occurs between february and may of following year newborns measure long and spend their first few months of life in shallow inshore nursery areas such as cleveland bay in north queensland males and females attain sexual maturity at lengths of around and respectively human interactions creek whaler is a minor bycatch of inshore gillnet fisheries operating in northern australia meat is sold for human consumption given its relatively high reproductive rate its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing therefore iucn has listed this species under least concern references
