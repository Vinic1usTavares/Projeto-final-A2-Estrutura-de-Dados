in 1985 alex cox pitched idea of a film based on mars attacks trading card series as a joint production to orion and tristar pictures he wrote three drafts over next four years but was replaced by martin amis before orion and tristar placed mars attacks in turnaround jonathan gems who had previously written multiple unproduced screenplays for director tim burton came up with his own idea for a mars attacks film in 1993 writer pitched both concepts of mars attacks and dinosaurs attack to burton who both decided that dinosaurs attack would be too similar to jurassic park 1993 burton who was busy preparing ed wood 1994 believed that mars attacks would be a perfect opportunity to pay homage to films of edward d wood jr especially plan 9 from outer space 1959 and other 1950s science fiction b movies such as invaders from mars 1953 it came from outer space 1953 war of worlds 1953 target earth 1954 invasion of body snatchers 1956 and earth vs flying saucers 1956 burton set mars attacks up with warner bros and studio purchased film rights to trading card series on his behalf original theatrical release date was planned for summer of 1996 gems completed his original script in 1994 which was budgeted by warner bros at 260 million studio wanted to make film for no more than 60 million after turning in numerous drafts in an attempt to lower budget gems was replaced by ed wood writers scott alexander and larry karaszewski gems eventually returned to project writing a total of 12 drafts of script although he is credited with both screen story and screenplay of mars attacks gems dedicates his novelization of movie to burton who co wrote screenplay and didn t ask for a credit warner bros was dubious of martian dialogue and wanted burton to add closed captioning subtitles but he resisted working with burton gems pared film s 60 leading characters down to 23 and worldwide destruction planned for film was isolated to three major cities scenes featuring martians attacking china philippines japan europe africa india and russia were deleted from screenplay bear in mind this was way before independence day 1996 was written gems commented we had things like manhattan being destroyed building by building white house went and so did empire state building warner bros figured all this would be too expensive so we cut most of that out to reduce cost further discussing differences between mars attacks and independence day gems stated independence day is more like a movie called fail safe and mars attacks is like dr strangelove in that both films had a similar story but with different tones howard stern claimed that film s climax where an attack by martians was thwarted by playing slim whitman songs to them was originally created by him when he worked at wnbc in 1982 in a sketch named slim whitman vs midget aliens from mars as burton listened to sketch while being interviewed by stern he dismissed it as mere coincidence casting decision to hire an a list ensemble cast for mars attacks parallels strategy irwin allen used for his disaster films notably poseidon adventure 1972 and towering inferno 1974 jack nicholson approached for role of president jokingly remarked that he wanted to play all roles burton agreed to cast nicholson as both art land and president dale specifically remembering his positive working relationship with actor on batman susan sarandon was originally set to play barbara land before annette bening was cast bening modeled character after ann margret s performance in viva las vegas 1964 hugh grant was first choice for professor donald kessler a role which eventually went to pierce brosnan meryl streep diane keaton and stockard channing were considered for first lady marsha dale but glenn close won role in addition to nicholson other actors who reunited with burton on mars attacks include sylvia sidney from beetlejuice 1988 o lan jones from edward scissorhands 1990 and danny devito from batman returns 1992 continuing burton s trend of recasting actors several times from his previous works filming originally scheduled start date was mid august 1995 but filming was delayed until february 26 1996 director tim burton hired peter as cinematographer because he was a fan of his work in david cronenberg s films production designer thomas wynn a beautiful mind malcolm x intended to have war room pay tribute to dr strangelove 1964 during production burton insisted that art direction cinematography and costume design of mars attacks incorporate look of 1960s trading cards on designing martian played by burton s girlfriend lisa marie smith who seduces and kills jerry ross martin short costume designer colleen atwood took combined inspiration from playing cards marilyn monroe work of alberto vargas and jane fonda in barbarella 1968 filming for mars attacks ended on june 1 1996 film score was composed by burton s regular composer danny elfman to whom burton was reconciled after a quarrel that occurred during nightmare before christmas 1993 for which they did not co operate in producing ed wood 1994 elfman enlisted help of oingo boingo lead guitarist steve bartek to help arrange compositions for orchestra visual effects thumb 300px right martians were created using computer generated imagery from ilm tim burton initially intended to use stop motion animation to feature martians viewing it as a homage to work of ray harryhausen primarily jason and argonauts similar to his own beetlejuice burton wanted to make special effects look cheap and purposely fake looking as possible he first approached henry selick director of nightmare before christmas to supervise stop motion work but selick was busy directing james and giant peach also produced by burton despite fact that warner bros was skeptical of escalating budget and had not yet greenlit film for production burton hired barry purves to shepherd stop motion work purves created an international team of about 70 animators who worked on mars attacks for eight months and began compiling test footage in burbank california department workers studied gloria swanson s choreography and movement as norma desmond in sunset boulevard for inspiration on martians movement when budget was projected at 100 million warner bros wanted it for no more than 75 million producer larry j franco commissioned a test reel from industrial light magic ilm visual effects company he worked with on jumanji burton was persuaded to change his mind to employ computer animation which brought final production budget to 80 million although purves was uncredited for his work stop motion supervisors ian mackinnon and peter saunders who would later collaborate with burton on corpse bride received character design credit warner digital studios was responsible for scenes of global destruction airborne flying saucer sequences martian landing in nevada and robot that chases richie norris in his pickup truck warner digital also used practical effects such as building scale models of big ben and other landmarks destruction of art land s hotel was footage of real life nighttime demolition of landmark hotel and casino a building burton wished to title sequence movie s opening sequence which depicts saucers leaving mars and flying to earth measured some 5 000 frames long and was created almost entirely by computer graphics while first shot showing a lone reconnaissance ship leaving earth was handled by ilm tour de force sequence s remaining 12 shots were all done by warner digital on mars irises open over

and commercially in europe many observers found similarities with independence day which also came out in 1996 it was just a coincidence nobody told me about it i was surprised how close it was director tim burton continued but then it s a pretty basic genre i guess independence day was different in tone it was different in everything it almost seemed like we had done kind of a mad magazine version of independence day during film s theatrical run in january 1997 tbs purchased broadcasting rights of film critical reaction mars attacks drew mixed responses from critics based on 81 reviews collected by rotten tomatoes 53 of reviewers enjoyed film with an average score of 6 10 critical consensus reads tim burton s alien invasion spoof faithfully recreates wooden characters and story of cheesy 50s sci fi and ed wood movies perhaps a little too faithfully for audiences by comparison metacritic calculated an average score of 52 100 from 19 reviews roger ebert observed homages to 1950s science fiction b movies ed wood himself could have told us what s wrong with this movie makers felt superior to material to be funny even schlock has to believe in itself look for infra man 1975 or invasion of bee girls 1973 and you will find movies that lack stars and big budgets and fancy special effects but are funny and fun in a way that burton s never really understands kenneth turan of los angeles times wrote that mars attacks is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief mocking conventions that independence day takes seriously this all sounds clever enough but in truth mars attacks is not as much fun as it should be few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and burton s heart and soul is not in humor desson thomson from washington post said mars attacks evokes plenty of sci fi classics from day earth stood still 1951 to dr strangelove 1964 but it doesn t do much beyond that superficial exercise with exception of burton s jolting sight gags i may never recover from vision of sarah jessica parker s head grafted on to body of a chihuahua comedy is half developed pedestrian material and climactic battle between earthlings and martians is dull and overextended richard schickel writing in time magazine gave a positive review you have to admire everyone s chutzpah breadth of burton s and writer jonathan gems movie references which range from kurosawa to kubrick and above all their refusal to offer us a single likable character perhaps they don t create quite enough deeply funny earthlings to go around but a thoroughly mean spirited big budget movie is always a rarity jonathan rosenbaum from chicago reader praised surreal humor and black comedy which he found to be in vein of dr strangelove and gremlins 1984 he said it was far from clear whether movie was a satire although critics were describing it as one todd mccarthy of variety called mars attacks a cult sci fi comedy miscast as an elaborate all star studio extravaganza awards mars attacks was on shortlist for academy award for best visual effects nomination but academy of motion picture arts and sciences chose independence day dragonheart and twister instead film was nominated for seven categories at saturn awards danny elfman won best music while director tim burton writer jonathan gems actor lukas haas costume designer colleen atwood and visual effects department at industrial light magic received nominations mars attacks was nominated for both saturn award for best science fiction film which went to independence day and hugo award for best dramatic presentation see also
