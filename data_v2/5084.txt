bull of heaven is a mythical beast fought by hero gilgamesh story of bull of heaven has two different versions one recorded in an earlier sumerian poem and a later version in standard akkadian epic of gilgamesh in sumerian poem bull is sent to attack gilgamesh by goddess inanna for reasons that are unclear more complete akkadian account comes from tablet vi of epic of gilgamesh in which gilgamesh rejects sexual advances of goddess ishtar east semitic equivalent of inanna leading enraged ishtar to demand her father anu for bull of heaven so that she may send it to attack gilgamesh in uruk anu gives her bull and she sends it to attack gilgamesh and his companion hero enkidu who slay bull together after defeating bull enkidu hurls bull s right thigh at ishtar taunting her slaying of bull results in gods condemning enkidu to death an event which catalyzes gilgamesh s fear for his own death which drives remaining portion of epic bull was identified with constellation taurus and myth of its slaying may have held astronomical significance to ancient mesopotamians aspects of story have been compared to later tales from ancient near east including legends from ugarit tale of joseph in book of genesis and parts of ancient greek epics iliad and odyssey mythology gilgamesh and bull of heaven in sumerian poem gilgamesh and bull of heaven gilgamesh and enkidu slay bull of heaven who has been sent to attack them by goddess inanna sumerian equivalent of ishtar etcsl 1 8 1 2 plot of this poem differs substantially from corresponding scene in later akkadian epic of gilgamesh in sumerian poem inanna does not seem to ask gilgamesh to become her consort as she does in later akkadian epic furthermore while she is coercing her father an to give her bull of heaven rather than threatening to raise dead to eat living as she does in later epic she merely threatens to let out a cry that will reach earth epic of gilgamesh in tablet vi of standard akkadian epic of gilgamesh after gilgamesh rebuffs her sexual advances ishtar goes to heaven where she complains to her mother antu and her father anu she demands that anu give her bull of heaven and threatens that if he refuses she will smash gates of underworld and raise dead to eat living anu at first objects to ishtar s demand insisting that bull of heaven is so destructive that its release would result in seven years of famine ishtar declares that she has stored up enough grain for all people and all animals for next seven years eventually anu reluctantly agrees to give it to ishtar whereupon she unleashes it on world causing mass destruction bull s first breath blows a hole in ground that one hundred men fall into and its second breath creates another hole trapping two hundred more gilgamesh and enkidu work together to slay bull enkidu goes behind bull and pulls its tail while gilgamesh thrusts his sword into bull s neck killing it gilgamesh and enkidu offer bull s heart to sun god shamash while gilgamesh and enkidu are resting ishtar stands up on walls of uruk and curses gilgamesh enkidu tears off bull s right thigh and throws it in ishtar s face ishtar calls together crimped courtesans prostitutes and harlots and orders them to mourn for bull of heaven meanwhile gilgamesh holds a celebration over bull of heaven s defeat tablet vii begins with enkidu recounting a dream in which he saw anu ea and shamash declare that either gilgamesh or enkidu must die as punishment for having slain bull of heaven they choose enkidu who soon grows sick and dies after having a dream of underworld tablet viii describes gilgamesh s inconsolable grief over his friend s death and details of enkidu s funeral enkidu s death becomes catalyst for gilgamesh s fear of his own death which is focus of remaining portion of epic symbolism and representation thumb bull of heaven was identified with constellation taurus numerous depictions of slaying of bull of heaven occur in extant works of ancient mesopotamian art representations are especially common on cylinder seals of akkadian empire 2334 2154 bc these show that bull was clearly envisioned as a bull of abnormally large size and ferocity it is unclear exactly what bull of heaven represents however michael rice speculates that bull may represent an earthquake since bulls in general were widely associated with earthquakes in ancient cultures he also posits that bull may represent summertime which was a period of drought and infertility for people in ancient mesopotamia assyriologists jeremy black and anthony green observe that bull of heaven is identified with constellation taurus and argue that reason why enkidu hurls bull s thigh at ishtar in epic of gilgamesh after defeating it may be an effort to explain why constellation seems to be missing its hind quarters rice also argues for an astronomical interpretation of slaying of bull noting that constellation canis major was sometimes iconographically represented in ancient egyptian texts as a bull s thigh though he notes that there is no evidence of this identification in sumer he also observes that thigh was often used in ancient near eastern texts as a substitute for genitals gordon and rendsburg note that notion of flinging a bull s leg at someone as a terrible insult is attested across a wide geographic area of ancient near east and that it recurs in odyssey an ancient greek epic poem some scholars consider bull of heaven to be same figure as husband of mentioned by inanna in inanna s descent into underworld influence on later stories thumb ishtar s storing up of seven years worth of grain is paralleled by joseph in biblical book of genesis which was written after epic of gilgamesh cyrus h gordon and gary a rendsburg note that near eastern motif of seven years of famine following death of a hero is attested in myth of death of aqhat and that theme of someone predicting seven years of famine in advance and storing up supplies is also found in hebrew story of joseph from book of genesis according to german classical scholar walter burkert scene in which ishtar comes before anu to demand bull of heaven after being rejected by gilgamesh is directly paralleled by a scene from book v of iliad in epic of gilgamesh ishtar complains to her mother antu but is mildly rebuked by anu in scene from iliad aphrodite later greek development of ishtar is wounded by greek hero diomedes while trying to save her son aeneas she flees to mount olympus where she cries to her mother dione is mocked by her sister athena and is mildly rebuked by her father zeus not only is narrative parallel significant but so is fact that dione s name is a feminization of zeus s own just as antu is a feminine form of anu dione does not appear throughout rest of iliad in which zeus s consort is instead goddess hera burkert therefore concludes that dione is clearly a calque of antu british classical scholar graham anderson notes that in odyssey odysseus s men kill sacred cattle of helios and are condemned to death by gods for this reason much like enkidu in epic of gilgamesh m l west states that similarities run deeper than mere fact that in both cases creatures slain are bovines exempt from natural death in both cases person or persons condemned to die are companions of hero whose death or deaths force hero to continue his journey alone he also notes that in both cases epic describes a discussion among gods over whether or not guilty party must die and that helios s threat to zeus if he does not avenge slaughter of his cattle in odyssey is very similar to ishtar s threat to anu when she is demanding bull in epic of gilgamesh bruce louden compares enkidu s taunting of ishtar immediately after slaying bull of heaven to odysseus s taunt of giant polyphemus in book ix of odyssey in both cases hero s own hubris after an apparent victory leads a deity to curse him references bibliography category epic of gilgamesh category mesopotamian
