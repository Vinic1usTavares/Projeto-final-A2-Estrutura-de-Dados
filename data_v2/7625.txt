actress samantha smith reprised her role as mary winchester in a flashback with chad lindberg making an appearance as hunter ash actor gabriel tigerman of second season episode simon said guest starred as mind controlling andy gallagher and katharine isabelle of hunted returned as missing ava wilson other of azazel s psychic children introduced in episode were heart stopping lily portrayed by jessica harmon and super strong jake talley who is played in both episodes by aldis hodge actor jim beaver also guest starred in both parts as recurring character bobby singer as did fredric lehne as yellow eyed demon azazel lehne first portrayed character in second season premiere in my time of dying and was originally meant to play part only temporarily because demon changes human hosts periodically however show runners liked him so much they kept him in role executive producer and director kim manners was happy with this decision believing lehne brought to character a real jack nicholson flavor second episode brought back actress samantha ferris as hunter ellen harvelle as well as jeffrey dean morgan as john winchester whose previous appearance was in season premiere morgan s busy schedule required his scenes for episode to be filmed weeks in advance writing thumb alt a man sitting in front of a microphone his hands are folded and he is speaking supernatural creator eric kripke wrote second episode multiple storylines spanning first two seasons were brought to a close in two part season finale including search for demon azazel and existence of azazel s psychic children as many of show s questions are answered in one long conversation by azazel series creator eric kripke and writer sera gamble had to rewrite demon s speech multiple times because they felt that payoff was never as good as anticipation though it would have been easier for them to keep postponing revelations writers believed they would get crushed under anticipation because they would not be able to satisfy fans if they kept building up more expectations knight nicholas season 2 companion p 115 as for psychic children writers originally intended to continue their storyline into third season but ultimately killed them off after deciding characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters in first version of script character of lily was two roles a girl named alex who could kill with a single touch and a telepath named lily believing they had too many characters writers combined alex and lily into one gamble had envisioned episode as a psychic breakfast club so new lily s motivation was that she was ally sheedy acheri demon responsible for two of psychic children s deaths was based on acheri from hindu mythology writer sera gamble felt that it being a diseased spirit that comes down from mountains and kills everybody in settlements fit in with abandoned mountain side town where episode takes place knight nicholas season 2 companion p 117 harvelle s roadhouse a saloon frequented by demon hunters was dropped from show in these episodes as well as kripke disliked concept of having a fixed home for a road based series with roadhouse s destruction came death of recurring character ash whom writers had been phasing out during season because they felt his comical and wacky personality was too unrealistic for show knight nicholas season 2 companion p 16 with john winchester making a demonic pact in second season premiere it was decided early on to end season with another demonic pact this required writers to kill sam they felt it was only thing that could motivate dean to sell his soul with pact becoming one of driving forces behind third season knight nicholas season 2 companion p nicholas season 2 companion p 123 at same time it opened up another new storyline by questioning if what returned was one hundred percent pure sam knight nicholas season 2 companion pp 119 120 additionally war of demons against humanity hinted at throughout first two seasons finally started with release of demons through devil s gate at end of second episode this plotline continues throughout rest of series with winchesters attempting to hunt down demons in third season while final version of part two is quite enclosed initial script was considered epic with production designer jerry wanek jokingly referring to it as a six hour mini series in original version giant devil s trap keeping demons away from gateway to hell was much more complex with each point in pentagram being a church housing a holy relic such as a sliver from true cross knight nicholas season 2 companion p 120 with artifacts powering devil s trap jake s role would have been to go to each church and destroy them hunters following after him to try to stop him jake would then eventually destroy final relic during a fight with sam and dean would race to gateway to prevent azazel from opening it while jake and sam are beating crap out of each other knight nicholas season 2 companion pp 120 121 however when director and executive producer kim manners received script he realized it was huge and had storyboard artist make five and a half hours of storyboards for episode to prove it could not be filmed without going hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget knight nicholas season 2 companion p 121 production suggested that a large amount of money could be saved by not depicting churches which were major set pieces for intended story kripke realized that instead of using churches he could have points of pentagram be connected by railroad tracks with tracks being made of iron it fit perfectly with series mythology because iron is a demon deterrent kripke found this aspect to be more western matching tone of show rather than destroying devil s trap as in original script jake is instead sent by azazel to open gateway himself and major fight scene between jake and sam was then changed into a standoff between jake and hunters though storyline had to be toned down kripke felt this improved overall episode by making it simpler filming thumb alt a studio sound stage with a pile of mulch in foreground and cherry pickers and a constructed mausoleum in background second episode s cemetery scene had to be filmed on a sound stage because of weather problems filming for first episode lasted for a period of nine days diner at beginning of episode was built by wanek though a pre existing set a deserted town built for western television series bordertown that is filmed in vancouver area was used for seven days of filming originally episode was meant to mainly take place in an abandoned orphanage with many hallways knight nicholas season 2 companion p 116 however producer cyrus had sent kripke photos of bordertown set during production of supernatural s first season and creepy and evocative aspects of town prompted writers to change setting with new location references to ghost town of connecticut were going to be included in script but were eventually edited out unfortunately for production bordertown set was surrounded by mountains on one side and farmland on other making it difficult for production team to access it also rained all seven days causing problems during filming however director robert singer felt gray skies and mist ended up helping episode s appearance knight nicholas season 2 companion pp 117 118 second episode s climax was originally to take place in an actual cemetery but problems at potential filming locations prohibited this scene takes place at night which at that time of year lasts only nine and a half hours in vancouver with only four nights to film sequence production came up with idea of having a supernatural solar eclipse so scenes could be shot day for night however first location did not have trees which were needed for technique to work eventually team found a cemetery that did have trees but a rainstorm during inspection forced them to realize weather would interfere with filming it was decided at last minute to film on a sound stage and a set was constructed however bark mulch used for cemetery contained manure which made it very rancid according to actress samantha ferris it stunk so bad your eyes watered effects thumb alt three men in front of a blue screen morgan s return had to be filmed in advance using blue screen due to his busy schedule jared padalecki covered in blood in above picture had to reshoot his part when script changes had his character uninjured as with all other episodes visual effects were done in studio production wanted to keep number of shots to a minimum for opening of devil s gate at second episode s climax so instead of just digitally creating demon smoke shots visual effects supervisor ivan hayden filmed stand ins dressed as characters from past episodes woman in white hook man and reaper on a blue screen and inserted them into scene in post production during brief flashes of lightning this filming technique also had to be used for return of john winchester actor jeffrey dean morgan was busy filming movie accidental husband during episode s scheduled shooting so he jensen ackles and jared padalecki filmed scene six weeks earlier in front of a blue screen reunion was intended to be more complex with a lot of fighting but movie s production crew believed morgan would be at risk of getting injured and forbade it kripke trimmed scene removing morgan s dialogue and having him only thrown to ground script was not yet complete during scene s filming so padalecki s appearance was based on original storyline in which sam has a brutal fight with jake and ends up covered in blood when fight scene was removed padalecki had to re film his part of family reunion using tennis balls and a stand in as replacements for ackles and morgan who were not available knight nicholas season 2 companion p 122 music as is typical for series synthesized orchestral score of episodes was written alternately by jay gruska and christopher lennertz with former working on part one and latter scoring part two because he had worked on pilot episode of series where he introduced a recurring musical theme for scenes related to villain nicholas season 1 companion p nicholas season 1 companion p 78 lennertz was happy to be one to score episode featuring demon s death allowing him to close that chapter with opening of gateway to hell at episode s end lennertz felt that music became much larger in scope than previous episodes deeming it an issue of making things larger than life knight nicholas season 2 companion pp 122 123 as with most episodes of series classic rock music is also included reception in its original broadcast part one was viewed by an estimated 2 9 million viewers with part two bringing in approximately 2 72 million viewers compared to rest of second season part two became lowest rated episode behind born under a bad sign which received only 2 84 million viewers despite this episodes garnered positive reviews from critics tina charles of tv guide found so much goodness in first episode and called dean s speech to sam rip your heart out sad she deemed second episode just plain wow praising both brotherly relationship depicted and scenes between jensen ackles and jim beaver but was disappointed that brothers did not converse with spirit of john winchester after he escapes from hell of particular interest to critics was wrapping up azazel story arc described by charles as a great way to cap off season kathie huddleston of sci fi com noted that terrific finale closed sam and dean s dad issues and their yellow eyed demon issues while opening up new problems for them to face while tv squad said it had a weight and importance that a good finale should have tv squad also said that in part two show handled sam s coming back well though it was apparent he would from part one actors performances were also applauded with ona grauer being deemed delightful as crossroads demon coming across as something of a supernatural used car salesman frederic lehne received praise for his portrayal of demon azazel described as riveting great and appropriately creepy however tom burns of underground online had previously criticized supernatural for ruining a surprise ending by giving it away in show s recap for part one he noted that its ending was given away in cw s preview for episode which showed sam stabbed in back and collapsing into dean s arms burns liked episode but did find some fault with it he felt that part one focusing on sam and part two on dean was a mistake since supernaturals strongest asset has always been chemistry between leads in addition burns felt season had set up question of whether sam was going to go evil and finale did not follow through which burns described as a tease jessica harmon gained a leo award nomination for best guest performance by a female in a dramatic series for her role as lily in part one referencesgeneralspecific
