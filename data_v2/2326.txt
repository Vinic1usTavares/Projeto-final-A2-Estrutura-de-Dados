urundi a village located in what is now southern province of rwanda his father deogratias was a member of tutsi ethnic group from which royal family had been derived since eighteenth century or earlier deogratias had family ties to king mutara iii but he pursued an independent business career rather than maintain a close connection to royal court kagame s mother descended from family of last rwandan queen rosalie at time of kagame s birth rwanda was a united nations trust territory long time colonial power belgium still ruled territory but with a mandate to oversee independence rwandans

border into uganda they moved gradually north and settled in refugee camp in toro sub region in 1962 it was around this time that as young boys kagame and his future comrade fred rwigyema first met one another kagame began his primary education in a school near refugee camp where he and other rwandan refugees learned english and began to integrate into ugandan culture at age of nine he moved to respected primary school around 16 kilometres 10 mi away graduating with best grades in district he subsequently attended ntare school one of best schools in uganda it is also alma mater of future ugandan president yoweri museveni death of kagame s father in early 1970s and departure of rwigyema to an unknown location led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled rwandan population he was eventually suspended from ntare and completed his studies without distinction at old kampala secondary school after finishing his schooling kagame made two visits to rwanda in 1977 and 1978 he was initially hosted by family members of his former classmates but upon arrival in kigali he made contact with members of his own family he kept a low profile on these visits believing that his status as a well connected tutsi exile could lead to arrest on his second visit he entered country through zaire rather than uganda to avoid suspicion kagame used his time in rwanda to explore country familiarise himself with political and social situation and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities military career 1979 1994

rwigyema began building a covert network of rwandan tutsi refugees within army s ranks intended as nucleus for an attack on rwanda in 1989 rwanda s president habyarimana and many ugandans in army began to criticise museveni over his appointment of rwandan refugees to senior positions and he demoted kagame and rwigyema kagame and rwigyema remained de facto senior officers but change caused them to accelerate their plans to invade rwanda they joined an organisation called rwandan patriotic front rpf a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979 rwigyema became

airport killing both habyarimana and president of burundi cyprien ntaryamira as well as their entourage and three french crew members attackers remain unknown historian gerard prunier in a book written shortly after incident concluded that it was most likely a coup d etat carried out by extreme hutu members of habyarimana s government and was a planned part of genocide this theory was disputed in 2006 by french judge jean louis bruguiere and in 2008 by spanish judge fernando andreu both alleged that kagame and rpf were responsible following habyarimana s death a military committee led by colonel theoneste bagosora took immediate control of country under committee s direction hutu militia interahamwe and presidential guard began to kill hutu and tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent tutsi figures within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders including prime minister agathe uwilingiyimana killers then began targeting entire tutsi population as well as

hutu were killed in well planned attacks on 7 april kagame warned committee and unamir that he would resume civil war if killing did not stop next day rwandan government forces attacked national parliament building from several directions but rpf troops stationed there successfully fought back kagame began an attack from north on three fronts seeking to link up quickly with troops isolated in kigali an interim government was set up but kagame refused to talk to it believing that it was just a cover for bagosora s rule over next few days rpf advanced steadily south capturing gabiro and large areas of countryside to north and east of kigali they avoided attacking kigali or byumba at this stage but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle cities and cut off supply routes rpf allowed tutsi refugees from uganda to settle behind front line in rpf controlled areas throughout april there were numerous attempts by unamir to establish a ceasefire but kagame insisted each time that rpf would not stop fighting unless killings stopped in late april rpf secured whole of tanzanian border area and began to move west from kibungo to south of kigali they encountered little resistance except around kigali and ruhengeri by 16 may they had cut road between kigali and gitarama temporary home of interim government and by 13 june they had taken gitarama following an unsuccessful attempt by rwandan government forces to reopen road interim government was forced to relocate to gisenyi in far north west as well as fighting war kagame was recruiting heavily to expand army new recruits included tutsi survivors of genocide and refugees from burundi but were less well trained and disciplined than earlier recruits having completed encirclement of kigali kagame spent latter half of june fighting to take city government forces had superior manpower and weapons but rpf steadily gained territory as well as conducting raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines according to romeo dallaire force commander of unamir this success was due to kagame being a master of psychological warfare he exploited fact that government forces were concentrating on genocide rather than fight for kigali and capitalised on government s loss of morale as it lost territory rpf finally defeated rwandan government forces in kigali on 4 july and on 18 july took gisenyi and rest of north west forcing interim government into zaire and ending genocide at end of july 1994 kagame s forces held whole of rwanda except for a zone in south west which had been occupied by a french led united nations force

government took office in kigali in july 1994 it was based loosely on arusha accords but habyarimana s party mrnd was outlawed positions it had been assigned were taken over by rpf military wing of rpf was renamed as rwandan patriotic army rpa and became national army paul kagame assumed dual roles of vice president of rwanda and minister of defence while pasteur bizimungu a hutu who had been a civil servant under habyarimana before fleeing to join rpf was appointed president bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs but kagame remained commander in chief of army and was de facto ruler of country domestic situation thumb left vice president kagame with united states secretary of defense william perry in july 1994 alt overhead view of kagame and perry seated on

former regime had carried with them all currency and moveable assets when they fled country human resources were also severely depleted with over of population having been killed or fled many of remainder were traumatised most had lost relatives witnessed killings or participated in genocide army controlled by kagame maintained law and order while government began work of rebuilding country s structures non governmental organisations began to move back into country but international community did not provide significant assistance to new regime and most international aid was routed to refugee camps which had formed in zaire following exodus of hutu from rwanda kagame strove to portray government as inclusive and not tutsi dominated he directed removal of ethnicity from citizens national identity cards and government began a policy of downplaying distinctions between hutu tutsi and twa during genocide and in months following rpf victory rpf soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting genocide many of these soldiers were recent tutsi recruits from within rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge scale scope and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed human rights watch as well as scholars such as prunier allege that death toll might be as high as 100 000 and that kagame and rpf elite either tolerated or organised killings in an interview with journalist stephen kinzer kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control rpf killings gained international attention with 1995 kibeho massacre in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in butare province australian soldiers serving as part of unamir estimated at least 4 000 people were killed while rwandan government claimed that death toll was 338 shortly after taking power rwandan government began prosecuting crimes committed during genocide international criminal tribunal for rwanda operating under a united nations mandate was set up in arusha to judge most senior leaders responsible for genocide in addition rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators including many ordinary citizens who had taken part in killings in order to end culture of impunity that it blamed for genocide between 1994 and 2000 120 000 suspects were arrested prisons were overcrowded and courts could not process all cases by 2006 only 10 000 of those arrested had been tried government introduced gacaca a village court system based on traditional rwandan justice gacaca process allowed for faster processing of cases but lacked many safeguards and principles of international criminal law unity government suffered a partial collapse in 1995 continuing violence along with appointing of local government officials who were almost exclusively rpf tutsi caused serious disagreement between kagame and senior hutu government members including prime minister faustin twagiramungu and interior minister seth sendashonga twagiramungu resigned in august and kagame fired sendashonga and three others next day pasteur bizimungu remained president but makeup of new government was predominantly rpf tutsi loyal to kagame twagiramungu and sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving government refugee crisis and insurgency thumb refugee camp in zaire 1994 alt view of refugee camp on foggy day showing tents of various colours and refugees following rpf victory approximately two million hutu fled to refugee camps in neighboring countries particularly zaire fearing rpf reprisals for rwandan genocide camps were set up by united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr but were effectively controlled by army and government of former hutu regime including many leaders of genocide this regime was determined to return to power in rwanda and began rearming killing tutsi residing in zaire and launching cross border incursions in conjunction with interahamwe paramilitary group by late 1996 hutu militants represented a serious threat to new rwandan regime and kagame launched a counteroffensive kagame first provided troops and military training to aid a rebellion against zaire by banyamulenge a tutsi group living near bukavu in zairian south kivu province with rwandan army support banyamulenge defeated local security forces and began attacking hutu refugee camps in area at same time kagame s forces joined with zairian tutsi around goma to attack two of camps there most refugees from attacked camps moved to large mugunga camp in november 1996 rwandan army attacked mugunga causing an estimated 800 000 refugees to flee many returned to rwanda despite presence of rpf others ventured further west into zaire despite disbanding of camps defeated forces of former regime continued a cross border insurgency campaign into rwanda from north kivu insurgents maintained a presence in rwanda s north western provinces and were supported by predominantly hutu population many of whom had lived in refugee camps before they were attacked in addition to supporting wars in congo kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring hutu to his side he integrated former soldiers of deposed genocidal regime s military into rpf dominated national army and appointed senior hutu to key local government positions in areas hit by insurgency these tactics were eventually successful by 1999 population in north west had stopped supporting insurgency and insurgents were mostly defeated congo wars although his primary reason for military action in zaire was dismantling of refugee camps kagame also began planning a war to remove long time dictator president mobutu sese seko from power mobutu had supported genocidaires based in camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on tutsi people within zaire together with ugandan president yoweri museveni kagame supported newly created alliance of democratic forces for liberation of congo adfl an alliance of four rebel groups headed by laurent desire kabila which began waging first congo war adfl helped by rwandan and ugandan troops took control of north and south kivu provinces in november 1996 and then advanced west gaining territory from poorly organised and demotivated zairian army with little fighting by may 1997 they controlled almost whole of zaire except for capital kinshasa mobutu fled and adfl took capital without fighting country was renamed as democratic republic of congo drc and kabila became new president rwandan defence forces and adfl were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during first congo war with as many as 222 000 rwandan hutu refugees declared missing cdi center for defense information defense monitor world at war 1 january 1998 kagame and rwandan government retained strong influence over kabila following his inauguration and rpa maintained a heavy presence in kinshasa congolese in capital resented this as did many in eastern kivu provinces where ethnic clashes increased sharply in july 1998 kabila fired his rwandan chief of staff james kabarebe and ordered all rpa troops to leave country kagame accused kabila of supporting ongoing insurgency against rwanda from north kivu same accusation he had made about mobutu he responded to expulsion of his soldiers by backing a new rebel group rally for congolese democracy rcd and launching second congo war first action of war was a blitzkrieg by rcd and rpa led by kabarebe these forces made quick gains advancing in twelve days from kivu provinces west to within of kinshasa capital was saved by intervention of angola namibia and zimbabwe on kabila s side following failure of blitzkrieg conflict developed into a long term conventional war which lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage according to a report by international rescue committee irc this conflict led to loss of between 3 million and 7 6 million lives many through starvation and disease accompanying social disruption of war although kagame s primary reason for two wars in congo was rwanda s security he was alleged to gain economic benefit by exploiting mineral wealth of eastern congo 2001 united nations report of panel of experts on illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of democratic republic of congo alleged that kagame along with ugandan president museveni were on verge of becoming godfathers of illegal exploitation of natural resources and continuation of conflict in democratic republic of congo report also claimed that rwandan ministry of defence contained a congo desk dedicated to collecting taxes from companies licensed to mine minerals around kisangani and that substantial quantities of coltan and diamonds passed through kigali before being resold on international market by staff on congo desk international ngo global witness also conducted field studies in early 2013 it concluded that minerals from north and south kivu are exported illegally to rwanda and then marketed as rwandan kagame dismissed these allegations as unsubstantiated and politically motivated in a 2002 interview with newsletter africa confidential kagame said that if solid evidence against rwandan officers was presented it would be dealt with very seriously in 2010 united nations released a report accusing rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in democratic republic of congo during first and second congo wars charges denied by rwandan government presidency accession in late 1990s kagame began to disagree publicly with bizimungu and hutu led government in rwanda kagame accused bizimungu of corruption and poor management while bizimungu felt that he had no power over appointments to cabinet and that national assembly was acting purely as a puppet for kagame bizimungu resigned from presidency in march 2000 historians do not agree on precise circumstances of bizimungu s departure american author stephen kinzer contends that one of president s friends called kagame with startling news that president was preparing to resign while prunier states that bizimungu was forced to resign having denounced national assembly and attempted to sow discord within rpf following bizimungu s resignation supreme court ruled that kagame should become acting president until a permanent successor was chosen kagame had been de facto leader since 1994 but had focused more on military foreign affairs and country s security than day to day governance by 2000 threat posed by cross border rebels was much reduced and when bizimungu resigned kagame decided to seek presidency himself transitional constitution was still in effect which meant president was elected by government ministers and national assembly rather than by a direct election rpf selected two candidates kagame and rpf secretary general charles ministers and parliament elected kagame by eighty one votes to three kagame was sworn in as president in april 2000 several hutu politicians including prime minister pierre celestin left government at around same time as bizimungu leaving a cabinet dominated by those close to kagame bizimungu started his own party following his resignation but this was quickly banned for destabilising country he was subsequently arrested and convicted of corruption and inciting ethnic violence he was imprisoned until 2007 when he was pardoned by kagame new constitution between 1994 and 2003 rwanda was governed by a set of documents combining president habyarimana s 1991 constitution arusha accords and some additional protocols introduced by transitional government as required by accords kagame set up a constitutional commission to draft a new permanent constitution constitution was required to adhere to a set of fundamental principles including equitable power sharing and democracy commission sought to ensure that draft constitution was home grown relevant to rwanda s specific needs and reflected views of entire population they sent questionnaires to civil groups across country and rejected offers of help from international community except for financial assistance draft constitution was released in 2003 it was approved by
