sordid chapter in tort litigation over vioxx closed as judge eldon fallon divvied up 315 million to be paid to plaintiffs attorneys who worked on litigation this sum was in addition to more than 1 2 billion already paid to such attorneys when you add in what merck paid to plaintiffs and for its own attorneys vioxx litigation cost it more than 7 billion yet merck almost certainly did not do anything wrong even as an unsympathetic corporate defendant it won vast majority of cases that went to trial and another dozen or more that plaintiffs attorneys dismissed on eve of trial rather than risk publicity of a certain loss even in handful of cases that merck lost at trial such as 253 million verdict in ernst case that generated much of publicity that led to tens of thousands of cases being filed merck won reversals of most of those on appeal because verdicts were based on conclusory junk science expert testimony that should not have been admitted into evidence lanier defended

grand theft auto san andreas video game with a hidden sexually explicit easter egg would have received less than 30 000 while plaintiffs attorneys would receive 1 million in legal fees court rejected settlement on other grounds but case spurred frank to devote himself to objecting to class action settlements and he left aei ccaf has objected to settlements throughout united states in cases where class action lawyers receive cash payments but plaintiff class receives only discount coupons for further products and services from defendant company ccaf argues in those cases that few of coupons

years he also questioned frank s motivation frank says his motivation is to improve system although he admits to having advocated for these changes for a long time but reports that substantially fewer merger lawsuits are being filed today and attributes that to frank and those he s encouraged ccaf does not accept payments to drop objections to settlements although sometimes their clients will ccaf

named plaintiffs would receive 5 000 apiece while an additional 6 million would be given to several privacy groups as cy pres in lieu of compensation to then remaining unnamed class action members due

flag and doesn t pass smell test although it was nonetheless approved ninth circuit court of appeals upheld use of cy pres noting that otherwise estimated 129 million web users that could theoretically receive damages from suit would receive a paltry 4 cents in recovery frank had argued that similar settlements such as fraley v facebook had successfully distributed small sums to large
