postponed project team was still feeling pressure to create a game and also wanted to change direction of aleste series designer kazuyuki nakashima came up with a design that ignored most of style of previous aleste games and instead went with a japanese aesthetic including a character with a noh mask this change in direction motivated team to pick up remnants of aleste 2 and push it into a new direction valley stage in musha utilizes genesis vertical parallax scrolling capabilities which was later highlighted by critics as one of game s most impressive technical features stage was programmed by sotoyama who also programmed enemies that move in and out of depths of valley and tiles that fall into screen in other stages sotoyama worked with sound effects programmer masanobu tsukamoto to modulate frequency of sound effects when objects moved in and out of screen to simulate doppler effect music for musha s soundtrack nakashima originally presented an idea for what he called edo metal music to composer toshiaki sakoda they eventually agreed on creating a speed metal soundtrack which would match fast scrolling action of game at time musha was developed sakoda felt most shooting game soundtracks were primarily fusion and mechanically sounding games that lacked a cohesive theme he wanted this soundtrack to be first heavy metal game soundtrack or how he called it a heady metal suite or heavy metal rhapsody to compose music sakoda used real instruments then notated music on an msx computer and converted it onto a pc 9800 since he did not like mechanical sounds he programmed virtual instruments to sound like they were played by humans sakoda worked closely with sound effects programmer masanobu tsukamoto since game had limited sound channels or tracks he exercised caution not to create too many simultaneous sounds so sound effects would not cut out music sakoda only had four channels to use in any given song one of which was always fixed on drums after soundtrack was nearly finished compile leadership told sakoda to change music to something which fit japanese aesthetic after hearing a new soundtrack with plucky japanese instruments leadership told sakoda to revert to his original music release musha was first released in japan on december 21 1990 it was released in north america following year reception musha received mixed reviews at release critics found themselves overwhelmed by number of shoot em ups on sega genesis and considered musha to be another standard shooter offering many wrote about graphics in positive light richard leadbetter from computer and video games found visuals to be smooth and highlighted parallax scrolling effect in canyon level frank martinez jr from gamefan also praised parallax scrolling in addition to enemy and character sprite detail writers at raze positively noted game s oriental design and explosion effects game s difficulty was a common point of criticism many noted musha to be too easy and too short some wrote that it may be fun for shooter novices but more experienced players would find it unchallenging music also received mixed comments leadbetter concluded that musha is a smooth playable blast but it s a shame it s so unoriginal and unchallenging retrospective reviews for re release of musha on wii s virtual console in 2009 were much more positive both lucas m thomas of ign and damien mcfarren of nintendo life praised title s detailed graphics fast paced soundtrack and tough difficulty since original cartridges have become rare and expensive both reviewers also commended
