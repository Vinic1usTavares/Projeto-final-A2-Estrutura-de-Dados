syd howe to detroit red wings officially trade broke down as such detroit received howe and ralph bowman in exchange for teddy graham and 50 000 at time it was considered a large sum of money likewise frank finnigan was sold to maple leafs eagles were unable to maintain early success under boucher and finished last in canadian division with a record of 11 31 6 with only 84 goals scored they were lowest scoring team in league only montreal canadiens allowed more goals during season surrendering 145 to eagles 144 end of eagles thumb 180px st louis eagles nhl jersey on display in hockey hall of

trips to montreal and toronto an attempt to stabilize franchise by selling off some of its players netted 58 000 owners had hoped to move again to save franchise there was interest from cleveland and also in a return to ottawa but neither came to fruition as a result ownership again petitioned nhl to allow them to suspend operations for a year this time nhl refused and eagles were put up for sale after no credible offers surfaced nhl bought franchise and player contracts for 40 000 and opted to play as an eight team league if nhl ever resold franchise proceeds were to go to ottawa hockey
