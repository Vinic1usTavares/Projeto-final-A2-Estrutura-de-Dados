was given mixed to positive reviews by critics jenna mullins of e online called it a perfect season starter of an episode atlantic kevin fallon appreciated that it tackled some of show s biggest problems such as surfeit of central characters and their previously un addressed ages he was particularly pleased that episode focussed on typical high school life rather than adult characters or more serious issues bobby hankinson of houston chronicle approved of clear trajectory set out for characters and noted that he looked forward to seeing their various storylines develop though aoltv crystal bell worried that teenagers ages could result in younger characters being overlooked in future episodes she was glad that premiere saw show return to its roots underdogs show tunes and sue sylvester a similar sentiment was expressed by amy reiter of los angeles times who was hopeful that renewed focus on core characters would lead to a great year huffington post amy lee observed that glee has a tendency to oscillate between sappy and nasty sometimes without any warning and then noted that purple piano project was more tonally balanced than majority of second season anthony benigno of faster times deemed episode admirably straightforward by sentimentality and inconsistencies which plagued previous episodes his praise was tempered however and he wrote i wouldn t go so far as to call episode good it was oddly lifeless and stakes seemed almost non existent at times it has feel of a show rediscovering itself but all things considered ryan murphy and co handled task relatively well james poniewozik of time took a more negative stance he wrote that purple piano project was not a particularly good episode of glee one which was hindered by vast number of central characters but it did at least suggest where third season of show could find its strong core stories and also numerous ways in which it could get sidetracked into tangential ridiculousness a v club emily vanderwerff graded episode d she summarised it as a handful of okay performances one or two pretty good lines and then a whole bunch of awful rolling stone erica futterman praised episode s humor and plot development but commented that it didn t hit any of emotional notes glee is capable of robert canning of ign rated it an okay 6 5 out of 10 he too found there were still quite a few laughs to be had but felt episode suffered from its repetitiveness as sue s hatred of glee club and new directions recruitment problems have been thoroughly explored before dallas morning news samantha urban noted that murphy failed to deliver on his promise to increase mercedes and tina s roles and couldn t accept that sue would be allowed to promote her congressional campaign on her local news commentary spot but overall was pretty impressed with what she called a solid episode of glee that made her feel cautiously optimistic about season ahead lisa respers france of cnn summed up episode in a single word meh plot which involved rachel and kurt attracted uniformly favorable reviews fallon called it one of episode s strongest subplots and salon com matt zoller seitz deemed it episode s most successful and affecting bell named rachel and kurt as her favorite glee pairing and futterman wrote that their friendship has grown from something catty into something genuine and relatable and their interactions are likely most authentic for any aspiring musical theater performers among glee viewers within his generally negative review of episode vanderwerff noted that nyada mixer scene features some of best work chris colfer and lea michele have contributed to show in contrast adult storylines were generally poorly received zoller seitz branded will and emma s relationship boring and abby west of entertainment weekly disliked fact season began with them in an established relationship i feel like i missed a huge leap for emma and we need to have it acknowledged fallon disparaged will as being insufferable and attributed this to morrison s wooden characterization stilted writing and flat purpose that character serves on show sue s storyline was described as nonsensical by vanderwerff who wrote that she has decided to take her crusade against glee club to a congressional district wide audience because well she was most popular character in season one and she will be again via blunt force if necessary reiter however found sue to be in perfect form in this episode neither too mean nor too misty and enjoyed her storyline introduction of harmony and sugar garnered critical praise vanderwerff wrote that former may be best new character ever tvline michael slezak said she was brillantly brought to life by pearce and fallon felt that her arrival boded well for introductions of other finalists from glee project he said that she brought which best new characters do fresh and exciting aspects in show s established leads zoller seitz described sugar as an entitled little but a great character nonetheless and one he hoped to see more of west praised lengies performance and opined that with sue otherwise occupied it ll be great to have another person as a thorn in glee club s side not everyone was thrilled with sugar s advent however vanderwerff called character awful music and performances episode s musical numbers were generally well received hankinson appreciated that they felt to proper scale with a realism which previous season s over top performances lacked though benigno criticized song selection for being too focused on broadway tracks which he felt limited its appeal for younger viewers urban called choices outstanding and vanderwerff commented that wide range represented progress from season two he noted that there were no performances he disliked but found some shockingly poorly motivated for dramatic purposes canning enjoyed songs both vocally and visually everything was upbeat familiar and fun dancing was entertaining and most of performances were group numbers which added plenty of visual flair we got beat garnered praise for brittany and mike s dancing from lee though she described vocals as autotuned a comment echoed by futterman who was nevertheless glad that brittany and rachel match ed rawness of santana s voice slezak and benigno were pleased that morris and rivera received lead vocals but while former commended number as a great musical start to season and awarded it an a grade latter found it hard to differentiate between glee cover and original observed that it failed to advance plot and graded it c respers france was entirely unimpressed with routine for her sugar s scene following it was one of episode s few highlights although she described sugar as having a horrible voice rachel and kurt s duet of ding dong witch is dead made billboard rae votta long for them to share more material it encapsulated everything futterman wanted in a duet between two she observed it s effortless charming full of power musical theater vocals and rachel gets to channel barbra streisand lee however felt number was an odd choice to demonstrate their talent and although slezak graded it a b he contrasted it negatively with their previous duets west opined that song was too insubstantial and gave it a b its highest grade an a came from benigno he noted its lack of significance to plot and wished that vocal split had not been so strongly in michele s favor but called it a fun infectious number criss s performance of it s not unusual attracted comparisons to comical renditions of number in fresh prince of bel air but earned an a from west regardless fallon said routine was embarrassingly enjoyable and lauded criss s screen presence and benigno called it a wonderful performance but felt it was hampered by simplicity of arrangement and gave it a b futterman and slezak both generally like blaine as a lead vocalist but felt song was not his best futterman wrote that some of belting felt strained and energy a little forced and slezak awarded song a b anything goes anything you can do mash up was widely acclaimed respers france named pearce s performance best moment of episode and found that character positively reminded her of glee of old song was also a favorite of lee s who wrote that intensity of actress was perfectly matched to character s disposition west slezak and benigno gave performance an a former called it an outstanding rendition which felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big screen musical and latter two praised her vocal talent which benigno deemed unequalled on glee futterman and bell found harmony a credible rival to rachel vocally and eagerly anticipated future competition between them urban called pearce s performance merely serviceable though she felt her acting was a weak point she compared her favorably to season two guest star charice and praised her vocals criticism came from new york lindy west who did not understand rachel s humiliation as new directions sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode she elaborated this is a thing that drives me crazy about glee as a viewer there s no knowing whether a performance was good like anything goes or bad like we ve got beat until rachel starts crying or some cheerleader starts throwing spaghetti you can t stop beat was called a perfect ending to a perfect season premiere by mullins futterman described it as a standard glee episode finale full of inspiration and importance for future and catchy as all hell slezak enjoyed rachel s slow opening verse said full performance felt a lot like shiny happy glee of yore and gave it an a as did benigno who also found it a typical final number but was less enthused by familiarity votta s only disappointment with rendition was that televised version did not include adorable duet between kurt and artie that is present on single chart history three of five cover versions released as singles debuted on billboard hot 100 it s not unusual at number sixty five with 40 000 in sales you can t stop beat at number sixty seven and we ve got beat at number eighty three peak chart positions for
