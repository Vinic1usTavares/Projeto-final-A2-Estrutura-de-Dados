samuel adams october 2 1803 was an american statesman political philosopher and one of founding fathers of united states he was a politician in colonial massachusetts a leader of movement that became american revolution and one of architects of principles of american republicanism that shaped political culture of united states he was a second cousin to his fellow founding father president john adams adams was born in boston brought up in a religious and politically active family a graduate of harvard college he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics he was an influential official of massachusetts house of representatives and boston town meeting in 1760s and he became a part of a movement opposed to british parliament s efforts to tax british american colonies without their consent his 1768 massachusetts circular letter calling for colonial non cooperation prompted occupation of boston by british soldiers eventually resulting in boston massacre of 1770 adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as british government s attempts to violate british constitution at expense of colonies which linked like minded patriots throughout thirteen colonies continued resistance to british policy resulted in 1773 boston tea party and coming of american revolution parliament passed coercive acts in 1774 at which time adams attended continental congress in philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response he helped guide congress towards issuing continental association in 1774 and declaration of independence in 1776 and he helped draft articles of confederation and massachusetts constitution adams returned to massachusetts after american revolution where he served in state senate and was eventually elected governor samuel adams later became a controversial figure in american history accounts written in 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before outbreak of revolutionary war this view gave way to negative assessments of adams in first half of 20th century in which he was portrayed as a master of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars who argue that these traditional depictions of adams are myths contradicted by historical record early life samuel adams was born in boston in british colony of massachusetts on september 16 1722 an old style date that is sometimes converted to new style date of september 27 adams was one of twelve children born to samuel adams sr and mary adams in an age of high infant mortality only three of these children lived past their third birthday adams s parents were devout puritans and members of old south congregational church family lived on purchase street in boston adams was proud of his puritan heritage and emphasized puritan values in his political career especially virtue samuel adams sr 1689 1748 was a prosperous merchant and church deacon deacon adams became a leading figure in boston politics through an organization that became known as boston caucus which promoted candidates who supported popular causes boston caucus helped shape agenda of boston town meeting a new england town meeting is a form of local government with elected officials and not just a gathering of citizens according to historian william fowler it was most democratic institution in british empire deacon adams rose through political ranks becoming a justice of peace a selectman and a member of massachusetts house of representatives he worked closely with elisha cooke jr 1678 1737 leader of popular party a faction that resisted any encroachment by royal officials on colonial rights embodied in massachusetts charter of 1691 in coming years members of popular party became known as whigs or patriots thumb left alt a four story brick building with many windows while at harvard adams boarded at massachusetts hall younger samuel adams attended boston latin school and then entered harvard college in 1736 his parents hoped that his schooling would prepare him for ministry but adams gradually shifted his interest to politics after graduating in 1740 adams continued his studies earning a master s degree in 1743 in his thesis he argued that it was lawful to resist supreme magistrate if commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved which indicated that his political views like his father s were oriented towards colonial rights adams s life was greatly affected by his father s involvement in a banking controversy in 1739 massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage and deacon adams and boston caucus created a land bank which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security land bank was generally supported by citizenry and popular party which dominated house of representatives lower branch of general court opposition to land bank came from more aristocratic court party who were supporters of royal governor and controlled governor s council upper chamber of general court court party used its influence to have british parliament dissolve land bank in 1741 directors of land bank including deacon adams became personally liable for currency still in circulation payable in silver and gold lawsuits over bank persisted for years even after deacon adams s death and younger samuel adams often had to defend family estate from seizure by government for adams these lawsuits served as a constant personal reminder that britain s power over colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways early career after leaving harvard in 1743 adams was unsure about his future he considered becoming a lawyer but instead decided to go into business he worked at thomas cushing s counting house but job only lasted a few months because cushing felt that adams was too preoccupied with politics to become a good merchant adams s father then lent him ps1 000 to go into business for himself a substantial amount for that time adams s lack of business instincts were confirmed he lent half of this money to a friend who never repaid and frittered away other half adams always remained in words of historian pauline maier a man utterly uninterested in either making or possessing money maier american national biography thumb 175px alt on a city street an old brick church with a tall steeple is surrounded by modern buildings old south meeting house

family s malthouse which was next to family home on purchase street several generations of adamses were maltsters who produced malt necessary for brewing beer years later a poet poked fun at adams by calling him sam maltster adams has often been described as a brewer but extant evidence suggests that he worked as a maltster and not a brewer stoll samuel adams notes that james koch founder of boston beer company reports having been offered for purchase a receipt for hops signed by adams which indicates that adams may have done some brewing in january 1748 adams and some friends were inflamed by british impressment and launched independent advertiser a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by adams his essays drew heavily upon english political theorist john locke s second treatise of government and they emphasized many of themes that characterized his subsequent career he argued that people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights he cited decline of roman empire as an example of what could happen to new england if it were to abandon its puritan values when deacon adams died in 1748 adams was given responsibility of managing family s affairs in october 1749 he married elizabeth checkley his pastor s daughter elizabeth gave birth to six children over next seven years but only two lived to adulthood samuel born 1751 and hannah born 1756 in july 1757 elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son adams remarried in 1764 to elizabeth wells but had no other children like his father adams embarked on a political career with support of boston caucus he was elected to his first political office in 1747 serving as one of clerks of boston market in 1756 boston town meeting elected him to post of tax collector which provided a small income he often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens which increased his popularity among those who did not pay but left him liable for shortage by 1765 his account was more than ps8 000 in arrears town meeting was on verge of bankruptcy and adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers but many taxes went uncollected in 1768 his political opponents used situation to their advantage obtaining a court judgment of ps1 463 against him adams s friends paid off some of deficit and town meeting wrote off remainder by then he had emerged as a leader of popular party and embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence struggle with great britain samuel adams emerged as an important public figure in boston soon after british empire s victory in french and indian war 1754 1763 british parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue and they sought to directly tax colonies of british america for first time this tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between british and american interpretations of british constitution and extent of parliament s authority in colonies bailyn ideological origins 162 sugar act first step in new program was sugar act of 1764 which adams saw as an infringement of longstanding colonial rights colonists were not represented in parliament he argued and therefore they could not be taxed by that body colonists were represented by colonial assemblies and only they could levy taxes upon them adams expressed these views in may 1764 when boston town meeting elected its representatives to massachusetts house as was customary town meeting provided representatives with a set of written instructions which adams was selected to write adams highlighted what he perceived to be dangers of taxation without representation for if our trade may be taxed why not our lands why not produce of our lands everything we possess or make use of this we apprehend annihilates our charter right to govern tax ourselves it strikes at our british privileges which as we have never forfeited them we hold in common with our fellow subjects who are natives of britain if taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal representation where they are laid are we not reduced from character of free subjects to miserable state of tributary slaves complete text is in cushing writings 1 1 7 when boston town meeting approved adams instructions on may 24 1764 writes historian john k alexander it became first political body in america to go on record stating parliament could not constitutionally tax colonists directives also contained first official recommendation that colonies present a unified defense of their rights adams s instructions were published in newspapers and pamphlets and he soon became closely associated with james otis jr a member of massachusetts house famous for his defense of colonial rights otis boldly challenged constitutionality of certain acts of parliament but he would not go as far as adams who was moving towards conclusion that parliament did not have sovereignty over colonies stamp act in 1765 parliament passed stamp act which required colonists to pay a new tax on most printed materials news of passage of stamp act produced an uproar in colonies colonial response echoed adams s 1764 instructions in june 1765 otis called for a stamp act congress to coordinate colonial resistance virginia house of burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against stamp act that resembled adams s arguments against sugar act adams argued that stamp act was unconstitutional he also believed that it would hurt economy of british empire he supported calls for a boycott of british goods to put pressure on parliament to repeal tax in boston a group called loyal nine a precursor to sons of liberty organized protests of stamp act adams was friendly with loyal nine but was not a member on

hall which was home of boston town meeting officials such as governor francis bernard believed that common people acted only under direction of agitators and blamed violence on adams this interpretation was revived by scholars in early 20th century who viewed adams as a master of propaganda who manipulated mobs into doing his bidding for example historian john c miller wrote in 1936 in what became standard biography of adams that adams controlled boston with his trained mob some modern scholars have argued that this interpretation is a myth and that there is no evidence that adams had anything to do with stamp act riots after fact adams did approve of august 14 action because he saw no other legal options to resist what he viewed as an unconstitutional act by parliament but he condemned attacks on officials homes as according to modern scholarly interpretation of adams he supported legal methods of resisting parliamentary taxation such as petitions boycotts and nonviolent demonstrations but he opposed mob violence which he saw as illegal dangerous and counter productive in september 1765 adams was once again appointed by boston town meeting to write instructions for boston s delegation to massachusetts house of representatives as it turned out he wrote his own instructions on september 27 town meeting selected him to replace recently deceased oxenbridge thacher as one of boston s four representatives in assembly james otis was attending stamp act congress in new york city so adams was primary author of a series of house resolutions against stamp act which were more radical than those passed by stamp act congress adams was one of first colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate stamp act was scheduled to go into effect on november 1 1765 but it was not enforced because protestors throughout colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign eventually british merchants were able to convince parliament to repeal tax by may 16 1766 news of repeal had reached boston there was celebration throughout city and adams made a public statement of thanks to british merchants for helping their cause massachusetts popular party gained ground in may 1766 elections adams was re elected to house and selected as its clerk in which position he was responsible for official house papers in coming years adams used his position as clerk to great effect in promoting his political message joining adams in house was john hancock a new representative from boston hancock was a wealthy merchant perhaps richest man in massachusetts but a relative newcomer to politics he was initially a protege of adams and he used his wealth to promote whig cause nobles old republicans 269 townshend acts after repeal of stamp act parliament took a different approach to raising revenue passing townshend acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into colonies these duties were relatively low because british ministry wanted to establish precedent that parliament had right to impose tariffs on colonies before raising them revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control to enforce compliance with new laws townshend acts created a customs agency known as american board of custom commissioners which was headquartered in boston resistance to townshend acts grew slowly general court was not in session when news of acts reached boston in october 1767 adams therefore used boston town meeting to organize an economic boycott and called for other towns to do same by february 1768 towns in massachusetts rhode island and connecticut had joined boycott opposition to townshend acts was also encouraged by letters from a farmer in pennsylvania a series of popular essays by john dickinson which started appearing in december 1767 dickinson s argument that new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by adams but never to such a wide audience in january 1768 massachusetts house sent a petition to king george asking for his help in london petition to king was published along with other documents by thomas hollis under title true sentiments of america adams and otis requested that house send petition to other colonies along with what became known as massachusetts circular letter which became a significant milestone on road to revolution letter written by adams called on colonies to join with massachusetts in resisting townshend acts house initially voted against sending letter and petition to other colonies but after some politicking by adams and otis it was approved on february 11 british colonial secretary lord hillsborough hoping to prevent a repeat of stamp act congress instructed colonial governors in america to dissolve assemblies if they responded to massachusetts circular letter he also directed massachusetts governor francis bernard to have massachusetts house rescind letter on june 30 house refused to rescind letter by a vote of 92 to 17 with adams citing their right to petition as justification far from complying with governor s order adams instead presented a new petition to king asking that governor bernard be removed from office bernard responded by dissolving legislature commissioners of customs board found that they were unable to enforce trade regulations in boston so they requested military assistance help came in form of a fifty gun warship which arrived in boston harbor in may 1768 tensions escalated after captain of romney began to impress local sailors situation exploded on june 10 when customs officials seized a sloop owned by john hancock a leading critic of customs board for alleged customs violations sailors and marines came ashore from romney to tow away liberty and a riot broke out things calmed down in following days but fearful customs officials packed up their families and fled for protection to romney and eventually to castle william an island fort in harbor governor bernard wrote to london in response to liberty incident and struggle over circular letter informing his superiors that troops were needed in boston to restore order lord hillsborough ordered four regiments of british army to boston boston under occupation thumb paul revere s 1768 engraving of british troops arriving

of warships learning that british troops were on way boston town meeting met on september 12 1768 and requested that governor bernard convene general court bernard refused so town meeting called on other massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at faneuil hall beginning on september 22 about 100 towns sent delegates to convention which was effectively an unofficial session of massachusetts house convention issued a letter which insisted that boston was not a lawless town using language more moderate than what adams desired and that impending military occupation violated bostonians natural constitutional and charter rights by time that convention adjourned british troop transports had arrived in boston harbor two regiments disembarked in october 1768 followed by two more in november according to some accounts occupation of boston was a turning point for adams after which he gave up hope of reconciliation and secretly began to work towards american independence however historian carl becker wrote in 1928 that there is no clear evidence in his contemporary writings that such was case becker samuel adams dictionary of american biography nevertheless traditional standard view of adams is that he desired independence before most of his contemporaries and steadily worked towards this goal for years historian pauline maier challenged that idea in 1980 arguing instead that adams like most of his peers did not embrace independence until after american revolutionary war had begun in 1775 notes that stewart beach s samuel adams fateful years 1965 also questioned whether adams sought independence before mid 1770s according to maier adams at this time was a reformer rather than a revolutionary he sought to have british ministry change its policies and warned britain that independence would be inevitable result of a failure to do so adams wrote numerous letters and essays in opposition to occupation which he considered a violation of 1689 bill of rights occupation was publicized throughout colonies in journal of occurrences an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by adams in collaboration with others journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in boston during military occupation an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters it depicted a boston besieged by unruly british soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity drawing upon traditional anglo american distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians journal ceased publication on august 1 1769 which was a day of celebration in boston governor bernard had left massachusetts never to return adams continued to work on getting troops withdrawn and keeping boycott going until townshend duties were repealed two regiments were removed from boston in 1769 but other two remained tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in killing of five civilians in boston massacre of march 1770 according to propagandist interpretation of adams popularized by historian john miller adams deliberately provoked incident to promote his secret agenda of american independence according to pauline maier however there is no evidence that he prompted boston massacre riot after boston massacre adams and other town leaders met with bernard s successor governor thomas hutchinson and with colonel william dalrymple army commander to demand withdrawal of troops situation remained explosive and so dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to castle william adams wanted soldiers to have a fair trial because this would show that boston was not controlled by a lawless mob but was instead victim of an unjust occupation he convinced his cousins john adams and josiah quincy to defend soldiers knowing that those whigs would not slander boston to gain an acquittal however adams wrote essays condemning outcome of trials he thought that soldiers should have been convicted of murder quiet period after boston massacre politics in massachusetts entered what is sometimes known as quiet period in april 1770 parliament repealed townshend duties except for tax on tea adams urged colonists to keep up boycott of british goods arguing that paying even one small tax allowed parliament to establish precedent of taxing colonies but boycott faltered as economic conditions improved support waned for adams s causes in 1770 new york city and philadelphia abandoned non importation boycott of british goods and boston merchants faced risk of being economically ruined so they also agreed to end boycott effectively defeating adams cause in massachusetts john adams withdrew from politics while john hancock and james otis appeared to become

over power of purse brought adams back into political limelight traditionally massachusetts house of representatives paid salaries of governor lieutenant governor and superior court judges from whig perspective this arrangement was an important check on executive power keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives in 1772 massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by british government rather than by province to protest this adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in november 1772 towns of massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded british activities and protested imperial policies committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies as well governor hutchinson became concerned that committees of correspondence were growing into an independence movement so he convened general court in january 1773 addressing legislature hutchinson argued that denying supremacy of parliament as some committees had done came dangerously close to rebellion i know of no line that can be drawn he said between supreme authority of parliament and total independence of colonies adams and house responded that massachusetts charter did not establish parliament s supremacy over province and so parliament could not claim that authority now hutchinson soon realized that he had made a major blunder by initiating a public debate about independence and extent of parliament s authority in colonies boston committee of correspondence published its statement of colonial rights along with hutchinson s exchange with massachusetts house in widely distributed boston pamphlet quiet period in massachusetts was over adams was easily re elected to massachusetts house in may 1773 and was also elected as moderator of boston town meeting in june 1773 he introduced a set of private letters to massachusetts house written by hutchinson several years earlier in one letter hutchinson recommended to london that there should be an abridgement of what are called english liberties in massachusetts hutchinson denied that this is what he meant but his career was effectively over in massachusetts and house sent a petition asking king to recall him hutchinson maintained that he was predicting a curtailment of liberty rather than recommending it for modern scholarly analysis of letters affair see bernard bailyn ordeal of thomas hutchinson cambridge 1974 tea party adams took a leading role in events that led up to famous boston tea party of december 16 1773 although precise nature of his involvement has been disputed in may 1773 british parliament passed tea act a tax law to help struggling east india company one of great britain s most important commercial institutions britons could buy smuggled dutch tea more cheaply than east india company s tea because of heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into great britain and so company amassed a huge surplus of tea that it could not sell thomas townshend duties 248 49 british government s solution to problem was to sell surplus in colonies tea act permitted east india company to export tea directly to colonies for first time bypassing most of merchants who had previously acted as middlemen this measure was a threat to american colonial economy because it granted tea company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers driving them out of business act also reduced taxes on tea paid by company in britain but kept controversial townshend duty on tea imported in colonies a few merchants in new york philadelphia boston and charlestown were selected to receive company s tea for resale in late 1773 seven ships were sent to colonies carrying east india company tea including four bound for boston news of tea act set off a firestorm of protest in colonies this was not a dispute about high taxes price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by tea act protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues familiar no taxation without representation argument remained prominent along with question of extent of parliament s authority in colonies thomas townshend duties 246 some colonists worried that by buying cheaper tea they would be conceding that parliament had right to tax them power of purse conflict was still at issue tea tax revenues were to be used to pay salaries of certain royal officials making them independent of people colonial smugglers played a significant role in protests since tea act made legally imported tea cheaper which threatened to put smugglers of dutch tea out of business see also john w tyler smugglers patriots

american revolution boston beacon press 1999 183 85 adams and correspondence committees promoted opposition to tea act in every colony except massachusetts protesters were able to force tea consignees to resign or to return tea to england in boston however governor hutchinson was determined to hold his ground he convinced tea consignees two of whom were his sons not to back down boston caucus and then town meeting attempted to compel consignees to resign but they refused with tea ships about to arrive adams and boston committee of correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support tea ship dartmouth arrived in boston harbor in late november and adams wrote a circular letter calling for a mass meeting to be held at faneuil hall on november 29 thousands of people arrived so many that meeting was moved to larger old south meeting house this was not an official town meeting but a gathering of body of people of greater boston british law required dartmouth to unload and pay duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate cargo mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by adams urging captain of dartmouth to send ship back without paying import duty meanwhile meeting assigned twenty five men to watch ship and prevent tea from being unloaded governor hutchinson refused to grant permission for dartmouth to leave without paying duty two more tea ships arrived in boston harbor eleanor and beaver fourth ship william was stranded near cape cod and never arrived to boston december 16 was last day of dartmouth s deadline and about 7 000 people gathered around old south meeting house adams received a report that governor hutchinson had again refused to let ships leave and he announced this meeting can do nothing further to save country according to a popular story adams s statement was a prearranged signal for tea party to begin however this claim did not appear in print until nearly a century after event in a biography of adams written by his great grandson who apparently misinterpreted evidence according to eyewitness accounts people did not leave meeting until ten or fifteen minutes after adams s alleged signal and adams in fact tried to stop people from leaving because meeting was not yet over for firsthand accounts that contradict story that adams gave signal for tea party see l f s upton ed proceeding of ye body respecting tea

harbor that evening a group of 30 to 130 men boarded three vessels some of them thinly disguised as mohawk indians and dumped all 342 chests of tea into water over course of three hours adams never revealed whether he went to wharf to witness destruction of tea whether or not he helped plan event is unknown but adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it he argued that tea party was not act of a lawless mob but was instead a principled protest and only remaining option that people had to defend their constitutional rights revolution great britain responded to boston tea party in 1774 with coercive acts first of these acts was boston port act which closed boston s commerce until east india company had been repaid for destroyed tea massachusetts government act rewrote massachusetts charter making many officials royally appointed rather than elected and severely restricting activities of town meetings administration of justice act allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to great britain for trial a new royal governor was appointed to enforce acts general thomas gage who was also commander of british military forces in north america adams worked to coordinate resistance to coercive acts in may 1774 boston town meeting with adams serving as moderator organized an economic boycott of british goods in june adams headed a committee

coercive acts congress endorsed suffolk resolves issued a declaration of rights that denied parliament s right to legislate for colonies and organized a colonial boycott known as continental association adams returned to massachusetts in november 1774 where he served in massachusetts provincial congress an extralegal legislative body independent of british control provincial congress created first minutemen companies consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment s notice adams also served as moderator of boston town meeting which convened despite massachusetts government act and was appointed to committee of inspection to enforce continental association he was also selected to attend second continental congress scheduled to meet in philadelphia in may 1775 john hancock had been added to delegation and he and adams attended provincial congress in concord massachusetts before adams journey to second congress two men decided that

adams was a cautious advocate for a declaration of independence urging eager correspondents back in massachusetts to wait for more moderate colonists to come around to supporting separation from great britain he was pleased in 1775 when colonies began to replace their old governments with independent republican governments he praised thomas paine s popular pamphlet common sense writing as candidus in early 1776 and supported call for american independence on june 7 adams s political ally richard henry lee introduced a three part resolution calling for congress to declare independence create a colonial confederation and seek foreign aid after a delay to rally support congress approved language of united states declaration of independence on july 4 1776 which adams signed after declaration of independence congress continued to manage war effort adams served on military committees including an appointment to board of war in 1777 he advocated paying bonuses to continental army soldiers to encourage them to reenlist for duration of war he called for harsh state legislation to punish loyalists americans who continued to support british crown who adams believed were as dangerous to american liberty as british soldiers in massachusetts more than 300 loyalists were banished and their property confiscated after war adams opposed allowing loyalists to return to massachusetts fearing that they would work to undermine republican government adams was massachusetts delegate appointed to committee to draft articles of confederation plan for colonial confederation with its emphasis on state sovereignty articles reflected congress s wariness of a strong central government a concern shared by adams like others at time adams considered himself a citizen of united states while continuing to refer to massachusetts as his country after much debate articles were sent to states for ratification in november 1777 from philadelphia adams urged massachusetts to ratify which it did adams signed articles of confederation with other massachusetts delegates in 1778 but they were not ratified by all states until 1781 adams returned to boston in 1779 to attend a state constitutional convention massachusetts general court had proposed a new constitution previous year but voters rejected it and so a convention was held to try again adams was appointed to a three man drafting committee with his cousin john adams and james bowdoin they drafted massachusetts constitution which was amended by convention and approved by voters in 1780 new constitution established a republican form of government with annual elections and a separation of powers it reflected adams s belief that a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever that he has not approved of either directly or through his representatives by modern standards new constitution was not democratic adams like most of his peers believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote and that senate and governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule in 1781 adams retired from continental congress his health was one reason he was approaching his sixtieth birthday and suffered from tremors that made writing difficult but he also wanted to return to massachusetts to influence politics in commonwealth he returned to boston in 1781 and never left massachusetts again return to massachusetts adams remained active in politics upon his return to massachusetts he frequently served as moderator of boston town meeting and was elected to state senate where he often served as that body s president adams focused his political agenda on promoting virtue which he considered essential in a republican government if republican leaders lacked virtue he believed liberty was endangered his major opponent in this campaign was his former protege john hancock two men had a falling out in continental congress adams disapproved of what he viewed as hancock s vanity and extravagance which adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader when hancock left congress in 1777 adams and other massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of congress struggle continued in massachusetts adams thought that hancock was not acting part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity adams favored james bowdoin for governor and was distressed when hancock won annual landslide victories adams s promotion of public virtue took several forms he played a major role in getting boston to provide a free public education for children even for girls which was controversial adams was one of charter members of american academy of arts and sciences in 1780 after revolutionary war adams joined others including thomas jefferson in denouncing society of cincinnati an organization of former army officers adams worried that society was a stride towards an hereditary military nobility and thus a threat to republicanism adams also believed that public theaters undermined civic virtue and he joined an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep theaters banned in boston decades after adams s death orator edward everett called him last of puritans postwar economic troubles in western massachusetts led to an uprising known as shays s rebellion which began in 1786 small farmers angered by high taxes and debts armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties governor james bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen to put down uprising an action supported by adams his old political ally james warren thought that adams had forsaken his principles but adams saw no contradiction he approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government as had happened during american revolution but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government where problems should be remedied through elections he thought that leaders of shays s rebellion should be hanged reportedly saying that man who dares to rebel against laws of a republic ought to suffer death shays s rebellion contributed to belief that articles of confederation needed to be revised in 1787 delegates to philadelphia convention instead of revising articles created a new united states constitution with a much stronger national government constitution was sent to states for ratification when adams expressed his displeasure i confess he wrote to richard henry lee in 1787 as i enter building i stumble at threshold i meet with a national government instead of a federal union of states adams was one of those derisively labeled anti federalists by proponents of new constitution who called themselves federalists adams was elected to massachusetts ratifying convention which met in january 1788 despite his reservations adams rarely spoke at convention and listened carefully to arguments rather than raising objections adams and john hancock had reconciled and they finally agreed to give their support for constitution with proviso that some amendments be added later even with support of hancock and adams massachusetts convention narrowly ratified constitution by a vote of 187 to 168 while adams was attending ratifying convention his only son samuel adams jr died at just 37 years of age younger adams had served as surgeon in revolutionary war but had fallen ill and never fully recovered death was a stunning blow to elder adams younger adams left his father certificates that he had earned as a soldier giving adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years investments in land made them relatively wealthy by mid 1790s but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle adams was concerned about new constitution and made an attempt to re enter national politics he allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for united states house of representatives in december 1788 election but lost to fisher ames apparently because ames was a stronger supporter of constitution a more popular position despite his defeat adams continued to work for amendments to constitution a movement that ultimately resulted in addition of a bill of rights in 1791 adams subsequently became a firm supporter of constitution with these amendments and possibility of more in 1789 adams was elected lieutenant governor of massachusetts and served in that office until governor hancock s death in 1793 when he became acting governor next year adams was elected as governor in his own right first of four annual terms he was generally regarded as leader of his state s jeffersonian republicans who were opposed to federalist party unlike some other republicans adams supported suppression of whiskey rebellion in 1794 for same reasons that he had opposed shays s rebellion like his fellow republicans he spoke out against jay treaty in 1796 a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly federalist in that year s u s presidential election republicans in virginia cast 15 electoral votes for adams in an effort to make him jefferson s vice president but federalist john adams won election with jefferson becoming vice president adams cousins remained friends but samuel was pleased when jefferson defeated john adams in 1800 presidential election samuel adams took a cue from president washington who declined to run for reelection in 1796 he retired from politics at end of his term as governor in 1797 adams suffered from what is now believed to have been essential tremor a movement disorder that rendered him unable to write in final decade of his life he died at age of 81 on october 2 1803 and was interred at granary burying ground in boston boston s republican newspaper independent chronicle eulogized him as father of american revolution legacy thumb 200px samuel adams grave marker in granary burying ground alt a rectangular rough hewn block of stone on ground there is a walkway in foreground grass

controversial figure in american history disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to present adams contemporaries both friends and foes regarded him as one of foremost leaders of american revolution thomas jefferson for example characterized adams as truly man of revolution leaders in other colonies were compared to him cornelius harnett was called samuel adams of north carolina charles thomson samuel adams of philadelphia and christopher gadsden sam adams of south e godbold gadsden christopher american national biography online february 2000 when john adams traveled to france during revolution he had to explain that he was not samuel famous adams supporters of revolution praised adams but loyalists viewed him as a sinister figure peter oliver exiled chief justice of massachusetts characterized him as a devious machiavellian with a cloven foot thomas hutchinson adams political foe took his revenge in his history of massachusetts bay in which he denounced him as a dishonest character assassin emphasizing his failures as a businessman and tax collector this hostile tory interpretation of adams was revived in 20th century by historian clifford k shipton in sibley s harvard graduates reference series shipton wrote positive portraits of hutchinson and oliver and scathing sketches of adams and hancock his entry on adams was characterized by historian pauline maier as forty five pages of contempt whig historians challenged tory interpretation of adams william gordon and mercy otis warren two historians who knew adams wrote of him as a man selflessly dedicated to american revolution but in early 19th century adams was often viewed as an old fashioned puritan and was consequently neglected by historians interest in adams was revived in mid 19th century historian george bancroft portrayed him favorably in his monumental history of united states from discovery of american continent 1852 first full biography of adams appeared in 1865 a three volume work written by william wells his great grandson wells biography is still valuable for its wealth of information although whig portrayals of adams were uncritically pro american and had elements of hagiography a view that influenced some later biographies written for general audiences in late 19th century many american historians were uncomfortable with contemporary revolutions and found it problematic to write approvingly about adams relations had improved between united states and united kingdom and adams role in dividing americans from britons was increasingly viewed with regret in 1885 james hosmer wrote a biography that praised adams but also found some of his actions troubling such as 1773 publication of hutchinson s private letters subsequent biographers became increasingly hostile towards adams and common people whom he represented in 1923 ralph v harlow used a freudian approach to characterize adams as a neurotic crank driven by an inferiority complex see ralph v harlow samuel adams promoter of american revolution a study in psychology and politics holt 1923 harlow argued that because masses were easily misled adams manufactured public opinion to produce revolution a view that became thesis of john c miller s 1936 biography sam adams pioneer in propaganda miller portrayed adams more as an incendiary revolutionary than an adroit political operative attributing to this one man all acts of boston s body of people and consistently calling his subject sam despite fact that adams was almost always known as samuel in his lifetime miller s influential book became in words of historian charles akers scholarly enshrinement of myth of sam adams as boston dictator who almost single handedly led his colony into rebellion akers sam adams and much more 120 21 according to akers miller and other historians used sam did it to explain crowd actions and other developments without citing any evidence that adams directed those events akers sam adams and much more 121 22 in 1974 akers called on historians to critically re examine sources rather than simply repeating myth akers sam adams and much more 130 by then scholars were increasingly rejecting notion that adams and others used propaganda to incite ignorant mobs and were instead portraying a revolutionary massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man historian pauline maier argued that adams far from being a radical mob leader took a moderate position based on english revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority that belief justified force only against threats to constitutional rights so grave that body of people recognized danger and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed within that revolutionary tradition resistance was essentially conservative in 2004 ray raphael s founding myths continued maier s line by deconstructing several of sam adams myths that are still repeated in many textbooks and popular histories in popular culture in 2008 miniseries john adams samuel adams was played by danny huston adams is main protagonist in 2015 miniseries sons of liberty
