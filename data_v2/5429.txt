thumb a royal maundy ceremony in 1867 royal maundy is a religious service in church of england held on maundy thursday day before good friday at service british monarch or a royal official ceremonially distributes small silver coins known as maundy money legally queen s maundy money as symbolic alms to elderly recipients coins are legal tender but do not circulate because of their silver content and numismatic value a small sum of ordinary money is also given in lieu of gifts of clothing and food that sovereign once bestowed on maundy recipients name maundy and ceremony itself derive from an instruction or mandatum of jesus christ at last supper that his followers should love one another in middle ages english monarchs washed feet of beggars in imitation of jesus and presented gifts and money to poor over time additional money was substituted for clothing and other items that had once been distributed beginning in 1699 monarch did not attend service sending an official in his place custom of washing feet did not survive 18th century in 1931 princess marie louise was at royal maundy and afterwards suggested that her cousin king george v make distributions following year which he did beginning a new royal custom traditionally service was held in or near london in most years in early 20th century at westminster abbey today queen elizabeth ii almost always attends she has been absent only four times in her reign and service is held in a different church usually a cathedral every year recipients were once chosen for their poverty and were entitled to remain as maundy recipients for life today new recipients are chosen every year for service to their churches or communities on recommendation of clergymen of various christian denominations generally recipients live in diocese where service is held although this was altered for 2011 and 2012 services maundy money is struck in denominations of one penny two pence three pence and four pence until 18th century coins given were from circulating coinage and it was not until latter half of century that four maundy coins developed as distinct pieces obverse design of coins features reigning monarch reverse with a crowned numeral enclosed by a wreath derives from a design first used during reign of king william iii and queen mary ii and which has been virtually unaltered since 1822 coins are presented in two leather purses a white one containing coins to value of same number of pence as years of monarch s age and a red purse containing a ps5 and a 50p coin these leather purses are traditionally supplied to sovereign by barrow hepburn gale in most years there are fewer than 2 000 complete sets of maundy money they are highly sought after by collectors origins early and medieval history thumb jesus washing peter s feet by ford madox brown word maundy derives from command or mandatum by christ at last supper to love one another gospels relate that on eve of his crucifixion jesus christ ate a meal with his disciples after meal it is recorded that jesus washed their feet and gave them following mandatum or command if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another s feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done unto you mandatum is derivation of word maundy and royal maundy service evolved from jesus command to his disciples by fourth or fifth century a ceremony had been developed following holy communion on maundy thursday in which high church leaders washed feet of poor ceremony known as pedilavium was performed daily in some monasteries in 992 bishop oswald of worcester died during its performance first english monarch to be recorded as distributing alms at a maundy service was john who on 15 april 1210 donated garments forks food and other gifts to poor of knaresborough yorkshire john is also first english monarch to be recorded as giving gifts of small silver coins to poor when in 1213 he gave 13 pence to each of 13 poor men at a ceremony in rochester number being symbolic of twelve apostles together with either jesus or an angel few details of 13th century maundy survive they are known to have existed from records which show spending necessary for gifts to poor monarch was not alone in performing rituals of maundy service henry iii s children assisted him as part of their political and religious training henry s son edward i was first monarch to keep maundy only on or about maundy thursday before edward additional might be kept during year according to virginia cole in her study of royal children s role in 13th century maundy service had a political purpose as well as needing to humble himself by doing pedilavium proclaimed monarch s greatness attendance at a maundy service became an obligation for all major european ruling houses by 1363 english monarch performed pedilavium and also gave gifts that year fifty year old edward iii gave fifty pence to each of fifty poor men it is not known however whether it was as yet practice each year to have number of pence and number of recipients track monarch s age henry iv was first monarch to decree that number of pence given be determined by monarch s age ceremony was not always performed on maundy thursday it could be postponed a day to good friday by royal command as it was in 1510 nobles could hold their own maundy distributions as did henry percy 5th earl of northumberland in early 16th century according to a contemporary record my lord and yerly said maundy thursday when his lordshipe is at home to yerly as manny of with as manny in every purse to as many poore men as his lordshipe is of aige and one for of my lords aige to come although mary i and elizabeth i differed religiously both performed elaborate maundy ceremonies records from 1556 show that mary washed feet of forty one poor women reflecting her age while ever on her knees and gave them forty one pence each as well as gifts of bread fish and clothing donating her own gown to woman said to be poorest of all in 1572 disliking scenes as each woman tried to secure a piece of royal gown elizabeth granted a sum of ps1 to each recipient in lieu of gown giving it in a red purse contemporary writer william lambarde noted that money was substituted for gown to avoid trouble of suite which was made for that in years in which plague was rife monarch did not attend sending an official usually lord high almoner to make distributions and perform pedilavium even though scented water was used to disguise any unpleasant odours from poor feet were washed three times before monarch performed pedilavium once by a menial and twice by court officials in later years sweet smelling nosegays were used to disguise odours nosegays are still carried today post restoration charles i rarely attended royal maundy service author brian robinson who traced development of royal maundy suggests that after restoration his son charles ii attempted to gain popularity by assiduous attendance and distribution of money at service charles ii even attended during plague years of 1661 and 1663 his brother and successor james ii performed ceremony as well although there is a record of william iii doing so in 1698 most sources state that james was last to wash feet of poor himself in 1685 there is no record of any attendance by a monarch at royal maundy ceremony after 1698 until 1932 but pre 1725 records are vague lord high almoner continued to perform pedilavium at maundy ceremony until 1737 today only traces of pedilavium at royal maundy are nosegays and linen towels worn by several of officials left thumb a royal maundy ceremony in 1877 service was usually held somewhere near london this was done to suit monarch s convenience in medieval times it was held in windsor eton richmond greenwich or wherever monarch happened to be at in 1714 with monarch no longer present at ceremony service was moved to chapel royal whitehall where it remained until 1890 when chapel was given to royal united services institute after 1890 by order of queen victoria it was moved to westminster abbey though in years when there was a coronation and abbey was closed for preparations service was held at st paul s cathedral from 1954 to 1970 it was held in even numbered years at westminster and in odd numbered years at provincial cathedrals since then it has in most years been held outside london when service was confined to london recipients were customarily householders who had met their financial obligations to society but had since fallen on hard times number of recipients continued to track monarch s age until joint reign of william iii and mary ii recipients were of same sex as monarch during that reign each of monarchs made gifts to poor people of their sex but after mary s death only men received gifts from william beginning with reign of george i 1714 1727 both men and women have received gifts each sex in a number corresponding to monarch s age each recipient receiving that number of pence despite monarch s absence ceremony was held each year with lord high almoner or sub almoner deputising for sovereign gift of clothing was eliminated for women beginning in 1724 as recipients immediately tried on gifts and exchanged ill fitting ones with each other a practice thought unseemly in a church women were instead given 35 shillings decimalised as ps1 75 for men clothing gift was replaced by woollen cloth that year men continued to be given cloth until 1883 when royal officials realised that many of recipients were too poor to have cloth made into garments and were instead selling it men were given 45 shillings decimalised as ps2 25 in lieu of cloth an amount increased in 1973 to ps3 for both men and women there is a record of 1802 royal maundy it notes that recipients were given of beef and four threepenny loaves after 1837 maundy william iv ordered that as recipients were selling food gift for less than its full value they were to be given 30 shillings in food which was sometimes sold by recipients for as little as five shillings it was to be replaced by a money gift of 30 shillings this amount decimalised into ps1 50 is still given same year a report on civil list written for house of commons proposed eliminating royal maundy considering that sum distributed annually as alms and charity is applied in a manner suited rather to ancient than modern times and is attended with some expense it may not be inexpedient to consider whether purpose of royal benevolence might not be more fully attained if some other and better mode of distribution were adopted william iv s death at age of 71 that year and accession of his 18 year old niece victoria resulted in a dramatic drop in number of maundy recipients as at that time a maundy recipient continued in that status for life surplus recipients were placed on waiting lists and given royal charity through other means one vacancy occurred a week before 1838 maundy when recipient elizabeth love died at age of 110 in 1843 illustrated london news described a maundy ceremony on day alluded to a certain number of poor men and women of each exact number of our sovereign s age attends divine worship in royal chapel whitehall in morning and afternoon bread meat and fish is distributed to them in large wooden bowls and a procession formed of royal almoner or sub almoner with other officers who are decorated with white scarfs and sashes and each carrying a bouquet of flowers one of officers supports a large gold dish or salver on which are placed small red and white leather bags red containing a sovereign white pieces termed maundy money one of each of these bags is given to persons selected to receive royal bounty they have likewise given to them cloth linen shoes c as well as a small maple cup out of which previous to termination of ceremony they drink queen s health these small pieces are by an order of government declared current coins of realm therefore no one dare refuse to take them if offered in payment still they are not in reality intended for that purpose drinking of monarch s health which is believed to have originated with custom of loving cup was abolished in 19th century though exact date is uncertain in early 20th century members of royal family sometimes attended royal maundy service queen alexandra twice was present most royal maundy ceremonies in first part of century were attended by princess helena or by her daughter princess marie louise in 1931 marie louise was present at royal maundy and suggested after service that her cousin king george v make distributions following year king george did so in 1932 only time he was at service during his reign in 1936 year of king george s death new king edward viii made distribution george vi who succeeded in 1936 did not attend until 1940 and then not again until 1944 his place being taken in most years by lord high almoner cosmo gordon lang archbishop of canterbury queen elizabeth ii has been present for all but four royal maundy services of her long reign she was absent twice following childbirth and twice because she was visiting other parts of commonwealth she first attended royal maundy as princess elizabeth of york in 1935 until 1956 a recipient once chosen for maundy service had right to continue to be a recipient for life in 1957 with service leaving london for first time in over two centuries it was held in 1957 at st albans this became impractical and it was decided that in future years recipients would attend once only to honour promise to surviving lifetime appointees they were given opportunity to attend whenever service was held in london and were sent an equivalent sum by post in years when it was not royal maundy today thumb queen elizabeth ii centre in blue and prince philip hold nosegays as they leave wakefield cathedral after 2005 royal maundy queen elizabeth ii views service as an important part of her devotional life it is only occasion on which queen visits others to make awards as recipients of honours usually come to her according to ronald allison and sarah riddell in their royal encyclopedia service has become occasion of a royal pilgrimage to different parts of country queen has directed that service not be held in london more often than once in ten years westminster abbey was site of 2001 royal maundy and again in 2011 first ever televised on 20 march 2008 at church of ireland st patrick s cathedral armagh queen attended first maundy service held outside england and wales with 2017 service at leicester cathedral every anglican cathedral in england has hosted royal maundy today recipients are pensioners chosen on an interdenominational basis from various christian churches for their service to their churches and communities in most years recipients are nominated by christian clergy of various denominations in diocese where service is held in 2011 however as well as recipients representing westminster abbey forty recipients came from anglican diocese of gibraltar in europe which covers continental europe and forty from diocese of sodor and man which consists of isle of man robert patterson bishop of sodor and man while at a conference of anglican bishops had invited queen to his cathedral for maundy services he received word that this would be too difficult but that his diocese could nominate recipients for 2012 in honour of queen s diamond jubilee recipients were selected from all 44 dioceses in united kingdom for service at york minster yeomen of guard are present at ceremony and serve as indoor guard choir of chapel royal is also present six whose original function is uncertain guide recipients to their places and render any other help which is needed present at ceremony are four maundy children formally children of royal almonry two boys and two girls original maundy children were four old men charity recipients whose sole duty was to attend at royal maundy service wearing linen scarves as their fees for service amounted to over twenty pounds per year this was deemed an abuse of charity and in 1808 old men were pensioned off and replaced by actual children first children appointed from 1808 did not personally attend service but their parents received five guineas per year to aid in their education until age of fourteen and four other children from schools in city of westminster represented them at service today maundy children are chosen from religious and state schools and receive a set of maundy coins for their participation officials in maundy service wear towels over their clothing worn over shoulder and tied at waist linen towels were once retained by their wearers but since 1883 same towels laundered each year have been used in 1968 a royal warrant was granted to barrow hepburn and gale to produce traditional white and red leather purses which continues to today until 1979 queen made two distributions of money in leather purses to each recipient first distribution given to women in green purses and to men in white was of an allowance in lieu of clothing formerly given white purses used for clothing allowance may be distinguished from white purses which contained maundy money as former was tied with a short green string latter bears a long red string clothing allowance purses had been introduced in 1936 prior to that clothing allowance was distributed in a paper packet in second distribution two purses were given by monarch red one contained ps1 50 for provisions once given in kind and additional sum of ps1 mandated by elizabeth i white purses contained maundy money after 1979 separate distribution of clothing allowance was discontinued gifts have now been consolidated and recipients now receive two purses in a single distribution one white containing maundy coins and one red containing other money distributions were consolidated so as to reduce physical strain of ceremony on queen as she aged red purse contains ps1 representing money for redemption of monarch s gown ps3 in lieu of clothing once given and ps1 50 in place of food once presented totalling ps5 50 in 2015 for ceremony at sheffield cathedral ps5 50 not given in maundy money took form of a ps5 coin commemorating 50th anniversary of death of sir winston churchill and a 50p piece for 75th anniversary of battle of britain thumb an order of service and set of maundy purses as given to a male recipient for 1974 maundy at salisbury cathedral all male participants from 1936 to 1979 received from left a white purse with green strings in first distribution containing clothing allowance and in second distribution a red purse with white strings containing allowances in lieu of provisions and monarch s gown and a white purse with red strings containing maundy money one man and one woman are chosen for each year queen has lived including year she is currently living and they receive maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years recipients attend a maundy lecture in cathedral in advance of service to familiarise them with what will happen cathedral is designated royal chapel for day of service and royal standard flies purses are carried into church by yeomen on silver dishes held above their heads origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from times when provisions were distributed to poor some experts believe dishes were carried high to stop poor from grabbing at food prematurely others believe that position was to prevent congregation from being overwhelmed by smell of fish order of service for royal maundy is a simple one it begins with reading of john 13 34 which contains mandatum from which royal maundy evolved it contains two lessons first of which john 13 also recalls mandatum second reading contains that portion of matthew 25 which describes last judgment queen makes half of presentations after first lesson and half after second anthems led by chapel royal choir and local choir are sung while distribution is going on concluding with george frideric handel s coronation anthem zadok priest royal maundy service concludes with prayers god save queen and blessing two hymns are sung there is no address six silver dishes are used to hold gifts one traditional maundy dish forms part of royal regalia and is held at tower of london when not in use all six dishes date from reign of charles ii five of six have been added to service since 1971 they are held by yeomen as queen walks about greeting recipients and giving them their gifts lord high almoner receives his only recompense for his position if he attends royal maundy service a small fee though payable in maundy money pope still performs pedilavium as does archbishop of canterbury in recent years pedilavium has become more popular across christian denominations and even as a gesture of humility among those serving poor today royal maundy ceremony involves a considerable security operation with drains in area checked two 17 year old boys were arrested in wakefield in 2005 for popping balloons in area of service as sound might be mistaken for gunfire queen interacts informally with maundy recipients it is said some of whom have given her gifts in return one participant handed her a jar of marmalade mercia a 71 year old maundy recipient who participated in 1992 ceremony at chester for her work with salvation army spoke of ceremony before her death in july of that year it surpassed anything that i ever thought i didn t ever think that i should be in cathedral with queen and all dignitaries that were there and singing organ queen just everything and everybody it s really been out of this world just to hear zadok priest i think has lifted me to cloud nine because it s something that i love and to hear that and to have queen pass so close to me and yes she smiled she smiled at me venues elizabeth ii maundy coinage thumb

denomination higher than 1d then struck for circulation in silver being used in maundy gift before 1731 sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes at that time coins used for maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation it was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for maundy distribution at times when little silver was being struck by royal mint coins distributed might bear a previous year s date to evade statutory prohibitions on striking of silver coin during napoleonic wars all maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear date 1800 though most were struck later when date was finally changed in 1816 after prohibition ended size of coins was slightly reduced as royal mint increased amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin last year in which no maundy coins were struck was 1821 in 1689 royal mint began using a design for reverse of four low denomination silver coins depicting a crowned numeral designer is unknown richard lobel in his catalogue of british coins suggests artist was george bower an employee of royal mint whose medals bear similar characteristics but his work has endured in a revised form for over 300 years in 1822 an amended reverse was introduced and has been struck every year since then in all four denominations 1822 reverse design which places crowned numeral within an oak wreath was created by jean baptiste this design is still struck each year though crown was altered in 1888 as was appearance of numeral 2 on twopence these changes were made by royal mint engraver leonard charles a proposal by royal mint in 1950 to return to pre 1888 2 as more artistic was refused by george vi who felt current numeral was stylistically similar to numerals on other coins and pre 1888 2 was not beginning in 1834 threepence 3d pieces were struck for circulation bearing same design as maundy 3d circulation pieces were initially struck for use in west indies but beginning in 1845 were coined for use in britain as well many of 3d pieces presented to impoverished maundy recipients were spent and these are rarer than other values today maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for maundy pieces design of circulation 3d remained same as that of maundy

1982 maundy fourpence like all elizabeth ii maundy pieces it bears an obverse design by mary gillick long abandoned for circulating coins in 19th century as many as sixty times number of pieces needed for ceremony were struck due to public interest in ceremony and pieces beginning in 1846 queen victoria requested pieces for her private use as much as ps10 2 400 pence per year many sets were purchased by coin dealers others by mint officials as gifts small quantities of maundy and fourpences principally latter were obtained by colleges at university of cambridge for use in making token annual payments these requests were fulfilled until middle of 20th century after which royal mint refused them colleges thereafter used obsolete circulation groats fourpences or dispensed with custom according to robinson practice of recipients being asked to sell their gifts is of long standing robinson recounts a description of scenes after a maundy service at turn of 19th century a s soon as service is over crowds of buyers flock eagerly around old people who take a price for their coins rate they usually charge is four or five times face value of coins purses are sometimes disposed of at from one to two shillings each depending on market by 1897 maundy recipients were being urged to sell small pieces at a premium there are tales of americans paying high prices for a set that year wanting a souvenir of victoria s diamond jubilee thumb right bags and coins given to a 2006 maundy recipient in 1903 royal mint made its first effort to cut back on number of pieces distributed eliminating 200 mint workers principally and labourers from distribution list until 1908 maundy sets could be ordered through banks beginning in 1909 however distribution of pieces was restricted to maundy recipients and certain officials mintage of sets of maundy money dropped from 9 929 in 1908 to 2 428 following year by 1932 maundy recipients were routinely selling coins to dealers at a premium there was little official response to this until 1960s when questions were asked in house of lords after press reported that recipients were being approached by dealers after service and being offered cash for their gifts in response royal mint decreased number of sets available to officials though royal mint employees of long service are offered opportunity every few years to purchase a set a number of sets are used as prizes for students at westminster school a practice said to have begun with elizabeth i though this now occurs only in years when service is held at westminster abbey sets distributed by royal mint in these ways are not given in purses but in presentation cases in recent years approximately 1 600 1 900 sets have been minted additional sets have been struck for inclusion in special silver proof sets marketed by royal mint in 1996 2000 and 2006 with a special issue in gold as part of a gold proof set in 2002 individual maundy recipients have realised as much
