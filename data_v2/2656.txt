1970 canada hurricane was an unnamed tropical cyclone that brought impact to bermuda and newfoundland fourth hurricane and ninth tropical storm of annual hurricane season this system developed northeast of bahamas as a subtropical depression on october 12 while tracking northeastward system intensified becoming a subtropical storm on following day subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone on october 16 and strengthened into a hurricane about twelve hours later hurricane later bypassed bermuda before further intensifying into a category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale thereafter hurricane accelerated rapidly northeastward and made landfall on avalon peninsula of newfoundland as a category 1 hurricane it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on october 17 system produced tropical storm force winds on bermuda which caused suspension of schools transportation and interrupted businesses although minimal structural damage occurred light rainfall was also reported on island hurricane force winds were observed throughout newfoundland which caused damage to structures though mostly limited to broken windows rough seas damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp on atlantic coast of island cost of damage on burin peninsula was estimated to be in thousands of dollars although specific figure in unknown heavy rainfall was also reported in region with precipitation in quebec reaching nearly on french territory of saint pierre and miquelon several buildings and houses lost their roof due to strong winds meteorological history on october 11 1970 satellite images indicated that a tropical depression developed north of hispaniola however according to post analysis a subtropical depression actually formed on october 12 at 1200 utc depression slowly intensified over next few days and became a subtropical storm on october 12 thought this was operationally unnoticed by national hurricane center by october 13 satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with depression merged with a weak stationary front as a result national hurricane center no longer considered it purely tropical and classified system as a storm on october 14 later that day national hurricane center began issuing special bulletins for storm indicating possibility of system acquiring tropical characteristics early on october 16 satellite imagery indicated that storm was developing a cloud pattern typical of a normal tropical cyclone in addition reconnaissance aircraft flight data indicated that a warm core was developing as a result system had acquired enough characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000 utc on that day later that day storm strengthened enough to be upgraded to a hurricane at 1200 utc six hours later system passed just west of bermuda although winds were well below hurricane force on island spiral cloud bands and an eye feature were observed on radars as hurricane bypassed island warm core persisted into october 17 which indicated that hurricane was fully tropical for at least 30 36 hours early on october 17 national hurricane center discontinued bulletins on system while it was located about northeast of bermuda at 0600 utc on october 17 system intensified into a category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale six hours later hurricane attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph 165 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of although a radio bulletin by naval communications station washington d c transmitter nss at 1200 utc noted that it had hurricane characteristics national hurricane center did not name storm by 1800 utc a cold front began impacting circulation of hurricane which caused storm to weaken back to a category 1 hurricane and began losing its tropical characteristics at approximately 2330 utc on october 17 hurricane made landfall on avalon peninsula of newfoundland with winds of 80 mph 130 km h only 30 minutes later hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone remnant extratropical cyclone curved abruptly northward and later re emerged into atlantic before dissipating on october 20 impact late on october 16 storm passed close to bermuda as a minimal category 1 hurricane causing strong winds on island maximum sustained winds of 48 mph 77 km h and gusts up to 58 mph 93 km h were recorded at an elevated location an anemometer reported sustained winds as high as 100 mph 155 km h strong winds caused suspension of school transportation and disruption to businesses across bermuda a riot started by recurrence of vandalism and arson plagued island for two weeks leading up to storm however merchants and police were forced to ease their anti riot efforts to board up their windows in addition to high winds storm also produced light rainfall on island of bermuda which peaked at shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone hurricane moved across extreme southeastern portion of newfoundland at category 1 intensity as a result high winds were reported across region wind speeds of 90 mph 145 km h occurred on burin peninsula wind damage occurred throughout island although mostly limited to broken windows trees being uprooted and fences knocked over in addition a house under construction blew over in another house was abandoned in st john s for fear of roof blowing off hydro poles also caught fire in burin and grand banks rough seas caused by storm sunk or damage several fishing dories in grand bank and three fishing premises were washed away in in addition a fishing ramp was washed out to sea in lourdes cove damage in burin peninsula alone totaled to thousands of dollars although exact figure is unknown heavy rainfall also occurred across much of atlantic canada region especially in areas well west of path of storm highest amount of precipitation from storm was reported in quebec where rainfall peaked at in extreme eastern part of province rainfall occurred further north into labrador with precipitation of at least being reported as far north as bay further south in provinces of prince edward island nova scotia and new brunswick rainfall amounts did not exceed no flooding was reported in atlantic canada on offshore french territory of saint pierre and miquelon severe wind damage was also reported on saint pierre several homes
