rhodium is a chemical element with symbol rh and atomic number 45 it is a rare silvery white hard corrosion resistant and chemically inert transition metal it is a noble metal and a member of platinum group it has only one naturally occurring isotope 103rh naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as free metal as an alloy with similar metals and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as and it is one of rarest and most valuable precious metals rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores together with other members of platinum group metals it was discovered in 1803 by william hyde wollaston in one such ore and named for rose color of one of its chlorine compounds element s major use approximately 80 of world rhodium production is as one of catalysts in three way catalytic converters in automobiles because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals and because of its rarity rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high temperature and corrosion resistive coatings white gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium plated for tarnish resistance rhodium is sometimes used to cure silicones a two part silicone where one part contains a silicon hydride and other containing a vinyl terminated silicone are mixed one of these liquids contains a rhodium complex armin fehn and juergen weidinger wacker chemie ag us patent rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux level other uses of rhodium include asymmetric hydrogenation used to form drug precursors and processes for production of acetic acid history thumb upright left william hyde wollaston rhodium greek meaning rose was discovered in 1803 by william hyde wollaston soon after his discovery of palladium he used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from south america his procedure involved dissolving ore in aqua regia and neutralizing acid with sodium hydroxide naoh he then precipitated platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride most other metals like copper lead palladium and rhodium were precipitated with zinc diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium of these palladium dissolved in aqua regia but rhodium did not and rhodium was precipitated by addition of sodium chloride as after being washed with ethanol rose red precipitate was reacted with zinc which displaced rhodium in ionic compound and thereby released rhodium as free metal after discovery rare element had only minor applications for example by turn of century rhodium containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to 1800 oc they have exceptionally good stability in temperature range of 1300 to 1800 v pearce f

reflectance rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide even when heated oxygen is absorbed from atmosphere only at melting point of rhodium but is released on solidification rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum it is not attacked by most acids it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia chemical properties thumb left

mixed with other metals such as palladium silver platinum and gold and there are very few rhodium bearing minerals it is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse principal sources are located in south africa in river sands of ural mountains and in north america including copper nickel sulfide mining area of sudbury ontario region although rhodium abundance at sudbury is very small large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost effective main exporter of rhodium is south africa approximately 80 in 2010 followed by russia annual world production is 30 tonnes price of rhodium is highly variable in 2007 rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold 450 times more than silver and 27 250 times more than copper by weight in 2008 price briefly rose above 10 000 per ounce 350 000 per kilogram economic slowdown of 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below 1 000 per ounce 35 000 per kilogram price rebounded to 2 750 by early 2010 97 000 per kilogram more than twice gold price but in late 2013 prices were less than 1000 political and financial problems led to very low oil prices and oversupply causing most metals to drop in price economies of china india and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015 in 2014 alone 23 722 890 motor vehicles were produced in china excluding motorbikes this resulted in a rhodium price of 740 00 us per troy ounce 31 1 grams in late november 2015 used nuclear fuels rhodium is a fission product of uranium 235 each kilogram of fission product contains a significant amount of lighter platinum group metals used nuclear fuel is therefore a potential source of rhodium but extraction is complex and expensive and presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half lives of longest lived isotope 101rh with a half life of 3 3 years and 102mrh with a half life of 2 9 years or about 10 years these factors make source unattractive and no large scale extraction has been attempted applications primary use of this element is in automobiles as a catalytic converter changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases of 30 000 kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2012 81 24 300 kg went into this application and 8 060 kg was recovered from old converters about 964 kg of rhodium was used in glass industry mostly for production of fiberglass and flat panel glass and 2 520 kg was used in chemical industry catalyst rhodium is preferable to other platinum metals in reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen 2 x rhodium catalysts are used in a number of industrial processes notably in catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by monsanto process it is also used to catalyze addition of to molecular double bonds a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to complex of a rhodium ion with is a widely used chiral catalyst for chiral synthesis as in synthesis of menthol ornamental uses rhodium finds use in jewelry and for decorations it is on white gold and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale after which thin layer wears away with use this is known as rhodium flashing in jewelry business it may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish silver sulfide ag2s produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide h2s solid pure rhodium jewelry is very rare more because of difficulty of fabrication high melting point and poor malleability than because of high price high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an rhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status when more commonly used metals such as silver gold or platinum were deemed insufficient in 1979 guinness book of world records gave paul mccartney a rhodium plated disc for being history s all time best selling songwriter and recording artist other uses rhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving corrosion resistance of platinum and palladium these alloys are used in furnace windings for glass fiber production thermocouple elements electrodes for aircraft spark plugs and laboratory crucibles other uses include electrical contacts where it is valued for small electrical resistance small and stable contact resistance and great corrosion resistance rhodium plated by either electroplating or evaporation is extremely hard and useful for optical instruments filters in mammography systems for characteristic x rays it produces rhodium neutron detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels this method requires a digital filter to determine current neutron flux level generating three separate signals immediate a few seconds delay and a minute delay each with its own signal level all three are combined in rhodium detector signal three palo verde nuclear reactors each have 305 rhodium neutron detectors 61 detectors on each of five vertical levels providing an accurate 3d picture of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to consume nuclear fuel most economically in automobile manufacturing rhodium is also used in construction of headlight reflectors stwertka albert a guide to elements oxford university press 1996 p 125
