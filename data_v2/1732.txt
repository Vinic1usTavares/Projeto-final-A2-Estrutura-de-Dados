they knew little about nintendo 64 s final technical specifications graphics implementation and development kit but were nevertheless interested in console and its improved pixel quality historically treasure developed games exclusively for sega consoles which made mischief makers their first release for a nintendo console bringing mischief makers to nintendo 64 was a hardware based decision nintendo 64 s cartridges were more expensive than cd roms but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for action games such as mischief makers however treasure ceo masato maegawa said that development for nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even sega saturn other than special attention required to build a single boss in 3d team did not use features specific to nintendo 64 hardware treasure s founders had come from konami where they worked on nintendo entertainment system games such as castlevania and contra they found their development environment restrictive and left to try riskier concepts and to singularly focus on making great games in three years between treasure s founding and mischief makers development company released highly regarded games such as gunstar as one of definitive 16 bit action games and dynamite headdy an average of 12 people worked on mischief makers with up to 15 at times though team was different in composition from that of previous treasure titles it included lead programmer and character designer from gunstar heroes treasure s ceo said that company liked to expand into new genres though they primarily work in genres where staff had experience company sought to depart from gunstar heroes shoot em up design and chose to build mischief makers around an original catching gameplay mechanic which became hardest aspect to implement while foreign non japanese aesthetics were popular with other japanese developers treasure s ceo felt company s games did not look particularly foreign and could appeal to japanese audiences game was treasure s first to be published by enix publisher sought out treasure for their reputation in action game genre and had approached treasure several times before nintendo 64 project surfaced upon choosing to make game for nintendo 64 treasure thought it would be a good idea to work with enix and similar to how treasure ended its historic loyalty to sega genesis by developing mischief makers for nintendo enix had just recently ended its historic loyalty to nintendo by signing dragon quest vii of their dragon quest franchise to sony neither square or enix built a special relationship with nintendo specific for mischief makers release though nintendo later served as game s publisher for western markets prior to nintendo proposing to publish game in west enix said it had no plans to release game outside japan when their english localization of japanese game finished ahead of schedule north american release date was advanced two weeks accordingly mischief makers was only game displayed at enix booth at april 1997 tokyo game show it was later demonstrated at 1997 electronic entertainment expo and released in japan on june 27 1997 united states on october 1 and europe and australia on january 15 1998 its japanese title is yuke yuke trouble makers or go go trouble makers near time of game s japanese launch treasure announced that they would continue to develop for nintendo 64 with japan only muteki which was released in september and later introduced to north america as o reception mischief makers received mixed or average reviews according to video game review score aggregator metacritic and a gold hall of fame score of 32 40 from japanese magazine famitsu critics praised game s inventiveness personality variety and boss fights and criticized its brevity low difficulty low replay value sound and harsh introductory learning curve retrospective reviewers disagreed with game s originally poor reception and multiple reviewers noted marina s signature shake shake sound bite as a highlight electronic gaming monthly awarded game their silver award igns matt casamassina said that game compensated for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges he added that game s puzzles require thought unlike those in other action platform games and that game s objectives were not clear until after first few levels casamassina praised game s transparency effects anti aliasing and scaling rotations ign described anticipation for game as tremendous particularly among game s market of younger gamers and 2d fans nintendo power thought that game was best side scroller since super mario world next generation wrote that only diehard 2d platform fans would be interested and did not feel that game lived up to standards set by mario 64 in contrast gamefan said that mischief makers did for 2d what mario 64 did for 3d and suggested that sega should be influenced by game gamesradar retrospectively called mischief makers pure unadulterated awesome and 2d brilliance website summarized game to be about grabbing sad faced aliens shaking them until gems come out and then hurling them at other sad faced aliens zachary miller of nintendo world report asserted game may be console s most bizarre and surreal but gamasutra john harris said that game s premise is only strange to people who have never heard of anime gamefan described game as obviously deeply japanese where old school gameplay and 64 bit visuals finally meet hirokazu of famitsu commended mischief makers gameplay which balanced its poor character design other famitsu reviewers admired treasure s signature robot designs and were puzzled by company s choice to use buttons instead of 3d analog stick nintendo life jamie o neill praised game s characters and disliked controls he compared calina character to role of shadow mario in super mario sunshine o neill wrote that intricate controls were antithesis of a friendly approachable and intuitive platformer because game used every button on controller including directional pad though he felt that players who persevered through difficult controls would find them inventive and unique he added that complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay and though throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from gunstar heroes clanball platforming was unintuitive john harris of gamasutra wrote that game borrowed other elements from gunstar heroes as games were similar in protagonists collectible gems and bosses as game took time to learn and understand o neill left reader to decide whether game was ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius nintendo life o neill thought five world bosses were among treasure s best in particular transforming cerberus alpha boss but found mid level bosses uninteresting peter bartholow of gamespot and electronic gaming monthly reviewers felt similarly sushi x of electronic gaming monthly added that technique of looking for a boss s weak spot was similar to metroid famitsu reviewers praised how game encouraged players to experiment with basic grab throw and shake gameplay they also appreciated cadence of mischief makers short levels o neill nintendo life thought game had great variety in gameplay mechanics from maze puzzles to outrunning lava graphics from bosses that scale back screen to levels with screen rotation and audio from upbeat quirk to scary and added that he was surprised to hear critics speak against unique varied and dramatic sound scott mccall of allgame too appreciated sound from voice to almost indescribable music gamasutra john harris noted its tremendous variety in a track field remake to outrunning a missile rare for 2d platformers and commented that it is obvious that treasure poured their hearts into this game peter bartholow of gamespot summarized mischief makers as a good game that will leave players wanting more he liked bosses which made player use all available skills but felt they were short lived and easily solved in context of a short game with tutorials as one fifth of its levels he did not consider ending extension a suitable reward for returning to levels and predicted that most players would not finish game more than once game informer echoed bartholow s comments about game s brevity and named game s seven event olympics as a highlight sushi x of electronic gaming monthly wrote that game felt incomplete and lamented that a decent player can finish game in under three hours though next generation said game was certainly long enough game s frequent reuse of a small selection of tiles objects sound effects soundtracks and bland backgrounds compared to impressive boss battle animations and effects led gamespot bartholow to suggest that mischief makers was limited by its cartridge space he concluded that decent game would be truly excellent on another medium zachary miller of nintendo world report reported that graphics did not age well into 2010 electronic gaming monthly wrote that game is definitely a sleeper hit as hardcore gamer ryan cartmel put it game went largely unnoticed legacy video game journalists from outlets such as gamesradar and nintendo world report cited mischief makers as ripe for reissue either through nintendo eshop or in a sequel or franchise reboot retro gamer placed masterpiece of mayhem 80th on their list of essential nintendo 64 games for its unbridled quality in 2009 gamesradar called it possibly most underrated and widely ignored game on n64 website wrote that mischief makers was received poorly because players wanted 3d instead of 2d gameplay from nintendo 64 games john harris added that those who gave it a bum rap missed a surprisingly clever game
