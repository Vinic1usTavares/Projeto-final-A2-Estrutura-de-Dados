horizontally scrolling fighting game that represents events of module dragons of despair has also been converted into neverwinter nights computer game format adaptation requires both shadows of undrentide and hordes of underdark expansion packs as well as original game reception steve hampshire reviewed scenario for imagine magazine he enjoyed this module a lot and felt it was well detailed and original and plays well hampshire found it good value his only problem having been reading rather flowery prose without being laughed down by players a review by graham staplehurst in white dwarf magazine issue 60 gave module an 8 out of 10 overall and noted that lack of things such as gold and clerics in adventure world don t destroy feel of scenario whilst creating a very novel atmosphere staplehurst felt that adventure was very much taken off from lord of rings with a powerful magic item to be taken at all costs to aggressor s innermost defences and through them characters will have to get past a nice new race of humanoids as well as a couple of other monster concepts artwork aside from cover is good and usable in adventure another good product in his 1991 book heroic worlds lawrence schick described scenarios as heavy handed in channelling players to follow plot it placed 25th on a 2004 list of 30 greatest d d adventures of all time only dragonlance module to make list
