from spy film ipcress file elliott decided to realise fennell s script through use of what commentator stephen la riviere terms quirky visuals elliott and camera operator alan perry experimented with original camera angles and movements choosing to open one scene with a long tracking shot episode s incidental music is largely recycled from earlier apf productions commentators including media historian nicholas j cull have noted that elliott and perry s cinematography emulates visual style of 1960s james bond films la riviere however suggests that this visual homage is not evident throughout arguing that episode s first half uses more conventional filming techniques 30 minutes after noon was released as an audio play in 1967 and serialised as a comic strip in 1992 plot while

ordeal at creighton ward mansion production director david elliott was unenthusiastic about realising alan fennell s script until he saw spy thriller ipcress file la riviere 2009 p 124 he remembered that film used all old fashioned through a lampshade etc on monday morning paddy seale lighting cameraman came in and said i saw a film this weekend and i said so did i was it ipcress file yep right that s what i want to do la riviere 2009 p 125 in homage to film elliott incorporated what commentator stephen la riviere terms quirky visuals into his direction of episode glen carrick castle scene opens with a tracking shot covering all three walls of puppet set for which elliott co ordinated camera movements with operator alan perry in a pioneering move for a supermarionation series this scene also uses forced perspective to show a human hand and scale marionette puppets in same shot while hand intended to belong to southern a pen in foreground puppets of kenyon and dempsey occupy background a visual illusion ensures that kenyon and dempsey appear correctly scaled in relation to hand even though thunderbirds puppets were only adult human size miniature model representing glen carrick castle was a re use of model of castle mcgregor from stingray episode loch ness monster bentley 2008 p 105 it later appeared as glen garry castle in captain scarlet and mysterons episode trap much of episode s incidental music was originally composed for earlier apf series particularly stingray re used tracks include highland theme from loch ness monster and march of oysters from secret of giant oyster another episode of stingray reception sylvia anderson noted alan fennell s vivid imagination and suggested that 30 minutes after noon was more a vehicle for live action than for limited emotions of our puppet cast according to nathalie of independent episode s plot highlights sense of drama that made thunderbirds popular sure most kids didn t understand workings of a plutonium bomb but fact that show was capable of sustaining their attention as well as that of their older siblings and parents meant they had some idea by end of said episode media historian nicholas j cull links episode to another of fennell s thunderbirds scripts man from mi 5 which features a british secret service agent called for cull 30 minutes after noon is one of several thunderbirds episodes that includes visual homage to james bond films in particular he comments on southern s briefing scene in which characters of southern sir william frazer and an unnamed aide are represented by hats on a hatstand southern s hat is a trilby tossed onto stand in best james bond fashion tom fox of starburst magazine also praises hatstand homage and names robot guards and scottish castle as episode s other highlights he gives 30 minutes after noon a score of 4 out of 5 stephen la riviere author of filmed in supermarionation a history of future acknowledges elliott s decision to use an original visual style but argues that first half of episode is filmed as normal la riviere also comments on editing noting that plot of episode is effectively split into two parts explosion at hudson building followed by southern s infiltration of erdman gang la riviere 2009 p 129 he suggests that this makes 30 minutes after noon similar to earliest episodes of thunderbirds which were originally 25 minutes long and subsequently extended to 50 minutes through addition of secondary rescues and character based subplots a review in news flash describes 30 minutes after noon as a thrilling well paced episode that brings together a very sadistic bad guy scheme and some innocent and some not so innocent victims in peril it describes pacing as especially good and also praises inventive camera work noting i don t think i ve seen more use of real hand acting in any other episode review compares exploding bracelets to premise of saw films in which people are trapped in dangerous situations and threatened with death if they refuse to carry out tasks placed before them adaptations in july 1967 century 21 records released an ep audio adaptation of 30 minutes after noon narrated by david graham as parker
