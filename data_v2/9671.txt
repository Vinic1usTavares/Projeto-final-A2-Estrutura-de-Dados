moorgate tube crash occurred on 28 february 1975 at 8 46 am on london underground s northern city line 43 people died and 74 were injured after a train failed to stop at line s southern terminus moorgate station and crashed into its end wall it is considered worst peacetime accident on london underground no fault was found with train and inquiry by department of environment concluded that accident was caused by actions of leslie newson 56 year old driver crash forced first carriage into roof of tunnel at front and back but middle remained on trackbed coach was crushed to second carriage was at front as it collided with first and third rode over rear of second brakes were not applied and dead man s handle was still depressed when train crashed london fire brigade ambulance service and city of london police attended scene it took 13 hours to remove injured from wreckage many of whom had to be cut free with no services running into adjoining platform to create piston effect pushing air into station ventilation was poor and temperatures in tunnel rose to over it took a further four days to extract last body that of newson his cab normally deep had been crushed to post mortem on newson showed no medical reason to explain crash a cause has never been established and theories include suicide that he may have been distracted or that he was affected by conditions such as transient global amnesia or akinesis with mutism tests showed that newson had a blood alcohol level of 80 mg 100 ml level at which one can be prosecuted for drink driving though alcohol may have been produced by natural decomposition process over four days at a high temperature in aftermath of crash london underground introduced a safety system that automatically stops a train when travelling too fast this became known informally as moorgate protection northern city line services into moorgate ended in october 1975 and british rail services started in august 1976 after a long campaign by relatives of dead two memorials were unveiled in vicinity of station one in july 2013 and one in february 2014 background london underground also known as underground or tube is a public rapid transit system serving london and some parts of adjacent counties of buckinghamshire essex and hertfordshire network opened in 1863 and contained of route track by 1975 that year three million people used service each day tube was one of safest methods of transport in britain in 1975 apart from suicides there were only 14 deaths on underground between 1938 and 1975 12 of which occurred in 1953 stratford crash moorgate station in city of london was terminus at southern end of northern city line five stops and from northern end at drayton park moorgate is an interchange between underground network and suburban overground services station contains ten platforms numbers 7 to 10 are deep level and numbers 9 and 10 are used for northern city line service thumb upright 1 interior of a type of train carriage involved in crash at end of platform 9 in 1975 was a red warning light atop a post situated in front of a sand drag placed to stop over running trains drag was long of which was on tracks in front of platform and was inside an overrun tunnel that was long high and wide tunnel had been designed to accommodate larger main line rolling stock and so was wider than standard tube tunnel width of a buffer which had once been hydraulic but had not been functioning as such for some time prior to crash was at end of tunnel in front of a solid wall approach to moorgate from old street station stop prior to terminus was on a falling gradient of 1 in 150 for before levelling out for to platform 9 a scissors crossover was located just prior to platforms 9 and 10 there was a speed limit of on line and a limit of on entry into moorgate station from november 1966 northern city line ran 1938 rolling stock weekly checks were made on stock s brakes doors and compressors all equipment on train was examined on a six week basis and cars were lifted from their bogies for a thorough examination once a year crash on 28 february 1975 first shift of northern city line service was driven by leslie newson 56 who had worked on london transport since 1969 and been driving on northern city line for previous three months newson was known by his colleagues as a careful and conscientious motorman driver on 28 february he carried a bottle of milk sugar his rule book and a notebook in his work satchel he also had ps270 in his jacket to buy a second hand car for his daughter after work according to staff on duty his behaviour appeared normal before his shift began he had a cup of tea and shared his sugar with a colleague he jokingly said to colleague go easy on it i shall want another cup when i come off duty first return trips of day between drayton park and moorgate which started at 6 40 am passed without incident robert harris 18 year old guard who had started working for london underground in august 1974 was late and joined train when it returned to moorgate at 6 53 am a driver waiting to go on duty took his place until his arrival newson and harris made three further return trips before train undertook its final journey from drayton park at 8 38 am thirty seconds late train carried approximately 300 passengers it was a friday and as it was peak of rush hour most of travellers were commuters as exit from platform 9 was next to overrun tunnel first two carriages were more popular with commuters and more full than remaining four although pupils from nearby city of london school for girls would normally be on service at that time pupils had a day s holiday as school was in use for external examinations journalist sally holloway in her history of crash observes that number of casualties could have been higher if girls had been attending school after train departed old street on its 56 second journey to moorgate harris was bored and left his position at guard s control panel which contained controls for emergency brake at front of rear carriage and walked to back of train to look for a newspaper he did not find one and spent his time reading advertisements on walls at rear of carriage on arrival at moorgate at 8 46 am train which comprised two units of three connected cars did not slow it was still under power and no brakes were applied it passed through station at signalman on duty later reported that train appeared to be accelerating as it passed along platform a passenger waiting to take return journey stated that newson appeared to be staring straight ahead and to be somewhat larger than life tests were later done on trains entering platform 9 at slow speed these showed that because of station lighting it was impossible to clearly see driver s eyes witnesses standing on platform saw newson sitting upright and facing forward his uniform neat and still wearing his hat his hands appeared to be on train s controls as far as they could tell thumb upright 1 5 scale drawing of crash showing size and position of front three carriages before and after impact brakes were not applied and dead man s handle was still depressed when train entered overrun tunnel throwing up sand from drag when driver s cab made impact with hydraulic buffer carriage was separated from its bogie and coachwork was forced into end wall and roof first 15 seats of carriage were crushed into second coach was forced under rear of first which buckled at three points into shape of a v with a tail and had its rear forced into tunnel roof with weight of train piling up behind it front coach was crushed to third car was damaged at both ends more significantly at leading end as it rode over second javier gonzalez a passenger who was travelling in front carriage described moment train crashed just above my newspaper i saw a lady sitting opposite me and then lights went out i have image of her face to this day she died p as darkness came there was a very loud noise of crash metal and glass breaking no screams all in fraction of second one takes to breathe in it was all over in no time forty two passengers and driver died seventy four people were treated in hospital for their injuries it was and remains worst peacetime accident on underground rescue first call to emergency services was received at 8 48 am london ambulance service arrived at 8 54 am and london fire brigade at 8 57 am at around same time city of london police alerted nearby st bartholomew s hospital barts that a tube train had hit buffers but there was no indication at that stage of seriousness of crash a small assessment team comprising a casualty officer and a medical student was sent from hospital 15 minutes later a resuscitation unit was sent although hospital staff were still unaware of scale of problem city of london police also contacted medical unit of bp at britannic house finsbury circus dr donald dean and a team of two doctors and two nurses walked around to station to assist and were first medical assistance at scene after assessing situation dean realised that he did not have enough painkillers with him or in bp stores so he went to moorgate branch of boots where pharmacist gave him shop s entire supply of morphine and pethidine fire brigade undertook a brief inspection of site and once they saw what they were dealing with status was updated to a major accident event additional ambulances and fire tenders were soon sent one of doctors from barts later described scene thumb rear of first carriage forced into roof of tunnel after second carriage had been removed front carriage was an indescribable tangle of twisted metal and in it living and dead were heaped together intertwined among themselves and wreckage p it was impossible to estimate number of casualties involved with any degree of accuracy because lighting was poor victims were all tangled together and everything was covered with a thick layer of black dust many of victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for individual attention it was obvious from an early stage that main problem was disentanglement of a heap of people many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation by around 9 00 am last casualty had been removed from third carriage by 9 30 am moorgate and many of surrounding roads had been cordoned off to allow space for co ordination teams above ground to manage flow of vehicles particularly for ambulances taking casualties to hospitals a message was sent from london fire brigade headquarters to all fire stations in london it estimated that there were still 50 people trapped and warned that this incident will be protracted to make a clear passage through wreckage for equipment emergency services and injured commuters a circular route was organised through carriages firemen cut holes in parts of structure including in floors and ceilings of carriages through which it was possible to move even if it meant crawling through some areas at 10 00 am a medical team arrived from london hospital and set up a makeshift operating theatre on a platform near triage team platform 9 was underground and fire and ambulance crews had to carry all equipment they needed through station and down to scene of accident depth at which they were operating and shielding effect of soil and concrete meant their radios could not get through to surface messages and requests for further supplies were passed by runners which led to mistakes one doctor requested further supplies of pain killing gas but by time request reached surface it had been garbled to doctor wants an empty box fire brigade deployed a small team with figaro an experimental radio system that worked in deep locations working conditions for emergency services became increasingly difficult throughout day crash had thrown soot and dirt into air from sand drag and from between two metal layers of tube carriages everything was covered with a thick layer of residue which was easily disturbed lamps and cutting gear used by fire brigade raised temperature to over and oxygen levels began to drop in deep lines at moorgate ventilation is created by piston effect created by trains forcing air through tube lines with services stopped since crash no fresh air was reaching platforms 9 and 10 a large electric fan was placed at top of escalators in an attempt to remedy situation but soot and dirt was disturbed and little draught was created machine was soon turned off by 12 00 noon only five live casualties were left to be extracted by 3 15 pm only two were left margaret liles a 19 year old woman police constable wpc and jeff benton who worked at london stock exchange they were in front part of first carriage at time of crash and ended up trapped together pinned down under girders of carriage s structure fire brigade worked for several hours to release benton but it became apparent that liles needed to be removed first which could only be done by amputating her left foot she was finally removed from wreckage after procedure at 8 55 pm benton was removed at 10 00 pm as soon as benton had been removed all equipment was turned off and silence was ordered among emergency services shouts were made to listen for any people trapped to respond there were none and site medical officer declared that all remaining bodies in wreckage were dead during day mouth to mouth resuscitation had been needed to save two people and two victims died of crush syndrome soon after being released from wreckage benton also died of crush syndrome in hospital on 27 march 1975 despite initially good progress aftermath clearing up work on removing bodies and clearing wreckage from tunnel began after last casualty had been removed with no casualties remaining fire brigade were able to use flame cutting equipment after third carriage was cut free from second at 1 00 am on 1 march third carriage began to be winched back down track as it began moving a body that no one had seen fell from wreckage and onto track according to joseph milner chief fire officer of london fire brigade body gave first indication of how protracted would be work ahead once carriage had been removed a doctor again checked for further signs of living casualties none were found thumb upright motorman s cab of 1938 rolling stock dead man s handle is larger control on right use of flame cutting equipment had a detrimental effect on atmosphere on platform oxygen levels dropped from norm of 21 per cent to 16 per cent and smell of decomposition from bodies trapped in wreckage was noticed by workers those working on platform or tunnel were restricted to 20 minute spells working followed by 40 minutes recovery time on surface all workers had to wear gloves and masks any cuts had to be reported and no one with a cut was allowed to be involved in extrication of a body temperatures improved after a company donated an air conditioning unit which was installed at ground level and air piped down into tunnel during 1 and 2 march wreckage of second carriage was cut away in sections and winched free clearance of carriages continued round clock until a break was forced by a telephoned bomb scare at 10 00 pm on 2 march which forced crews to evacuate station last passenger was removed from front carriage at 3 20 pm on 4 march which left only driver s body gordon hafter london underground s chief engineer and lieutenant colonel ian mcnaughton chief inspecting officer of railways examined driver s cab normally deep it had been crushed to they ascertained that newson was at his controls although his head had been forced through front window hafter reported his examination about newson to subsequent inquiry his left hand was close to but not actually on driver s brake handle and his right arm was hanging down to right of main controller his head was to left of dead man s handle which had been forced upwards beyond its normal travel and was resting on his right shoulder newson s body was removed at 8 05 pm on 4 march fire brigade cleared remainder of wreckage by 5 00 am on 5 march and handed control of platform back to london underground rescue and clean up operation involved efforts of 1 324 firemen 240 policemen 80 ambulance men 16 doctors and several nurses services on line had been suspended on day of crash a shuttle service between drayton park and old street was used from 1 march 1975 until normal traffic returned on 10 march investigation and inquiry thumb upright keith simpson who performed post mortem on motorman newson post mortem was undertaken on newson by home office pathologist keith simpson on 4 march 1975 he found no physical conditions such as a stroke or heart attack that would have explained crash initial findings showed no drugs or alcohol in newson s bloodstream and there was no evidence of liver damage from heavy drinking on 7 march 1975 anthony crosland secretary of state for environment instructed mcnaughton to undertake an investigation of crash mcnaughton s inquiry began on 13 march and was paused after a day and a half during that time it was established that mechanics of train were in working order and that there were no known problems with newson s health although results of pathological tests were still awaited mcnaughton said he was perplexed as to causes of crash but that he would proceed with next part of his inquiry which was to undertake further enquiries and to consider measures so accident could not be repeated coroner s inquest was between 14 and 18 april 1975 david paul coroner was unhappy that a government inquiry had already begun as evidence was in public domain and could affect inquest s jury sixty one witnesses gave evidence an analysis of newson s kidneys by toxicologist dr anne robinson showed his blood alcohol level at time of post mortem was 80 mg 100 ml robinson stated that there were several biological processes that produced alcohol in body after death and it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was result of consumption of alcohol or a product of process of decomposition she added there are so many unknown factors here that it is difficult to be precise and definite one has to make a number of assumptions although she stated that it was likely that he had been drinking 80 mg 100 ml was and as at 2018 still is legal limit in england for driving it was highest reading of four samples taken from newson s body lowest was 20 mg 100 ml newson s widow stated that her husband drank spirits only rarely david paul agreed that it was out of character with all he had heard and agreed that further tests could be run on newson s samples on final day of inquiry dr roy goulding a specialist in forensic examination of poisons stated that while he reached same results of 80 mg 100 ml his conclusions differed from robinson s goulding stated that as alcohol was naturally produced in blood after death it was not possible to confirm that newson had been drinking prior to crash several of newson s colleagues reported that they had no suspicions that newson had been drinking and that his behaviour on morning of crash was normal david paul asked simpson to comment on findings relating to alcohol levels he informed coroner that it is generally accepted that as much as 80 mg may make its appearance in a decomposing body after four days in a relatively high temperature jury returned verdicts of accidental death on 19 march a memorial service was held at st paul s cathedral london attended by 2 000 mourners including representatives of emergency services and newson s widow and family mcnaughton published his report almost a year later on 4 march 1976 he wrote that tests showed no equipment fault on train and that dead man s handle had no defect from x rays it was clear that at moment of crash newson s hand was on dead man s handle there were no electrical burns on his skin or clothing to indicate an electrical fault mcnaughton observed that because of guard harris s lack of experience he could not have taken any action to stop accident from happening although he thought young man displayed himself as idle and undisciplined he concluded that accident was solely due to a lapse on part of driver motorman newson given inquest findings relating to alcohol in newson s bloodstream mcnaughton examined possibility that newson was drunk he received expert advice that even if newson had drunk sufficient alcohol to achieve a blood alcohol level of 80 mg 100 ml it would not account for crash mcnaughton also examined possibility of suicide by newson but considered it unlikely given other indications including newson s plans for purchasing a car later in day and that he had driven route without error for preceding 2 hours mcnaughton investigated possibility that newson may have been daydreaming or distracted to point that he did not realise train was entering moorgate mcnaughton concluded that as train went over scissor crossing before platform it would have brought driver to his senses it was also likely that newson would have realised his circumstances before train hit wall and would have thrown his hands up in front of his face in a reflex action medical evidence presented to inquiry raised possibility that driver had been affected by conditions such as transient global amnesia or akinesis with mutism where brain continues to function and individual remains aware although not being able to move physically there was no evidence to indicate either condition to positively diagnose akinesis with mutism would depend on a microscopic examination of brain which was not possible because of decomposition and transient global amnesia leaves no traces mcnaughton s report found that there was insufficient evidence to say if accident was due to a deliberate act or a medical condition i must conclude therefore that cause of this accident lay entirely in behaviour of motorman newson during final minute before accident occurred whether his behaviour was deliberate or whether it was result of a suddenly arising physical condition not revealed as a result of post mortem examination there is not sufficient evidence to examine but i am satisfied that no part of responsibility for accident rests with any other person and that there was no fault or condition of train track or signalling that in any way contributed to it legacy london underground services into moorgate on northern city line had previously been scheduled to be replaced by british rail services from welwyn garden city and hertford accident did not change plan last london underground services on northern city line ran into moorgate on 4 october 1975 and british rail services started in august 1976 having previously terminated at broad street station when platform 9 reopened there had been changes introduced to aid drivers back wall of tunnel was painted white and a large heavy duty buffer preceded sand drag shortly after crash london underground imposed a speed limit of for all trains entering terminal platforms operating instructions were changed so that protecting signal at terminal platforms was held at danger until trains approaching were travelling slowly or had been brought to a stop although this caused delays and operating problems moorgate protection thumb train stop equipment since death of a driver in 1971 when an empty stock train crashed into buffers in a tunnel siding near tooting broadway london underground had been introducing speed controls at such locations by time of moorgate crash 12 of 19 locations had equipment installed in july 1978 approval was given for moorgate protection moorgate control or trains entering terminal stations tets to be introduced at all dead end termini on manually driven lines on underground system at moorgate s platform 9 three timed train stops were installed first at scissors crossing second at start of platform and third halfway down platform if train passes any of these at more than emergency brake is applied resistors were placed in traction supply of trains to prevent a train accelerating when entering platform although value of these resistors had to be changed after installation relays switch resistors out when train is permitted to leave system was operational in all locations by 1984 memorials in south west corner of finsbury square north of moorgate station a memorial lists those who died measuring it was unveiled in july 2013 after a long campaign by relatives of victims and supporters on 28 february 2014 a memorial plaque was unveiled by fiona woolf lord mayor of london on side of station building in moor place in media in 1977 bbc one programme red alert examined whether an accident like moorgate could happen again writer laurence marks whose father died in disaster presented me my dad and moorgate a channel 4 documentary broadcast on 4 june 2006 he stated that he believed crash was due to suicide by newson in 2009 bbc radio 4
