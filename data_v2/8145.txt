advised and managed by infrared capital partners limited and equitix investment management limited early history a high speed rail line lgv nord has been in operation between channel tunnel and outskirts of paris since tunnel s opening in 1994 this has enabled eurostar rail services to travel at for this part of their journey a similar high speed line in belgium from french border to brussels hsl 1 opened in 1997 in britain eurostar trains had to run at a maximum of on existing tracks between london waterloo and channel tunnel these tracks were shared with local traffic limiting number of services that could be run and jeopardising reliability case for a high speed line similar to continental part of route was recognised by policymakers and construction of line was authorised by parliament with channel tunnel rail link act 1996 which was amended by channel tunnel rail link supplementary provisions act 2008 an early plan conceived by british rail in early 1970s for a route passing through tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds especially from leigh action group and surrey kent action on rail skar a committee was set up to examine proposal under sir alexander cairncross but in due course environment minister anthony crosland announced that project had been cancelled hansard 20 january 1975 together with plan for tunnel itself next plan for channel tunnel rail link involved a tunnel reaching london from south east and an underground terminus in vicinity of king s cross station a late change in plans principally driven by then deputy prime minister michael heseltine s desire for urban regeneration in east london led to a change of route with new line approaching london from east this opened possibility of reusing underused st pancras station as terminus with access via north london line that crosses throat of station idea of using north london line proved illusory and it was rejected in 1994 by then transport secretary john macgregor as too difficult to construct and environmentally damaging idea of using st pancras station as core of new terminus was retained albeit now linked by of specially built tunnels to dagenham via stratford london continental railways lcr was chosen by uk government in 1996 to build line and to reconstruct st pancras station as its terminus and to take over british share of eurostar operation eurostar uk original lcr consortium members were national express virgin group s g warburg co bechtel and london electric while project was under development by british rail it was managed by union railways which became a wholly owned subsidiary of lcr on 14 november 2006 lcr adopted high speed 1 as brand name for completed railway official legislation documentation and line side signage have continued to refer to ctrl project as 1987 channel tunnel act made government funding for a channel tunnel rail link unlawful construction did not take place as it was not financially viable construction was delayed until passage of channel tunnel rail link act 1996 which provided construction powers that ran for following 10 years chief executive of time rob holden stated that it was largest land acquisition programme since second world war whole route was to have been built as a single project but in 1998 serious financial difficulties arose and extensive changes came with a british government rescue plan to reduce risk line was split into two separate phases to be managed by union railways south and union railways north a recovery programme was agreed whereby lcr sold government backed bonds worth ps1 6 billion to pay for construction of section 1 with future of section 2 still not settled original intention had been for new railway once completed to be run by union railways as a separate line from rest of british railway network as part of 1998 rescue it was agreed that following completion section 1 would be purchased by railtrack with an option to purchase section 2 in return railtrack was committed to operate whole route as well as st pancras railway station which unlike all other former british rail stations had been transferred to lcr union railways in 1996 in 2001 railtrack announced that due to its own financial problems it would not undertake to purchase section 2 triggering a second restructuring 2002 plan agreed that two sections would have different owners railtrack for section 1 lcr for section 2 but with common railtrack management following further financial problems at railtrack its interest was sold back to lcr which then sold operating rights for completed line to network rail railtrack s successor under this arrangement lcr became sole owner of both sections of ctrl and st pancras property as per original 1996 plan amendments were made in 2001 for new station at stratford international and connections to west coast main line as a consequence of restructuring in 2006 lcr consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms arup bechtel halcrow and systra which form rail link engineering rle transport operators national express and sncf which operates eurostar uk share of eurostar service with national railway company of belgium and british airways electricity company edf and ubs investment bank on completion of section 1 by rle line was handed over to union railways

handed it over to lcsp entire line including st pancras is managed operated and maintained by network rail ctrl in february 2006 there were rumours that a third party believed to be a consortium headed by banker sir adrian montague had expressed an interest in buying out present partners in project lcr shareholders rejected proposal and government which effectively could overrule shareholders decisions as a result of lcr s reclassification as a state owned body decided that discussions with shareholders would not take place imminently effectively backing shareholders views on proposed takeover by may 2009 lcr had become insolvent and government received agreement to use state aid to purchase line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from eurostar lcr s hitherto wholly owned subsidiary hs1 ltd thus became property of secretary of state for transport on 12 october 2009 a proposal was announced to sell ps16 billion of state assets

programme was launched to tackle problem behaviour during construction unlike most lgv stations in france through tracks for ashford international station are off to one side rather than going through
