oryzomys couesi also known as coues rice rat is a semiaquatic rodent in family cricetidae occurring from southernmost texas through mexico and central america into northwestern colombia it is usually found in wet habitats such as marshes but also lives in drier forests and shrublands weighing about o couesi is a medium sized to large rat coarse fur is buff to reddish above and white to buff below hindfeet show some specializations for life in water such as reduced ungual tufts of hair around digits it has 56 chromosomes there is much geographic variation in size proportions color and skull features oryzomys couesi is active during night and builds nests of vegetation that are suspended among reeds about above ground it is an excellent swimmer and dives well but can also climb in vegetation an omnivore it eats both plant and animal food including seeds and insects it breeds throughout year females give birth to about four young after a pregnancy of 21 to 28 days species may be infected by several different parasites and by two hantaviruses species was first described in 1877 first of many related species from region described until 1910s in 1918 edward alphonso goldman consolidated most into single species oryzomys couesi and in 1960 raymond hall united this taxon with its united states relative marsh rice rat o palustris into a single widespread species subsequently many related localized species retained by goldman were also included in this taxon after studies of contact zone in texas where o couesi and marsh rice rat meet were published in 1979 and underscored distinctness of two they were again regarded as separate since then some of peripheral forms of group such as oryzomys antillarum from jamaica and oryzomys peninsulae from baja california peninsula have been reinstated as species nevertheless o couesi as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species a 2010 study using dna sequence data found evidence to recognize separate species from pacific and eastern sides of distribution of o couesi and two additional species from panama and costa rica generally oryzomys couesi is common and of no conservation concern and it is even considered a plague species in places but some populations are threatened taxonomy oryzomys couesi and at least six more narrowly distributed species with peripheral distributions together form o couesi group within genus oryzomys eighth species of genus marsh rice rat o palustris is only member of its own and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 117 unless western populations are classified as a separate species o texensis hanson et al 2010 p 342 oryzomys previously included many other species which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by marcelo weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from genus weksler et al 2006 table 1 all are placed in tribe oryzomyini rice rats a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species weksler 2006 p 3 and on higher taxonomic levels in subfamily sigmodontinae of family cricetidae along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents musser and carleton 2005 history edward alston first described oryzomys couesi in 1877 using three specimens from mexico and guatemala alston 1877 p 756 he named animal hesperomys couesi placing it in now defunct genus hesperomys and noted similarities to marsh rice rat then called hesperomys palustris and two species now placed in tylomys alston 1877 pp 756 757 musser and carleton 2005 p 1189 for placement in tylomys specific name couesi honors american naturalist elliott coues who had done much work on north american rodents in 1893 oldfield thomas wrote that species by then placed in genus oryzomys as oryzomys couesi had caused much confusion about its identity because three specimens one from coban guatemala and two from mexico used by alston in fact belonged to two or three different species he restricted name couesi to animal from guatemala and introduced new name oryzomys fulgens for one of mexican animals thomas 1893 p 403 several other related species were described from early 1890s onwards and in 1901 clinton hart merriam united many of those into a palustris mexicanus group of species which also included marsh rice rat merriam 1901b p 275 edward alphonso goldman revised north american oryzomys in 1918 and consolidated many forms into a single species oryzomys couesi with ten subspecies distributed from southern texas and western mexico south to costa rica he placed it in an oryzomys palustris group with marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions which he regarded as related to o couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species goldman 1918 pp 16 28 29 in 1930s a few more forms related to o couesi were described as then recognized ranges of marsh rice rat a united states species and oryzomys couesi meet in southern texas in 1960 raymond hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate two species thus he reduced o couesi to a subspecies of marsh rice rat hall 1960 pp 172 173 other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species goldman had placed in o palustris group were classified under marsh rice rat together with oryzomys azuerensis from panama described as a species in 1937

regarded as a species distinct from marsh rice rat musser and carleton 2005 p 1147 afterward some of other forms synonymized under o couesi or o palustris were resurrected as separate species oryzomys

carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 94 still o couesi included 22 synonyms carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 116 and carleton and arroyo cabrales wrote that further research on o couesi and related species would certainly result in recognition of additional species carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 107 a 2010 study by delton hanson and colleagues used dna sequence data from mitochondrial gene cytochrome b cytb and two nuclear markers 1 of retinoid binding protein gene rbp3 and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 adh1 i2 to study relationships among populations of marsh rice rat and o couesi hanson et al 2010 p 337 cytb data placed all studied specimens of o couesi in a clade sister to marsh rice rat mean genetic distance between two groups was 11 30 much larger than distance between sister species in related genera melanomys and nectomys 7 48 and 7 52 respectively within o couesi clade two populations from panama and costa rica were successively basal to other specimens which fell into two large subclades one containing animals from pacific seaboard from western mexico to el salvador and other containing rats from eastern seaboard from texas to nicaragua panamanian and costa rican populations differed by 6 53 to 11 93 from others and western and eastern subclades differed by 4 41 on average hanson et al 2010 figs 1 2 table 1 data from both of slower evolving nuclear markers rbp3 and adh1 i2 also placed examples of oryzomys in two main clades but did not recover western and eastern groups of o couesi as separate clades in addition adh1 i2 placed costa

four groups they found within o couesi should be recognized as distinct species if this suggestion is followed eastern subclade would retain name oryzomys couesi western group would be named oryzomys

oryzomys species o albiventer o peninsulae and o nelsoni which are larger and different in some proportions and details of coloration carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 pp 118 121 122 joel asaph allen first described oryzomys mexicanus as a full species in 1897 from specimens from jalisco in same publication he also described oryzomys bulleri from nearby nayarit but he did not compare two with each other merriam added a second species from nayarit oryzomys rufus in 1901 noting that it was smaller and more reddish than mexicanus goldman synonymized three as o couesi mexicanus in 1918 and in 2009 carleton and arroyo cabrales concurred arguing that differences between rufus and mexicanus were age related and within normal range of variation of animal carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 pp 118 120 goldman 1918 p 34 another subspecies oryzomys couesi lambi was described by burt in 1934 from central coastal sonora which extended range of species by at time this form is dark gray brown much darker than mexicanus and has a shorter tail and weaker jugals burt 1934 p 108 carleton and arroyo cabrales wrote that it is similar to mexicanus but that further research is needed to determine whether it should be recognized as a subspecies large o couesi from northern sinaloa may also belong to this form carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 120 goldman wrote that mexicanus was very similar to nominate couesi but usually with paler fur upperparts are more buffy than in couesi and underparts are usually white but may be buffy normal color in couesi goldman 1918 p 34 oryzomys zygomaticus was first described by merriam in 1901 as a separate species similar to mexicanus but with zygomatic arches broadly spreading and curved downward goldman who reduced it to a subspecies of couesi recorded it from southwestern guatemala and nearby chiapas and described it as slightly paler than o c couesi but darker than o c mexicanus goldman 1918 p 33 three specimens from central el salvador have cytb

albiventer as a separate species from lowland mexicanus on basis of clear morphometric and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 118 and offered some comments on status of crinitus regillus and aztecus including holotypes of three forms in their morphometric analyses holotypes of regillus and aztecus were at upper end of range of variation in their large series of mexicanus from western lowlands and crinitus clustered with specimens of o peninsulae from tip of baja california peninsula they suggested that regillus and aztecus may represent no more than robust upland populations of mexicanus but could not exclude possibility that they represent a different species that crinitus which occurs at over altitude in valley of mexico was same species as peninsulae from lowlands of baja california peninsula they could not accept and they recommended further research to determine relationships of crinitus carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 113 a specimen from inland michoacan has cytb data characteristic

bright reddish long tailed species with a broad skull with widely spreading zygomatic arches thomas 1893 p 404 goldman wrote that it was similar to crinitus but more intensely colored and differed in form of interorbital region he retained it as a separate species pending further investigations goldman 1918 p 282 carleton and arroyo cabrales noted that archival research may yet uncover precise

from veraguas province it is a brown form lacking reddish tones of nearby populations and has a broad skull with a short rostrum front part and ridges on interorbital region like those of gatunensis bole 1937 p 166 although goldman recommended to him that gatunensis and azuerensis both be treated as subspecies of couesi bole described azuerensis as a species because it did not seem intermediate between geographically closest forms gatunensis and couesi and was separated by a large gap from nearest known populations of o couesi in northwestern costa rica and southeastern nicaragua bole 1937 p 167 in a 1966 review of panamanian mammals charles handley reduced both gatunensis and azuerensis to subspecies of marsh rice rat in which o couesi was included at time handley 1966 p 781 and when o couesi was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it specimens from near type locality of azuerensis differ by about 7 in their cytb sequences from other o couesi which suggests that they may represent a separate species however hanson and colleagues did not reinstate azuerensis as a species because they could not examine samples of gatunensis oryzomys couesi was first reported

woodman and croft 2005 table 4 dalquest and roth 1970 pp 220 226 it is common in watery habitats such as marshes and small streams but also occurs in forests and shrublands with sufficient cover reid 2009 p 207 hall and dalquest 1963 p 287 in addition it is found in sugarcane and rice fields in texas it occurs in marsh vegetation along resacas oxbow lakes schmidly and davis 2004 p 381 benson and gehlbach 1979 p 228 and in veracruz it has even been found on dry coastal plain among shrubs it occurs from altitude down to sea level on cozumel proportion of juveniles and females is higher near roads that function as habitat edges fuentes montemayor et al 2009 p 865 cozumel rice rats rarely cross roads which may isolate subpopulations on island vega et al 2004 p 217 oryzomys couesi lives on ground and is semiaquatic spending much time in water as alston in his original description already recognized alston 1877 p 757 but is also a good climber murie 1935 p 26 reid 2009 p 207 a study in costa rica found that o couesi is an excellent swimmer diving well and using its tail to propel itself it is probably able to forage underwater which may help differentiate its niche from that of ecologically similar cotton rat sigmodon hirsutus which also swims well but does not dive cook et al 2001 when disturbed o couesi will enter water and swim away it is primarily active during night hall and dalquest 1963 p 287 oryzomys couesi builds globular nests of woven vegetation suspended among reeds about above water or ground benson and gehlbach 1979 p 227 reid 2009 p 207 schmidly and davis 2004 p 281 in texas larger individuals make larger nests benson and gehlbach 1979 p 227 it does not usually make its own runways in vegetation but may use those of other rodents such as cotton rats population densities range from 5 to 30 per ha 2 to 12 per acre on cozumel density is around 14 5 to 16 5 per ha 5 9 to 6 7 per acre but shows large seasonal variation vega et al 2004 p 218 in western mexico one study found densities of 3 per ha 1 2 per acre in cloud forest and 1 per ha 0 4 per acre in a disturbed area vazquez et al 2000 table 1 in 24 hours male texas o couesi move up to and females up to benson and gehlbach 1979 p 226 diet includes both plant material including seeds and green parts and animals including small fish crustaceans snails insects like ants and beetles and other invertebrates medellin and medellin 2006 p 710 reid 2006 p 303 2009 p 207 it probably breeds around year and after a pregnancy of 21 to 28 days medellin and medellin 2006 p 710 female produces litters of two to seven young with an average of 3 8 according to reid s mammals of central america southeast mexico in 28 pregnant females from nicaragua litter size varied from one to eight averaging 4 4 young become reproductively active when seven weeks old and life cycle is short introduced snake boa constrictor preys on o couesi on cozumel parasites recorded on o couesi in veracruz include unidentified ticks mites fleas and fly larvae hall and dalquest 1963 p 288 flea was found on an oryzomys couesi from cozumel eckerlin 2005 p 155 out of ten o couesi in san luis potosi five each were infected by nematode worms and h with about 25 worms per rat and two were infected by one or two cestodes of genus underwood et al 1986 mites and have been found on oryzomys couesi in oaxaca

estebanes gonzalez et al 2011 table 1 and eimeria in mexico barnard et al 1971 p 1294 species is infected by two hantaviruses catacamas virus in honduras and playa de oro virus in western mexico which are related to bayou virus infecting marsh rice rat a common cause of hantavirus infections in united states no hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to o couesi hantaviruses however chu et al 2008 milazzo et al 2006 chiapas o couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses including venezuelan equine encephalitis virus suggesting that species may serve as a reservoir for that virus et al 2009 p 519 2010 p 350 conservation status iucn lists oryzomys couesi as least concern because it is a widely distributed common species with broad habitat tolerance that occurs in many protected areas habitat destruction such as drainage of wetlands may threaten some populations in many areas it is so common that it is considered a plague species populations even persist in valley of mexico as evidenced by a photograph published in 2006 medellin and medellin 2006 p 710 carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 113 however it is listed as threatened in texas where its distribution is very limited because of habitat loss schmidly and davis 2004 p 381 in 1979 benson and gehlbach estimated size of texas population to be about 15 000 benson and gehlbach 1979 p 228 a 2001 study predicted that climate change would drive texas population to extinction because no suitable habitats would continue to exist cameron and scheel 2001 p 676 cozumel population has declined
