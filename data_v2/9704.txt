of dark defender comic book writer dan wickline was also at rodriguez s studio and so schlattmann arranged for two to have cameo appearances in episode episode was filmed in los angeles california

is a children s writer debra realizes that ice princess is a children s book when dexter returns to miami and visits rita gail suspecting that he is hiding something announces that she will be living with rita from now on dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets so he begins by cleaning his boat that night with a black light to detect any blood he is unaware that marina is being videotaped by miami metro pd who believe that bay harbor butcher may be keeping his boat at that marina production schlattmann thought to write comic book store homicide storyline when he picked up aquaman snow globe in his office and thought wow this thing could easily be a murder weapon because of its weight and its edge writers wanted to use actual aquaman globe but dc comics would not allow character and snow globe to be used in episode so dexter art department custom made a snow globe superhero s name ultimately became mariner as other names including sea king and king of seas could not be used for legal reasons trademark and copyright clearances was again an issue when finding a name for superhero based on bay harbor butcher and judge justice were considered but final choice was dark defender cerone said that name was a little on generic side but it was one we could clear he said that dark defender was in part an homage to batman dark knight returns and to dexter s dark passenger featured in jeff lindsay s series of dexter novels on which television series is based on poster dark defender though hooded was drawn with a smile to resemble michael c hall poster was rendered by comic artist tone rodriguez with whom schlattmann had previously worked on a screenplay in development at 20th century fox when schlattmann visited rodriguez s studio in los angeles to discuss art comic book writer dan wickline was also there schlattmann thought that by including two of them we could make things a bit more special and add some credibility to show wickline played dead comic book shopkeeper while rodriguez played prime suspect for murder dark defender character also lent its name to a series of highly stylized dexter webisodes recapping dexter s victims of second season scenes at marina where dexter keeps his boat coral cove were filmed at leeward bay marina in los angeles wilmington neighborhood in spite of show s miami setting episode opens in a coffee bar at coral cove marina which was filmed at leeward bay s floating diner chowder barge one of empty barns at long beach california s shoreline village was set up as comic book store doakes and laguerta discuss homicide case while standing on shoreline village boardwalk and village car park was used to film doakes and laguerta s stake out reception eric goldman of ign called dark defender a very satisfying episode of show and thought that so far cast and crew are doing a very good job of replicating tension seen in first season he was impressed by dexter s discoveries about his birth mother and adoptive father but called debra s romance with gabriel a less successful storyline writing for los angeles times tom o neil called episode a standout because of parts of dexter s past that it explored he stated that for regular viewers this episode is a real knockout but for unfamiliar viewers this whole dark defender bit might look pretty corny tv squad s keith mcduffee believed revelation of laura s affair with harry to be certainly most shocking moment of episode and thought that one of brilliant moments of season so far was dexter going after one of his mom s killers paula paige of tv guide called dexter s monologue about his hollowness very moving she thought that his confrontation with his mother s killer may have been one of best shot scenes in whole series blogcritics ray ellis praised razor sharp sense of humor seen in episode and thought that in a season of mostly dreary bland series dexter remains most daring show on television dexter and jimenez s confrontation was named hall s best scene by variety critic stuart levine in a short recap of seasons 1 and 2 in film quarterly j m lecturer in fiction at stanford university s creative writing program called dark defender season 2 s most intriguing episode and compared dexter to batman when identities of butcher s victims are revealed to be murderers public applauds him elevating dexter to status of a folktale avenger or comic book anti hero and indeed rita him for disappearing at night like clark fucking kent but fbi describes butcher as more like one s own personal batman batman is an apt comparison although dexter prefers to violate batman s aversion to killing both live outside law part human part mutant as dexter puts it both cling to an ethos riddled with perplexities and contradictions visiting a comic book shop dexter find himself transformed on a handmade superhero poster from butcher into dark defender a protector of city and executioner of its predators vigilantes simultaneously share territory with cops and outlaws they break law in hopes of helping society dexter describes being half sick with thrill complete wrongness when dark passenger inside him takes command schlattmann was
