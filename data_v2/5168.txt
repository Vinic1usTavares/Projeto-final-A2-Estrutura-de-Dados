fulvous whistling duck or fulvous tree duck dendrocygna bicolor is a species of whistling duck that breeds across world s tropical regions in much of mexico and south america west indies southern united states sub saharan africa and indian subcontinent it has plumage that is mainly reddish brown long legs and a long grey bill and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight like other members of its ancient lineage it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on ground its preferred habitat consists of wetlands with plentiful vegetation including shallow lakes and paddy fields nest built from plant material and unlined is placed among dense vegetation or in a tree hole typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs breeding adults which pair for life take turns to incubate and eggs hatch in 24 29 days downy grey ducklings leave nest within a day or so of hatching but parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night on seeds and other parts of plants it is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation and is also shot for food in parts of its range despite hunting poisoning by pesticides and natural predation by mammals birds and reptiles large numbers and huge range of this duck mean that it is classified as least concern by international union for conservation of nature taxonomy whistling ducks dendrocygna are a distinctive group of eight bird species within duck goose and swan family anatidae which are characterised by a hump backed long necked appearance and whistled flight calls that give them their english name madge burn 1988 p 124 they were an early split from main duck lineage feduccia 1999 p 219 and were predominant in late miocene before subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in pliocene and later fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with wandering whistling duck it has no recognised subspecies although birds in northern mexico and southern us have in past been assigned to d b described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than d b bicolor duck was first described by johann friedrich gmelin in 1789 and given name anas fulva but name was preoccupied or already used by friedrich christian in 1787 for another species this led to next available name proposed by french ornithologist louis jean pierre vieillot in 1816 from a paraguayan specimen as anas bicolor vieillot 1816 pp 136 137 whistling ducks were moved to their current genus dendrocygna by british ornithologist william john swainson in recognition of their differences from other ducks swainson 1837 p 365 genus name is derived from ancient greek tree and latin cygnus swan jobling 2010 pp 128 133 and bicolor is latin for two coloured jobling 2010 p 72 fulvous means reddish yellow and is derived from latin equivalent fulvus old and regional names include large whistling teal brown tree duck mexican duck and spanish cavalier description fulvous whistling duck is long male weighs and female averages marginally lighter at it is a long legged duck mainly golden brown with a darker back and an obvious blackish line down back of its neck it has whitish stripes on its flanks a long grey bill and grey legs in flight wings are brown above and black below with no white markings and a white crescent on rump contrasts with black tail barlow et al 1997 p 135 hilty 2003 p 195 all plumages are fairly similar but female is slightly smaller and duller plumaged than male juvenile has paler underparts and appears generally duller especially on flanks there is a complete wing moult after breeding and birds then seek cover of dense wetland vegetation while they are flightless body feathers may be moulted throughout year each feather is replaced only once annually kear 2005 pp 199 202 these are noisy birds with a clear whistling kee wee ooo call given on ground or in flight quarrelling birds also have a harsh repeated kee in flight beating wings produce a dull sound calls of males and females show differences in structure and an acoustic analysis on 59 captive birds demonstrated 100 accuracy in sexing when compared with molecular methods adult birds in asia can be confused with similar lesser whistling duck which is smaller has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down back of neck juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks but crown colour is still a distinction juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to head in south america and africa juvenile white faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns barred flanks and chestnut breasts thumb center 500px in flight showing black and white tail pattern distribution and habitat thumb a flock at wetland india fulvous whistling duck has a very large range extending across four continents it breeds in lowland south america from northern argentina to colombia and then up to southern us and west indies it is found in a broad belt across sub saharan africa and down east of continent to south africa and madagascar indian subcontinent is asian stronghold it undertakes seasonal movements in response to availability of water and food african birds move southwards in southern summer to breed and return north in winter and asian populations are highly nomadic due to variability of rainfall this species has strong colonising tendencies having expanded its range in mexico us and west indies in recent decades wandering birds can turn up far beyond normal range sometimes staying to nest as in morocco peru and hawaii fulvous whistling duck is found in lowland marshes and swamps in open flat country and it avoids wooded areas it is particularly attracted to wetlands with plenty of emergent vegetation including rice fields it is not normally a mountain species breeding in venezuela for example only up but single peruvian breeding record was at behaviour thumb adult in london wetland centre collection this species is usually found in small groups but substantial flocks can form at favoured sites it walks well without waddling and normally feeds by upending though it can dive if necessary it does not often perch in trees unlike other whistling ducks it flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet in loose flocks rather than tight formation it feeds during day and at night in fairly large flocks often with other whistling duck species but rests or sleeps in smaller groups in middle of day they are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads before taking off in alarm they often shake their head sideways johnsgard 1965 pp 16 20 several arthropod parasites have been recorded on this duck including chewing mites of families and feather mites and skin mites internal helminth parasites include roundworms tapeworms and flukes in a survey in florida all 30 ducks tested carried at least two helminth species none had blood parasites only one duck had no mites or lice breeding thumb dendrocygna bicolor mhnt breeding coincides with availability of water in south america and south africa main nesting period is december february in nigeria it is july december and in north america mid may august in india breeding season is from june to october but peaking in july and august ali ripley 1978 pp 139 141 fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong monogamy courtship display is limited to some mutual head dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which birds raise their bodies side by side while treading water pairs may breed alone or in loose groups in south africa nests may be within of each other and breeding densities of up to 13 7 nests per square kilometre 35 5 per square mile have been found in louisiana nest across is made from plant leaves and stems and has little or no soft lining it is usually built in dense vegetation and close to water but sometimes in tree holes in india use of tree holes and even old nests of raptors or crows is much more common than elsewhere eggs are laid at roughly 24 to 36 hour intervals starting before nest is complete resulting in some losses from clutch they are whitish and on average measure and weigh clutch is usually around ten eggs but other females sometimes lay into nest so 20 or more may be found on occasion eggs may also be added to nests of other species like ruddy duck both sexes incubate changing over once a day with male often taking greater share of this duty eggs hatch in about 24 29 days downy ducklings are grey with paler upperparts and a white band on neck phillips 1922 pp 128 129 and weigh within a day of hatching like all ducklings they are precocial and leave nest after a day or so but parents protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later eggs and duckling may be preyed on by mammals birds and reptiles one parent may try to distract a potential predator with a broken wing display while other adult leads ducklings away birds are sexually mature after one year and maximum known age is 6 5 years in south africa a few records of hybridization with white faced whistling duck have been noted in wild in most parts of southern africa two species breed at different times bicolor during dry season april to september and during rains october to march hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in genus dendrocygna kear 2005 p 188 feeding thumb long legs enable duck to stand erect and walk without waddling upright fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night often in mixed flocks with relatives such as white faced or black bellied whistling ducks its food is generally plant material including seeds bulbs grasses and stems but females may include animal items such as aquatic worms molluscs and insects as they prepare for egg laying which may then comprise up to 4 of their diet ducklings may also eat a few insects foraging is by picking plant items while walking or swimming by upending or occasionally by diving to a depth of up to favoured plants include water snowflake aquatic millet shama grass cape blue water lily waxy leaf nightshade flatsedge and rice is normally a small part of diet and a survey in cuban rice fields found that plants taken were mainly weeds growing with crop however in a study in louisiana 25 of diet of incubating females consisted of cereal status international union for conservation of nature iucn estimates population of fulvous whistling duck to be from 1 3 1 5 million individuals around world this may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1 million birds in americas 1 1 million in africa and at least 20 000 in south asia for a grand total of 2 12 million ducks around world population appears to be declining but decrease is not rapid enough to trigger vulnerability criteria for extinction large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by iucn as being of least concern it is one of species to which agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa applies fulvous whistling duck has expanded its range in west indies and into southern us madge burn 1988 pp 126 127 a series of invasions from south america and reaching eastern us commenced around 1948 fueled by rice cultivation and breeding was recorded in cuba in 1964 and florida in 1965 some florida birds still winter in cuba in africa it bred on cape peninsula between 1940 and 1960s a survey of eighteen species which had colonised area in recent decades found that most were wetland species that had used irrigated farmland as stepping stones across arid country separating peninsula from breeding main range however status of two whistling duck species featured in research is dubious since they are popular ornamental species so their origin is unclear outside north america it is subject to hunting for food or because of its liking for rice and persecution means that it is now rare in madagascar pesticides used on rice fields may also have an adverse impact causing liver and breast muscle damage even at sub lethal levels notes references cited texts external links fulvous whistling duck videos at internet bird collection tribe whistling
