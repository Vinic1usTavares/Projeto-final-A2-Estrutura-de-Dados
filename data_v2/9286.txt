cauldron ii pumpkin strikes back is a computer game developed and published by british developer palace software palace as a sequel to their 1985 title cauldron two dimensional 2d platform game was released in 1986 for zx spectrum commodore 64 and amstrad cpc home computers players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against witch queen roles of two were reversed from first game in which witch defeated a monstrous pumpkin following success of cauldron palace employee steve brown began work on a sequel to provide fans of original title with a new experience a very different style of gameplay was implemented for sequel although several minor features retained connections to first inspired by bouncing pumpkin character in cauldron brown designed game around character s movement bouncing mechanic proved problematic for programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations such as turning pages of a book cauldron ii was first released on commodore 64 it was released in following years on other systems and as re releases game received praise mainly for its audio visuals in video game magazines difficulty in handling bouncing pumpkin s movement was a common complaint although reviewers felt overall package was of good value gameplay left thumb alt horizontal rectangular video game screenshot that is a digital representation of a castle interior a yellow pumpkin bounces on second floor of a castle room to left of pumpkin is a blue monster while a red table with a bowl of fruit is below on first floor pumpkin bounces through castle and encounters enemies game statistics points obtained magic points and remaining lives are tracked at top in cauldron protagonist was a witch who became witch queen by defeating an enemy called pumpking in its sequel players control a pumpkin that has survived witch s ascent to power and seeks to defeat her cauldron ii takes place in witch s castle and players control pumpkin moving it through 2d game world that is shown as side views six magical items a goblet axe shield crown scissors and book of spells are scattered throughout castle and when collected by player character augment pumpkin s abilities providing it with offensive and defensive capabilities collecting items also allows pumpkin to access witch s chambers and cut a lock of her hair which is required to defeat witch and complete game protagonist traverses castle by bouncing and players control pumpkin by manipulating direction and height of its bounce similar to previous game halloween themed enemies such as ghosts monsters and skeletons inhabit game world contact with an enemy drains pumpkin s magic meter that also fuels protagonist s offensive projectiles character dies once meter is depleted pumpkin has a limited number of lives to continue game which ends once all of pumpkin s lives have been expended on continuing pumpkin reappears on screen with a refilled meter development success of cauldron in 1985 prompted palace software to produce a sequel rather than recycle previous game s design development team wanted to be innovative and implement new gameplay features steven brown and richard leinfellner resumed their roles as designer and programmer respectively richard joseph handled audio design and stan schembri programmed commodore 64 version brown first drew inspiration from final scene of cauldron witch s fight against pumpking which bounced around a room he felt bouncing pumpkin looked cool and decided to base sequel s gameplay on this aspect although unsure about idea other team members proceeded with development intended to mimic a bouncing ball pumpkin s movement could change direction only if force is applied to it while it is in contact with a surface that provides friction this mechanic prohibited pumpkin from changing directions while in mid air and proved problematic for programmers to implement issues included difficulties with collision detection unpredictable movements that led to glitches and troubles with firing mechanism pumpkin s ability to fire projectiles was intended to provide offensive game mechanics to players in early designs however projectile inadvertently generated a force that changed pumpkin s direction programmers tried to correct this but were unable to create a perfect solution as gameplay designs were being implemented brown switched his focus to game s aesthetics scenes from game were sketched on storyboards to aid development cauldron iis game world witch s castle was designed to resemble palace software s logo as an advertising tactic brown photographed separate screens of game and assembled them into a complete map showing shape of his company s logo for video game magazines enemy designs were similar to those in previous game based on halloween holiday brown envisioned a graphical effect for game s narration showing a book whose pages turned as story is read however technical limitations at time prohibited implementation of such a visual effect brown also wanted game s visuals to scroll seamlessly as character moved through game world but flick screening showing one section of world at a time was more feasible as with previous game brown created a plasticine model of witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for game s box art group tested game prior to release and deemed it too challenging they reduced difficulty level so that more players could complete game palace software developed cauldron ii for three home computers amstrad cpc commodore 64 and zx spectrum game was first released for commodore 64 and then for amstrad cpc and zx spectrum it was later re released on zx
