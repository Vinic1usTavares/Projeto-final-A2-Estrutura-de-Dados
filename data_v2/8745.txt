mercer was unable to prevent club being relegated in 1959 for only second time in its history fact that villa reached semi finals of fa cup only served to highlight complacency that had set in at club that led to villa being relegated villa only spent one season in second division returning as champions in 1960 1960 61 season was a successful one it saw villa reach semi finals of fa cup finish ninth in league and win inaugural league cup this was helped by emergence of an exciting group of youth players who became known as mercer s minors references specific general history 1874 1961 aston
