bismuth is a chemical element with symbol bi and atomic number 83 it is a pentavalent post transition metal and one of pnictogens with chemical properties resembling its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony elemental bismuth may occur naturally although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores free element is 86 as dense as lead it is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge bismuth is most naturally diamagnetic element and has one of lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals bismuth was long considered element with highest atomic mass that is stable but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive its only primordial isotope bismuth 209 decays via alpha decay with a half life more than a billion times estimated age of universe because of its tremendously long half life bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes main uses bismuth compounds account for about half production of bismuth they are used in cosmetics pigments and a few pharmaceuticals notably bismuth subsalicylate used to treat diarrhea bismuth s unusual propensity to expand as it solidifies is responsible for some of its uses such as in casting of printing type bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal as toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys presently about a third of bismuth production as a replacement for lead history bismuth metal has been known since ancient times although it was often confused with lead and tin which share some physical properties etymology is uncertain but possibly comes from arabic bi meaning having properties of antimony bismuth retrieved on 17 december 2011 or from german words weisse masse or white mass translated in mid sixteenth century to new latin or bismuth concise oxford dictionary of english etymology name bismuth dates from around 1660s and is of uncertain etymology it is one of first 10 metals to have been discovered bismuth appears in 1660s from obsolete german early 16th century perhaps related to old high german white new latin due to georgius agricola who latinized many german mining and technical words is from german perhaps from white mass element was confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements bismuth has been known since ancient times so no one person is credited with its discovery agricola in de natura c 1546 states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead this was based on observation of metals and their physical properties miners in age of alchemy also gave bismuth name or silver being made in sense of silver still in process of being formed within earth giunta carmen j glossary of archaic chemical terms le moyne college see also for other terms for bismuth including stannum glaciale glacial tin or ice tin beginning with johann heinrich pott in 1738 carl wilhelm scheele and torbern olof bergman distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear and claude francois geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and tin bismuth was also known to incas and used along with usual copper and tin in a special bronze alloy for knives characteristics thumb left left synthetic bismuth crystal exhibiting stairstep crystal structure and iridescence colors which are produced by interference of light within oxide film on its surface right a 1 cm3 cube of bismuth metal physical characteristics thumb left pressure temperature phase diagram of bismuth tc refers to superconducting transition temperature bismuth is a brittle metal with a white silver pink hue often with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue spiral stair stepped structure of bismuth crystals is result of a higher growth rate around outside edges than on inside edges variations in thickness of oxide layer that forms on surface of crystal cause different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection thus displaying a rainbow of colors when burned in oxygen bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in periodic table such as lead antimony and polonium no other metal is verified to be more naturally diamagnetic than bismuth kruger p 171 is a different physical phenomenon of any metal it has one of lowest values of thermal conductivity after manganese and maybe neptunium and plutonium and highest hall coefficient it has a high electrical resistivity when deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate bismuth is a semiconductor despite being a post transition metal elemental bismuth is denser in liquid phase than solid a characteristic it shares with germanium silicon gallium and water wiberg p 768 bismuth expands 3 32 on solidification therefore it was long a component of low melting typesetting alloys where it compensated for contraction of other alloying components to form almost isostatic bismuth lead eutectic alloys though virtually unseen in nature high purity bismuth can form distinctive colorful hopper crystals it is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 271 degc so crystals may be grown using a household stove although resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab grown crystals at ambient conditions bismuth shares same layered structure as metallic forms of arsenic and antimony wiberg p 767 crystallizing in rhombohedral p 172 pearson symbol space group rm no 166 which is often classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems when compressed at room temperature this bi i structure changes first to monoclinic bi ii at 2 55 gpa then to tetragonal bi iii at 2 7 gpa and finally to body centered cubic bi iv at 7 7 gpa corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity they are rather reproducible and abrupt and are therefore used for calibration of high pressure equipment chemical characteristics bismuth is stable to both dry and moist air at ordinary temperatures when red hot it reacts with water to make bismuth iii oxide 2 bi 3 h2o 3 h2 it reacts with fluorine to make bismuth v fluoride at 500 degc or bismuth iii fluoride at lower temperatures typically from bi melts with other halogens it yields only bismuth iii halides wiberg pp 769 770 greenwood pp 559 561 trihalides are corrosive and easily react with moisture forming oxyhalides with formula suzuki p 9 2 bi 3 x2 2 x f cl br i

hno3 3 h2o 3 no2 bi no3 3 it also dissolves in hydrochloric acid but only with oxygen present 4 bi 3 o2 12 hcl 4 6 h2o it is used as a agent in synthesis of alkaline earth metal complexes 3 ba 2 3 2 bi isotopes only primordial isotope of bismuth bismuth 209 was traditionally regarded as heaviest stable isotope but it had long been suspected to be unstable on theoretical grounds this was finally demonstrated in 2003 when researchers at institut d in orsay france measured alpha emission half life of to be over a billion times longer than current estimated age of universe owing to its extraordinarily long half life for all presently known medical and industrial applications bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of a few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and theoretically predicted before being detected in laboratory bismuth has longest known alpha decay half life although tellurium 128 has a double beta decay half life of over bismuth s extremely long half life means that less than one billionth of bismuth present at formation of planet earth would have decayed into thallium since then several isotopes of bismuth with short half lives occur within radioactive disintegration chains of actinium radium and thorium and more have been synthesized experimentally bismuth 213 is also found on decay chain of neptunium 237 and uranium 233 commercially radioactive isotope bismuth 213 can be produced by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator in 1997 an antibody conjugate with bismuth 213 which has a 45 minute half life and decays with emission of an alpha particle was used to treat patients with leukemia this isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment for example in targeted alpha therapy tat program chemical compounds bismuth forms trivalent and pentavalent compounds trivalent ones being more common many of its chemical properties are similar to those of arsenic and antimony although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements oxides and sulfides at elevated temperatures vapors of metal combine rapidly with oxygen forming yellow trioxide greenwood p 553 when molten at temperatures above 710 degc this oxide corrodes any metal oxide and even platinum kruger p 185 on reaction with base it forms two series of oxyanions which is polymeric and forms linear chains and anion in is actually a cubic anion whereas anion in is dark red bismuth v oxide is unstable liberating gas upon heating compound is a strong oxidising agent greenwood p 578 bismuth sulfide occurs naturally in bismuth ores it is also produced by combination of molten bismuth and sulfur thumb bismuth oxychloride biocl

anionic salts of iii cation bio which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds however in case of biocl salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of bi o and cl atoms with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in adjacent plane this mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic see below bismuthine and bismuthides unlike lighter pnictogens nitrogen phosphorus and arsenic but similar to antimony bismuth does not form a stable hydride bismuth hydride bismuthine is an endothermic compound that spontaneously decomposes at room temperature it is stable only below 60 degc bismuthides are intermetallic compounds between bismuth and other metals in 2014 researchers discovered that sodium bismuthide can exist as a form of matter called a three dimensional topological dirac semi metal 3dtds that possess 3d dirac fermions in bulk it is a natural three dimensional counterpart to graphene with similar electron mobility and velocity graphene and topological insulators such as those in 3dtds are both crystalline materials that are electrically insulating inside but conducting on surface allowing them to function as transistors and other electronic devices while sodium bismuthide is too unstable to be used in devices without packaging it can demonstrate potential applications of 3dtds systems which offer distinct efficiency and fabrication advantages over planar graphene in semiconductor and spintronics applications halides halides of bismuth in low oxidation states have been shown to adopt unusual structures what was originally thought to be bismuth i chloride bicl turns out to be a complex compound consisting of bi cations and bicl and bicl anions bi cation has a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry and is also found

octahedral complex occurrence and production thumb left upright bismite mineral in earth s crust bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold most important ores of bismuth are and bismite native bismuth is known from australia bolivia and china kruger pp 172 173 according to united states geological survey world mining production of bismuth in 2016 was 10 200 tonnes with major contributions from china 7 400 tonnes vietnam 2 000 tonnes and mexico 700 tonnes refinery production in 2016 was 17 100 tonnes of which china produced 11 000 mexico 539 and japan 428 tonnes difference reflects bismuth s status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as lead copper tin molybdenum and tungsten kruger p 173 world bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic bismuth travels in crude lead bullion which can contain up to 10 bismuth through several stages of refining until it is removed by kroll betterton process which separates impurities as slag or electrolytic betts process bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals copper raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals foremost lead by reacting molten mixture with chlorine gas metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high purity bismuth metal over 99 bi price thumb upright 1 3 world mine production and annual averages of bismuth price new york not adjusted for inflation price for pure bismuth metal has been relatively stable through most of 20th century except for a spike in 1970s bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining and thus price usually reflected cost of recovery and balance between production and demand demand for bismuth was small prior to world war ii and was pharmaceutical bismuth compounds were used to treat such conditions as digestive disorders sexually transmitted diseases and burns minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire during world war ii bismuth was considered a strategic material used for solders fusible alloys medications and atomic research to stabilize market producers set price at 1 25 per pound 2 75 kg during war and at 2 25 per pound 4 96 kg from 1950 until 1964 in early 1970s price rose rapidly as a result of increasing demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium iron and steel this was followed by a decline owing to increased world production stabilized consumption and recessions of 1980 and 1981 1982 in 1984 price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide especially in united states and japan in early 1990s research began on evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes fishing sinkers food processing equipment free machining brasses for plumbing applications lubricating greases and shot for waterfowl hunting suzuki p 14 growth in these areas remained slow during middle 1990s in spite of backing of lead replacement by united states federal government but intensified around 2005 this resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price bismuth statistics and information see metal prices in united states through 1998 for a price summary and historical statistics for mineral and material commodities in united states for production usgs recycling most bismuth is produced as a byproduct of other metal extraction processes including smelting of lead and also of tungsten and copper its sustainability is dependent on increased recycling which is problematic it was once believed that bismuth could be practically recycled from soldered joints in electronic equipment recent efficiencies in solder application in electronics mean there is substantially less solder deposited and thus less to recycle while recovering silver from silver bearing solder may remain economic recovering bismuth is substantially less so next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content such as bismuth bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free machining metallurgical additive bismuth in uses where it is dispersed most widely include certain stomach medicines bismuth subsalicylate paints bismuth vanadate pearlescent cosmetics bismuth oxychloride and bismuth containing bullets recycling bismuth from these uses is impractical applications alt black and white engraving of two men extracting and working bismuth hammering and pouring on a hillside thumb 18th century engraving of bismuth processing during this era bismuth was used to treat some digestive complaints bismuth has few commercial applications and those applications that use it generally require small quantities relative to other raw materials in united states for example 733 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2016 of which 70 went into chemicals including pharmaceuticals pigments and cosmetics and 11 into bismuth alloys some manufacturers use bismuth as a substitute in equipment for potable water systems such as valves to meet lead free mandates in u s began in 2014 this is a fairly large application since it covers all residential and commercial building construction in early 1990s researchers began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications medicines bismuth is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals although use of some of these substances is declining bismuth subsalicylate is used as an it is active ingredient in such pink bismuth preparations as as well as 2004 reformulation of it is also used to treat some other gastro intestinal diseases like and cadmium poisoning mechanism of action of this substance is still not well documented although an oligodynamic effect toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on microbes may be involved in at least some cases salicylic acid from

an iridescent appearance similar to nacre of pearl it was used as a cosmetic in ancient egypt and in many places since bismuth white also spanish white can refer to either bismuth oxychloride or bismuth oxynitrate biono3 when used as a white pigment bismuth vanadate is used as a light stable non reactive paint pigment particularly for artists paints often as a replacement for more toxic cadmium sulfide yellow and orange yellow pigments most common variety in artists paints is a lemon yellow visually indistinguishable from its cadmium containing alternative metal and alloys bismuth is used in metal alloys with other metals such as iron these alloys are used in automatic sprinkler systems for fires it forms largest part 50 of rose s metal a fusible alloy which also contains 25 28 lead and 22 25 tin it was also used to make bismuth bronze which was used in bronze age lead replacement density difference between lead 11 32 g cm3 and bismuth 9 78 g cm3 is small enough that for many ballistics and weighting applications bismuth can substitute for lead for example it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers it has been used as a replacement for lead in shot bullets and less lethal riot gun ammunition netherlands denmark england wales united states and many other countries now prohibit use of lead shot for hunting of wetland birds as many birds are prone to lead poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead instead of small stones and grit to aid digestion or even prohibit use of lead for all hunting such as in netherlands bismuth tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is steel shot which is actually soft iron bismuth s lack of malleability does however make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets bismuth as a dense element of high atomic weight is used in bismuth impregnated latex shields to shield from x ray in medical examinations such as cts mostly as it is considered non toxic european union s restriction of hazardous substances directive for reduction of lead has broadened bismuth s use in electronics as a component of low melting point solders as a replacement for traditional tin lead solders its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes although it can also be used in other applications including those in automobile industry in european union for example bismuth has been evaluated as a replacement for lead in free machining brasses for plumbing applications although it does not equal performance of leaded steels other metal uses and specialty alloys many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders many automatic sprinklers electric fuses and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain eutectic 1 3 6 3 7 alloy that melts at this is a convenient temperature since it is unlikely to be exceeded in normal living conditions low melting alloys such as bi cd pb sn alloy which melts at 70 degc are also used in automotive and aviation industries before deforming a thin walled metal part it is filled with a melt or covered with a thin layer of alloy to reduce chance of breaking then alloy is removed by submerging part in boiling water kruger p 183 bismuth is used to make free machining steels and free machining aluminium alloys for precision machining properties it has similar effect to lead and improves chip breaking during machining shrinking on solidification in lead and expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities similarly alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change on order 0 01 upon melting solidification or aging such alloys are used in high precision casting e g in dentistry to create models and molds bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material bismuth is also used in aluminium silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology however it indicated a poisoning effect on modification of strontium sr some bismuth alloys such as are combined with non sticking materials such as mica glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts addition of bismuth to caesium enhances quantum yield of caesium cathodes kruger p 184 sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300 degc produces a permanent magnet and material which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in 10 100 khz range and in magnetic memory devices suzuki p 15 other uses as compounds thumb right bismuth vanadate a yellow pigment bismuth is included in bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide which is a group of similar superconducting compounds discovered in 1988 that exhibit highest superconducting transition temperatures bismuth subnitrate is a component of glazes that produces an iridescence and is used as a pigment in paint bismuth telluride is a semiconductor and an excellent thermoelectric material diodes are used in mobile refrigerators cpu coolers and as detectors in infrared spectrophotometers bismuth oxide in its delta form is a solid electrolyte for oxygen this form normally breaks down below a high temperature threshold but can be well below this temperature in a highly alkaline solution bismuth is a scintillator widely used in x ray and gamma ray detectors bismuth vanadate is an opaque yellow pigment used by some artists oil acrylic and watercolor paint companies primarily as a replacement for more toxic cadmium sulfide yellows in greenish yellow lemon to orange toned yellow range it performs practically identically to cadmium pigments such as in terms of resistance to degradation from uv exposure opacity tinting strength and lack of reactivity when mixed with other pigments most commonly used variety by artists paint makers is lemon in color in addition to being a replacement for several cadmium yellows it also serves as a non toxic visual replacement for older chromate pigments made with zinc lead and strontium if a green pigment and barium sulfate for increased transparency are added it can also serve as a replacement for barium chromate which possesses a more greenish cast than others in comparison with lead chromates it does not blacken due to hydrogen sulfide in air a process accelerated by uv exposure and possesses a particularly brighter color than them especially lemon which is most translucent dull and fastest to blacken due to higher percentage of lead sulfate required to produce that shade it is also used on a limited basis due to its cost as a vehicle paint pigment a catalyst for making acrylic fibers as an electrocatalyst in conversion of co2 to co ingredient in lubricating greases in crackling dragon s eggs in pyrotechnics as oxide subcarbonate or subnitrate toxicology and ecotoxicology see also a rare dermatological condition that results from prolonged use of bismuth scientific literature indicates that some of compounds of bismuth are less toxic to humans via ingestion than other heavy metals lead arsenic antimony etc presumably due to comparatively low solubility of bismuth salts its biological half life for whole body retention is reported to be 5 days but it can remain in kidney for years in people treated with bismuth compounds bismuth poisoning can occur and has according to some reports been common in relatively recent times data on bismuth s health and environmental effects com retrieved on 17 december 2011 as with lead bismuth poisoning can result in formation of a black deposit on gingiva known as a bismuth line bismuth line in s medical dictionary inc kruger pp 187 188 poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol however evidence for benefit is unclear bismuth s environmental impacts are not well known it may be less likely to bioaccumulate than some other heavy metals and this is an area of active research bioremediation fungus marasmius oreades can be used for biological
