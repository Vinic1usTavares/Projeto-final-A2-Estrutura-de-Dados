inspired by a weekend program organized by massachusetts institute of technology in which volunteers can teach classes to groups of high school students on any chosen subject munroe signed up after hearing about it from a friend and decided to teach a class on energy though lecture felt dry at first once munroe started bringing up examples from star wars and lord of rings students became more excited entire second half of class was eventually spent solving mathematical and physics problems munroe wrote first entries a few years before start of blog based on questions he was asked that day because he was delayed in getting website online munroe had a lot of time thinking about design of blog he eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page as he considers latter more difficult to digest munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about or after reading a scientific paper he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up munroe has said that volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them answering a question and writing a post takes him about a

first question munroe answered for blog was following using mathematics and physics munroe concluded such a situation would result in a large explosion what if approaches its subject matter with a sense of wit and sometimes makes use of approximations to answer questions that seem impossible to solve most questions demand assumptions and cross disciplinary science skills to answer resulting in back of envelope calculations what if is interspersed with charmingly amateur stick figure illustrations book also features periodic sections titled weird and worrying questions from what if inbox

to watch as munroe tackles each question and examines every possible complication according to gilsdorf what if gives a view into munroe s playful yet existentially tinged worldview by contrasting cataclysmic scenarios with more heady ideas such as examining effects of a magnitude minus 7 richter scale earthquake huffington post remarked that what makes munroe s work so fantastic is a combination of two elements his commitment to trying to answer even weirdest question with solid science and his undeniable sense of humor rhett allain of wired praised what if because even his 12
