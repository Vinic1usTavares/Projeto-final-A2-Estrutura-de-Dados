thumb hon george villiers 1759 1827 thumb cranbourne lodge by john in what is now windsor great park villiers home from 1805 to 1812 george villiers 23 november 1759 21 march 1827 styled honourable was a british courtier and politician from villiers family youngest son of diplomat lord hyde later earl of clarendon he was an intimate of princess amelia and personal supporter of her father george iii his favour within royal family and his father s influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him however villiers was more interested in operation of royal farms at windsor castle than in politics or duties of his offices when his bookkeeping as paymaster of marines was carefully examined in 1810 villiers carelessness and speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to crown by more than ps250 000 this exposure touched off a public scandal villiers promptly surrendered all his property to crown and threw himself on king s mercy misconduct of joseph hunt as treasurer of ordnance to some extent obscured villiers own misconduct and he was able to retain other sinecures and a stable if reduced income from them until his death in 1827 upbringing and political career villiers was youngest son of thomas villiers 1st earl of clarendon and charlotte capell his maternal grandparents were william capell 3rd earl of essex and jane hyde george like his brother was educated at eton college and then st john s college cambridge graduating with an ma in 1779 it was presumably through influence of his father then chancellor of duchy of lancaster under first pitt ministry that he was appointed a groom of bedchamber to george iii on 13 january 1783 and clerk of council and registrar of duchy of lancaster in august 1786 a polished courtier villiers earned nickname tiger among his party for his vehement support of king although as fanny burney observed his remarkably slim slight and delicate person did not match nickname in 1792 villiers purchased support of lord warwick and was returned as member of parliament for warwick in by election of 18 january issue published on 24 january 1792 page 3 crown office january 28 1792 members returned to serve in present parliament borough of warwick as a tory on 19 march 1792 shortly after his entry into parliament villiers was appointed to office of paymaster of marines a sinecure which would ultimately prove his undoing salary of post was fixed at ps600 p a after a reform in 1800 in 1794 villiers became captain commanding newly raised western troop of hertfordshire gentlemen and yeomanry cavalry he was elected unopposed in 1796 but did not stand for borough in 1802 though a friend of pitt s government he rarely attended house george rose commented in a letter that villiers s loss would have no impact on tories while a member of parliament in 1798 he married lord boringdon s daughter theresa who would bear him ten children over next two decades after leaving parliament villiers continued his presence at court and carried messages from princess royal in stuttgart to king in 1803 duties of his office as paymaster were extended and on 9 may he was reappointed as paymaster and inspector general of marines with a salary of ps1 000 p a in same year he was commissioned a captain in watford volunteer cavalry villiers was prepared to intercede with king on behalf of pitt to fulfill latter s desire for a more comprehensive ministry which however was frustrated and to bring pitt s friends into ministry of all talents in 1806 villiers indeed enjoyed considerable favour with king who granted him a private bounty of ps400 p a in 1804 after being compelled to refuse him an office at windsor park he was allowed to hold simultaneous office as a groom of bedchamber and paymaster and king determined to place him in charge of his farms at windsor as bailiff villiers and his family lived at windsor old lodge until 1805 when he was appointed ranger of cranbourne chase and he moved into cranbourne lodge newly renovated as his residence villiers and his wife were particularly intimate with princess amelia king s favourite daughter accounting in part for royal favour shown him with fall of ministry of all talents in 1807 and formation of portland s government duke of cumberland vigorously lobbied portland to grant villiers mastership of or some other office on grounds of villiers having rendered very serious and important services to royal family but was unsuccessful in 1809 upon death of john fordyce surveyor general of land revenues of crown portland proposed to replace that office and that of surveyor general of woods forests parks and chases then held by lord glenbervie with a three man commission commissioners of woods and forests and to make villiers one of junior commissioners this reorganisation of crown lands temporarily halted upon portland s resignation and formation of a new government under spencer perceval this created an embarrassing difficulty for villiers and his interest george canning did not choose to serve under perceval and villiers brother in law 2nd lord boringdon was canning s friend nor was proposed appointment of villiers universally popular lord glenbervie proposed senior commissioner vented his anger at perceval s nomination of villiers in his journal nonetheless villiers continued to press his claims to office on perceval in a letter of 18 october 1809 he had he said turned down a pension of ps1 200 p a for reasons which can never be publicly alluded to and had received a promise from portland to replace fordyce as surveyor general of land revenues a post worth ps2 000 p a villiers would however be satisfied with and ps1 000 p a in addition provided that he might retain his office of paymaster in fact that office was about to become engine of villiers political destruction he appears to have received sinecure offices of registrar of vice admiralty court of gibraltar and marshal of vice admiralty court of antigua around this time thorne dates these appointments to 1811 but a letter of 27 january 1810 by a b in cobbett s political register refers to sinecures at gibraltar and in west indies presumably same scandal and disgrace value to of an office like that of paymaster of marines lay not so much in official salary attached to it but in lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds which allowed official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up office of paymaster general had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses but these changes had not yet been extended to marines during villiers tenure he appears to have taken little interest in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector general leaving affairs in hands of edmund waters waters had been his private secretary and when villiers came to office as paymaster waters was appointed chief clerk in that department rising to deputy paymaster in 1797 waters and villiers invested in real estate with some of money passing through office unfortunately for villiers waters was also diverting some of funds to his own interest in opera house and accounts of office were in a shambles well aware of parlous state of office s accounts waters retired from marine pay office in 1807 as an independently wealthy man only to lose fortune in his opera house investments lax regime in pay office rattled on however until 27 december 1809 when perceval became aware of state of villiers accounts villiers to his credit immediately resigned and took responsibility for his official debts perceval allowed him to proffer his resignation directly to king but villiers could not face his master perceval informed king of state of affairs in a letter of 15 january 1810 laying blame for situation largely on waters perceval s letter noted that reports were circulating on subject to such an extent as to make it impossible to hope that it would not become subject of parliamentary observation by this time villiers s accounts had been audited through year 1804 revealing him to be in arrears by staggering sum of ps280 000 through that point on advice of his brother in law boringdon villiers offered up all his property to crown although he could not hope to pay off entire sum found wanting by this means episode left him in a condition of nervous prostration more so as he by now had five children to support a letter by a b in cobbett s political register of 27 january 1810 assailed villiers for his delinquency and estimated that his debt with interest might run to ps500 000 fortunately for villiers his case was not to be prosecuted with utmost rigour he was to some degree protected by joint efforts of boringdon s friends and whig george tierney as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent and delinquency of joseph hunt treasurer of ordnance attracted attention and saved villiers from full wrath of finance committee their report on matter noted that writ of extent had been to amount of 000 but only ps91 000 had been raised from sale of his property and about ps30 000 from securities and bond posted for him when he took office committee recommended abolition of office of paymaster of marines and transfer of its duties to treasurer of navy a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon villiers was left in boringdon s estimation with a debt of ps1 500 2 000 an annual income of ps2 000 3 000 and property in cranbourne lodge however his disgrace was not over after his resignation villiers had been replaced by lord mulgrave s brother edmund phipps as paymaster and lost his prospective place as a commissioner of woods and forests then he was informed on 4 may 1810 after release of finance committee s report that king had removed from him supervision of farms at windsor he also lost news threw him into a state of great mental distress he wrote to king begging him to suspend judgement on points raised by committee s report king replied that it was indispensable to remove villiers from his office under circumstances but extended his sympathy and suspended judgement on him final disaster for villiers occurred in november when princess amelia died after her death villiers and his wife attempted to blackmail royal family by threatening in a letter to her doctor sir henry halford to release some of her correspondence much to shock of her sister princess mary family finally moved out of cranborne lodge in 1812 untangling of his accounts dragged on until 1819 prolonged by his enemies at navy office and his own fiscal incapacity at length a balance of ps220 000 was found against him but by this time his career was hopelessly ruined he left office as a groom of bedchamber in 1815 but retained his vice admiralty sinecures until his death in 1824 he became heir presumptive to earldom of clarendon but died in 1827
