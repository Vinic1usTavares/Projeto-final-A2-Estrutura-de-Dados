tupolev tu 12 development designation tu 77 was an experimental soviet jet powered medium bomber developed from successful piston engined tupolev tu 2 bomber after end of world war ii it was designed as a transitional aircraft to familiarize tupolev and vvs with issues involved with jet engined bombers development tupolev tu 73 jet engined bomber project was suffering delays in early 1947 and tupolev suggested re tu 2 medium bomber with imported british rolls royce nene jet engines to produce a jet bomber as quickly as possible design work began well before official approval was received on 31 may 1947 for one tu 2s to be converted in okb s workshop and another five to be converted at zavod factory nr 23 but construction of prototype had already begun in early may under bureau designation tu 77 gordon pp 117 18 changes from standard tu 2 were minimized to speed production and they consisted of following gordon p 118 two nene jet engines replaced standard shvetsov ash 82fn radial engines wing dihedral was reduced to 3deg from 6deg fuselage was lengthened and rear fuselage was heightened by a new tricycle undercarriage was fitted with main gear units retracting into engine nacelles additional fuel tanks were fitted and design of tanks was changed to accommodate change from gasoline to kerosene control system was revised and trim tabs were fitted to elevators wing and tail were reinforced shvak cannon were removed from wing roots and a nudelman suranov ns 23 cannon was mounted in an external fairing on starboard side of nose testing and evaluation prototype was completed in july and was first flown on 27 july 1947 two aircraft were shown at tushino aviation day display on 3 august 1947 it completed its manufacturer s trials in september and underwent state acceptance trials from 4 october 1947 to 27 february 1948 where it was redesignated as tu 12 nii vvs seel air force scientific test institute report summarized differences between tu 2 and tu 12 as a considerable gain in speed an improved rate of climb a higher service ceiling but poorer field performance and a considerably greater fuel load required to achieve same range as tu 2 gordon p 120 both lack of a pressurized cabin that greatly reduced its effectiveness at high altitude and lack of deicing equipment for wing and tail leading edges and cockpit glazing were noted as major problems at high speeds it was virtually impossible to traverse and elevate manually operated 68 and lu 68 gun turrets vibration of ns 23 cannon when firing rendered equipment in navigator s cabin unusable and damaged cabin glazing turning on identification friend or foe iff system adversely affected intercom system and radios new generators had to be installed as originals did not produce enough electrical power trials conducted by nii vvs included engagements between tu 12 and soviet mig 9 and yak 23 jet fighters which were very useful in evaluating offensive armament of fighters defensive armament of bomber and proper tactics involved for both types of aircraft tests demonstrated inferiority of current armament and meant that every soviet bomber henceforth would have a defensive armament using power operated turrets that carried 20 mm or larger guns five aircraft modified by factory were given klimov rd 45 engine soviet unlicensed copy of nene engine and all six aircraft were used by vvs for aircrew familiarization and training aircraft completed were later relegated to test duties one aircraft was used for drone tests and another redesignated as tu mounted various pulse jet engines on a pylon above fuselage gunston p 137 operators soviet air force specifications tu 12 references notes bibliography category 1940s soviet bomber aircraft tu category twinjets category aircraft first flown in 1947
