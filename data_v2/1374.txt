massachusetts regiments and had signed on for three years of service when 3rd and 4th massachusetts were mustered out in july 1861 seven companies that had signed on for three years were grouped together to form a battalion known as massachusetts battalion finally in december 1861 three more companies were added to their roster to form a full regiment and unit was designated 29th

massachusetts militia 3rd and 4th massachusetts both left for washington d c on april 17 to serve a term of 90 days but in their haste to reach capital these regiments had departed without a full complement of ten companies as required by army regulations in following weeks seven additional companies were formed in massachusetts and assigned to 3rd and 4th to fill out their rosters unlike majority of companies in 3rd and 4th regiments which had enlisted for 90 days these new companies signed on for three years of service these seven companies would eventually form majority of 29th massachusetts while serving with 3rd and 4th massachusetts these companies were primarily garrisoned at fortress monroe at end of virginia peninsula bowen 436 this strategically important foothold in virginia allowed union forces to control major waterway of hampton roads in an unsuccessful effort to strengthen their hold on peninsula union troops marched from fortress monroe and attacked confederate position at big bethel church resulting in battle of big bethel on june 10 1861 two of companies that would eventually become part of 29th were involved in this action expedition was commanded by colonel ebenezer w peirce osborne 62 when 3rd and 4th massachusetts regiments were mustered out in july 1861 seven three year companies were consolidated on july 16 to form massachusetts battalion under command of captain joseph barnes osborne 75 battalion served relatively light garrison and guard duty at fortress monroe newport news and hampton for remainder of 1861 in december three more companies were added to battalion and with a full complement of ten companies unit became known as 29th massachusetts infantry osborne 105 peirce was appointed first commander of 29th regimental historian recorded that this appointment was exceedingly distasteful to 29th as there had been an expectation that barnes who had led massachusetts battalion would command new regiment osborne 107 barnes however was placed second in command to peirce as lieutenant colonel further peirce was disliked for his failure at big bethel during winter of 1862 charges were brought against peirce by officers of 29th and he was court martialed for incompetence and improper conduct his superior officer brigadier general john e wool overturned ruling and peirce remained in command of 29th

confederate capital of richmond effort would be known as peninsular campaign over course of march 1862 men of 29th watched as roughly 100 000 union soldiers and 15 000 mules and horses debarked from fortress monroe wert 66 29th was to remain at fortress monroe as army of potomac made its way toward richmond as campaign became bogged down outside confederate capital additional troops were called

front on june 8 1862 regiment was attached to irish brigade 2nd brigade 1st division ii corps contemporaries and historians alike have wondered at this unusual assignment callaghan 76 29th massachusetts was made up of men descended largely from old stock english families some with heritage dating back to mayflower there was at time significant social friction in new england between established protestant families and irish immigrants while regimental historian observed that 29th was cordially welcomed to irish brigade other historians such as marion armstrong point out oddity of aristocratic 29th massachusetts thrown in with three regiments of new york irishmen armstrong 66 historian daniel callaghan quotes period sources describing unlikely matching of ancient political foes and manner in which men of 29th tolerated irish born commander of irish brigade brig gen thomas francis meagher coldly in a pinched and critical silence callaghan 77 despite these social differences 29th massachusetts fought alongside irish regiments through heavy combat first regiment had seen during seven days battles during this series of battles confederates drove mcclellan s army away from richmond resulting in failure of peninsular campaign after union retreat meagher praised 29th s actions in battle saying that they had proved themselves equals of any others in brigade and had no superiors in army osborne 293 meagher would later call 29th irishmen in disguise during seven days battles 29th suffered moderate casualties of six killed and 18 wounded osborne 171 these casualties included peirce whose right arm was shot off by cannon fire command of regiment then fell to barnes bowen 438 maryland campaign thumb left alt an old photograph of a sunken road filled with bodies

battle of antietam on september 17 1862 wert 155 battle of antietam battle commenced in early morning with several assaults on confederate left flank by i corps and xii corps after these failed ii corps including irish brigade was called upon to assault a position near confederate center known as sunken road or bloody lane trench like road afforded confederates a strong defensive position just after 9 a m maj gen israel b richardson s division with irish brigade in lead moved toward sunken road armstrong 220 meagher envisioned delivery of a few volleys from brigade followed by an impetuous charge as irish brigade advanced up crest toward sunken road it took heavy fire from confederates progress of brigade was slowed by a sturdy split rail fence when meagher asked for volunteers to run forward and take it down corporal samuel c wright of 29th sprang forward with several others wright recalled that many were shot down before they reached fence and as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying out of his hands by rifle shots bilby 54 dash back to lines was just as dangerous cpl wright was later awarded medal of honor for his bravery at antietam he would over course of successive battles be wounded five times and reported dead twice despite his travails he survived war owens 44 irish brigade though advancing in good order under heavy fire and delivering effective fire in return did not reach sunken road brigade retired regimental historian observed as steadily as on drill osborne 186 29th has been criticized by some historians including marion armstrong for not advancing as quickly as rest of irish brigade an accident in terrain a small rise in front of 29th s position afforded them cover and their casualties were lighter than those of other regiments of brigade armstrong argues that barnes was reluctant to leave this advantageous ground a factor which may have contributed to failure of irish brigade s charge armstrong 224 casualties of 29th were nine killed 31 wounded and four missing fredericksburg campaign battle of antietam had been a tactical stalemate mcclellan claimed it as a strategic victory as lee s army retreated back into virginia despite this president lincoln was displeased with mcclellan s failure to pursue lee and replaced him with maj gen ambrose burnside wert 177 178 during november 1862 burnside proceeded to gather army

29th learned that meagher had arranged for a green irish brigade flag to be presented to regiment recognizing their role as honorary irishmen and their bravery during battle of antietam barnes declined gift however according to regimental historian while colonel would have been proud to receive flag for regiment as a token of respect of their irish comrades yet he objected to flag being carried by regiment on ground that it was not an irish regiment osborne 203 irish brigade historians including joseph bilby have observed that there may have been some controversy surrounding issue according to bilby barnes refused to accept flag because they believed it would brand them as fenians or irish revolutionaries bilby 63 as a result of this incident on november 30 1862 29th was transferred out of irish brigade and into brig gen benjamin c christ s brigade in ix army corps it was replaced in irish brigade by 28th massachusetts an irish regiment transfer spared 29th from battle of fredericksburg in which their new brigade played almost no role bowen 441 their former comrades in irish brigade however made a harrowing charge during battle and suffered severe casualties bilby 70 kentucky following his failure during battle of fredericksburg burnside was removed from command of army of potomac and returned to command of ix corps to which 29th massachusetts now
