they are shocked to find that box that normally holds elements is completely empty upon opening it suddenly an image of discord on stained glass windows comes to life teasing ponies and celestia discord claims to have taken elements and alludes to where they can be located twilight believes discord is referring to hedge maze near castle and six race there discord appears in his true form and challenges ponies to a game telling them that only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic enforcing this rule by making unicorns horns and pegasi s wings vanish and that if any of them leave game he automatically wins despite their handicap ponies enter maze but they are soon separated by discord s magic he is able to individually test applejack pinkie pie rarity and fluttershy against their respected elements making them be momentarily hypnotized lose some of their color and become a polar opposite of their element twilight encounters each of them after this point aware of

forfeiting game by leaving discord makes maze fall around them and he boasts his victory warning of an incoming storm of chaos part two twilight confronts discord by accusing him of cheating however discord counters this by reminding her that while he had hinted at where elements were he never said anything about them being in labyrinth as he disappears and teases ponies with another storm of chocolate rain twilight realizes that a line from discord s riddle actually refers to ponyville itself determined and with renewed hope twilight leads her best friends back to ponyville which discord has altered in a chaotic manner discord continues to taunt twilight who is determined to get back to library in town to find a way to defeat discord while her best friends personalities continue to become more warped losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome managing to get them all into library twilight and spike locate book about elements of harmony and are surprised and delighted to find book actually contains elements she forces her best friends to wear elements though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that sooner they defeat discord sooner they never have to see each other again twilight also assigns spike as temporary element of loyalty because rainbow dash is not present they go to face discord but elements fail to activate other four ponies and spike quickly drop elements and depart leaving twilight despondent and finally losing her own color twilight sadly returns to library preparing to pack and leave ponyville when she finds spike coughing up scroll after scroll twilight is surprised to find these to be friendship report letters that she had previously sent to celestia and memories of her friendships in ponyville make her regain her color inspired by this she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship cancelling discord s magic and returning them to normal rainbow dash is still apart from group however and without her elements will not activate they find rainbow dash protecting a cloud believing it to be her home of they start to give chase but rainbow flies away they quickly use a hot air balloon pulled along by fluttershy to catch up to rainbow at first it seems that rainbow has upper hand but they manage to catch up to her as soon as fluttershy is reminded of discord ponies eventually catch rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for twilight to cast her memory spell ponies collect elements and discord who casually passes off their threat however with all six ponies restored elements activate firing a rainbow beam of light that engulfs discord and ponyville ponyville immediately returns to normal and discord is once again turned to stone ponies victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at canterlot led by celestia who praises their heroism and power of their friendship and reveals a new stained glass window of six ponies defeating discord production thumb john de lancie guest stars in episode as discord return of harmony was directed by james wootton with assistance from supervising director jayson thiessen and written by m a larson john de lancie guest stars in episode as discord according to thiessen lauren faust had conceived of discord while watching a series of star trek next generation episodes using q portrayed by de lancie as a template when it came time to consider voice actors for role production team had considered using a stand in for de lancie but were surprised to learn that de lancie himself was available for role upon hearing news team altered some elements of episode to provide more allusion to his previous role such as flash of light when discord would appear or disappear de lancie was later surprised by large positive responses from adult fans of series leading him to learn more about this fandom and participating as executive director of documentary about fandom bronies extremely unexpected adult fans of my little pony de lancie has since re voiced discord for later episodes of series and promotions on hub episodes were final to feature lauren faust as executive producer near end of first season faust announced that she had left series and for second season she stepped down as executive producer to become consulting producer her involvement in second season consisted mainly of story conception and scripts despite her decreased participation she still has high hopes for staff members stating gaps i have left are being filled by same amazing artists writers and directors who brought you season 1 i m certain show will be as entertaining as ever in addition a new storyboard editor named jim miller was hired for second season and a majority of animation was outsourced to animation company top draw according to thiessen this allowed for a greater pre production process for season two episodes return of harmony was first episode of second season according to thiessen hub and its parent company hasbro had approved season two before we were done with season one they knew they had something good on their hands he explained they saw success of show early on which is rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because they want to know what numbers are but they i guess a bit of a risk on their behalf but i m glad they did finale scene of episode is a parody of ending from 1977 film star wars episode iv a new hope according to thiessen joke was an afterthought originally there was going to be a more elaborate ending but due to time constraints a new finale was created during animation stage one of directors noted that scene was kind of like ending to a new hope and so decision was made to create scene for scene parody of original reception ratings first part of return of harmony aired on september 17 2011 while second part aired on september 24 first part was viewed by over

has also improved with a wider variety of styles being used a review from republibot of first part of episode called plot an interesting revisit of premise of pilot friendship is magic furthermore review called john de lancie s performance superb and praised animation reviews for part two were positive as well republibot gave episode a largely positive review however site did note that episode feels a bit rushed even as a two parter and that fluttershy s and rarity s restoration sequences in particular feel rushed and inadvertently echo mind wipe sequences from men in black many reviews praised series pop culture references carina belles applauded series for making subtle pop culture references citing pinkie pie s mention of chocolate rain a reference to a popular internet meme many reviews and critics positively commented on episode s ending which featured a parody of closing scenes to original star wars cyriaque lamar from i09 wrote positively of scene writing honestly modern my little pony fandom is one of those things i m live and let live about even though it baffles me entirely but this morning s episode of show did a little homage to a new hope i09 later named scene one of best television moments of 2011 john farrier from wrote it s hard for bronies to get respect from some quarters but closing star wars parody scene alone says much in favor of show entertainment site dorkly an affiliate of collegehumor featured a video comparing two scenes and wrote may adorable be with you topless robot writer anne mathews named star wars parody nerdiest easter egg in my little pony friendship is magic writing this scene is a direct to fans and completely cements creator lauren faust s geek cred only thing missing is a wookiee yell at end home media release two part
