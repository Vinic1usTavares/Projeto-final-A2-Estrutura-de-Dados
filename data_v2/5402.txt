cameron leon white born 18 august 1983 is an australian cricketer and former australian twenty20 and victorian bushrangers captain a powerful middle order batsman and right arm leg spin bowler white made his first class cricket debut as a teenager in 2000 01 season for victorian bushrangers as a bowling all rounder early comparisons with victoria teammate shane warne faded as white took on a role closer to that of andrew symonds a batsman who bowled occasionally and bats aggressively with flat sixes around his leg side in 2003 04 he became victoria s youngest ever captain at age of 20 when he took over leadership of their one day side and first class captaincy followed season after international recognition came for first time in 2005 but white found himself in and out of side as selectors and national captain ricky ponting looked for white to improve his bowling to play as a front line spinner two successful winters with english county side somerset helped to propel white back into selectors minds white had a short test career playing four test matches in 2008 his tenure as t20 captain ended with 2012 series against india where he was dropped following poor form in big bash league he was succeeded by melbourne stars teammate george bailey his nickname of bear is due to his purported resemblance to polar bear mascot of bundaberg rum career early career white began his cricket career working his way through youth structure at victoria playing in commonwealth bank under 17 and later under 19 championship series he showed his prowess with both bat and ball during these competitions claiming a century two half centuries and 17 wickets in ten matches he played over two seasons he tended to bat as part of middle order and bowl as third or fourth change his first class debut came in march 2001 aged 17 against new south wales batting at number nine white scored 11 runs in his only batting inning of match and claimed 4 654 65 white claimed four wickets and 65 runs were scored while he was bowling coming on as third change bowler he made one further first class appearance that season before joining up with australian under 19 cricket team for two youth tests against sri lanka he captained ais australia cricket academy side that toured new zealand beating new zealand academy side 3 1 in a four match one day series after a pair of draws in two three day matches soon after he made his list a debut for victoria but match was rained off after 42 1 overs without white taking any part in match white received his first senior man of match award a few days later for his two wickets and score of 91 batting at number seven during pura cup match against south australia he was named as captain of australian under 19 squad to compete in 2002 under 19 cricket world cup in new zealand and led his team to victory in competition beating south africa by seven wickets in final white finished tournament as leading run scorer with 423 runs with two of other top four batsmen also being australian despite his success with bat during under 19 world cup victoria continued to use white as a bowling all rounder a decision that seemed to be justified in 2002 03 season when white passed 50 just once in his 13 first class innings and claimed 28 wickets in his last match of season he claimed his maiden five and ten wicket hauls taking 6 66 in first innings against western australia and 4 70 in second innings to help victoria to a 10 wicket victory youngest ever captain following a season which had seen darren berry and shane warne share captaincy of victoria s ing cup side victoria selectors appointed white as captain for 2003 04 season aged only 20 white became youngest player to captain victoria state side in its 152 year history to that point his coach david hookes said that white has shown at a young age a successful understanding of captaining a team decision was supported by reports that during under 19 world cup he captained side with flair control and maturity far beyond his years white was also called upon to captain first class side early in 2003 04 season after regular captain berry broke his finger during a practice match after a win and a loss while captaining ing cup side white was named man of match on his debut as pura cup captain taking six wickets to lead victoria to a five wicket victory over queensland white was given his first taste of international cricket in december 2003 having taken four indian wickets during a tour match for victoria white was selected to play for australia a against same opposition later in tour batting at number six in an australian side that also included victoria teammate brad hodge and was captained by michael hussey white made little impression on indians making just 20 runs in his two innings and taking no wickets white retained his place in a side to face zimbabwe in two 50 over contests claiming two wickets 2003 04 season saw white s batting improve markedly in first class cricket but he tore some ligaments in his right leg therefore ending his 2003 04 season a return of five half centuries in eighteen innings saw his season average finish in excess of 30 for first time he also claimed 30 wickets in season most in a single season in his career to date although his average suffered compared with previous season rising to over 35 a couple of cameo innings also indicated what was to come 58 runs off 65 balls against western australia and 75 runs off 97 balls against south australia an innings that included 7 fours and 3 sixes showcased strengths that would later see white shine in shorter twenty20 format of game these improvements in white s game and an injury to stuart macgill saw white named as part of 13 man australia test squad to tour zimbabwe with australia selectors keen to take two spinners on tour macgill s injury allowed them to select white with a view to future a tour match against zimbabwe a brought a wicket for white but he was denied chance of making his test debut when two match series was called off due to disputes between zimbabwe cricket board and their rebel players white described decision as a missed opportunity to see how everything went and how an international test match is played 2003 04 season had been capped by victory in pura cup following a 321 victory over queensland in final in which white made a half century and claimed five of oppositions wickets victoria captain berry retired from professional cricket after triumph and white was named as his replacement for 2004 05 white was pleased with appointment saying that captaincy brings out best in my game and extra responsibility is good for me in december 2004 white made his maiden first class century making 119 after victoria were forced to follow on against queensland his partnership of 205 with ian harvey a record seventh wicket partnership for victoria and 152 from opener jason helped victoria recover to a second innings total of 508 8 declared a fine bowling performance then saw queensland bowled out for just 169 capping a remarkable fightback by victoria international breakthrough 150px thumb right white bowling in adelaide oval nets january 2009 alt a man wearing dark blue cricket training kit with gold piping bowls a cricket ball a net can be seen predominately in fore ground during his early career parallels were drawn victoria teammate shane warne both were blonde and both were leg spinners it was soon apparent that he did not have ability to turn ball as much as warne his style being described as more reminiscent of anil kumble instead midway through 2004 05 season white played four matches for australia a against touring west indians and pakistanis three 50 over matches brought him two half centuries and a duck and his first experience of twenty20 cricket resulted in an unbeaten 58 with a strike rate over 150 victoria did not qualify for either pura cup or ing cup finals but white s improvement was again significant his first class averages remained roughly same as in previous season but he more than doubled his previous best season batting average in one day cricket passing 30 in format after his impressive form for australia a during january 2005 white was selected as part of australia a side to tour pakistan in september that year after claiming four wickets and averaging 35 50 with bat in 2 four day matches white shone in subsequent one day games not required to bat in first he then scored 106 not out in second and 59 not out in third also claiming a tail end wicket having now demonstrated his ability as a big hitting all rounder white was selected to make his international debut during 2005 icc super series against icc world xi shaun pollock captaining world xi team said that his batsmen would target young leg spinner but australia captain ricky ponting said he expected white to bowl after he d handled things well in victoria game against them he was named as supersub in first two matches being on field only during icc world xi innings therefore being unable to bat he did not bowl in first match and only bowled three wicket less overs in second despite controversy regarding official status of matches these two appearances as supersub signified white s first two one day international odi appearances he started third match but as australia closed their innings on 293 5 white was again not required to bat nor did he bowl in following icc world xi innings white was named as a bowling supersub again for first odi of chappell hadlee trophy replacing at start of new zealand innings he bowled one wicket less over conceding four runs after missing out on second match white returned for third getting opportunity to bat for first time he was dismissed for a golden duck falling to chris martin first ball in new zealand innings he claimed his first senior international wicket bowling hamish marshall international contract not renewed 2005 06 was first season that twenty20 cricket was played domestically in australia and white with his victoria team were quickest to adapt to new format white earnt a man of match award in his first match in tournament scoring 45 runs off 32 balls and claiming a single wicket two wickets followed in second match and a second victory granted victoria a place in final facing new south wales in final white added 46 off 16 balls scoring at almost three runs a ball he claimed 3 8 in following innings helping to restrict new south wales to 140 giving victoria championship title white finished tournament with 99 runs second only to brad hodge and 6 wickets trailing only shane harwood both victoria teammates in april 2006 white joined up with english county side somerset for first match of county championship after somerset were forced to follow on by gloucestershire white came in at number five and scored 172 runs off 228 balls before finally being caught off bowling of former victoria teammate ian harvey despite this innings somerset only managed a team total of 287 and lost match by an innings and seven runs two weeks later on 1 may cricket australia announced that along with james hopes and mick lewis cameron white s national contract would not be renewed for next 12 months when somerset captain ian blackwell suffered a shoulder injury that put him out of game for three months white was named as his replacement as with australia under 19s and victoria added responsibility seemed to improve his game a score of 109 is used to signify that white remained not out at close of his team s innings against glamorgan in 50 over cheltenham gloucester trophy was followed immediately by 131 in county championship against worcestershire a half century against touring sri lankans and then a second innings 108 against surrey all made in first half of june twenty20 cup gave white another chance to display his skills in shortest format of game white was joined at somerset by fellow australian justin langer for tournament and pair shone in somerset s opening match of competition opening innings langer made 90 runs off 46 balls but was outscored and outpaced by white s 116 scored at more than two runs a ball century was white s first in twenty20 cricket and he capped off his performance by claiming gloucestershire s tenth wicket to wrap up a 117 run victory just under two weeks later white surpassed this score at time joint highest made in twenty20 cricket with 141 against worcestershire his runs made off 70 balls set a new world record twenty20 total that would stand for almost two years before being beaten by brendon mccullum he finished competition with leading batting average and his 403 runs trailed only teammate langer s 464 and leicestershire batsman hylton ackerman s 409 in august with somerset slumping white scored back to back fourth innings centuries in county championship but neither could rescue his side from defeat first he made 111 against essex and then under a week later he made highest individual score in fourth innings of a first class match by remaining 260 not out at close of somerset s innings as derbyshire beat them to record their first home win in four years despite somerset finishing bottom of division two of county championship white had his most successful season of cricket in his career to that point having made his highest score and hit five centuries in first class cricket his batting average was almost 60 and his one day batting average exceeded 40 one day international cricket 2006 07 a strong start to 2006 07 australian domestic season exemplified by 150 against tasmania in pura cup and 126 against new south wales in ford ranger cup previously ing cup saw white recalled to australia one day squad chief of selectors andrew described his inclusion in squad praising his great form with bat and he has had some terrific performances with ball in an interview with australian newspaper age white professed his relief at returning to international scene stating that i don t really care if i get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder or just as a bat or bowler as long as i get picked an international twenty20 against england saw white rewarded with a man of match award for his 40 off 20 balls and 1 11 with ball in hand in his next batting innings white scored 45 runs including 3 sixes against new zealand leading teammate andrew symonds to praise his ability to strike cricket ball saying that when you ve got that going on at other end it makes it a lot easier for me despite his excellent form with bat white s bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective for this reason as well as improved form of brad hodge and selection of brad hogg and shane watson for their ability with ball he was dropped for finals of commonwealth bank series and left out of world cup squad despite not being named in world cup squad white played all three odis in chappell hadlee trophy against new zealand this was because some of senior players were rested ahead of world cup or sustained injuries stand in captain michael hussey only called upon him to bowl three overs during series all in second match in which he was expensive conceding almost 10 runs an over he hit a quick 42 in that match scoring six boundaries including 3 sixes he was less impressive with bat in other two matches making 13 on both occasions another domestic year white returned to victoria side in time to captain his team in ford ranger cup final which they lost to queensland by 21 runs two pura cup matches brought a couple of wickets and 96 runs and then a month s break before his first match back in england where he returned to somerset for a second season he was among runs immediately one of eight centurions as somerset played middlesex fellow australian langer also returning to somerset made 315 and white added 114 as somerset eventually reached 850 7 declared white scored three more half centuries before month was out and in first match of may was one of four australians to reach three figures as somerset hosted derbyshire against gloucestershire he again showed his ability to remain calm and keep scoring even as those around him fell making 241 in a somerset first innings in which james hildreth was only other player to pass 50 white passed 1 000 runs in county championship for second time and his batting average topped 70 as somerset won promotion from division two a turnaround from previous season when they had finished bottom of division winning competition s wooden spoon season also saw a slight improvement in white s bowling his 20 first class wickets coming at an average of 32 75 his best in a domestic season despite his impressive season due to english counties only being allowed one overseas player for 2008 season white did not see his contract with county renewed somerset preferring to keep captain justin langer somerset s director of cricket brian rose paid tribute to white saying it was a difficult choice with new ruling about only one overseas player because cameron has also done tremendous things for us thumb left 150px white warming up for a twenty20 match for somerset 2007 alt a man wearing dark blue shorts and sweat shirt with a large red pad fastened to his left leg holds a cricket bat in front of him it was on back of this form that white once again toured pakistan with australia a squad but he finished series with just two wickets both coming in first class matches and a handful of runs two months into australian domestic season white was forced to retire hurt after colliding with queensland bowler lee and after match it was revealed he d fractured his foot he d been carrying injury since start of season and collision led to a full break putting white out for six weeks white conceded that injury would almost certainly rule out any chance he had of playing for national team that summer he returned in early january playing last three matches of twenty20 tournament including final which victoria won by 32 runs although white only managed to make one run off eight balls for second season in a row white was named as captain of prime minister s xi and claimed two sri lankan wickets in 50 over contest white led victoria to both pura cup and ford ranger cup finals in 2007 08 but they lost both to new south wales and tasmania respectively auction for inaugural season of indian premier league ipl saw majority of world s cricketing talent up for sale in a very public forum for thirteen australians on offer this was in sharp contrast to secrecy which surrounded value of national contracts white was finally sold for 500 000 to royal challengers bangalore 50 000 more than shane warne fetched and more again than ricky ponting matthew hayden and michael hussey apparent discrepancy was in part due to possibility that international involvement could rule australia s test players out of much if not all of first two years of tournament rahul dravid bangalore s icon player described white as an exciting addition saying white is a very exciting twenty20 player and his domestic record with two twenty20 hundreds in australia is phenomenal despite his price white had a largely disappointing time in his only ipl season he finished tournament with 114 runs over 500 less than fellow australian and competition s leading run scorer shaun marsh cameron white holds record for highest individual score in a t20 as captain 141 on international fringes white was recalled to australian odi and twenty20 squads for 2008 tour of west indies he scored 10 runs off 6 balls in a rain reduced 11 over twenty20 contest and in a 50 over tour match against university of west indies vice chancellor s xi made 34 but remained wicket less in his eight overs with ball by this stage in his career white was generally considered a middle order batsman who bowled a bit but australia captain ponting saw his place in team as that of front line spinner white s obviously been picked as spinner on this tour we just need to keep exposing him to different situations and putting him under a bit more pressure hopefully he plays a big role for us during series despite ponting s comments he used white as fourth change bowler in first odi bringing slow left arm spin of michael clarke on first white conceded 32 runs in his six overs without a breakthrough and did not bowl at all in second match as clarke claimed man of match award for his half century and three wickets although white scored 40 at quicker than a run a ball return of andrew symonds for last three odis left white out of team again it was absence of symonds sent home from 2008 09 series against bangladesh for skipping a team meeting to go fishing that gave white another opportunity in odi team although stand in captain clarke mirrored action of ponting by bringing himself on before victoria captain white claimed a career best three wickets for five runs off 10 balls he bowled after match white admitted he had to prove he could deal with pressures of international cricket but was upbeat saying it was nice to get a few wickets but it would have been nice to get a few overs under belt as well he claimed two more wickets in second match and after not being required to bowl in third finished series with an average under 10 he was selected as captain of australia a team to compete against new zealand a and india a in a tri series hosted by india captaincy gave white an opportunity to give himself plenty of overs in total he bowled over 30 overs claiming eight wickets in competition second only to piyush chawla he displayed his all round ability by finishing with fifth highest batting average and leading his team to final in which they beat india a by 156 runs when symonds was dropped from tour of india due to disciplinary issues greg shipperd white s coach at victoria claimed that white should have been called up rather than watson claiming that leg spinner looked ideal to fill aggressive role vacated by symonds he is a great counter puncher when fellow victorian leg spinner bryce left tour injured white got call up to test squad that shipperd felt he deserved although he was nominally selected as a specialist bowler after jason krejza other spinner on tour conceded 199 runs for no wickets in a match against board president s xi white was considered safer option although ponting publicly endorsed krejza after his wicket less match despite ponting s apparent leanings white was preferred and became 402nd australian to receive his test cap he was selected to bat at number eight usually a specialist bowler s position despite generally playing first class cricket as a batsman at end of first test in which white took solitary wicket of sachin tendulkar ponting said he s come along in leaps and bounds in his bowling he s probably exceeded my expectations with what he s done although he did not take wickets white improved his return in second test claiming three wickets but only took one more in last two matches although ponting extolled white in public he once again often opted to use part time spin of clarke before and more frequently than white throughout series white s five wickets on tour came at a bowling average of almost 70 and with symonds named in test squad to face new zealand there was no place in squad for white one day specialist although not included in test squads to face either new zealand or south africa white was named in odi and twenty20 squads to face south africa at home and professed it was a good feeling to know you are still in mix white played in a more familiar role in batting in middle order and after a disappointing 7 in first match made 40 off 18 in second to push australia s total up beyond south africa s reach he had a steady odi series in which he was again used as a middle order batsman and part time spinner he retained his place for one day series against new zealand but had limited involvement making 27 runs from his two innings though he did claim two wickets in his seven overs bowling his lack of involvement with test squad allowed him to return to victoria to lead them in a losing cause in ford ranger cup final a narrow 12 run loss to queensland draws against tasmania and queensland set up another queensland victoria final this time in sheffield shield formerly pura cup white was named as man of match as he led his team to their first championship since 2003 04 scoring 135 and 61 as queensland were out played comprehensively white remained in australia s twenty20 team for their two matches in south africa but was not involved in their odi matches and subsequently was not named as part of their squad for icc world twenty20 however after symonds was sent home from tournament due to an alcohol related incident white was called up as his replacement australia were knocked out in group stage of competition with white unused in their two matches cricinfo s brydon coverdale lambasting australia s belief that players who carry them in test and 50 over cricket can do same in three hour games white returned to australia to captain a team against pakistan and showed consistency with bat culminating in 73 in twenty20 match knowing his role thumb cameron white in 2008 named in both one day squads for tour of england and in champions trophy squad white s role in team was now that of a batsman in rain abandoned twenty20 in england he made his best twenty20 international score of 55 and was only player to cope with poor conditions on a two paced pitch in odi series white saw himself promoted to number three in absence of ponting and responded with scores of 53 and 42 in first two matches before making his maiden international century in third his 124 ball 105 saw him named man of match in his last match before ponting s return which would see him drop back down batting order he played remaining four matches of series at number six but finished tour as australia s leading run scorer in odis white was ever present in australia s triumph in 2009 champions trophy saving his best performance for final where having been promoted to number four he scored a patient 62 against new zealand to help australia recover from 6 2 to ease to a six wicket victory following odi series against india saw white remain at number four due to injuries to michael clarke and brad and he made three half centuries including a remarkable 57 off 33 balls including 5 sixes after being in and out of australian set up earlier in his career white claimed i think my best position is up around where i have been batting a statement backed up by an average of 41 71 in his 18 appearances since his call up to face england earlier that year higher responsibility placed on white as a batsman was balanced by a much lower responsibility with ball across whole of 2009 season he only bowled three balls in one day international cricket upon retirement of ricky ponting from international twenty20 cricket there were some calls for white to be promoted to captain side led by his victoria coach greg shipperd despite these calls white backed favourite incumbent vice captain michael clarke for role white was eventually named as clarke s vice captain although worries about clarke s injury prone back and his struggles with form in twenty20 resulted in continued calls for white to take over though white again backed clarke claiming michael s going to do a great job and i ll just look forward to working with him i m still really young in australia job as well and very inexperienced at this level so i think i can learn a lot off him return of clarke to odi team for pakistan series also saw white move down order again although batting at number five he made his second international century in first match scoring 105 from 88 balls to help drive australia to victory white continued to perform well with bat in series making a half century in second match and making decent totals in a number of other games as australia swept series 5 0 indian premier league 2011 in fourth season
