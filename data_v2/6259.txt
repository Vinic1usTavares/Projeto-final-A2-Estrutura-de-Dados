norman selfe 9 december 1839 15 october 1911 was an australian engineer naval architect inventor urban planner and outspoken advocate of technical education after emigrating to sydney with his family from england as a boy he became an apprentice engineer following his father s trade selfe designed many bridges docks boats and much precision machinery for city he also introduced new refrigeration hydraulic electrical and transport systems for these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime decades before sydney harbour bridge was built city came close to building a selfe designed steel cantilever bridge across harbour after he won second public competition for a bridge design selfe was honoured during his life by name of sydney suburb of normanhurst where his grand house gilligaloola is a local landmark he was energetically involved in organisations such as sydney mechanics school of arts and australian historical society as president of board of technical education he fought consistently for establishment of an independent system of technical education to serve needs of a rapidly industrialising society he was acknowledged upon his death as one of best known people in and greatest individual influences upon city of sydney family background and apprenticeship selfe came from a long line of inventors and engineers both sides of his family came from kingston upon thames in london where one grandfather had owned a plumbing and engineering works his father henry was a plumber and inventor whose high pressure fire fighting hose was displayed at great exhibition in london s crystal palace in 1851 selfe s cousin edward muggeridge grew up in same town but moved to united states in 1855 restyled himself eadweard muybridge and achieved global fame as a pioneer in new field of photography selfe family landed at sydney s semi circular quay in january 1855 when norman was 15 years old one of reasons they emigrated to colony of new south wales was to enable him and his brother harry to undertake engineering apprenticeships without having to pay heavy premium required by large firms in london they initially resided in nearby rocks district in a small house that had previously been first sydney home of mary reibey a former convict who became australia s first businesswoman selfe s parents had high expectations of their children particularly of norman whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth and were first to construct a velocipede in country selfe very quickly began his career as an engineer taking articles of apprenticeship to ironmaster peter nicol russell at whose firm he worked in several departments and eventually became its chief draughtsman he would remain there until 1864 in 1859 when pn russell co expanded to a site in barker street near head of darling harbour selfe drew up plans for new works and wharf and oversaw their construction in an address to engineering section of royal society of new south wales in 1900 selfe recalled his work for russell s while there i prepared plans for numbers of flour mills and for first ice making machines designing machinery for multifarious requirements of colonial industries many of which such as sheep washing and boiling down no longer exist on old lines cited in freyne 2009 while at russell s selfe made several innovations in design and construction of dredges for deeping our harbours and rivers something of crucial importance to industry in early sydney he later recalled success of pluto one of his dredges purchased by government i n this there were several novelties introduced and among them ladder was lifted by hydraulic power instead of by a chain from a winch day of official trial was a proud one for me because during course of little festivities which followed their formal approval and official acceptance head engineer mr dunlop pointedly remarked that as she was all right credit must be given to his boy in drawing office inventor and engineer selfe achieved international recognition in 1861 when leading british journal engineer published illustrations of his designs for one of first refrigerating machines one such machine was installed behind royal hotel in george street in sydney s ice works one of world s earliest commercial refrigeration plants decades following selfe s arrival in australia were watershed years in development of refrigeration technology and he was closely involved with its evolution introduction of refrigeration to colony revolutionised farming allowing expansion of settlement and made possible export of meat and dairy products in sydney itself refrigeration changed commercial practices and led to eventual demise of city dairies selfe became an international authority on refrigeration engineering he wrote articles and eventually a definitive textbook on subject published in us in 1900 pp 3 6 cited in freyne 2009 thumb left alt black and white drawing of two masted ship with a central steam engine funnel traveling from right to left through choppy seas illustration of ss governor blackall after leaving russell s selfe went into partnership with his former employer james dunlop they designed and built major installations for australasian mineral oil company western kerosene oil company and australian gas light company in 1869 selfe was appointed to senior post of chief draftsman and scientific engineer at mort s dock and engineering company in balmain in this role he oversaw design and construction of mail ship ss governor blackall personally commissioned for queensland government by premier charles lilley in 1869 sydney built but queensland owned ship was an attempt to break what was later described as capricious monopoly of australasian steam navigation company on coastal trade and mail delivery from england however it ultimately caused political downfall of lilley as he had undertaken contract without consulting his colleagues thumb alt black and white photo of a group of adults sitting in a coal skip halfway down a very steep and rickety

engineer at 141 pitt street gaining a reputation for versatility and originality upon his return from an overseas trip through america britain and continental europe in 1884 85 where he visited engineering works and technical education facilities in search of new ideas to take back to sydney selfe set up a new office in lloyd s chambers at 348 george street he would later move to no 279 where he operated consultancy until his death in 1911 in late 1890s he employed william as an engineer who would later make a major donation of australiana to state library of new south wales collection of selfe s own papers and drawings have since been donated to same library that his former employee greatly augmented selfe designed hulls or machinery for some 50 steam vessels including

patented an improved system of baling wool which increased capacity fourfold and oversaw hydraulic and electric light installations in city and carriages on its railway network he planned mills waterworks and pumping stations including high level pumps at reservoir on crown street he made major electric light installations at anthony hordern sons department store and hotel australia and provided a hot water system for hotel he designed machinery for factories dairies and railways including in 1878 incline of what is now scenic railway attraction at katoomba in blue mountains which claims to be world s steepest its original purpose was transportation of mists of time pells hammon page 66 from jamison valley to cliff top during his lifetime selfe received both local and international recognition for his engineering skill he had been president of both australian mechanical engineers and naval architects institutes as well as a member of both british equivalent organisations he was also elected a full member of english institution of civil engineers and by virtue of his writings also being published in chicago also an honorary member of an american engineering association sydney selfe s capacity for invention was not limited to realm of machinery he was also an energetic civic and urban reformer he had high hopes for sydney thumb left 350px alt

for all time be queen city of southern hemisphere and that new century will open finding old ways departed from and a glorious new era of progress prosperity morality and cleanliness installed in our midst when that day arrives we shall look back with curiosity and wonder at continued blindness and negligence from which our city so highly gifted by nature had suffered so long from time of selfe s return in 1886 from two years travel in united states and europe he campaigned for improvements to city of sydney these included proposals for a city railway loop redevelopment of rocks and a bridge to north shore his obituary in sydney morning herald noted mr selfe for over twenty years was a strenuous advocate of a circular city railway that should connect up eastern western and northern suburbs of city with marine suburbs of harbour and stations adjacent to ferries he published plans and proposals elaborating on his ideas and produced major articles with titles like sydney past present and possible and sydney and its institutions as they are and might be from an engineer s point of view in 1887 selfe published proposals for a city underground railway with stations at wynyard rocks and circular quay and a loop to woolloomooloo and eastern suburbs proposal included a bridge across sydney harbour for trains vehicles and pedestrians he presented these schemes to royal commission on city and suburban railways in 1890 but nothing was to come of it largely because 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill in 1908 09 he served as one of 11 expert commissioners to royal commission for improvement of city of sydney and its suburbs selfe s proposals included an overhead railway station at circular quay and major landscaping works at belmore park opposite central railway station report of royal commission for improvement of sydney and its suburbs new south wales parliamentary papers vol 5 1909 cited in freyne 2009 both of these visions were later realised but not in his lifetime sydney harbour bridge thumb right alt watercolour drawing of bridge design looking south east from north sydney towards circular quay with houses in

crossing and a city railway extension were again on agenda lyne government committed to building new central railway station and organised a worldwide competition for design and construction of a harbour bridge selfe submitted a design for a suspension bridge estimated to cost ps1 128 000 and won second prize of ps500 first prize went to c e w of westminster with a design estimated to cost more than twice as much after outcome of competition had become mired in controversy in 1902 selfe won a second competition outright with a design for a steel cantilever bridge stretching from dawes point to mcmahons point selection board were unanimous commenting that structural lines are correct and in true proportion and outline is graceful construction of selfe s version of sydney harbour bridge never started due to an economic slowdown and a change of government at 1904 state election much to selfe s outrage department of public works kept his calculations and drawings and also copied and printed them eventually in 1907 department contacted selfe and asked him to collect his drawings but refused to return calculations selfe was never given ps1 100 prize nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than ps20 000 north shore bridge competitions precis of correspondence with government in same moved for in parliament by dr arthur printed under no

1884 85 these would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge building practices for selfe s own designs in 1908 selfe presented new proposals based upon old design to royal commission on communication between sydney and north sydney however this time commissioners preferred a tunnel scheme again no work proceeded agitation for a bridge was renewed with election of a labor government at 1910 state election but with selfe s death in 1911 it was time for a new generation of bridge builders in 1912 government appointed j j bradfield as engineer in chief of sydney harbour bridge and city transit call for tenders for constructing bridge was not made until a decade later over following decades versions of what selfe had much earlier articulated for a city circle railway link and a bridge to north shore were realised selfe s contribution received little public or formal recognition historian selfe was founding vice president of australian historical society in 1901 serving with president andrew houison and patron david scott mitchell after whom mitchell wing of state library of new south wales is named he remained actively involved in society for 10 years despite what he called evident lack of interest taken in proceedings of society by general public in early years minutes of meeting 1 june 1903 rahs cited by society got off to a shaky start with low attendance of lectures and meetings early papers delivered by selfe included a century of sydney cove and some notes on sydney windmills slowly interest increased and by 1905 membership had reached 100 known as royal australian historical society rahs since 1918 and housed in a grand victorian style townhouse on macquarie street organisation is australia s oldest historical society selfe is celebrated as one of its pioneers technical education selfe was a key figure in history of technical education in new south wales he advocated a more utilitarian and less literary education system to produce a skilled workforce that could realise australia s potential as an efficient industrial state he was utopian in his vision there is no doubt that it is on work of tools directed by brains that future of australia depends more than anything else with tools our australian deserts may be turned into gardens they will pluck hidden treasure from bowels of earth enable us to soar in air or explore depths of water they will weave a network of communication over our island continent dot it with homes of a happy people and minister to our wants in providing not only necessities and comforts of life but most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy novel and exacting wants which arise every day as standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us p 10 cited in l a mandelson 1972 pp 128 131 selfe believed an overhaul of education was needed from kindergarten to tertiary study his concept of technical education encompassed friedrich frobel s kindergarten activities based around play and occupations teaching of drawing manual work and science in schools and specialised practical training of workmen and professionals in technical colleges he argued for establishment of a new kind of university an industrial university less theory oriented and more concerned with practical and useful he saw technical education as a distinct sphere of education to be administered and delivered by people with practical industry experience not government officials or traditional teachers teacher thumb right alt sepia photograph of buildings of technical college unsealed harris street runs across foreground and mary anne street goes into distance over a hill with collection of buildings and their elaborate brickwork standing on corner sydney technical college in ultimo c 1890 as early as 1865 selfe gave regular classes in mechanical drawing to tradesmen at sydney mechanics school of arts in pitt street selfe s class in mechanical drawing was first technical vocational offering at school of arts and its popularity led to introduction of other practical subjects due to colony s rapidly expanding population and demand for skilled labour there were increasing calls in 1870s for a formal system of technical education in 1870 selfe helped found engineering association of new south wales which amalgamated into engineers australia in 1919 he was its president from 1877 to 1879 and engineers australia annually awards norman selfe medal to a student at australian maritime college in 1878 association joined forces with new south wales trades and labour council and sydney mechanics school of arts to form technical and working men s college college initially operated as an agency of sydney mechanics school of arts college occupied premises in pitt sussex and castlereagh streets and rooms in royal arcade before it moved to ultimo in 1889 college later became sydney technical college out of which grew university of new south wales university of technology sydney and national art school ultimo buildings still serve their original purpose now as main campus of sydney institute of tafe in 1880 selfe became vice president of school of arts he supported school s working men s college but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed he rejected non technical non practical approach of school s model and campaigned instead for establishment of a proper institute of technical education where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience he also pushed for expansion of technical education facilities into suburban and regional districts critic on 1 august 1883 new south wales government made a proclamation which transferred control of technical and working men s college to an independent board of technical education to which selfe was appointed and assumed financial responsibility directly nsw government gazette no 324 1 august 1883 p 4173 government also provided funds to fit out workshops in kent street that opened in 1886 this was an initiative driven by selfe who had admired workshop teaching model abroad it represented a major innovation in technical education in new south wales many of board s initiatives were based on observations made abroad by selfe and board president edward combes or recommendations made by british royal commission into technical education of 1881 84 however most of board s schemes were frustrated by an unresponsive colonial government norm neill historian of early years of sydney technical college argues that board caused many of its own problems there was a marked lack of unity members either resigned or became inactive and board failed to accept that its autonomy was more nominal than real any expansion of technical education was dependent on government funding and governments were unlikely to allocate resources to an organisation unwilling or unable to cooperate selfe was president of board from january 1887 until it was disbanded in 1889 during this time relationship between board and government deteriorated with selfe being overtly critical of two powerful institutions newly formed department of public instruction and university of sydney selfe strongly opposed government s taking control of technical education which had been underway since government first declared its interest in doing so at a special meeting of sydney mechanics school of arts in september 1883 he also did not support an alternative proposal that university of sydney should take over in an address at annual presentation of prizes at sydney technical college in 1887 selfe alienated minister for public instruction and others by being openly contemptuous of traditional pursuits of schools and universities t he whole experience of past goes to show that learning of schools has had little if anything to do with material advancement of world and that while it may have produced intellectual giants subjective teaching has not brought forth those men who have been inventors and manufacturers that have entirely changed character of our civilisation selfe criticised classical liberal arts education offered at university of sydney as elitist in his 1888 address to sydney technical college students on prize night he again caused affront to establishment when he called for greater diversity of educational opportunities in colony i t is not easy to see why general public should pay so many thousands a year to make our future professional men in medicine and law in colony to form part of so called upper classes when our principles will not allow us to pay just a little more in order to have say our locomotives made here and when we are doing so very little proportionately to train and educate artisans who make these locomotives and who belong to a much less wealthy and influential level in society in 1889 colonial government already in financial control assumed direct operational control by abolishing board and placing college within technical education branch of department of public instruction now new south wales department of education reformer in early years of 20th century education remained a major political issue in new south wales while selfe would not be drawn again into centre of fray he supported efforts of his sister maybanke and her second husband francis anderson towards education reform following turner royal commission into new south wales education in 1902 and appointment of peter board as director of education in 1905 many of selfe s ideas for technical education were implemented ultimately in 1949 a separate department of technical education was created and new south wales university of technology later university of new south wales was established at kensington les mandelson historian of australia s education systems categorises selfe as a nineteenth century protagonist for new education who helped pave way for extensive reforms of twentieth century without him he adds education in late nineteenth century would have been decidedly more mundane however mandelson sounds a critical note selfe s contempt for liberal arts tradition and priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended these reflected and augmented one of less attractive features of australian ethos indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion selfe may have lost a battle but before long liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats to these selfe certainly contributed and what must be recognised is that in vehemence of struggle and in lauding of efficiency over culture much that was valuable in liberal arts tradition was lost biographer stephen murray smith is more generous in his assessment of selfe s contribution to education debates around turn of twentieth century selfe went beyond concept of helping working man to achieve a share of good things hitherto reserved for others towards concept of leading him to create good things for himself cited in arthur 2001 p 17 selfe was a noted activist for federation of australia being a member of central federation league edward dowling his colleague on inaugural board of australian historical society was also secretary of central league of australasian federation league and his former articled engineer john jacob cohen would later be elected at 1898 new south wales election in seat of petersham representing national federal party personal life when selfe obtained a steady job after his apprenticeship he brought his family with him from rocks to live at balmain selfe bought waterfront land and built twin terraced houses called normanton and maybank which are still at 21 and 23 wharf road birchgrove it is likely that selfe shared normanton with his widowed mother next door lived his brother harry his sister maybanke and his brother in law edmund wolstenholme selfe was a supportive brother both emotionally and materially his sister maybanke bore seven children to her first husband edmund four of whom died as infants from tuberculosis he also provided financial support after maybanke s marriage came to an end maybanke earned fame in her own right as a prominent suffragist and pioneer of education for women and girls in 1890s brother and sister campaigned together for education reform thumb left alt colour photograph of facade of a multi storey brick house with a tower amesbury designed by selfe and built in 1888 on 10 october 1872 at

norma catherine in 1888 in 1885 selfe bought land in ashfield and designed a grand house called amesbury described at time as having more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in colony including terracotta lyrebird reliefs by artist lucien henry on front wall and a tower purpose built for selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy built around 1888 to honour centenary of

pennant hills road house is still a local landmark notable for its distinctive tower and twin chimneys selfe was a committed citizen and a natural spokesman for local community to extent that when railways needed a name for locality community chose normanhurst though selfe himself felt that st normans would have been much more elegant and suggestive selfe norman july 1910 some account of st

died in his sleep norma reported that her father had been sanguine to end playful with his nephews and learning to play oboe however other reports suggest that selfe was concealing a bitter sense of
