buzz aldrin born edwin eugene aldrin jr january 20 1930 is an american engineer and a former astronaut and fighter pilot aldrin made three spacewalks as pilot of 1966 gemini 12 mission and as apollo lunar module pilot on 1969 apollo 11 mission he and mission commander neil armstrong were first two humans to land on moon born in glen ridge new jersey aldrin graduated third in class of 1951 from united states military academy at west point with a degree in mechanical engineering he was commissioned into united states air force and served as a jet fighter pilot during korean war he flew 66 combat missions and shot down two mig 15 aircraft after earning a sc d degree in astronautics from massachusetts institute of technology aldrin was selected as a member of nasa s astronaut group 3 making him first astronaut with a doctoral degree his doctoral thesis was line of sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous earning him nickname dr rendezvous from fellow astronauts his first space flight was in 1966 on gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity three years later aldrin set foot on moon at 03 15 16 on july 21 1969 utc nineteen minutes after armstrong first touched surface while command module pilot michael collins remained in lunar orbit a presbyterian elder aldrin became first person to hold a religious ceremony on moon when he privately took communion upon leaving nasa in 1971 he became commandant of u s air force test pilot school he retired from air force in 1972 after 21 years of service his autobiographies return to earth 1973 and magnificent desolation 2009 recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in years after leaving nasa he continued to advocate for space exploration particularly a human mission to mars and developed aldrin cycler a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to mars more efficient in regard to time and propellant he has been accorded numerous honors including presidential medal of freedom in 1969 and is listed in several halls of fame early life edwin eugene aldrin jr was born on january 20 1930 at mountainside hospital in glen ridge new jersey his parents edwin eugene aldrin sr and marion aldrin moon lived in neighboring montclair new jersey his father was an army aviator during world war i and assistant commandant of army s test pilot school at mccook field ohio from 1919 to 1922 but left army in 1928 and became an executive at standard oil aldrin had two siblings both sisters madeleine who was four years older and fay ann who was a year and a half older his nickname which became his legal first name in 1988 arose as a result of fay s mispronouncing brother as buzzer which was then shortened to buzz he was a boy scout with rank of tenderfoot scout aldrin did well in school maintaining an a average he played football and was starting center for montclair high school s undefeated 1946 state champion team his father wanted him to go to united states naval academy in annapolis maryland and enrolled him at nearby severn school a preparatory school for annapolis and even secured him an appointment from albert w hawkes one of united states senators from new jersey aldrin attended severn school in 1946 but had other ideas about his future career he suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes he faced down his father and told him to ask hawkes to change nomination to united states military academy at west point new york aldrin entered west point in 1947 he did well academically finishing first in his class his plebe first year he was a member of academy track and field team in 1950 he traveled with a group of west point cadets to japan and philippines to study military government policies of douglas macarthur during his trip korean war broke out on june 5 1951 he graduated third in class of 1951 with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering military career as one of highest ranking members of class aldrin had his choice of assignments he chose united states air force which had become a separate service in 1947 while aldrin was still at west point and did not yet have its own academy a 1949 agreement allowed up to of graduating classes of west point and annapolis to volunteer for air force between 1950 when agreement became effective and 1959 when first class graduated from united states air force academy about 3 200 west point cadets and annapolis midshipmen chose to do so he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and underwent basic flight training in t 6 texans at bartow air base in florida his classmates included sam johnson who later became a prisoner of war in vietnam two became friends at one point aldrin attempted a double immelmann turn in a t 28 trojan and suffered a he recovered in time to pull out at averting what would have been a fatal crash thumb left aldrin in cockpit of a 51st fighter interceptor wing f 86 sabre after shooting down a mig 15 fighter during korean war alt aldrin in a cockpit with canopy pulled back when deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly his father advised him to choose bombers because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills which could open up better prospects for career advancement aldrin chose instead to fly fighters he moved to nellis air force base in las vegas where he learned to fly f 80 shooting star and f 86 sabre like most jet fighter pilots of era he preferred latter in december 1952 aldrin was assigned to 16th fighter interceptor squadron which was part of 51st fighter interceptor wing at time it was based at suwon air base about south of seoul and was engaged in combat operations as part of korean war during an acclimatization flight his main fuel system froze at power which would have soon used up all his fuel he was able to override setting manually but this required holding a button down which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio he barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence he flew 66 combat missions in f 86 sabres in korea and shot down two mig 15 aircraft first mig 15 he shot down was on may 14 1953 aldrin was flying about south of yalu river when he saw two mig 15 fighters below him aldrin opened fire on one of migs whose pilot may never have seen him coming june 8 1953 issue of life magazine featured gun camera footage taken by aldrin of pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft thumb right aldrin s gun camera footage featured in life magazine alt six shots of a mig showing pilot bailing out aldrin s second aerial victory came on june 4 1953 when he accompanied aircraft from 39th fighter interceptor squadron in an attack on an airbase in north korea their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up he then spotted a mig approaching from above this time aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about same time they went through a series of scissor maneuvers attempting to get behind other aldrin was first to do so but his gun sight jammed he then manually sighted his gun and fired he then had to pull out as two aircraft had gotten too low for dogfight to continue aldrin saw mig s canopy open and pilot eject although aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open for his service in korea he was awarded two distinguished flying crosses and three air medals aldrin s year long tour ended in december 1953 by which time fighting in korea had ended aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at nellis in december 1954 he became an aide de camp to brigadier general don z zimmerman dean of faculty at nascent united states air force academy which opened in 1955 that same year he graduated from squadron officer school at maxwell air force base in alabama from 1956 to 1959 he flew f 100 super sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in 22nd fighter squadron 36th fighter wing stationed at bitburg air base in west germany among his squadron colleagues was ed white who had been a year behind him at west point after white left germany to study for a master s degree at university of michigan in aeronautical engineering he wrote to aldrin encouraging him to do same thumb left aldrin in cockpit of a lockheed t 33a shooting star as an instructor at bryan air force base texas alt aldrin in cockpit canopy tilted up through air force institute of technology aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at massachusetts institute of technology mit in 1959 intending to earn a master s degree his astrodynamics class was taught by richard two other usaf officers who later became astronauts david scott and edgar mitchell took this course around this time while another charles duke wrote his 1964 master s degree at mit under supervision of laurence r young aldrin enjoyed classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead in january 1963 he earned a sc d degree in astronautics his doctoral thesis was line of sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous dedication of which read in hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space this is dedicated to crew members of this country s present and future manned space programs if only i could join them in their exciting endeavors aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut although it meant foregoing test pilot training which was a prerequisite at time on completion of his doctorate aldrin was assigned to gemini target office of air force space systems division in los angeles working with lockheed aircraft corporation on enhancing maneuver capabilities of agena target vehicle which was to be used by nasa s project gemini he was then posted to space systems division s field office at nasa s manned spacecraft center in houston where he was involved in integrating department of defense experiments into project gemini flights nasa career aldrin s initial application to join astronaut corps when nasa s astronaut group 2 was selected in 1962 was rejected on grounds that he was not a test pilot he was aware of requirement and asked for it to be waived but request was turned down on may 15 1963 nasa announced another round of selections this time with requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1 000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft aldrin had over 2 500 hours of flying time of which 2 200 was in jets his selection as one of fourteen members of nasa s astronaut group 3 was announced on october 18 1963 this made him first astronaut with a doctoral degree which combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics earned him nickname dr rendezvous from his fellow astronauts aldrin was aware it was not always intended as a compliment upon completion of initial training each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise in aldrin s case it was mission planning trajectory analysis and flight plans gemini program jim lovell and aldrin were selected as backup crew of gemini 10 commander and pilot respectively backup crews usually became prime crew of third following mission but last scheduled mission in program was gemini 12 february 28 1966 deaths of gemini 9 prime crew elliot see and charles bassett in an air crash led to lovell and aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for gemini 9 which put them in position as prime crew for gemini 12 they were designated its prime crew on june 17 1966 with gordon cooper and gene cernan as their backups gemini 12 thumb right aldrin stands in space while in gemini 12 spacecraft with earth in background alt astronaut performing eva initially gemini 12 s mission objectives were uncertain as last scheduled mission it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions while nasa had successfully performed rendezvous during project gemini gravity gradient stabilization test on gemini 11 was unsuccessful nasa also had concerns about extravehicular activity eva cernan on gemini9 and richard gordon on gemini11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during eva but michael collins had a successful eva on gemini 10 which suggested that order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor it therefore fell to aldrin to complete gemini s eva goals nasa formed a committee to give him a better chance of success it dropped test of air force s astronaut maneuvering unit amu that had given gordon trouble on gemini11 so aldrin could focus on eva nasa revamped training program opting for underwater training over parabolic flight aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest it also encouraged performing tasks quickly whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately training in a viscous buoyant fluid gave a better simulation nasa also placed additional handholds on capsule which were increased from nine on gemini9 to 44 on gemini12 and created workstations where he could anchor his feet thumb left aldrin next to agena work station alt astronaut performing eva gemini 12 s main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle and fly spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity gradient stabilization perform docked maneuvers using agena propulsion system to change orbit conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three evas and demonstrate an automatic reentry gemini12 also carried 14 scientific medical and technological experiments it was not a trailblazing mission rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by gemini 9 and tethered vehicle exercise by gemini 11 even gravity gradient stabilization had been attempted by gemini 11 albeit unsuccessfully gemini12 was launched from launch complex 19 at cape canaveral on 20 46 utc on november 11 1966 gemini agena target vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before mission s first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle as target and gemini12 capsule drew closer together radar contact between two deteriorated until it became unusable forcing crew to rendezvous manually aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give lovell right information to put spacecraft in position to dock with target vehicle gemini12 achieved fourth docking with an agena target vehicle next task was to practice undocking and docking again on undocking one of three latches caught and lovell had to use gemini s thrusters to free spacecraft aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later flight plan then called for agena main engine to be fired to take docked spacecraft into a higher orbit but eight minutes after agena had been launched it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure mission and flight directors therefore decided not to risk main engine this would be only mission objective that was not achieved instead agena s secondary propulsion system was used to allow spacecraft to view solar eclipse of november 12 1966 over south america which lovell and aldrin photographed through spacecraft windows thumb right aldrin and jim lovell arrive on aircraft carrier after gemini12 mission alt astronauts in spacesuits exiting helicopter on aircraft carrier aldrin performed three evas first was a standup eva on november 12 in which spacecraft door was opened and he stood up but did not leave spacecraft standup eva mimicked some of actions he would do during his free flight eva so he could compare effort expended between two it set an eva record of two hours and twenty minutes next day aldrin performed his free flight eva he climbed across newly installed hand holds to agena and installed cable needed for gravity gradient stabilization experiment aldrin performed numerous tasks including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for project apollo a dozen two minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued his second eva concluded after two hours and six minutes a third 55 minute standup eva was conducted on november 14 during which aldrin took photographs conducted experiments and discarded some unneeded items on november 15 crew initiated automatic reentry system and splashed down in atlantic ocean where they were picked up by a helicopter which took them to awaiting aircraft carrier after mission his wife realized he had fallen into a depression something she had not seen before apollo program lovell and aldrin were assigned to an apollo crew with neil armstrong as commander lovell as command module pilot cmp and aldrin as lunar module pilot lmp their assignment as backup crew of apollo 9 was announced on november 20 1967 due to design and manufacturing delays in lunar module lm apollo 8 and apollo9 swapped prime and backup crews and armstrong s crew became backup for apollo 8 under normal crew rotation scheme armstrong was expected to command apollo 11 thumb left aldrin photographs a geological specimen while neil armstrong looks on alt aldrin and armstrong performing geological training in desert michael collins cmp on apollo8 prime crew required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine lovell took his place on apollo8 crew when collins recovered he joined armstrong s crew as cmp in meantime fred haise filled in as backup lmp and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo 8 while cmp usually occupied center couch on takeoff aldrin occupied it rather than collins as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before collins arrived apollo11 was second american space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space first being apollo 10 next would not be flown until sts 26 in 1988 deke slayton who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments gave armstrong option to replace aldrin with lovell since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with armstrong thought it over for a day before declining he had no issues working with aldrin and thought lovell deserved his own command early versions of eva checklist had lunar module pilot as first to step onto lunar surface however when aldrin learned that this might be amended he lobbied within nasa for original procedure to be followed multiple factors contributed to final decision including physical positioning of astronauts within compact lunar lander which made it easier for armstrong to be first to exit spacecraft furthermore there was little support for aldrin s views among senior astronauts who would command later apollo missions collins has commented that he thought aldrin resents not being first on moon more than he appreciates being second aldrin and armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training first lunar landing focused more on landing on moon and making it safely back to earth than scientific aspects of mission duo were briefed by nasa and usgs geologists they made one geological field trip to west texas press followed them and a helicopter made it hard for aldrin and armstrong to hear their instructor apollo 11 on morning of july 16 1969 an estimated one million spectators watched launch of apollo11 from highways and beaches in vicinity of cape canaveral florida launch was televised live in 33 countries with an estimated 25 million viewers in united states alone millions more listened to radio broadcasts propelled by a saturn v rocket apollo11 lifted off from launch complex 39 at kennedy space center on july 16 1969 at 13 32 00 utc 9 32 00 edt and entered earth orbit twelve minutes later after one and a half orbits s ivb third stage engine pushed spacecraft onto its trajectory toward moon about thirty minutes later transposition docking and extraction maneuver was performed this involved separating command module columbia from spent s ivb stage turning around and docking with lunar module eagle after lunar module was extracted combined spacecraft headed for moon while rocket stage flew on a trajectory past moon thumb left aldrin walks on surface of moon during apollo 11 alt aldrin stands on moon armstrong and lunar module are reflected in his

that followed crew saw passing views of their landing site in southern sea of tranquillity about southwest of crater sabine d at 12 52 00 utc on july 20 aldrin and armstrong entered eagle and began final preparations for lunar descent at 17 44 00 eagle separated from columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure craft was not damaged and that landing gear had correctly deployed throughout descent aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting eagle five minutes into descent burn and above surface of moon lm guidance computer distracted crew with first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them eagle landed at 20 17 40 utc on sunday july 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left as a presbyterian elder aldrin was first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on moon he radioed earth i d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in whoever and wherever they may be to pause for a moment and contemplate events of past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way using a kit given to him by his pastor he took communion and read jesus s words from new testament s john 15 5 as aldrin records it i am vine you are branches whoever remains in me and i in him will bear much fruit for you can do nothing without me but he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over reading of genesis on apollo8 in 1970 he commented it was interesting to think that very first liquid ever poured on moon and first food eaten there were communion elements on reflection in his 2009 book aldrin said perhaps if i had it to do over again i would not choose to celebrate communion although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me it was a christian sacrament and we had come to moon in name of all mankind be they christians jews muslims animists agnostics or atheists but at time i could think of no better way to acknowledge enormity of apollo11 experience than by giving thanks to god aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on voyage back to earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of old testament s psalm 8 3 4 as aldrin records when i considered heavens work of thy fingers moon and stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him photos of these liturgical documents reveal conflict s development as aldrin expresses faith preparations for eva began at 23 43 once armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside eagle was depressurized and hatch was opened at 02 39 33 on july 21 aldrin set foot on moon at 03 15 16 on july 21 1969 utc nineteen minutes after armstrong first touched surface armstrong and aldrin became first and second people respectively to walk on moon aldrin s first words after he set foot on moon were beautiful view to which armstrong asked isn t that something magnificent sight out here aldrin answered magnificent desolation aldrin and armstrong had trouble erecting lunar flag assembly but with some effort secured it into surface aldrin saluted flag and armstrong took an iconic photo of scene aldrin positioned himself in front of video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about lunar surface to aid future during his experiments president nixon called duo to congratulate them on successful landing nixon closed with thank you very much and all of us look forward to seeing you on hornet on thursday aldrin replied i look forward to that very much sir after call aldrin began photographing and inspecting spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight aldrin and armstrong then set up a seismometer to detect and a laser beam reflector while armstrong inspected a crater aldrin began difficult task of hammering a metal tube into surface to obtain a core sample thumb right aldrin s lunar bootprint in a photo taken by him on july 21 1969 alt a bootprint in gray dust most of iconic photographs of an astronaut on moon taken by apollo11 astronauts are of aldrin armstrong appears in just two color photographs as sequence of lunar operations evolved aldrin explained neil had camera most of time and majority of pictures taken on moon that include an astronaut are of me it wasn t until we were back on earth and in lunar receiving laboratory looking over pictures that we realized there were few pictures of neil my fault perhaps but we had never simulated this during our training aldrin reentered eagle first but before ascending ladder he was first human to urinate on moon with some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to hatch using a flat cable pulley device armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket and aldrin tossed bag down it contained a mission patch for apollo 1 flight that ed white never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during launch rehearsal medallions commemorating yuri gagarin first man in space and vladimir komarov first man to die in a space flight and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations after transferring to lm life support explorers lightened ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks lunar overshoes an empty hasselblad camera and other equipment hatch was closed again at 05 01 and they lunar module and settled down to sleep at 17 54 utc they lifted off in eagle ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit after rendezvous with columbia ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit and columbia made its way back to earth it splashed down in pacific east of wake island at 16 50 utc 05 50 local time on july 24 total mission duration was 195 hours 18 minutes 35 seconds chance of bringing back pathogens from lunar surface was considered a remote possibility so divers passed biological isolation garments to astronauts and assisted them into life raft astronauts were winched on board recovery helicopter and flown to aircraft carrier where they spent first part of earth based portion of 21 days of quarantine on august 13 three astronauts rode in ticker tape parades in their honor in new york and chicago attended by an estimated six million people an official state dinner that evening in los angeles celebrated flight president richard nixon honored each of them with highest american civilian award presidential medal of freedom with distinction on september 16 1969 astronauts addressed a joint session of congress where they thanked representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding space effort astronauts embarked on a 38 day world tour on september 29 that brought astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries last leg of tour included australia south korea and japan crew returned to us on november 5 1969 after apollo 11 aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances in october 1970 he joined soviet cosmonauts nikolayev and vitaly on their tour of nasa space centers he was also involved in design of space shuttle with apollo program coming to an end aldrin now a colonel saw few prospects at nasa and decided to return to air force on july 1 1971 during his nasa career he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in eva post nasa activities aerospace research pilot school thumb aldrin as commandant of air force test pilot school alt aldrin in an air force colonel s uniform with five rows of ribbons and astronaut wings aldrin hoped to become commandant of cadets at united states air force academy but job went to his west point classmate hoyt s vandenberg jr aldrin was made commandant of usaf aerospace research pilot school at edwards air force base california aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience but a third of training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified f 104 starfighter to edge of space fellow group 3 astronaut and moonwalker alan bean considered him well qualified for job aldrin did not get along well with his superior brigadier general robert m white who had earned his usaf astronaut wings flying x 15 aldrin s celebrity status led people to defer to him more than higher ranking general there were two crashes at edwards of an a 7 corsair ii and a t 33 no lives were lost but aircraft were destroyed and accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision which placed blame on aldrin what he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one aldrin went to see base surgeon in addition to signs of depression he experienced neck and shoulder pains and hoped that latter might explain former he was hospitalized for depression at wilford hall medical center for four weeks his mother had committed suicide in may 1968 and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after gemini12 had contributed his mother s father had also committed suicide and he believed he inherited depression from them at time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career ending but could result in his being ostracized socially in february 1972 general george s brown paid a visit to edwards and informed aldrin that usaf aerospace research pilot school was being renamed usaf test pilot school and astronaut training was being dropped with apollo program winding down and air force budgets being cut air force s interest in space diminished aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on march 1 1972 after 21 years of service his father and general jimmy doolittle a close friend of his father attended formal retirement ceremony post retirement aldrin s father died on december 28 1974 from complications following a heart attack aldrin s autobiographies return to earth 1973 and magnificent desolation 2009 recounted his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in years after leaving nasa encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job aldrin worked selling used cars at which he had no talent periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct finally in october 1978 he quit drinking for good aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems including actor william holden holden s girlfriend stefanie powers had portrayed marianne a woman with whom aldrin had an affair in tv movie version of return to earth aldrin was saddened by holden s alcohol related death in 1981 bart sibrel incident on september 9 2002 aldrin was lured to a beverly hills hotel on pretext of being interviewed for a japanese children s television show on subject of space when he arrived moon landing conspiracy theorist bart sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a bible that moon landings were not faked after a brief confrontation during which sibrel followed aldrin despite being told to leave him alone and called him thief liar and coward 72 year old aldrin punched sibrel in jaw which was caught on camera by sibrel s film crew aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter witnesses said sibrel had aggressively poked aldrin with a bible additional mitigating factors were that sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention and that aldrin had no criminal record police declined to press charges against aldrin thumb left usaf thunderbirds

aldrin told an interviewer they had seen an unidentified flying object ufo documentary makers omitted crew s conclusion that they probably saw one of four detached spacecraft adapter panels from upper stage of saturnv rocket panels had been jettisoned before separation maneuver so they closely followed spacecraft until first mid course correction when aldrin appeared on howard stern show on august 15 2007 stern asked him about supposed ufo sighting aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were and are 99 9 percent sure object was detached panel according to aldrin his words had been taken out of context he made a request to science channel to make a correction but was refused polar expedition in december 2016 aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting amundsen scott south pole station in antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated first to mcmurdo station and from there to christchurch new zealand at 86 years of age

department s first chair rice daniel r 1992 clifford years university of north dakota 1971 1992 p 46 to further promote space exploration and to commemorate 40th anniversary of first lunar landing aldrin teamed up with snoop dogg quincy jones talib kweli and soulja boy to create rap single and video rocket experience proceeds from which were donated to aldrin s non profit foundation in 1985 aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as aldrin cycler aldrin e e cyclic trajectory concepts saic presentation to interplanetary rapid transit study meeting jet propulsion laboratory october 1985 cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to mars by using less propellant aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from earth to mars with a return trip to earth of same duration on a twin cycler orbit aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from purdue university in 1996 aldrin founded starcraft boosters inc to design reusable rocket launchers in december 2003 aldrin published an opinion piece in new york times criticizing nasa s objectives in it he voiced concern about nasa s development of a spacecraft limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability and declared goal of sending astronauts back to moon was more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs in a june 2013 opinion piece in new york times aldrin supported a human mission to mars and which viewed moon not as a destination but more a point of departure one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead mars and become a two planet species in august 2015 aldrin in association with florida institute of technology presented a master plan to nasa for consideration where
