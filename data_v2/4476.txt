occupation of yugoslavia drljevic had become a proponent of theory that montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from serbs as early as 1921 he had stated that serbian and montenegrin mentalities were diametrically opposed he stated mentalities of serbians and montenegrins are irreconcilable visage of former was speckled with ottoman slavery liberty gave latter a new visage it was not until 1941 that drljevic advanced notion that montenegrins were not slavs at all but dinaric people descended from ancient illyrians he wrote races are communities of blood whereas people are creatures of history with their language montenegrin people belong to slavic linguistic community by their blood however they belong to dinaric peoples according to contemporary science of european races dinaric peoples are descended from illyrians hence not just kinship but identity of certain cultural forms among dinaric peoples all way from albanians to south who are germanized illyrians retreat and death in spring of 1945 drljevic visited parts of montenegro held by chetniks of pavle durisic it was here that durisic made a safe conduct agreement with drljevic and with elements of armed forces of ndh although details of agreement are unknown it appears to have been agreed that durisic and his men were to move into ndh and cross sava river into slavonia where they would be aligned with drljevic as montenegrin national army with durisic retaining operational command suspicious of drljevic s intentions durisic tried to outsmart him and his forces by sending only his sick and wounded across sava keeping his fit troops south of river following his defeat at battle of field north of banja luka and defection of one of his sub units to drljevic durisic was forced to negotiate directly with leaders of ndh forces about further movement of his units towards slovenia this appears to have been a trap as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to meeting on 17 april 1945 after he returned to zagreb drljevic issued a proclamation with his political program and invited his army to fight both new yugoslavia and chetniks of draza mihailovic on 20 april durisic petar bacovic dragisa vasic and zaharije ostojic were taken to stara gradiska prison near jasenovac ustase gathered them in a field alongside 5 000 other chetnik prisoners and arranged for drljevic and his followers to select 150 chetnik officers and non combatant intellectuals for execution durisic bacovic vasic and ostojic were amongst those selected they and others were loaded onto boats by ustase and taken across sava river where they were killed either in jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh both ndh forces and drljevic had reasons for ensnaring durisic ndh forces were motivated by mass terror committed by durisic on muslim population in sandzak and southeastern bosnia while drljevic was opposed to durisic s support of a union of serbia and montenegro which ran counter to drljevic s separatism left without a leader majority of durisic s men were integrated into drljevic s montenegrin national army and withdrew with him towards austrian border in second half of may troops of montenegrin national army surrendered to british and were quickly turned back into yugoslavia and into hands of communists drljevic managed to evade capture and he and his wife sought refuge at a camp for displaced persons in austrian town of judenburg on 10 november 1945 three of durisic s followers discovered them there and murdered them by slitting their throats legacy in 1944
