blackadder goes forth is fourth and final series of bbc sitcom blackadder written by richard curtis and ben elton which aired from 28 september to 2 november 1989 on bbc one series placed recurring characters of blackadder baldrick and george in a trench in flanders during world war i and followed their various doomed attempts to escape from trenches to avoid death under misguided command of general melchett series references famous people of time and criticises british army s leadership during campaign culminating in poignant ending of its final episode despite initial concerns that comedy might trivialise war it was acclaimed and won british academy television award for best comedy series in 1989 in 2000 it was placed 16th by industry professionals in a list of 100 greatest british television programmes compiled by british film institute however some historians and politicians have criticised it for presenting an oversimplified view of war reinforcing popular notion of lions led by donkeys scenario blackadder goes forth is set in 1917 on western front in trenches of world war i captain edmund blackadder rowan atkinson is a professional soldier in british army who until outbreak of great war has enjoyed a relatively danger free existence fighting natives who were usually two feet tall and armed with dried grass finding himself trapped in trenches with another big push planned his concern is to avoid being sent over top to certain death series thus chronicles blackadder s attempts to escape trenches through various schemes most of which fail due to bad fortune misunderstandings and general incompetence of his comrades aforementioned comrades are his second in command idealistic upper class edwardian twit lieutenant george st barleigh hugh laurie and their profoundly stupid but dogged batman private s baldrick tony robinson first initial s is taken from first episode of blackadder third in which baldrick assumes his first name must be as when he introduced himself to other children when he was growing up they generally said yes we know sod off baldrick rather than germans who remain generally unseen with exception of private plane where they are a means to escape trenches blackadder s nemeses come in form of his superior eccentric general melchett stephen fry who rallies his troops from a french chateau from front and melchett s bureaucratic assistant captain kevin darling tim mcinnerny despite two being of equal rank blackadder treats darling with contempt while former is on front line latter is folding general s pyjamas their animosity is mutual largely as a result of blackadder exploiting comic potential of darling s surname at every opportunity although blackadder and darling are both captains darling has seniority because he s a staff officer this is signified by red tabs on collar of his uniform and red band on his service cap themes blackadder goes forth is darker in tone than previous three blackadder series and most sitcoms taking opportunity to present an anti war message dialogue is marked throughout by satirical musings about nature of war its origins and effects on soldiers who suffered over its course idea that soldiers suffered whilst their commanders remained safely distant from action was also referenced on many occasions such as when melchett says to baldrick don t you worry my boy if you should falter remember that captain darling and i are behind you to which blackadder responds about 35 miles behind you in episode corporal punishment blackadder justifies shooting for food of a carrier pigeon which turns out to be melchett s pet speckled jim by saying with 50 000 men getting killed a week who s going to miss a pigeon this episode sees blackadder being sentenced to death by firing squad for act a reference to capital sentences carried out under laws of war in force at time in private plane after receiving word that blackadder and baldrick may have been killed when shot down over german lines melchett tries to cheer george up by showing him a life size model measuring seventeen square feet of land recaptured by british a commentary on high human cost and small physical gains achieved by attacks in middle years of war later in same episode blackadder describes great war as a war which would be a damn sight simpler if we just stayed in england and shot fifty thousand of our men a week field marshal sir douglas haig whose orders are alleged to have resulted in hundreds of thousands of british deaths at passchendaele and somme is continually referenced paul fussell 1975 great war and modern memory blackadder himself describes haig s attempts at an advance as no more than another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to berlin in goodbyeee a scene parodies haig s professional abilities by depicting field marshal playing with toy soldiers which he sweeps nonchalantly from trench to trench and then into a rubbish bin while listening to blackadder s plea to get out of big push on telephone series recalls a number of famous historical events of war such as christmas truce of 1914 blackadder recalls event both sides advanced further during one christmas piss up than they did in next two and a half years of war references are also made to popular culture of era as well as previous series episode private plane sees return of characters of lord and bob from second series episode bells and also an appearance of famous flying ace baron von richthofen a plot thread in third episode major star involves blackadder s dislike of silent film star charlie chaplin whom he finds as funny as getting an arrow through neck and then finding there s a gas bill tied to it in fifth episode anti german sentiment in britain during war is repeatedly referenced general melchett orders blackadder to find out what is behind leak in top secret battle plans and immediately though erroneously pins it on a german spy who is later discovered to be inadvertently one of their own blackadder takes chance to interrogate captain darling who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is as british as queen victoria to which blackadder sarcastically replies so your father is german you re half german and you married a german blackadder s retort references fact that victoria was a member of house of hanover and that her husband was a prince from house of saxe coburg and gotha in 1917 victoria s grandson king george v changed royal house name from saxe coburg and gotha to windsor in an effort to appease british nationalist feelings final episode of this series goodbyeee although true to series usual comedy style through most of preceding scenes is known for featuring a highly intense and important final scene where main characters except general melchett are finally sent over top to sound of a slow minimal and downbeat piano version of title theme four are seen in slow motion charging into fog and smoke of no man s land with gunfire and explosions all around before scene fades into footage of a sunny poppy field and sound of birdsong fate of four is left ambiguous blackadder s final line before charge is also delivered with an unusually thoughtful and bittersweet tone offered after baldrick claims to have one last cunning plan to save them from impending doom episodes series aired for six episodes broadcast on bbc one on thursdays at 9 30pm between 28 september and 2 november 1989 ending nine days before remembrance day titles of first five episodes captain cook corporal punishment

chin nah poo toodle oo goodbye ee production writing and rehearsals writers ben elton and richard curtis wrote scripts for blackadder episodes separately using word processors and then swapped disks containing scripts for each other to add or remove jokes and dialogue curtis recalls that they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny then it was never put back during rehearsals script was exhaustively discussed and by cast with richard curtis having final say on content fry laurie and atkinson were comic writers and performers themselves and having worked together on previous series were not afraid to question script and make suggestions for example captain darling was originally called captain cartwright and was renamed when stephen fry recalled a boy at his school with surname darling who had found name a constant embarrassment curtis recalls that he was initially reluctant to change name as he considered it a one off joke speaking to times about ending of show in 1989 curtis hinted that collaborative writing process caused tensions amongst cast everybody on show thinks they can put in good jokes despite fact that ben elton and i think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with it does usually end up funnier but it s time to do something over which i have more control twenty years on curtis recalled in documentary blackadder rides again that they would literally sit around for entire time discussing script sometimes we would just say to them if you stood up and tried to act this script out you would find out things about it ben elton stated that by opening it up they allowed cast to question every aspect of script during blackadder rides again tony robinson likewise recalls that these script meetings could be uncomfortable and has been less reserved speaking about script rehearsals since in an interview with daily telegraph he suggests that although relations between actors were generally cordial there was bad feeling between writers and performers writers felt we were unilaterally altering script and altering it for worse at end of first day of rehearsals writers would go away and by time they came back we would have changed an awful lot of it by end they felt we had run away with it there were quite a lot of emotions flashing around about that producer john lloyd speaking to times in 1989 hinted that it was draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to writers deciding not to make another series things do get very tense by end of a series because everyone involved in thing is very clever and very funny and they all want to push scripts along it s a very exhausting process and by end of it we all swear we ll never ever do another one but then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in same room and you talk yourself into doing another series casting thumb 250px alt main members of cast of blackadder goes forth are seated in production s world war

third series to include stephen fry as general melchett and tim mcinnerny as captain kevin darling who had both appeared in guest roles in blackadder third and had appeared regularly in blackadder ii this cast appeared together in every episode of fourth series although only episode to feature no guest appearances was captain cook miranda richardson who had played elizabeth i in second series appeared in a guest role in one episode as she had in third series in their guest performances actors such as rik mayall and gabrielle reprised characters they had played in earlier series other performers such as bill wallis and lee who had played minor roles in prior series appeared briefly again in fourth series as well taping this series of blackadder was one of first television programmes in britain to be made and transmitted with stereo sound using digital system even though most viewers could only afford or were only able to receive due to their location standard fm mono audio carrier signal bbc engineering eng inf 1991 21 march 2012 series was directed by richard boden and all interior scenes were shot at bbc television centre in front of a live studio audience rowan atkinson recalls that studio shooting could present him with problems that sitcom tradition is very strange when you re performing to both a camera and an audience at same time thing that sometimes held us up is my stammer some words and some phrases did catch me out b s in particular i remember one episode in which stephen fry and hugh laurie were going woof a lot and my line was it s like battersea dogs home in here b of battersea was a problem for me floor manager suggested that i say crufts instead atkinson has said that in buildup to final episode he began to psychologically experience something of his character s apprehension speaking to michael parkinson in 2003 he recalled i remember in weeks leading up to one day recording of that final episode when we went over top for first time in my acting career knowing that even though rest of episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self there was this deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed it was most peculiar i m sure serious character actors feel this all time obviously if you re trying to feel character and his dilemma then you re going to experience some of fictional feelings for real you felt swept along by it other than title sequence series used little external shooting to achieve flying sequences in episode private plane footage from 1976 film aces high was re edited and dubbed over with actors voices most challenging scene to shoot was final over top sequence which was recorded in a separate studio set away from audience which had been rigged with special effects to simulate a battlefield on viewing original studio rushes for 20th anniversary documentary blackadder rides again john lloyd recalls that originally final scene was all very embarrassing as actors only had to run before they reached barbed wire in front of camera where they had to pretend to die an effect described by atkinson as somewhat unconvincing it was only in post production that final effect was achieved by running video and audio in slow motion and fading another video of empty set over top to make it appear as if characters had disappeared this image of a barren landscape was then faded into a still image of a poppy field found in bbc picture library titles and music theme melody was a variation on blackadder theme by howard goodall over opening title images of blackadder and george parading their men past melchett and darling while baldrick plays triangle title music starts with opening bars of british grenadiers before segueing into familiar blackadder theme in closing credits full blackadder theme plays over visuals of armed men marching on a parade ground sequences were filmed and recorded on location at former colchester cavalry barracks with production using fifty members of 3rd battalion royal anglian regiment to represent blackadder s men attired in reproduction first world war uniforms with battalion s band providing music titles are presented as static captions instead of being rolled as in previous three series crew credits are presented in pseudo military fashion for example designer is credited thus dgr hull c opening sequence is filmed in colour while closing sequence was treated in post production to appear grainy streaky and sepia toned in imitation of newsreels of era goodbyeee has no closing titles simply fading from protagonists charging across no man s land under fire to a field of poppies in sunlight a reference to poem in flanders fields and flower s symbolic significance music was also changed to a slow echoey solo piano arrangement recorded in a school gymnasium finishing with three strong bass drum notes interposed with sound effects of gunshot and later birdsong in 25th anniversary special interview richard curtis stated that production team had not intended for such an ending and idea of scene fading to poppy field was only conceived after some of cast stated their reluctance in doing a second take reception subject emma hanna in her book great war on small screen has noted that some contemporary reviewers felt topic of first world war to be inappropriate for a comedy series with one newspaper critic uncertain of writers motives is series justified in using tragic situations as a springboard for comedy merely for entertainment value ben elton s uncle historian geoffrey elton was at first most unhappy at what he considered to be an insulting portrayal of army although he later took view that satire was drawn with great respect certainly issue of series subject matter was of concern to producers atkinson recalled in an interview with michael parkinson that poignant ending of final episode was in part written to counter possibility of criticism that subject was inappropriate for a comedy although noted that public accepted series for what it was rowan atkinson interview on parkinson 29 march 2003 available on bbc worldwide s youtube page speaking during filming in 1989 he remarked that despite 20th century setting trenches were particularly apt for blackadder series we wanted a place and a time that could reproduce to a certain extent claustrophobia and of medieval england and best way to do that is to set it in middle of a war co writer richard curtis has said that before writing series writers read a number of books about war and decided that first world war was a particularly apt subject for a situation comedy finding that actually all lead up to first world war was very funny all people coming from communities where they d never bumped into posh people and all being so gung ho and optimistic first hundred pages of any book about world war are hilarious then of course everybody dies i have a cunning plan 20th anniversary of blackadder bbc radio 4 documentary broadcast 23 august 2003 excerpts available at bbc co uk comedy blackadder interviews michael brooke assessing series for british film institute suggests that characterisation and pervading sense of danger prevented sitcom from trivialising its subject matter prospect of its characters suddenly dying a violent death provided a constant source of tension and gags though when they really were killed off at end of final episode result was so unexpectedly moving that programme was later repeated as part of an otherwise wholly serious bbc2 armistice day programme without anyone batting an eyelid brooke michael retrieved 10 july 2010 awards series won british academy television award for best comedy series in 1989 in addition for his performance as captain blackadder rowan atkinson won best light entertainment performance in 2000 series was placed 16th by industry professionals in a list of 100 greatest british television programmes compiled by british film institute in 2004 championed by john sergeant whole blackadder series came second in bbc poll to find britain s best sitcom with 282 106 votes legacy journalists and historians have noted that television series has become a pervasive view of war in public s perception of world war i with max hastings calling common british view of war blackadder take on history military historian richard holmes commented in his book western front blackadder s aphorisms have become fact a well turned line of script can sometimes carry more weight than all scholarly footnotes in world stephen badsey analysing trends in television programmes about war remarked that blackadder goes forth as a popular comedy series was subject to particular criticism from historians remarking that series consciously traded on every cliche and piece of history about western front and was influential enough to draw a surprising degree of angry criticism from professional historians as a result series has prompted debate among politicians in uk in 2014 it was subject of a public dispute between conservative politician michael gove then serving as secretary of state for education and labour activist sir tony robinson after gove had written that it presented war as a misbegotten shambles a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out of touch elite even to this day there are left wing academics all too happy to feed those myths robinson responded to categorise teachers who would introduce something like blackadder as left wing and introducing left wing propaganda is very very unhelpful and i think it s particularly unhelpful and irresponsible for a minister in charge of education tristram hunt also criticised gove s comments but andrew compared series to oh what a lovely war as a take on history that had sadly been in ascendant for past 50 years esther stewart of sussex university noted in her essay television docu drama and first world war that blackadder goes forth is used as a teaching aid in schools not as a secondary text that should be analysed and discussed for its own reliability but as a truthful parody sic of conditions of first world war broadcaster jeremy paxman criticised schools for relying on episodes of blackadder goes forth to teach pupils about conflict media releases blackadder goes forth is available on a variety of bbc worldwide
