holding caucuses here and there doing a little electioneering to get their men in however van amburgh and i held a large number of votes many shareholders knowing of our long association with russell sent their proxies to us to be cast for one whom we thought best fitted for office macmillan who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing russell months earlier to accept position of president after his death agreed with van amburgh that rutherford was best candidate according to macmillan rutherford did not know what was going on he certainly didn t do any electioneering or canvassing for votes but i guess he was doing some worrying knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands there is no doubt in our minds that lord s will was done in this choice it is certain that rutherford himself had nothing to do with it presidency dispute on january 6 1917 rutherford aged 47 was elected president of watch tower society unopposed at pittsburgh convention by laws passed by

counting days to armageddon cambridge james clarke co 1996 pp 84 85 one of rutherford s first actions as president was without reference either to his fellow directors or to editorial committee which russell had nominated in his will to commission a seventh volume of studies in scriptures responsibility for preparing this volume was given to two of russell s close associates george h fisher and clayton j woodworth on face of it their brief was to edit for publication notes left by russell and to draw upon his published writings it is obvious that it was not in any straightforward sense result of editing russell s papers rather it was in large measure original work of woodworth and fisher at behest of new president was denounced by rutherford s opponents but became a best seller and was translated into six languages and serialized in watch tower expecting god s kingdom to establish rule on earth and for saints to be raised to heaven in 1918 rutherford wrote in january of that

began to abolish system of electing elders by congregational voting dismissing them as haughty and lazy and finally asserting in 1932 that electing elders was unscriptural he impressed on elders need to obey society s regulations instructions and directions without complaint service directors who reported back to brooklyn were appointed in each congregation and a weekly service meeting introduced

watchtower society changed interpretation ending 2300 days in 1944 rather than 1932 at a 1931 bible student assembly in columbus ohio rutherford proposed a new name for organization jehovah s

1940 author tony wills who analyzed attendance and field worker statistics suggests it was more dedicated bible students who quit through 1920s to be replaced by newcomers in larger numbers although rutherford dismissed loss of original bible students as lord shaking out unfaithful 1931 yearbook watch tower bible tract society p 57 in 1942 yearbook of jehovah s witnesses rutherford wrote that

russell s posthumous volume entitled finished mystery 7th in series of his studies in scriptures and published subsequent to his death in this posthumous volume which is called his last legacy to christians of earth is found a thorough exposition of every verse in entire book of revelation but contained several interpretations and viewpoints not espoused by russell tony mills a people for his name 2007 pp 97 8 while he keeps faithfully to russell s comments in most cases there are a few times when he goes beyond russell s plainly stated interpretation in some of chapters of revelation on which russell left no comments his imagination wandered free he ridicules john wesley whom russell admired and his methodist movement he calls europeans most cruel bloodthirsty quarrelsome rapacious people on earth a thought russell denied he ridicules calvinists by saying that they have lost their manhood reason and common sense he ridicules politics patriotism religion and almost everything world holds holy without as russell was careful to do presenting good along with bad bible students tract society notes and comments on finished mystery feb 1919 pp 6 7 thus we have bro woodworth s distinct statement that none of these interpretations of revelation are pastor russell s but another s presumably his own have pastor russell s interpretations been followed to this we reply that in many cases they have not on contrary entirely contradictory ones are frequently given including an urging of all bible students to cast judgment upon christendom and its clergy adoption of new dates for fulfillment of particular prophecies a claim that salvation is tied to membership within watch tower society as well as shunning and censuring any who reject interpretations given in volume or related articles in zion s watch tower magazine thumb right millions now living will never die contains some of earliest doctrinal right newspaper advertisement for rutherford s millions lecture in

jubilees brings us to this important fact seventy jubilees of fifty years each would be a total of 3500 years that period of time beginning 1575 before a d 1 of necessity would end in fall of year 1925 despite russell s rejection of such a change a few months prior to his death watch tower april 15 1916 p 127 we cannot help it that many of dear friends continue to tell what watch tower believes and to misrepresent its teachings our kindest thought must be that they are not giving much heed to its teachings otherwise they would know from its columns that we are not looking forward to 1925 nor to any other date as expressly stated in watch tower we are simply going on our last date or appointment having been passed more than a year ago we have no different time in mind from scriptures on subject and do not expect to have any in october 1920 society published a new edition of russell s 1881 tabernacle shadows of better sacrifices it included an appendix introducing many alterations or reinterpretations of russell s original views on death of jesus and role of christ s followers in heaven as typified in ceremonies of jewish tabernacle tabernacle shadows of better sacrifices 1920 appendix of notes pp 133 155 thirty nine years have passed since publication of this little booklet and during that time some of teachings herein contained have come to be seen in clearer light even as details of a mountain become more discernible closer one draws to it in harmony with these clearer understandings we suggest following alterations in appendix form leaving text intact out of deference to honored and beloved writer of booklet at 1922 cedar point convention rutherford began teaching that christ s reign had begun in 1914 watchtower december 15 1922 p 394 and not 1878 as russell had taught how long o lord zion s watch tower january 1881 rutherford expanded on this view in march 1 1925 issue of watch tower in article birth of nation which he later acknowledged caused a real stir or shake up within ranks in 1927 he moved date of resurrection of sleeping saints all christians who had died since jesus time from 1878 to june 1 1927 p 166 light by j f rutherford watch tower bible tract society 1930 p 226 and as early as 1930 began to dismiss year 1874 as date for invisible presence of christ in favor of year 1914 golden age may 7 1930 p golden age march 14 1934 p 380 prior to 1914 and years thereafter we thought that our lord s return dated from 1874 and we took it for granted that parousia or presence of our lord dated from that time an examination of scriptures containing word parousia shows that presence of lord could not date prior to 1914 from 1925 he developed view of battle of armageddon as a universal war waged by god rather than russell s belief that it was decline of human society into social political and religious anarchy rutherford based his interpretations on books of exodus jeremiah ezekiel and psalms as well as additional material from books of samuel kings and chronicles can this world s armageddon be avoided watchtower december 1 1966 p 730 an article in january 1 1926 watch tower introduced new emphasis on importance of name jehovah from 1929 rutherford taught that vindication of god s name which would ultimately occur when millions of unbelievers were destroyed at armageddon was primary doctrine of christianity and more important than god s display of goodness or grace toward humankind j f rutherford prophecy watch tower bible tract society 1929 pp 319 328 f rutherford vindication watch tower

persecution of jehovah s witnesses that would culminate in god intervening on their behalf to begin battle of armageddon which would destroy all opposers of god s organization in 1926 he discredited russell s teaching on importance of christian character development or personal sanctification character or covenant which watchtower may 1 1926 and a year later discarded teaching that russell had been faithful and wise servant of matthew 24 45 47 warning that desire to revere men was a snare set by devil watchtower january 1 1927 p 7 in may 1926 rutherford released his book deliverance at

subtle hand in matter and that he is back of movement to turn people away from god neither man nor woman should be worshiped for doing right because such doing of right is their duty creature worship

years earlier that prophecies of their restoration were already being fulfilled with british takeover of palestine from turkey during world war i he denied there was a role for jews in god s kingdom

tongues wagging at fair grounds and resulted in another overhauling of old trunk wherein are kept a few choice relics of what until recently we honestly believed bible teaches in 1930 rutherford published a systematic reinterpretation of book of revelation light book 1 and 2 1930 many of symbols recorded in book were applied to events following 1918 specifically to watch tower conventions held in years 1922 through 1928 light book 1 1930 p 106 these reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as historicist interpretations of pastor russell finished mystery p watch tower nov 15 1916 p 343 at a washington d c convention in 1935 rutherford rejected russell s teaching that great company of revelation 7 9 was a secondary spiritual class

who could potentially survive armageddon and receive everlasting human life on earth if they became jehovah s witnesses before it began in 1935 rutherford objected to u s state laws requiring school students to salute flag as a means of instilling patriotism in 1936 yearbook he declared that baptized jehovah s witnesses who did salute flag were breaking their covenant with god and were thus guilty of death yearbook 1936 p 22 saluting of or salutation to a flag means this i depend on what flag represents for my salvation those who know and serve god in spirit and in truth look to jehovah god for salvation and not to any man or any man made organization it therefore follows that saluting of any flag by those who are in covenant with jehovah god to do his will constitutes breaking of that covenant with god and such covenant breakers are guilty of death in 1940 children in 43 states were expelled for refusing to salute flag and watch tower society took most cases to court with rutherford personally leading unsuccessful case of school district v controversy over flag salute issue escalated and mob attacks became prevalent in many u s states until 1943 when court overruled its previous decision in case of west virginia state board of education v barnette a u s law magazine noted how jehovah s witnesses had helped shape course of constitutional law remarking through

eloquent forceful speaker watch tower society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor one witness history book says that while russell was kind warm and tactful rutherford was warm and generous toward his associates but he was also a brusque and direct type of person and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense another watch tower society account says he did not hide his feelings adding his bluntness even when spoken in kindness was sometimes misunderstood fellow watch tower society director a h macmillan says rutherford spoke as simply and directly to people as he knew how and he was an extremely forthright man he was thoroughly convinced that what he had to say was truth and that it was a matter of life and death macmillan added he would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood bible to teach he was so strict about that he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of truth author tony wills describes him as charitable and

sarcasm and ridicule his face expressed more contempt than that of any other face upon which i have ever looked p 14 with a streak of self righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of devil while alan rogerson notes that he was a dogmatic and insensitive person obsessed with his own self importance rutherford s confrontation with four watch tower society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both forcefulness of his personality and his determination to fight for what he believed was right penton claims rutherford played hard fisted church politics and rogerson accuses rutherford of using watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president at heart of his opponents complaints was his autocratic behavior as he strove to exercise complete management of society and its affairs penton similarly describes rutherford s actions in his first year of presidency including his appointment of new directors refusal to allow society s accounts to be examined and his unilateral decision to publish finished mystery as high handed and secretive in contrast rutherford claimed it was my duty to use power lord had put into my hands to support interests of shareholders and all others interested in truth throughout world to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to lord

towards clergy his avowed enemies as unadulterated hatred his attacks on clergymen particularly those of catholic church from late 1920s were strong enough to attract a ban on his broadcasts by nbc

isolated part of ground which would be administered by princes who should return from their graves consolation may 27 1942 based on his claims that resurrected biblical characters would live at beth sarim rutherford concluded that it was appropriate that his bones be buried on property legal problem arose because beth sarim was not a legally zoned cemetery witnesses collected more than 14 000
