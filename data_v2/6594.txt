state department officials held secret meetings near washington d c with sudan s then defense minister el fatih erwa in may 1996 bin laden left sudan for afghanistan under pressure from united states when meetings failed to reconcile u s demands made of khartoum about its record in aiding abetting and harboring known terrorist groups and individuals ijaz first met sudanese president omar al bashir and other sudanese leaders in august 1996 and reported his findings back to u s government officials including lee hamilton ranking member of house committee on international relations at time and sandy berger then clinton s deputy national security adviser and susan rice then director for african affairs at national security council initially khartoum sought u s sanctions relief particularly

allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin laden s involvement in training terrorists in somalia some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed u s black hawk helicopters in mogadishu in october 1993 any evidence of bin laden s involvement in criminal activity against u s interests such as training militia members who attacked u s troops in 1993 could have been grounds for indicting him far before sudan expelled saudi fugitive in may 1996 however 9 11 commission found that although former sudanese officials claim that sudan offered to expel bin laden to united states we have not found any reliable evidence to support sudanese claim amb carney reportedly had instructions only to press sudanese to expel bin laden because u s government had no legal
