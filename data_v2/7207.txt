electronic arts had wanted to make a new syndicate game for several years but had not found an opportunity to do so they hoped to bring new elements and drastically altered gameplay concepts that would suit franchise s universe they eventually partnered with starbreeze which they recognized as an excellent studio for making first person video games with distinctive styling pre production of game began in 2007 it was carried out by a small team of staff members after studio completed work on chronicles of riddick assault on dark athena however mid way through game s development there were also many creative differences between developer and publisher and two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship during first stage of development game had no co operative multiplayer mode it focused on story instead of cyberpunk element a year after development began game was sent for reworking because studio thought they had not captured essence of syndicate series team had little experience in making a co operative games due to technological restraints but decided to experiment with it internal reception of co op prototype was positive testers said it fit with canonical fiction of franchise team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for game but thought it was not original enough for inclusion as game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element developers abandoned use of an online pass unlike most ea games at that time development team hoped new title would appeal to both newcomers and fans of series be accessible and introduce franchise to a broader audience they assumed most players would not have played original syndicate games team also considered that because of change in audience tastes and introduction of new video game platforms altering game s perspective to first person was a correct decision turning it into a first person game was first design choice made by team who hoped allowing players to view from agent s perspective directly would make game more immersive for players team aimed to replicate playing experience and difficulty of extant syndicate starbreeze considered difficulty of first game to be part of franchise s legacy and was worth preserving they hoped new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating they introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence ai into game ai reacts to players actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked new game has less gore than older one players still can kill innocent civilians but team minimized these scenarios which they thought were part of game s environment rather than gameplay elements game was designed to have a sense of unpredictability so it can be played without confining player to rules to achieve this company added breaching system which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with artificial intelligence breaching system which originated as a mini game was designed to be simple so it would not interrupt flow of gameplay instead of being purely a first person shooter game features action adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles because new game is set within a well established franchise starbreeze tried to retain essence of world and rebuild these elements game s story was written by british science fiction writer richard k morgan whom team approached after they read his book altered carbon syndicate was morgan s second video game script after 2011 s crysis 2 he used original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize he preserved original s dystopian setting and theme and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story morgan traveled to sweden to meet starbreeze s game designers to ensure game s story would not contradict its overall design thumb left screenshot shows art direction of game s upper zone which was inspired by a number of futuristic films team s goal was to make game different from contemporaneous first person shooters team ensured game had its own style that would differentiate itself from other games this was achieved by using a split world aspect which divided game s into two areas each with a different artstyle team added details and aesthetics to game s three syndicates in upper zone so they would easily be recognized and be different from each another downzone where non implanted poor people live has a different design from three syndicates team took ideas for this area from mirror s edge both sides were inspired by futuristic films such as blade runner minority report and gattaca in addition split world concept applies to gameplay downzone enemies tend to be more aggressive and anti agents and some gameplay segments such as breaching system are inapplicable in such areas syndicate uses starbreeze s in house game engine which had been modified for creation of game team used beast to achieve global illumination and a realistic lighting system and a new physics solver to deliver more physical interactions team aimed to maintain a consistent visual quality on all platforms on which game was released even though pc version had advantage of higher resolution and frame rate engine allowed inclusion of post process effects previously used in assault on dark athena such as motion blur and depth of field their artstyle was changed to suit game s overall style marketing in 2008 electronic arts announced that starbreeze studios was working with ea on two projects one was a new project set in one of ea s older franchises under name project redlime name syndicate was trademarked multiple times by starbreeze and ea and a small portion of game s script was accidentally leaked before game s official revelation ea officially revealed game on 12 september 2011 and announced that it is a reboot for franchise a demo of game which only included co op mode and western europe map was released for xbox live marketplace and playstation network on 31 january 2012 game was announced and shipped in under six months it was released worldwide on 21 february 2012 reception critical reception syndicate received generally positive reviews from critics game s story received mixed responses reviewer from gametrailers called plot predictable and considered several of game s plot points boring he praised game s dialogue for its flow and backstory presented reviewer said campaign lacked scale but was nevertheless enjoyable and worthwhile playing he also said celebrity led voice cast had successfully brought believability to game this was echoed by jeff gerstmann from giant bomb in contrast martin gaston from videogamer com said he was disappointed with campaign and considered it one of game s biggest flaws he said world deserves more exploration than it had in syndicate and that development team did not seem to understand creative vision of first version of game he also said emphasis on morals did not excel because it does not fit game s overall style he disliked game s protagonist who he thought was bland making him difficult for players to relate to de matos from joystiq said story is filled with promises but overall product failed to differentiate itself from other shooters with similar themes dan whitehead from eurogamer compared it unfavourably to its predecessors and called it unambitious and uninspiring overall gameplay received praise gaston described shooting as clever and said dart 6 breaching abilities have encouraged players to experiment he said combination of breaching system and gunfights made syndicate better than some other contemporaneous first person shooters gametrailers reviewer said dart 6 system provides players with choice and recharge time of breaching abilities tasks players with managing a micro economy that encourages and rewards skills both gaston and gametrailers said game missed out opportunities for limiting use of some of kilo s powers which are only shown in cutscenes gerstmann liked game s gameplay and said control was fun and that he appreciated ability to shoot while running he also admired breaching abilities and found them satisfying to use whitehead shared similar thoughts saying breaching abilities tasks players with deploying strategy and make game deeper than typical run and gun video games game s ai received praise gametrailers reviewer said enemies know how to die in style and that boss fights are memorable even though they can be repetitive gaston considered it missed opportunities de matos appreciated boss fights and said it was fun and interesting and tasks players with learning pattern of these boss fights and using correct skill to defeat them thumb left an example of game s bloom effect which was criticized reviewers praised game s graphical quality gerstmann said use of lighting added a unique style to game he also liked depiction of two major areas of game and game s sounds which he said suited tone of game alexandra hall from gamesradar said starbreeze really coaxed some beautiful sights out of aging hardware she added that some players may not be pleased with game s bloom effects david houghton of same publication said game is a decent shooter but that its effects were over top peter eykemans from ign echoed similar thoughts declaring that motion bloom and blinding light a problem however he admitted that game constantly looks great and that its simple design has made game to look very polished four player co operative multiplayer mode received acclaim gaston said it was a watered down version of left 4 dead but it was nonetheless a fun and pleasant experience for most players de matos said game had encouraged players to work together to defeat enemies and to plan before attacking which he said had turned mode to a gratifying experience he criticized game s difficulty which he said does not scale well and scripted enemies which made game less dynamic whitehead highly recommended co operative mode which he thought should have been game s main focus he added that it provided more freedom to players than campaign critics had mixed feelings about game gerstmann said he had an outstanding time with it and that it had offered an excellent twist to genre de matos said it had successfully branched out franchise to a new direction even though it may not be what players of original syndicate would expect however he said spirit of franchise is still maintained and preserved gaston said starbreeze was not able to capture franchise s vision and that game was not well executed overall whitehead described game as fun even though he thought syndicate was a forgettable experience that will live under shadow of rival shooters syndicate wars producer and lead programmer mike criticized game stating that it was nothing like original games this encouraged him to make a spiritual successor to syndicate wars called satellite reign which was a kickstarter success and garnered better reception than ea s reboot sales in an interview with computer and video games frank of ea said syndicate revival had not been as successful as had been hoped saying syndicate was something that we took a risk on it didn t pay off it didn t work in a 2012 interview with edge mikael nermark ceo of starbreeze studios said game sold around 150 000 copies worldwide according to nermark budget for creating this game was less than those of other triple a video games he also said that despite poor commercial performance team was still proud of final product australian censorship on 20 december 2011 it was reported that syndicate has been refused classification by australian classification board board was especially critical of what it considered to be game s excessive violence explicit depictions of dismemberment decapitation exposed flesh and bone from injuries and copious blood spray ea australia said they would not appeal decision or change game to address board s concerns ea also complained about australia s archaic censorship on games and said syndicate would be released on
