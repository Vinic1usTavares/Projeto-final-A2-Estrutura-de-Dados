led zeppelin iii is third studio album by english rock band led zeppelin released in october 1970 it had a more eclectic style than prior albums adding folk style songs to their standard hard rock and blues rock repertoire while hard rock influences were still present such as on immigrant song acoustic based songs such as gallows pole and that s way showed led zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully band wrote most of material themselves but as with prior records included two songs that were re interpretations of earlier works gallows pole based on a traditional english folk song by way of american singer fred gerlach and hats off to roy harper a reworking of a blues song by bukka white acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between band members jimmy page and robert plant at bron yr aur cottage in wales which influenced musical direction songs were recorded in three locations much of work was done at headley grange a country cottage using rolling stones mobile studio additional sessions were held in more traditional recording studios such as island studios and olympic studios in london as with prior album band eschewed use of guest musicians with all music played by band members page guitars plant vocals john paul jones bass keyboards and john bonham drums range of instruments played by band was greatly enhanced in this album with jones especially emerging as a talented multi instrumentalist playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments including various synthesizers mandolin and double bass in addition to his usual bass guitar as with prior albums page served as producer on album with mixing done by andy johns and terry manning album was one of most anticipated of 1970 and its shipping date was held up by intricate inner sleeve design based around a volvelle with numerous images visible through holes in outer cover it was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped uk and us charts although critics were typically confused over change in musical style and gave album a mixed response led zeppelin iii has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in band s history and a turning point in their music background alt thumb right many songs on led zeppelin iii were written by jimmy page and robert plant in bron yr aur cottage in wales by 1970 led zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both uk and us with their first two albums they were determined to have a proper break having recorded most of led zeppelin ii in various locations while on tour financing sessions with album sales and tour receipts following an exhausting concert tour of north america that spring lead singer robert plant recommended to guitarist and producer jimmy page that they should retreat to bron yr aur an 18th century cottage in snowdonia wales on a hilltop overlooking dyfi valley north of market town machynlleth plant had spent holidays there with his family this remote setting had no running water or electric power which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements page later explained tranquillity of bron yr aur stood in sharp contrast to continual touring of 1969 and affected overall tone of songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars his playing was influenced by folk guitarists davey graham and bert who regularly used alternative guitar tunings plant also recalled band were obsessed with change and enjoyed listening to john fahey band specifically wanted a change in direction to show they could play any style of music they wanted recording first recording sessions for led zeppelin iii took place at olympic studios in november 1969 a press statement from manager peter grant said group were recording a non album track to be released as a single but this was ultimately abandoned further sessions took place towards end of year in between touring before decision to stop work and take a break at bron yr aur after preparing material for album there page and plant were joined by drummer john bonham and bassist keyboardist john paul jones at headley grange a mansion in east hampshire to rehearse songs rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to sessions and band found it a more enjoyable environment to develop songs than a studio in city album was recorded between may and june 1970 at headley grange using rolling stones mobile studio and at olympic with further recording at island records basing street studios in notting hill following month mixing took place at ardent studios memphis in august 1970 partway through group s sixth american concert tour album was produced by page and engineered by andy johns and terry manning page had first met manning when latter s band lawson and four more had supported page s old band yardbirds in 1966 manning had been to several led zeppelin shows and this led to page asking him to engineer new album songs led zeppelin iii marked a change in focus for band from late 1960s hard rock to a psychedelic folk and acoustic sound these styles had been present to a lesser degree in band s first two releases such as babe i m gonna leave you and ramble on from first and second albums respectively however on this album group used more acoustic arrangements and they would remain prominent to various degrees in group s later releases with led zeppelin iii group s songwriting dynamic also changed from page s domination of first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas plant wrote all of lyrics with exception of tangerine side one immigrant song was written about viking invasions of england and inspired by a short tour of iceland in june 1970 it was released as a single in us and became a top 20 hit it was opening song for band s appearance at bath festival of blues and progressive music and subsequent gigs for next two years it was

it was written in bron yr aur about problems two people faced in a relationship and clashes with their families song became a staple part of group s acoustic set throughout 1970s and was played at bath festival where led zeppelin performed acoustically for first time in uk page thought highly of plant s lyrics and considered it a breakthrough in their development as a songwriting team pair had gone for a walk and on their return sat down by a ravine with a tape recorder where page started to play tune to which plant improvised a verse bron y aur stomp was originally called jennings farm blues and recorded as an electric arrangement at end of 1969 it was subsequently reworked as an acoustic number and featured bonham playing spoons closing track hats off to roy harper was based on bukka white blues song shake em on down and named as a tribute to their friend and folk singer roy harper original lp credited arrangement to charles obscure a band in joke it features plant s voice

mind later appeared on 2014 deluxe edition of album packaging and artwork alt thumb volvelle used on front cover led zeppelin iii s original vinyl edition was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an innovative cover designed by zacron a multi media artist whom page had met in 1963 whilst zacron was a student at kingston college of art zacron subsequently graduated at royal academy of arts and became a lecturer at university of leeds page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for album and on 24 january 1970 zacron met band at their gig at his university and agreed to do cover that spring he met band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them which would be put into collage cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation behind front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc or volvelle covered with more images including photos of band members which showed through holes in cover moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes back cover was a composite shot of best photographs from photography sessions zacron chose images because he wanted to show them as giant force they were in music in france this album was released with a different album cover simply showing a photo of four band members zacron later said that upon his completion of artwork page telephoned him while he was in new york to express his satisfaction with results saying i think it is fantastic hats off to zacron classic rock december 2007 he later thought artwork was unsatisfactory because of working to a deadline release and zeppelin iii was one of most anticipated albums of 1970 and advance orders in us alone were close to million mark volvelle designed sleeve held up production and caused a two month delay in run up to release group bought a full page advertisement in melody maker magazine at end of september which simply said thank you for making us world s number one band album was released in us on 5 october then in uk on 23 october it immediately topped british charts although band s expanding musical boundaries were greeted warmly by some detractors attacked heavier tracks as being mindless noise in a review in rolling stone critic lester bangs praised that s way as beautiful and genuinely moving while characterising band s heavier songs as crude and little differentiated from each other others criticised acoustic material for imitating music of crosby stills nash young which page disputed as group had featured that style on their previous albums page has also said that negative press given to third album affected him so much that he did not give press interviews for 18 months after its release and was also one of reasons why following album contained no written information on it at all he later came to believe that journalists had little time to listen to material and were simply looking for new whole lotta love instead of appreciating material on its own merits a positive review came from robert christgau in village voice who assigned it an a minus grade and wrote in his capsule review i have always approved theoretically of led zep s concept and now group has finally whipped it into shape it s amazing to realize that robert plant s vocals can convey that same overbearing power when page plays acoustic as he does to great effect on several cuts here no drum solos either heavy led zeppelin iii was a trans atlantic number one hit in uk it reached no 1 on 7 november 1970 and remained on chart for 40 weeks in us it entered chart at no 3 on 24 october and reached no 1 following week it remained on chart for 19 weeks and was certified gold on 8 october 1970 however following lukewarm if not confused and sometimes dismissive reception from critics sales lagged after this initial peak despite mostly indifferent reviews and lower sales than led zeppelin s previous two albums led zeppelin iiis reputation has recovered over time riaa certified album 2 times platinum in 1990 and 6 times platinum in
