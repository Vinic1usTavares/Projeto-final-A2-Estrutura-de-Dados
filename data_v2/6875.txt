serdity was one of 18 s officially known as project 7u built for soviet navy during late 1930s although she began construction as a project 7 serdity was completed in 1940 to modified project 7u design serving with baltic fleet she participated in minelaying operations after start of german invasion of soviet union operation barbarossa in june 1941 serdity engaged german minesweepers in irbe strait on 6 july without result and on 18 july was damaged by a friendly air attack while anchored off hiiumaa following day she was sunk by german bombers her survivors were taken off by other destroyers and what remained of ship was broken up for scrap postwar design originally built as a gnevny class ship serdity and her sister ships were completed to modified project 7u design after joseph stalin general secretary of communist party of soviet union ordered that latter be built with their boilers arranged en echelon instead of linked as in gnevnys so that a ship could still move with one or two boilers disabled rohwer monakov p 52 balakin p 8 like gnevnys project 7u destroyers had an overall length of and a beam of but they had a reduced draft of at deep load ships were slightly overweight displacing at standard load and at deep load crew complement of storozhevoy class numbered 207 in peacetime but this increased to 271 in wartime as more personnel were needed to operate additional equipment balakin pp 30 44 yakubov worth p 101 each ship had a pair of geared steam turbines each driving one propeller rated to produce using steam from four water tube boilers which designers expected would exceed speed of project 7s because there was additional steam available some fell short of it although specific figures for most individual ships have not survived variations in fuel oil capacity meant that range of project 7us varied from at yakubov worth pp 101 106 107 ships mounted four b 13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of superstructure anti aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34 k aa guns in single mounts and three 21 k aa guns hill p 42 as well as four dk or dshk machine guns they carried six torpedo tubes in two rotating triple mounts amidships ships could also carry a maximum of 58 to 96 mines and 30 depth charges they were fitted with a set of mars hydrophones for anti submarine work although these were useless at speeds over yakubov worth pp 101 105 106 construction and world war ii serdity was laid down in shipyard no 189 sergo ordzhonikidze in leningrad with yard number 298 on 25 october 1936 as a gnevny class destroyer with name of she was relaid down as a project 7u destroyer on 15 october 1938 and launched on 21 april 1939 ship was renamed serdity on 25 september 1940 before acceptance by a state commission on 15 october although she did not officially join baltic fleet until 12 april 1941 when soviet naval jack was raised aboard her balakin pp 67 pp 350 351 in days after 22 june beginning of operation barbarossa german invasion of soviet union serdity participated in minelaying with her sister ships of 2nd division on 24 and 26 june destroyer moved north to kuivastu roadstead on 27 june due to german advance and after departure of remainder of light forces detachment for tallinn she was left to defend gulf of riga with her sister and elderly destroyer destroyer expended 115 130 mm shells during 6 july battle of irbe strait against german minesweeping support ship 11 former osnabruck and her attached minesweepers due to an inexperienced gunnery officer who was unable to distinguish fall of s shells from those of his own ship all of shells missed she participated in an unsuccessful attack on a group of german landing craft off mouth of daugava river on 13 july rohwer p 86 under flag of light forces detachment commander admiral valentin drozd she and destroyer covered minelaying by guard ships and on 18 july by 14 00 of that day she returned to roadstead near saaremaa but quickly turned back after receiving a message that a german convoy had been spotted due a lack of coordination with soviet naval aviation both destroyers came under friendly air attack and at 15 31 a bomb dropped by a tupolev sb bomber exploded close to serdity killing one and wounding three sailors and knocking out a boiler and both rangefinders in conning tower steregushchy which escaped unscathed engaged german convoy escorts but was only joined by serdity at 17 24 when they had lost sight of convoy after escaping without serious damage from a german bombing raid on return journey serdity anchored in roadstead off hiiumaa by 19 july on that day she came under sudden attack by four junkers ju 88 bombers of kampfgruppe 806 while anchored efforts to raise steam proved futile and one of her boilers was destroyed by a bomb that penetrated deck knocking out power a second bomb holed hull and displaced fuel oil from her tanks starting a fire that engulfed forward superstructure and both forward boiler rooms although crew flooded aft 130 mm magazine damage control was hindered by lack of power fire spread aft and caused explosion of ammunition and depth charges destroying aft section due to shallow depth of anchorage hull rolled to starboard and remained above water destroyer remained afloat for slightly more than an hour after air raid and her survivors were taken off by steregushchy and destroyer a total of 35 crewmembers were killed and more than 30 were wounded during sinking what was left of hull was destroyed by explosion of forward magazines destroyer was officially struck from soviet navy on 27 july postwar wreck was raised in pieces and towed to tallinn for scrapping between 1949 and 1952 notes citations sources further
