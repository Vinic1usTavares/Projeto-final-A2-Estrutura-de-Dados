thumb protagonist master chief left encounters flood in halo combat evolved 2001 flood is a fictional parasitic alien life form in halo multimedia franchise it is introduced in 2001 video game halo combat evolved and returns in later entries in series such as halo 2 halo 3 and halo wars flood infects any sentient life of sufficient size flood infected creatures also called flood in turn infect other hosts parasite is depicted as such a threat that ancient forerunners killed themselves and all other sentient life in galaxy in an effort to stop flood s spread flood s design and fiction was spearheaded by bungie artist robert mclees who utilized unused concepts from earlier bungie game marathon 2 setting of first game ringworld halo was stripped of many of its large creatures to make flood s surprise appearance more startling bungie environment artist vic deleon spent six months of pre production time refining flood s fleshy aesthetic and designing organic interiors of flood infested space ships for halo 3 player s discovery of flood in halo combat evolved is a major plot twist and was one of surprises reviewers noted positively upon release flood s return in halo 2 and halo 3 was less enthusiastically praised reaction to flood has varied while some found flood too derivative and a cliche element of science fiction some others ranked it among greatest video game villains of all time development thumb left alt sketch of a humanoid alien tentacles sprout out where head would be and long whiplike tentacles extend from hand concept art of a flood combat form left hand has been replaced with tentacles and infection form s sensory apparatus sprout out where head once was before it was corrupted flood is depicted as a parasitic organism that infects any sentient life of sufficient size largest self contained form that flood can produce itself without using other biomass is an infection form these forms seeks hosts living or dead attempting to drive sharp spines into host and tap into nervous system host is incapacitated while infection form burrows into host s body and begins mutation process bringing host under flood control dietz 2003 p 140 depending on size or condition of body infection form mutates hapless host into various specialized forms in continual drive for more food larger hosts are turned into forms for combat growing long whiplike tentacles while mangled and disused hosts are turned into incubators for more infection forms flood also creates forms known as key minds to coordinate flood these include apex of flood evolution known as flood was added early in bungie s development of 2001 video game halo combat evolved before game had made its jump from macintosh platform to xbox a design for one flood form appeared as early as 1997 commenting upon inception of flood bungie staff member chris butcher noted that idea behind flood as forgotten peril that ended a galaxy spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci fi yeah and bad sci fi too another inspiration was christopher rowley s vang series early design for flood was done by bungie artist and writer robert mclees who considers himself architect of flood flood s roots are reflected in concept art of a fungal zombie that mclees did for earlier bungie game marathon 2 durandal mclees also did all early concept art for flood based on behavior of viruses and certain bacteria flood was intended to be disgusting and nasty creatures were constructed from corpses and bodies of former combatants so artists had to make sure flood soldiers were recognizable while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from uninfected many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints initially flood was intended to convert any species of alien covenant into soldiers we didn t have resources to make it happen mclees recalled so they modified game s fiction to suggest that some covenant were too small or too frail to be combat troops likewise flood enemy intelligence was intended to be as complicated as that of other enemy faction in game but full implementation was cut for time dinosaur like terrestrial wildlife that originally dwelled in halo s environments were dropped due to gameplay constraints and fear that their presence would reduce surprise and impact of flood bungie decided a new visual language for flood was needed for halo 3 task of developing new flood forms organic flood terrain and other miscellaneous changes fell to vic deleon then bungie s senior environment artist early concepts of what became new flood types in game called pure forms featured creatures wielding an array of weapons via tendrils while forms like flood and flood transport concepts never made it into final game flood infested structures were designed as angular to counterbalance flood biomass as well as provide surfaces for game s artificial intelligence to exploit and move on new additions were designed to be multi purpose exploding growth pods that spew flood forms were added to game to adjust pacing provide instant action and add to visuals endoscopic pictures provided further inspiration halo 3 added new capabilities to flood including ability for parasite to infect enemies in real time bungie used halo 3s improved capacity for graphics to make a host s sudden transformation into flood form more dramatic two different character models and skeletons were fused and swapped in real time appearances games flood makes its first appearance more than halfway

appearances 2006 anthology halo graphic novel expands upon flood s release during events of halo combat evolved in two stories last voyage of infinite succor and breaking quarantine whereas flood is only hinted at being intelligent in game halo graphic novel shows flood has a hive mind assimilating knowledge of their hosts rapidly lee hammock writer of last voyage of infinite succor described basis of story as a way to showcase true danger of flood as an intelligent menace rather than something player encounters and shoots hammock also stated that story would prove intelligent nature of flood and hopefully euthanize idea that they are just space zombies threat of flood is also highlighted in a short story from halo evolutions anthology mona lisa which was later adapted into a motion comic flood also features heavily in greg bear s trilogy of novels forerunner saga which takes place thousands of years before events of main games novel halo silentium reveals that flood is what remains of precursors an ancient race that was said to accelerate evolution of a species and shape galaxies forerunners overthrew precursors on verge of extinction some precursors reduced themselves to a biological powder that would regenerate into their past selves time rendered powder defective and it became mutagenic reacting with other living organisms to produce what would eventually mutate into flood flood would threaten ancient humanity and then forerunners who ultimately build and activate halo array to stop parasite s spread analysis thumb right this frog infected by ribeiroia demonstrates limb mutations similar to flood combat forms name of flood is one of many names taken from religious stories in halo franchise flood and especially gravemind serve as demonic or satanic figures and master chief s descent into bowels of halo to encounter flood can be likened to a journey to hell academic p c notes that name flood suggests a reference to biblical deluge with forerunner ark being shelter from flood s destructive and cleansing power akin to bible lifecycle and parasitic nature of flood has similarities to behaviors of real world parasites flood s induced physiological changes recall modified eyestalks of hosts infected by paradoxum or malformed limbs of ribeiroia infected amphibians flood s habit of altering its surroundings has parallels to parasitoid wasp use of spider s webs for protection cultural impact merchandise flood have been featured in four series of halo action figures produced by joyride studios for halo combat evolved joyride produced a carrier form and infection form bundle halo 2s series contains both a human combat form and infection form bundled with master chief which were released after video game armchair empire s review of figure expressed sentiment that joyride s models could not totally capture texture and detail of flood mcfarlane toys produced action figures for halo 3 and third released series featured a human combat form other merchandise includes an xbox 360 avatar prop and a limited edition silver plated statue of master chief fighting a flood form critical reception surprise appearance of flood during halo combat evolved was seen as an important plot twist and a scary moment even after repeat playthroughs of game gamasutra writing about video game plots gives example of flood not only as an important reversal to story of halo but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in plot rolling stone and kotaku credited appearance of flood as an excellent way game kept players on their toes forcing them to adjust their strategies rolling stone called twist as shocking as if several levels into a game of pac man dots suddenly began to attack you despite positive acclaim in halo response to presence of flood in halo 2 and halo 3 was mixed a panel of online reviewers noted that flood appeared in halo 2 for no obvious reasons and was simply described as aggravating to play against similarly reviewers including victor godinez of dallas morning news felt that flood was too derivative of other sci fi stereotypes and functioned as space zombies daniel weissenberger of gamecritics com noted in his review of halo 3 that even though flood looked better than ever its single strategy of rushing player proved tedious over time gamesradar s charlie barratt listed flood as worst part of halo contrasting what he considered fun vibrant and open levels before flood s appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies flood has been recognized as one of greatest game villains making lists of greatest villains and enemies from wizard magazine game daily pc world and electronic gaming monthly mtv considered flood possession in halo 3 as a great gaming moment of 2007 stating that with power of xbox 360 s graphics this reanimation comes to vivid distressing life more memorably than it had in earlier games here are zombies of gaming doing what they do worst it s grisly and unforgettable ign listed flood as 45th best video game villain describing it as one of most hated video game villains in history of video games references external
