pobeda was last of three pre dreadnought battleships built for imperial russian navy at end of nineteenth century ship was assigned to pacific squadron upon completion and based at port arthur from 1903 during russo japanese war of 1904 1905 she participated in battles of port arthur and yellow sea having escaped serious damage in these engagements pobeda was sunk by gunfire during siege of port arthur and then salvaged by japanese and placed into service under name rearmed and re boilered by japanese suwo was reclassified by imperial japanese navy ijn as a coastal defense ship in 1908 and served as a training ship for several years she was flagship of japanese squadron that participated in battle of tsingtao at beginning of world war i and continued in that role until she became a gunnery training ship in 1917 ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with terms of washington naval treaty and probably scrapped around that time design and description design of peresvet class was inspired by british second class battleships typically faster but with thinner armor and smaller guns than first class battleships of british ships were intended to defeat commerce raiding armored cruisers like russian ships and and peresvet class was designed to support armored cruisers this role placed a premium on high speed and long range at expense of heavy armament and armor mclaughlin

on 26 april 1898 from baltic works and construction began on 30 may 1898 at company s saint petersburg shipyard well before formal keel laying ceremony on 21 february 1899 ship was launched on 10 may 1900 and towed to kronstadt on 31 august 1901 for fitting out she made her machinery trials in october well before she was completed next year she sailed to reval modern tallinn on 1 august to participate in naval review held there a few days later to commemorate visit of german kaiser wilhelm ii to russia pobeda entered service upon completing her artillery trials on october 1902 although she was not officially accepted until 10 march 1903 mclaughlin 2008 pp 47 48 at a cost of 10 050 000 rubles mclaughlin 2003 p 112 she had already sailed from libau on 13 november 1902 and arrived at port arthur on 13 june 1903 for assignment to pacific squadron mclaughlin 2003 p 115 battle of port arthur after japanese victory in first sino japanese war of 1894 95 tensions had arisen between russia and japan over their ambitions to control both manchuria and korea a further issue was russian failure to withdraw its troops from manchuria in october 1903 as it had promised japan had begun negotiations to ease situation in 1901 but russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve problems japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete russian armament programs final straws were news of russian timber concessions in northern korea and russian refusal to acknowledge japanese interests in manchuria while continuing to place conditions on japanese activities in korea these led japanese government to decide in december 1903 that war was now inevitable pacific squadron began mooring in outer harbor at night as tensions with japan increased so as to react more quickly to any japanese attempt to land troops in korea westwood pp 15 21 on night of 8 9 february 1904 ijn launched a surprise attack on russian fleet at port arthur pobeda was not hit in initial torpedo boat attack and sortied following morning when combined fleet commanded by vice admiral togo heihachiro attacked togo had expected surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was anticipating that russians would be badly disorganized and weakened but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack japanese ships were spotted by protected cruiser which was patrolling offshore and alerted russian defenses togo chose to attack russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage ships with his secondary guns splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as japanese and six inch guns inflicted little damage on russian ships which concentrated all their fire on japanese ships with some effect pobeda was hit once or twice amidships near waterline losing two men killed and four wounded but shell s failed to penetrate ship s armor and little damage was done forczyk pp 41 43 mclaughlin 2008 p 48 on 22 march pobeda joined several other battleships firing indirectly at japanese ships bombarding port arthur s harbor and hit once killing seven men mclaughlin p 48 she participated in action of 13 april when togo successfully lured out a portion of pacific squadron including vice admiral stepan makarov s flagship battleship when makarov spotted five japanese battleships he turned back for port arthur and petropavlovsk struck a mine laid by japanese previous night ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded and makarov was one of 677 killed when pobeda was returning to port after petropavlovsk sank she struck a mine herself but was able to steam to harbor under her own power despite an 11deg list forczyk pp 43 45 46 her repairs were completed on 9 june although some of her guns were removed during this time to reinforce defenses of port pobeda lost a total of three 6 inch two 75 millimeter one 47 millimeter and four 37 millimeter guns mclaughlin 2003 pp 115 163 she sailed with rest of russian squadron on 23 june in an abortive attempt to reach vladivostok new fleet commander vice admiral wilgelm vitgeft ordered squadron to return to port arthur when it encountered japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage numerically superior japanese in a night battle warner warner pp 305 06 pobeda bombarded japanese positions besieging port on 28 july battle of yellow sea japanese bombardment of 9 august coupled with a direct order from tsar nicholas ii forced vitgeft to make another attempt to reach vladivostok squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to vladivostok next morning at 12 25 it was spotted by japanese cruisers and intercepted by combined fleet in what became battle of yellow sea pobeda was third in line during battle forczyk p 48 and was not seriously damaged during early long range stage of action around 18 00 two 12 inch shells from battleship penetrated conning tower of russian flagship killing vitgeft and helmsman severely wounding captain and causing ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn thinking that this was a maneuver planned by vitgeft russian battleline started to execute same turn causing all of ships directly behind tsesarevich including pobeda to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting stationary flagship as japanese ships continued to pound tsesarevich battleship boldly charged togo s battleline in an attempt to divert japanese shellfire followed shortly afterward by peresvet flagship of squadron s second in command rear admiral prince pavel ukhtomsky japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to oncoming ships badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away mclaughlin 2003 p 163 ukhtomsky signaled other russian ships to follow him back to port arthur but signal was hard to discern because flags had to be hung from bridge railings because peresvets topmasts had been shot away signal was only gradually recognized mclaughlin 2008 p 46 although pobeda was struck by eleven large caliber hits that killed 4 men and wounded 29 including one below waterline they failed to penetrate her armor and she reached port arthur without any difficulties hits did knock out one 10 inch gun and three 75 millimeter guns siege of port arthur thumb pobeda right and protected cruiser sunk in port arthur returning to port arthur on 11 august russian squadron found city still under siege by japanese third army led by baron nogi maresuke new commander rear admiral robert n viren decided to use men and guns of pacific squadron to reinforce defenses of port arthur and even more guns were stripped from squadron s ships this proved to make little difference and pobeda was struck by several and 4 7 inch shells on 28 september that did no significant damage japanese bombardment with medium guns continued for next month and a half and ship was repeatedly struck without much effect japanese troops were able to seize 203 hill which overlooked harbor on 5 december this allowed imperial japanese army s siege guns to fire directly at russian ships they hit pobeda approximately 30 times and sank her in shallow water on 7 december 1904 mclaughlin 2003 pp 115 163 64 russian attempts to destroy ship before they surrendered were frustrated because her vital parts were already underwater japanese career
