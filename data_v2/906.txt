in early philosophies of psychology and metaphysics conatus latin for effort endeavor impulse inclination tendency undertaking striving is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself this thing may be mind matter or a combination of both over millennia many different definitions and treatments have been formulated seventeenth century philosophers rene descartes baruch spinoza gottfried leibniz and thomas hobbes made important contributions conatus may refer to instinctive will to live of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of motion and inertia often concept is associated with god s will in a pantheist view of nature concept may be broken up into separate definitions for mind and body and split when discussing centrifugal force and inertia history of term conatus is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over course of two and a half millennia successive philosophers to adopt term put their own personal twist on concept each developing term differently earliest authors to discuss conatus wrote primarily in latin basing their usage on ancient greek concepts these thinkers therefore used conatus not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense in archaic texts more technical usage is difficult to discern from more common one and they are also hard to differentiate in translation in english translations term is italicized when used in technical sense or translated and followed by conatus in brackets today conatus is rarely used in technical sense since modern physics uses concepts such as inertia and conservation of momentum that have superseded it it has however been a notable influence on nineteenth and twentieth century thinkers such as arthur schopenhauer friedrich nietzsche and louis dumont classical origins thumb upright marcus tullius cicero latin conatus comes from verb conor which is usually translated into english as to endeavor but concept of conatus was first developed by stoics 333 264 bce and c 335 bce before common era these groups used word translated in latin by impetus to describe movement of soul towards an object and from which a physical act results clement of alexandria in iii 377 cicero de i 132 seneca younger epistulae morales ad 113 23 classical thinkers marcus tullius cicero 106 43 bce and diogenes laertius c 235 bce expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction but continued to limit its application to motivations of non human animals diogenes laertius for example specifically denied application of term to plants before renaissance thomas aquinas c 1225 1274 ce duns scotus c 1266 1308 ce and dante alighieri 1265 1321 ce expressed similar sentiments using latin words or appetit as synonyms of conatus indeed all four terms may be used to translate original greek later and campanella extended ancient greek notions and applied them to all objects animate and inanimate first aristotle then cicero and laertius each alluded to a connection between conatus and other emotions in their view former induces latter they maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it good but rather they think it good because they want to do it in other words cause of human desire is natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with principles of conatus medieval views there is a traditional connection between conatus and motion itself aquinas and 1265 1321 both related concept directly to that which augustine 354 430 ce saw to be natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position described in his de civitate dei c 520 ce they called this force that causes objects to rise or fall amor naturalis or natural love in 6th century john philoponus c 490 c 570 ce criticized aristotle s view of motion noting inconsistency between aristotle s discussion of projectiles where medium of aether keeps projectiles going and his discussion of void where there is no such medium and hence a body s motion should be impossible philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by action of some surrounding medium but by some property or conatus implanted in object when it was set in motion this was not modern concept of inertia for there was still need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion this view was strongly opposed by averroes and many scholastic philosophers who supported aristotle aristotelian view was also challenged in islamic world for example ibn al haytham alhazen seems to have supported philoponus views while he developed a concept similar to inertia concept of inertia was developed more clearly in work of his contemporary avicenna who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance making him first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non natural motion avicenna s concept of mayl is almost opposite of aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of newton s first law of motion avicenna also developed an idea similar to momentum when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between weight and velocity of a moving body jean buridan 1300 1358 also rejected notion that this motion generating property which he named impetus dissipated spontaneously buridan s position was that a moving object would be arrested by resistance of air and weight of body which would oppose its impetus he also maintained that impetus increased with speed thus his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to modern concept of momentum despite obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia buridan saw his theory as only a modification to aristotle s basic philosophy maintaining many other peripatetic views including belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear but also circular in nature causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle in descartes thumb upright rene descartes in first half of seventeenth century rene descartes 1596 1650 began to develop a more modern materialistic concept of conatus describing it as an active power or tendency of bodies to move expressing power of god whereas ancients used term in a strictly anthropomorphic sense similar to voluntary endeavoring or struggling to achieve certain ends and medieval scholastic philosophers developed a notion of conatus as a mysterious intrinsic property of things descartes uses term in a somewhat more mechanistic sense more specifically for descartes in contrast to buridan movement and stasis are two states of same thing not different things although there is much ambiguity in descartes notion of conatus one can see here beginnings of a move away from attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view descartes rejects teleological or purposive view of material world that was dominant in west from time of aristotle mind is not viewed by descartes as part of material world and hence is not subject to strictly mechanical laws of nature motion and rest on other hand are properties of interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws god only sets whole thing in motion at start and later does not interfere except to maintain dynamical regularities of mechanical behavior of bodies hence there is no real teleology in movements of bodies since whole thing reduces to law governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations conatus is just tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other god may set this activity in motion but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed descartes specifies two varieties of conatus conatus a centro and conatus conatus a centro or tendency towards center is used by descartes as a theory of gravity conatus recendendi or tendency away from center represents centrifugal forces these tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions nor as inherent properties or forces of things but rather as a unifying external characteristic of physical universe itself which god has bestowed descartes in developing his first law of nature also invokes idea of a conatus se or conatus of self preservation this law is a generalization of principle of inertia which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by galileo principle was formalized by isaac newton and made into first of his three laws of motion fifty years after death of descartes descartes version states each thing insofar as in it lies always perseveres in same state and when once moved always continues to move in hobbes thumb upright thomas hobbes conatus and psyche thomas hobbes 1588 1679 too worked off of previous notions of conatus principle however he criticized previous definitions for failing to explain origin of motion working toward this end became primary focus of hobbes work in this area indeed hobbes reduces all cognitive functions of mind to variations of its functions furthermore hobbes describes emotion as beginning of motion and will as sum of all emotions this will forms conatus of a body and its physical manifestation is perceived will to survive in order that living beings may thrive hobbes says they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace hobbes also equates this conatus with imagination and states that a change in conatus or will is result of deliberation conatus and physics i define conatus to be motion made in less space and time than can be given that is less than can be determined or assigned by exposition or number that is motion made through length of a point and in an instant or point of time as in his psychological theory hobbes s physical conatus is an infinitesimal unit of motion it is beginning of motion an inclination in a specified direction concept of impetus as used by hobbes is defined in terms of this physical conatus it is a measure of conatus exercised by a moving body over course of time resistance is caused by a contrary conatus force is this motion plus magnitude of body hobbes also uses word conatus to refer to restorative forces which may cause springs for example to contract or expand hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state today science attributes this phenomenon to material elasticity in spinoza conatus is a central theme in philosophy of benedict de spinoza 1632 1677 according to spinoza each thing as far as it lies in itself strives to persevere in its being ethics part 3 prop 6 spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this first particular things are as he puts it modes of god which means that each one expresses power of god in a particular way ethics part 3 prop 6 dem moreover it could never be part of definition of god that his modes contradict one another ethics part 3 prop 5 each thing therefore is opposed to everything which can take its existence away ethics part 3 prop 6 dem this resistance to destruction is formulated by spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist and conatus is word he most often uses to describe this force thumb left upright benedictus de spinoza striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities it might happen to undertake rather striving is nothing but actual essence of thing ethics part 3 prop 7 spinoza also uses term conatus to refer to rudimentary concepts of inertia as descartes had earlier since a thing cannot be destroyed without action of external forces motion and rest too exist indefinitely until disturbed behavioral manifestation concept of conatus as used in baruch spinoza s psychology is derived from sources both ancient and medieval spinoza principles that stoics cicero laertius and especially hobbes and descartes developed one significant change he makes to hobbes theory is his belief that conatus ad conatus to motion is not mental but material spinoza with his determinism believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws god and nature are one and there is no free will contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of present spinoza rejects dualistic assumption that mind intentionality ethics and freedom are to be treated as things separate from natural world of physical objects and events his goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a naturalistic framework and his notion of conatus is central to this project for example an action is free for spinoza only if it arises from essence and conatus of an entity there can be no absolute unconditioned freedom of will since all events in natural world including human actions and choices are determined in accord with natural laws of universe which are inescapable however an action can still be free in sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces human beings are thus an integral part of nature spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really natural and rational and motivated by this principle of conatus in process he replaces notion of free will with conatus a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man emotions and affects spinoza s view of relationship between conatus and human affects is not clear firmin assistant professor of philosophy at maryland institute college of art and antonio damasio professor of neuroscience at university of southern california both argue that human affects arise from conatus and perpetual drive toward perfection indeed spinoza states in his ethics that happiness specifically consists in human capacity to preserve itself this endeavor is also characterized by spinoza as foundation of virtue conversely a person is saddened by anything that opposes his conatus david bidney 1908 1987 professor at yale university disagrees bidney closely associates desire a primary affect with conatus principle of spinoza this view is backed by scholium of of ethics which states between appetite and desire there is no difference except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of appetite so desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of appetite according to bidney this desire is controlled by other affects pleasure and pain and thus conatus strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain in leibniz thumb upright gottfried wilhelm leibniz gottfried leibniz 1646 1716 was a student of erhard weigel 1625 1699 and learned of conatus principle from him and from hobbes though weigel used word latin tendency specifically leibniz uses word conatus in his exposition and defence of new system 1695 to describe a notion similar that of hobbes but he differentiates between conatus of body and soul first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power and latter of which may remember more complicated motions for leibniz problem of motion comes to a resolution of paradox of zeno since motion is continuous space must be infinitely divisible in order for anything to begin moving at all there must be some mind like property or force inherent in basic constituents of universe that propels them this conatus is a sort of instantaneous or virtual motion that all things possess even when they are static motion meanwhile is just summation of all conatuses that a thing has along with interactions of things conatus is to motion as a point is to space problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back if only force in play were conatus hence leibniz was forced to postulate existence of an aether that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions leibniz concept of a mind like memory less property of conatus coupled with his rejection of atoms eventually led to his theory of monads leibniz also uses his concept of a conatus in developing principles of integral calculus adapting meaning of term in this case to signify a mathematical analog of newton s force by summing an infinity of such conatuses i e what is now called integration leibniz could measure effect of a continuous force he defines impetus as result of a continuous summation of conatus of a body just as vis viva or living force is sum of inactive vis based on work of kepler and probably descartes leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on conatus principle idea of aether and a fluid vortex this theory is expounded in work de motuum coelestium 1689 according to leibniz kepler s analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a harmonic vortex for circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity both of which are examples of conatus to account for radial motion leibniz later defines term conatus as state of change through which his monads perpetually advance related usages and terms thumb upright friedrich nietzsche several other uses of term conatus apart from primary ones mentioned above have been formulated by various philosophers over centuries there are also some important related terms and concepts which have more or less similar meanings and usages giambattista vico 1668 1744 defined conatus as essence of human society and also in a more traditional sense as generating power of movement which pervades all of nature nearly a century after beginnings of modern science vico inspired by neoplatonism explicitly rejected principle of inertia and laws of motion of new physics for him nature was composed neither of atoms as in dominant view nor of extension as in descartes but of metaphysical points animated by a conatus principle provoked by god arthur schopenhauer 1788 1860 developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of hobbes s conatus this principle wille zum leben or will to live described specific phenomenon of an organism s self preservation instinct schopenhauer qualified this however by suggesting that will to live is not limited in duration rather will wills absolutely and for all time across generations friedrich nietzsche 1844 1900 an early disciple of schopenhauer developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of primacy of schopenhauer s will to live and other notions of self preservation he called his version will to power or wille zur macht sigmund freud 1856 1939 greatly depended on spinoza s formulation of conatus principle as a system of self preservation though he never cited him directly in any of his published works around same time henri bergson 1859 1941 developed principle of elan vital or vital impulse which was thought to aid in evolution of organisms this concept which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life is reminiscent of conatus principle of spinoza and others for max concept of drang is centerpiece of philosophical anthropology and metaphysics though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics like bergson s elan vital drang drive or impulsion is impetus of all life however unlike in bergson s vitalistic metaphysics significance of drang is that it provides motivation and driving force even of spirit geist spirit which includes all theoretical intentionality is powerless without movement of drang material principle as well as eros psychological principle cultural anthropologist louis dumont 1911 1988 described a cultural conatus built directly upon spinoza s seminal definition in of his ethics principle behind this derivative concept states that any given culture tends to persevere in its being whether by dominating other cultures or by struggling against their domination modern significance physical after advent of newtonian physics concept of a conatus of all physical bodies was largely superseded by principle of inertia and conservation of momentum as bidney states it is true that logically desire or conatus is merely a principle of inertia fact remains however that this is not spinoza s usage likewise conatus was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete conatus recendendi for instance became centrifugal force and gravity is used where conatus a centro had been previously today topics with which conatus dealt are matters of science and are thus subject to inquiry by scientific method biological archaic concept of conatus is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as antonio damasio conatus of today however is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where before it was a matter of metaphysics and this concept may be constructed so as to maintain coherence of a living organism s structures and functions against numerous life threatening odds systems theory conception of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of in biological systems in systems theory and sciences in general concept of a conatus may be related to phenomenon of emergence whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures self regulating and self maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of spinoza s conatus principle however scope of idea is definitely narrower today without religious
