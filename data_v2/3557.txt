andre kertesz 2 july 1894 28 september 1985 born kertesz andor was a hungarian born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and photo essay in early years of his career his then unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition kertesz never felt that he had gained worldwide recognition he deserved today he is considered one of seminal figures of photojournalism expected by his family to work as a stockbroker kertesz pursued photography independently as an autodidact and his early work was published primarily in magazines a major market in those years this continued until much later in his life when kertesz stopped accepting commissions he served briefly in world war i and moved to paris in 1925 then artistic capital of world against wishes of his family in paris he worked for france s first illustrated magazine called vu involved with many young immigrant artists and dada movement he achieved critical and commercial success due to german persecution of jews and threat of world war ii kertesz decided to emigrate to united states in 1936 where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work in 1940s and 1950s he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success his career is generally divided into four periods based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known they are called hungarian period french period american period and toward end of his life international period biography early life and education andor

sons including imre and jeno when lipot died in 1908 from tuberculosis widowed ernesztin was without a source of income to support their three children ernesztin s brother lipot hoffmann provided for family and acted much like a father to boys family soon moved to hoffman s country property in szigetbecse kertesz grew up in a leisurely pace of life and pastoral setting that would shape his later career path hoffman paid for his middle nephew s business classes at academy of commerce until his 1912 graduation and arranged his hiring by stock exchange soon after unlike his older brother imre who worked at exchange in budapest for all his life kertesz had little interest in field he was drawn to illustrated magazines and to activities like fishing and swimming in danube river near his uncle s property kertesz s first encounters with magazine photography inspired him to learn photography he was also influenced by certain paintings by lajos and gyula as well as by poetry hungarian period thumbnail circus budapest 19 may 1920 after earning enough money kertesz quickly bought his first camera an ica box camera in 1912 despite his family s protests to continue his career in

first published in 1917 in magazine erdekes ujsag during world war i while kertesz was serving in austro hungarian army as early as 1914 for example eugene 1914 his distinctive and mature style was already evident in 1914 at age of 20 he was sent to frontline where he took photographs of life in trenches with a lightweight camera a tenax most of these photographs were destroyed during violence of hungarian revolution of 1919 wounded in 1915 by a bullet kertesz suffered temporary paralysis of his left arm he was sent for convalescence to a military hospital in budapest but was later transferred to esztergom where he continued to take photographs these included a self portrait for a competition in magazine janko his most famous piece of this period was underwater swimmer esztergom

heal soon enough to return to combat and with peace in 1918 he returned to stock exchange there he met his future wife erzsebet salomon later changed to elizabeth who also worked at exchange he began to pursue her romantically during this period of work and throughout his whole career he used elizabeth as a model for his photographs kertesz also took numerous photographs of his brother jeno kertesz left his career at exchange to try agricultural work and beekeeping during early 1920s this venture was brief given political turmoil that accompanied revolution and coming of communism after returning to stock exchange kertesz decided to emigrate to study at one of france s photographic schools his mother dissuaded him and he did not emigrate for several years working during day at exchange he pursued photography rest of time in 1923 hungarian amateur photographer s association selected one of his photographs for its silver award on condition that he print it by bromoil process kertesz disliked this so turned down medal instead he was given a diploma from association on its 26 june 1925 hungarian news magazine erdekes ujsag used one of his photographs for its cover giving him widespread publicity by that time kertesz was determined to photograph sights in paris and join its artistic culture french period thumb right fork or la was taken in 1928 and is one of kertesz s

critical evaluation throughout most of his career kertesz was depicted as unknown soldier who worked behind scenes of photography yet was rarely cited for his work even into his death in 1980s kertesz

style and work was accepted by critics and art audiences alike although in 1927 he was first photographer to have a solo exhibition kertesz said that it was not until his 1946 exhibition at art institute of chicago that he first felt he received positive reviews on his work and often cites this show as one of his finest moments in america during his stay in america he was cited as being an intimate artist bringing viewer into his work even when picture was that of subjects such as intimidating new york city and even his reproduced work printed after his death received good reviews kertesz was above all a consistently fine photographer kertesz s work itself is often described as predominantly utilising light and even kertesz himself said that i write with light capa et al diary of light pp inside cover he was never considered to comment on his subjects but rather capture them this is often cited as why his work is often overlooked he stuck to no political agenda and offered no deeper thought to his photographs other than simplicity of life with his art s intimate feeling and nostalgic tone kertesz s images alluded to a sense of timelessness which was inevitably only recognised after his death unlike other photographers kertesz s work gave an insight into his life showing a chronological order of where he spent his time for example many of his french photographs were from cafes where he spent majority of his time waiting for artistic inspiration although kertesz rarely received bad reviews it was lack of commentary that lead to photographer feeling distant from recognition now however he is often considered to be father of photojournalism even other photographers cite kertesz and his photographs as being inspirational henri cartier bresson once said of him in early 1930s we all owe him a great deal when he was 90 years old a person asked him why he was still taking photographs he replied i m still hungry tad 1992 quirky quotations new york harmony
