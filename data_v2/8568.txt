cultural affairs it allowed selection of most important cultural properties set restrictions on alteration repair and export of cultural properties and provided measures for preservation and utilization of such properties regulations implementing law specified three broad categories of properties tangible intangible cultural properties and historic sites places of scenic beauty and natural monuments tangible cultural properties were defined as objects of high artistic or historic value or archaeological materials or other historic material of high scholarly value designated

was extended to include groups of historic buildings not necessarily located in capitals second significant change of 1975 was that government began to extend protection not only to tangible or intangible properties for their direct historic or artistic value but also to techniques for conservation of cultural properties this step was necessary because of lack of skilled craftsmen resulting from industrialization techniques to be protected included mounting of paintings and calligraphy on scrolls repair of lacquerware and wooden sculptures and production of noh masks costumes and
