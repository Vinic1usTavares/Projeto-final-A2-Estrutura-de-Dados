heard that liszt and richard wagner would be participating in beethoven centenary festival in vienna in 1870 she refused to attend her difficulty with liszt stemmed from a philosophical difference he believed that artist through physical and emotional performance interpreted music for audience to assist listeners in experiencing transformative ecstasy of music when he performed liszt flailed his arms tossed his head and pursed his lips schumann on other hand believed that personality of musician should be suppressed so that composer s vision would be clearly evident to listeners schumann was

exceptional by her reviewers she was one of first pianists to perform from memory making it standard for concerts she was also instrumental in changing kind of programs expected of concert pianists in her early career before her marriage she played customary bravura pieces designed to showcase artist s technique often in form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas written by virtuosos such as thalberg herz or henselt as it was customary to play one s own compositions she included at least one of her own works in every program such as variations on a theme by bellini op 8 and popular scherzo op 10 however as she became a more independent artist her repertoire contained mainly music by leading composers schumann influenced pianists through her teaching which emphasized expression and a singing tone with technique subordinated to intentions of composer one of her students mathilde verne carried her teaching to england where she taught among others solomon another of her students carl friedberg carried tradition to juilliard school in america where his students included malcolm frager and bruce hungerford she was also instrumental in getting works of robert
