nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers such children pamphlet argued could not help but to grow up effete and were scarcely worth raising some of blame for this pamphlet claims lay with

not acquire manly traits governed by women they never learned to dominate women themselves which pamphlet claimed was requisite to please a wife male effeminacy and sodomy one chapter of pamphlet describes physiognomy of sodomitical type claiming that gentle soft and delicate men are predisposed toward sodomy next criticizes feminine dress and hairstyling of young men whom it describes as those gentlemen who call themselves pretty fellows it characterizes their appearance in which men styled their hair and dressed in a manner similar to their footmen as history s most preposterous in contemporary britain fears about consequences of homosexual relationships often centred on their perceived tendency to ignore and thus weaken class boundaries an effeminate gentleman who dressed like his footman a servant embodied this class transgression in a threatening way habit of wearing makeup pamphlet says was as much in vogue among our gentlemen as with ladies in france italian opera too is criticized for its attributed tendency to men same chapter describes same sex kissing particularly between men as most hateful product of effeminacy it claims phenomenon originated in italy and

book claims is popular both in turkey and at twickenham prostitution pamphlet claims streets of london were astonishingly full of prostitutes male and female to extent that whole districts such as drury lane which purportedly housed 107 brothels in early 18th century were exclusively inhabited by prostitutes though pamphlet describes pitiable and desperate conditions in which prostitutes lived and corruption of police supposed to be patrol them it also accuses prostitutes of inhumanity and deems them devilish and monstrous vices of prostitute are presented as those endemic among all women petit maitre pamphlet concludes with a poem petit maitre criticizing a man with an effeminate appearance style has been characterized as satirical final verse not only exhorts men to dress in a masculine style but suggests that effeminate are in any case less than manly reception some modern analyses have characterized pamphlet as a best seller in its own time its familiarity today may also derive from its inclusion in several 19th century bibliographies it was listed in w t lowndes s pioneering bibliographer s manual of english literature published 1834 generally regarded as first such systematic literary bibliography pamphlet was also subject of an extensive entry in 1877 index librorum prohibitorum of pseudonymous really henry spencer ashbee an encyclopedia of erotic literature index reproduced substantial portions of original text introducing work as a rare volume its object being strictly moral modern scholars have attended to pamphlet as an example of contemporary attitudes toward homophobia effeminacy prostitution and even international relations david robinson characterizes pamphlet s contents as blatant vituperative homophobia and encyclopedia of homosexuality identifies it as an effort to incite anti homosexual sentiment christopher hobson presents pamphlets of this type as handmaid of eighteenth century english judicial crackdowns against homosexual offenders as a mechanism whereby homosexual behaviour was kept indefensible and potential perpetrators kept terrified ian mccormick diagnoses pamphlet as representing a gradual change in european discourse on character of sodomite previous publications had discussed sexual deviance conceived in contemporary terms as a general evil with satan s harvest home a new attention was brought to individual character of persons who committed sodomy he argues that before seventeenth century sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves heretics sorcerers and like increasingly however it came to be linked with pride excess of diet idleness and contempt of poor ian mccormick secret sexualities a sourcebook routledge 1997 p 6 pamphlet s equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by michael kimmel as distinctive for period other scholars have identified text s tone as satirical and mildly obscene locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution linda dowling interprets pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that britain s martial past and saw lack of respect for it as a precondition for vice ian bell considers causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice characterizing book as part of strand that saw vice as a product not a cause of a fundamental collapse in morality in augustan london many scholars have considered pamphlet as evidence for an association in eighteenth century thought between same sex vice and influence of continental and specifically roman catholic european mores particularly of those from france and italy george haggerty sees pamphlet as typical of a trend in eighteenth century british discourse that blamed italy and france for exporting sodomy to britain valerie traub notes its references to foreign contagion criminal endemic to france and italy george rousseau similarly cites pamphlet as part of a body of 1740s sodomy literature so wide ranging as to suggest that term s meaning might have been mutable broad and vague he argues specifically that in 1740s term had a strong connotation of an imported vice it was often used in 1740s to connote suspicion against foreigners pamphlet s text on page 50 includes strident claim damn d fashion imported from italy amid st a train of other unnatural vices have we not sins enough of our own but we must eke em out with those of foreign nations to fill up cup of our abominations and make us yet more ripe for divine vengeance plausibility of theory that sodomy however understood was particularly prevalent in italy is difficult to assess though trevor dean notes that earlier seventeenth century italy had undergone increasingly vigorous efforts to monitor and regulate sexual activity historians of lesbianism have cited work as early evidence of public awareness that a lesbian culture existed within eighteenth century england and locate its references to sappho as early indicators that that term was coming into general usage to describe lesbians publishing history
