she had sold out in an effort to garner record sales particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first maclean s wrote that her makeover seems a bit forced and contrasted her with singers such as madonna and emily haines of metric they seem to be completely in control even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality they ve made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons in contrast furtado s new overt sexuality comes off as unoriginal overdone by thousands of pouty pop stars with a quarter of furtado s natural talent revamping feels as
