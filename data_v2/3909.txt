of a broader story arc in form of a mystery that veronica solves over several episodes crew s plan at beginning of season was to have two part murder mystery of hearst s basketball coach encapsulated in postgame mortem and mars bars to stretch over rest of season beginning with this episode but this idea was changed around airing of spit eggs series creator rob thomas gave two rationales for creative change first was that he believed that story arcs alienated new or casual viewers meaning that change would solve series low nielsen ratings while other reason was that he noticed that after first season show had garnered most narrative criticism about story arcs on trying new narrative structure thomas stated it seems like a good time to do it a good fun test balloon try it over five episodes and see how fans and non fans react however thomas also commented that show would continue to exhibit a degree of serialization through veronica s romantic and personal life in addition new story formula was a way to have episodes focus on veronica s personal life instead of devoting most of episode time to advancing rushed mysteries episode also features first kiss of characters of piz chris lowell and veronica creating a love triangle between two and logan jason dohring that would last for rest of series and veronica mars movie dividing fans into team logan and team piz depending on which relationship they preferred song rally by alternative rock band phoenix plays during veronica and piz s kiss thomas highlighted scene in veronica returns home to find keith reading classified ads as one of his favorite moments between father daughter pair in season stating that they both fulfilled writers initial vision for scene and that kristen bell in particular interpreted her lines well episode was first to air after nearly a two month hiatus during which thomas came up for idea for season four to take place in fbi academy possibly done as a last resort attempt to save show from cancellation series was very much on brink of cancellation at this point in production prior to airing of un american graffiti enrico colantoni stated that cw had seen filmed first ten pages and reacted negatively however thomas denied this testimony and commented that cw had not yet seen fbi pitch and would on may 2 day after series return a statement that was confirmed to be true by a

cliche and moralistic and opining that it was not a strong start for show s new episode formula eric goldman of ign graded episode a 7 0 out of 10 indicating that it was good he was very critical of case of week and keith s plotline as sheriff comparing them both negatively to an after school special he disliked what he considered to be cliche storyline and stereotyped characters of restaurant plot particularly trope of disapproving arab american father and plotline ending with a speech about american dream concluding that even veronica pointing out this cliche didn t make it less so while opining that logan s actions were out of character reviewer was more positive towards budding relationships of veronica and piz and mac and max television without pity graded episode a c with reviewer stating that it was only episode of series that they did not like reviewer alan sepinwall on his blog what s alan watching was very negative towards episode while stating that it was very preachy and generally boring particularly in case of week he believed that episode was just a fluke because he had already been sent next episode debasement tapes which he enjoyed while being less critical of episode s other subplots he concluded that this wasn t exactly a triumphant return kelly west of cinema blend was mixed towards episode while calling new formula a breath of fresh air she was not entirely pleased with final scene featuring piz and veronica s kiss opining that location and fact that veronica ran after piz and kissed him back were not in keeping with veronica s character rowan kaiser writing for a v club was also critical of case of week and episode in general while admiring show s decision to address controversial issue of islamophobia in united states he did not like show s characterization of rashad father noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not there are three seemingly equal interpretations that veronica mars writers believe that cartoon is worth ruining someone s life over that rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive or it s just a bunch of stuff that happens and there is no moral references
