marasmius rotula is a common species of agaric fungus in family marasmiaceae widespread in northern hemisphere it is commonly known variously as pinwheel mushroom pinwheel marasmius little wheel collared parachute or horse hair fungus type species of genus marasmius m rotula was first described scientifically in 1772 by mycologist giovanni antonio scopoli and assigned its current name in 1838 by elias fries fruit bodies or mushrooms of m rotula are characterized by their whitish thin and membranous caps up to wide that are sunken in center and pleated with scalloped margins slender and wiry black hollow stems measure up to long by thick on underside of caps are widely spaced white gills that are attached to a collar encircling stem mushrooms grow in groups or clusters on decaying wood such as fallen twigs and sticks moss covered logs and stumps unlike other mushrooms known to release spores in response to a circadian rhythm spore release in m rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics there are several species of marasmius with which m rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances but differences in size gill arrangement and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them m rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications taxonomy species was first described by italian mycologist giovanni antonio scopoli as agaricus rotula in 1772 in 1821 elias magnus fries redescribed mushroom in systema mycologicum and later transferred it to marasmius in his 1838 epicrisis systematis mycologici synonyms include names derived from generic transfers to androsaceus by narcisse theophile patouillard in 1887 and to by otto kuntze in 1898 both of these genera are now obsolete and have since been sunk back into marasmius in his 1821 a natural arrangement of british plants samuel frederick gray introduced generic name micromphale including species micromphale which was based on william withering s 1796 in 1946 alexander h smith and rolf singer proposed to conserve name marasmius over micromphale latter had nomenclatorial priority as it was published first generic name marasmius with m rotula as lectotype species was later conserved at 1954 paris congress on botanical nomenclature m rotula is also type species of section marasmius within genus this grouping of species is characterized by inamyloid flesh a cap cuticle with broom cells finger like projections common to marasmius species ornamented with numerous warts gills usually attached to a collar surrounding stem and presence of black rhizomorphs on stem several varieties of m rotula have been described miles berkeley and moses ashley curtis named var fuscus in 1869 for its brown cap in 1887 pier andrea saccardo described var microcephalus from italy with caps half normal size it is now understood that fruit body morphology is variable and dependent upon environmental conditions joseph schroter described var in 1889 but that taxon is now treated as marasmius bulliardii marasmius rotula is commonly known as pinwheel mushroom pinwheel marasmius collared parachute or horse hair fungus this latter name is shared with other marasmius species including m androsaceus and m crinis equi gray called it collared dimple stool name little wheel fungus is suggestive of collar to which gills are attached like spokes of a wheel like specific epithet which is a diminutive of rota latin word for wheel description thumb left gills are attached to a collar encircling stem cap of fruit body is thin and membranous measuring in diameter it has a convex shape slightly depressed in center conspicuous furrows in an outline of gills and scalloped edges young caps are yellowish brown as cap expands color lightens to whitish or light pinkish white often with a darker sometimes brown center variety fusca has brown caps white or slightly yellowish flesh is very thin reaching about 0 25 1 5 mm thick in central part of cap and even thinner at margin gills are attached to a collar never to stem although some specimens have collar pressed close enough to it that this characteristic may be less obvious widely spaced they have same whitish to pale yellow color as flesh and typically number between 16 and 22 they are initially narrow but thicken downward to about 1 3 mm at exposed edge stem is long and up to thick with a smooth sometimes shiny surface it is tough hollow and either straight or with some curving color is blackish brown up to a lighter almost translucent apex base of stem may be connected to dark brown or black root like rhizomorphs 0 1 0 3 mm thick mature specimens display no veil details of fruit bodies appearance color in particular are somewhat variable and dependent on growing conditions for example specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in spring tend to have more yellowish white depressed caps than those found in same location in autumn which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape fruit body development of m rotula is with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by tissues robert kuhner showed that a cortina like tissue covers young gills before expanding cap breaks away from stem in unfavorable weather conditions mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi basidiocarps microscopic characteristics viewed in deposit such as with a spore print spores of marasmius rotula appear white or pale yellow under an optical microscope they are hyaline translucent teardrop or pip shaped and have dimensions of 7 10 by 3 5 um basidia spore producing cells are four spored club shaped or nearly so and 21 21 by 4 17 um along edge of gill interspersed among basidia are non reproductive cells cheilocystidia these are club shaped with rough wart like protuberances on surface gill edges further feature broom cells which are variably shaped thin walled and measure 7 32 by 2 5 20 um their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish blunt and conical warts or incrustations 0 2 1 5 by 0 1 1 um similar species there are several less common species of marasmius with which m rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances but differences in size gill arrangement and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish between them for example marasmius capillaris has a pale tan cap with a white center and grows on oak leaves without forming clusters furthermore its cap is evenly rounded unlike pleated and furrowed cap of m rotula and its stem is somewhat thinner usually less than 0 3 mm and slightly darker in color m rotula is distinguished from m bulliardii by its larger size and greater number of gills m is found in marshes where it fruits on dead stems of reeds and rushes nigripes formerly treated in marasmius has white caps that are in diameter attached gills that are sometimes slightly decurrent a dark stem covered with tiny white hairs that give it a powdered appearance and triangular to star shaped spores m described from brazil was considered by its discoverer rolf singer to be closely related to m rotula in addition to its tropical distribution it can distinguished from m rotula by its smaller size and more widely spaced gills m known only from montane forests of trinidad can only be reliably distinguished from m rotula by microscopic characteristics it has smaller ovoid spores measuring 5 by 2 5 um other marasmius species with a pinwheel arrangement of gills are readily distinguished from m rotula by differences in color including orange m pink m and rust m mycena is smaller than marasmius rotula has a pale pink brown cap and is usually found growing singly or in small groups on bark near base of living trees ecology and distribution marasmius rotula is a saprobic species and as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter it grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood especially beech woody debris such as twigs or sticks and occasionally on rotting leaves fruit bodies which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size are often present in abundance after rains species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials and will grow poorly or not at all under water stress conditions it is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that water holding capacity increases in deeper layers of soil magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with fruit bodies stems thumb right marasmius rotula jpg fruit bodies typically grow in clusters on woody debris in 1975 american mycologist martina s gilliam investigated periodicity of spore release in m rotula and concluded that spore discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms but rather was dependent on rain a threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and duration of peak spore discharge correlates with amount of rainfall rather than its duration furthermore gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if stem ends were placed in water suggesting that water must enter through fruit body for discharge to occur like those of many other species of marasmius fruit bodies of m rotula can and shrivel in dry periods then revive when sufficient moisture is available again in form of rain or high humidity gilliam s study demonstrated that revived fruit bodies were capable of discharging spores over a period of at least three weeks whereas previous studies using similar methods with other agaricomycetes showed spore discharge occurred over a shorter period of up to six days after revival potential for sustained spore production and discharge may be due to growth of new basidioles immature basidia during periods of growth which then complete maturation when mushroom revives this may also explain why gills become thicker as mushroom matures fungus is widespread and common in its preferred habitats in north america europe and northern asia although far less common in southerly locations isolated collections have been reported from africa congo nigeria sierra leone and tanzania and south asia india in north america m rotula is most common in eastern part of continent uses marasmius rotula is generally considered inedible but is not poisonous mushroom has no distinguishable odor and its flavor varies from bland or bitter louis krieger writing in national geographic in 1920s noted that mushroom was used as an addition to and when used to garnish venison adds appropriate touch of wild woodlands fruit bodies will bioaccumulate cadmium a study of metal concentration of 15 wild mushroom species of india showed that m rotula accumulated highest concentration of that metal a peroxidase enzyme known as marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase is attracting research interest for possible applications in in general enzymes that catalyze oxygen transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions fungal can catalyze oxidations that are difficult for organic chemist including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline 4 hydroquinone catechol and paracetamol m rotula enzyme is first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields it is highly stable over a wide ph range and in a variety of organic solvents enzyme has other potential for use as a for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring see also list of marasmius species references cited literature external links
