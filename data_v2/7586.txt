ocean class ironclads were a class of three wooden hulled armored frigates built for french navy in mid to late 1860s attempted to blockade prussian ports in baltic sea in 1870 during franco prussian war and participated in french conquest of tunisia in 1881 was often used as flagship for cherbourg division channel division mediterranean squadron and northern squadron during her career ships were discarded during 1890s design and description ocean class ironclads were designed by henri dupuy de lome as an improved version of s ships were central battery ironclads with armament concentrated amidships de balincourt and vincent brechignac 1975 p 26 for first time in a french ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in hull like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal reinforced ram gardiner p 288 ships measured overall with a beam of they had a maximum draft of and displaced their crew numbered between 750 and 778 officers and men metacentric height of ships was very low between ships were over weight as completed their draught so exceeded that designed for them that an increase of stability by ballast was impossible ocean class were reported to be able to carry all sail safely were good sea boats steady and well behaved but lacking in stiffness resistance to heeling propulsion ocean class ships had one horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engine driving a single propeller using steam provided by eight oval boilers on sea trials engines produced between and ships reached they carried of coal which allowed them to steam for approximately at a speed of ocean class ships were barque or barquentine rigged with three masts and had a sail area around armament initial design was to have a main armament of four guns and four guns on main deck in an armoured central battery and four guns in open topped armoured barbettes on spar deck in 1869 armament was changed to four 24 cm guns in barbettes and either six or eight 24 cm guns in battery which was then changed to four 24 cm guns in barbettes and four cm guns in battery ship s sides were not recessed so main deck guns could not fire fore or aft but barbettes were slightly sponsoned out over sides of hull if barbette guns were fired at angles smaller than 45 degrees from keel line crew had to be withdrawn from extremities of ship for practical purposes arc of fire of each barbette was about 100 degrees main deck battery was above waterline and spar deck and barbette guns were above waterline barbettes had steam powered turntables they also had a secondary armament mounted on broadside on spar deck of six guns rear pair could be moved to stern to fire aft 18 caliber 27 cm modele 1870 gun had a caliber of 274 millimeters and fired an armor piercing shell while gun itself weighed gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of and was credited with ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at muzzle armor piercing shell of 19 caliber 24 cm modele 1870 gun had a caliber of 240 millimeters weighed while gun itself weighed it had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at muzzle 138 millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed it fired a explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells brassey p 477 by 1885 all of 138 millimeter guns were replaced by four or six guns silverstone p 62 at some point ships received a dozen hotchkiss 5 barrel revolving guns they fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about to a range of about they had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute late in ships careers four above water torpedo tubes were added armor ocean class ships had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron sides of battery itself were armored with of wrought iron barbette armor was thick unarmored portions of their sides were protected by iron plates gardiner and gibbons say that barbette armor was later removed to improve their stability but this is not confirmed by any other source ships ship builder laid down launched commissioned fate displacement maximum speed power tonnes long

cost of each ship as 1 302 000 for hull and machinery excluding armament rigging and first outfit of stores and 260 680 for machinery alone thomas brassey gave cost of marengo as ps280 000 and suffren as ps260 400 service during franco prussian war of 1870 71 ocean was assigned to northern squadron that attempted to blockade prussian ports on baltic until recalled on 16 september 1870 and ordered to return to cherbourg de balincourt and vincent brechignac 1975 p 30 afterward she was assigned to evolutionary squadron until 1875 when she was placed in reserve ocean was recommissioned in 1879 for service with mediterranean squadron she had a lengthy refit in 1884 85 and was assigned to northern squadron after it was completed around 1888 ship was transferred back to mediterranean squadron until she was reduced to reserve around 1891 ocean was assigned to gunnery school that same year and later became a training ship for naval apprentices before being condemned in 1894 marengo was running her sea trials when franco prussian war began and was immediately put in reserve she was recommissioned in 1872 for service with mediterranean squadron until 1876 when she was again placed in reserve on 2 october 1880 ship was recommissioned and assigned to mediterranean squadron marengo was transferred to levant squadron on 13 february 1881 and bombarded tunisian port of sfax in july 1881 as part of french conquest of tunisia wilson pp 3 4 she remained in mediterranean until she was assigned to reserve squadron in 1886 in 1888 marengo became flagship of northern squadron and led squadron during its port visit to kronstadt in 1891 p 3 she was reduced to reserve following year and sold in 1896 de balincourt and vincent brechignac 1975 pp 26 27 suffren was placed into reserve after she completed her sea trials and was not commissioned until 1 march 1876 when she became flagship of cherbourg division throughout her career ship was often used as a flagship because of her spacious admiral s quarters on 1 september 1880 ship was assigned to division that participated in international naval demonstration at ragusa later that month under command of vice admiral seymour of
