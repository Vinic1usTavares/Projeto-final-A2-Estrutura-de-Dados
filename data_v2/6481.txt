southern providence metropolitan area directly linking providence with eastern washington county beaches of narragansett and south kingstown and city of newport route 4 begins as a two lane divided highway at an intersection with u s route 1 us 1 in town of north kingstown becoming a limited access freeway after route has four numbered interchanges before terminating in city of warwick where northbound lanes merge into interstate 95 i 95 origins of route 4 date back to 1952 when construction began on a short unnumbered arterial from us 1 to modern location of exit 3 at routes 2 and 102 in wickford in 1965 rhode island department of public works began work on a freeway from modern exit 3 north to merge with i 95 freeway designated as route 4 was completed in 1972 at that time route 4 designation was also applied to wickford arterial in 1988 missing link in route 4 between exits 3 and 5 was completed and opened rhode island department of transportation had long term plans to upgrade southernmost portion of route 4 to freeway status by constructing overpasses at oak hill road and west allenton road and a grade separation with us 1 although project was originally scheduled to be completed by 2007 55 million project has been postponed indefinitely route description left thumb alt ground level of two lanes of a divided highway with a small grassy median highway intersects

kettle hole pond and to southwest of secret lake in a heavily forested region after secret lake highway curves to north crossing oak hill road at another at grade intersection shortly after intersection with oak hill road route 4 transitions from a divided arterial highway into a four lane limited access freeway freeway passes to west of belleville pond and begins to parallel alignment

before interchanging with route 401 freeway s final spur at another partial cloverleaf interchange exit 9 is also used to access route 2 and i 95 south which has no direct freeway connection with route 4 north shortly after exit 9 route 4 designation ends and mainline of highway defaults onto i 95 north history in 1950 rhode island general assembly passed a 12 million equivalent to in bond issue to fund construction of a four lane divided arterial bypass of u s route 1 in wickford construction on highway began in 1952 and was completed in 1954 at which time roadway opened as an unnumbered state highway leading from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 in wickford thumb left alt ground level view of a four lane divided highway with a wide grassy median separating opposing lanes of

completion of arterial rhode island department of public works ridpw proposed a relocation of route 2 which at time was major thoroughfare in area no action was taken until 1964 when ridpw introduced a study for relocated route 2 proposal during study drivers who used colonel rodman highway arterial and were bound for state capital of providence were redirected onto route 2 an accident prone four lane undivided highway near modern exit 3 in 1965 planned route 2 freeway was given new number of route 4 leaving route 2 on its existing alignment a public hearing was held by state of rhode island on proposed freeway which was to be four lanes and have a divided grassy median this proposal was later accepted and construction began two years later construction of a long section of route 4 from what is now exit 5 in east greenwich to i 95 in warwick began in 1967 and was completed in 1972 that year arterial south of modern exit 3 was also designated as part of route 4 divided highway remains largely intact to this date as stretch of route 4 from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 at exit 3 only piece of arterial that has been significantly altered is construction of a bridge over amtrak s northeast corridor line by early 1970s route 4 was complete north of exit 5 and south of what would become exit 3 but there was a still a missing piece in highway between two exits in 1970s state of rhode island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns both of which delayed construction of missing link for nearly eleven years environmental studies on missing link began in 1977 and state estimated that long section of freeway would cost 15 21 million equivalent to million in to construct right thumb alt ground level view of a four lane divided highway with a narrow grassy median

transportation ridot began construction of new segment of route 4 between exits 3 and 5 project which ultimately went over budget at 24 million equivalent to million in was financed from a 63 million federal grant in 1986 during excavation for new right of way department of transportation found archeological items from narragansett indians dating from about 2 000 to 4 500 years prior although findings were not centralized in area this caused delays for extension of freeway on august 6 1988 completed construction and performed a ribbon cutting ceremony for new highway in january 1990 two police cruisers were severely damaged during a chase on route 4 a driver was speeding in southbound lanes of route 4 near exit 7 when driver exited at route 402 frenchtown road two police officers got into serious accidents in their attempts to pursue vehicle after crashes american civil liberties union restarted efforts to amend police chase policy and avoid further crash related injuries for officers in line of duty in 2000 construction began on quonset freeway a relocated route 403 that serves quonset business park from route 4 project included reconstruction and reworking of exit 7 off route 4 which was a southbound only exit serving both route 403 and route 402 when constructed exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between route 4 route 403 and route 402 and was completed in december 2008 one year ahead of schedule project included construction of a new northbound exit 7 serving route 403 east future left thumb alt ground level view of a four lane divided

department of transportation ridot has laid out long term plans for improvements to both southern and northern termini of route 4 during 1980s and 1990s ridot announced plans to eliminate three traffic lights along southern end of highway department planned to replace existing signalized us 1 and route 4 merge converting it into a grade separated interchange with an extensive overpass this would cut off access to three local roads that intersect us 1 near signal plan also included replacement of two other signaled intersections at west allenton road and oak hill road with overpasses overpass for west allenton road is planned to be constructed as a new exit 4 in 1990s state purchased and demolished several houses in region to allow for an expanded route 4 right of way in vicinity of west allenton road upgrade proposal proved to be very unpopular with north kingstown residents who lived on affected local roads additionally ridot laid highway out so that route 4 would cross through wetlands in area this sparked environmental concerns as one of large wetlands that would be affected s marsh was deemed to be of high value by rhode island environmentalists despite local and environmental concerns ridot still considers route 4 upgrade to be safest way to improve traffic flow in region while department of transportation considered upgrading nearby route 2 to freeway standards as a potential alternative this plan was ultimately rejected because of its effects on wells in area although project was originally scheduled to be completed by 2007 55 million project has been postponed indefinitely ridot also has long range plans to construct direct freeway connections linking route 4 north with i 95 south and i 95 north with route 4 south as of november 2010 environmental studies are being prepared for a reconfiguration of interchange exit list exit numbers are sequential ridot plans to renumber all exits including those on route 4 to mileage based numbering by 2020 in december 2018 ridot announced that route 4 would be part of second round of exit renumbering to begin in early 2019 https www ri gov press view list of new exit numbers run from
