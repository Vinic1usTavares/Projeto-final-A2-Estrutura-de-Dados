initially hesitant to handle music for first kingdom hearts mix of a square style story and disney characters made it hard to imagine what game would be like which made it difficult to compose music

maintain original mood and atmosphere of them while complying with technical specifications of playstation 2 for example original orchestrated arrangement of song this is halloween from nightmare before christmas was impossible to reproduce on playstation 2 s sound system to keep aspects of it intact shimomura used a trial and error method to arrange piece in creating original music shimomura wanted to create compositions that would make players feel good while playing to accompany action aspect of kingdom hearts she played game and looked over scripts and illustrations for inspiration after coming up with ideas she discussed them with director tetsuya nomura and game planners for playstation 2 re release of kingdom hearts chain of memories she and her team spent much of their time working on fight music shimomura wanted different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness and sadness to handle large workload for kingdom hearts coded kingdom hearts 358 2 days
