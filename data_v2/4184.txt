third person perspective collecting and buying items and equipment talking to non playable characters who act as quest givers and merchants solving environmental puzzles and completing both story centered quests and side quests turn based battles are triggered through both random and scripted encounters each player character has hit points health skill points magic and sanity points sp sp ordinarily decrease once per turn and when a character runs out of sp they go berserk and cannot be controlled by player each character has two basic attack types single attacks which range from normal attacks to powerful hard hit and double attacks which allow one character to take two actions in a single turn characters including enemy groups can use combos with two or more characters characters link up to perform a succession of compatible attacks there are two combo types standard combos and double combos which are mechanically similar to double attacks double attacks and all combos draw from a stock gauge which is filled by attacking or being attacked after each battle party gains experience points which raise their level permanently raising health magic and sp greater experience and more valuable items are awarded for good battle performance new skills are attained by each character through story driven side quests central to combat is judgement ring represented as a disc with colored areas on its surface player s aim is to hit those areas as a pointer passes over them if player fails to hit an area attack can either be shortened or cancelled altogether small red colored strike areas boost power of an action while magic attacks have increasingly dark hues near end of a hit area with hits in those areas making spell more powerful judgement ring is used for every battle action from standard attacks and special abilities to using items players can choose to automate judgement ring but this removes strike option and decreases action power during combos missing a hit area on judgement ring breaks rest of combo and removes any subsequent character s turns after a certain point in game judgement ring can be customised for each character potentially easing difficulty judgement ring is also used in other gameplay areas such as gaining discounts from shops and in some mini games a power unique to main heroine shania is fusion during course of story shania unlocks ability to transform into different monstrous forms altering her stats and giving her unique abilities each fusion costs sp and while in a fusion form sp decreases with each turn fusions are increased in strength using spirit energy collected after each battle which is fed into collectable totems associated with each form for characters other than shania magic is unlocked using stellar charts each character equips compatible stellar items in slots which give a character access to different spells stellar charts can be upgraded and expanded allowing for new and more

challenges to different team members caused by this by march 2005 game was 60 complete while previous shadow hearts titles were based on eurasian continent from new world moved to americas giving developers a fresh start new setting and characters allowed team to create a beginner friendly narrative which would attract a larger audience with story being a spin off only loosely connected to events of shadow hearts and covenant rather than portraying a grand mythology narrative focused on individuals within struggle created within shadow hearts series despite its spin off status team treated johnny with gravity of a mainline shadow hearts protagonist while series continued to use real locations team did not want to be too realistic so added in anachronistic locations ishida who had worked on series since covenant was in charge of battle system it was based on system used in covenant although new elements such as stock gauge were added to increase strategy battle system expansions which included ability for enemies to use combo attacks were done based on a combination of staff wishes an fan feedback kato designed all characters with some going through notable redesigns one was natan whose early character design was far leaner than his final appearance for shania s fusion forms she was given direction to make them appear like goddesses rather than monsters

problems with data storage cgi cutscenes were created by computer graphics studio avant with motion capture being handled by avant had previously created cgi cutscenes for covenant many of motion capture actors had previously worked on covenant real time cutscenes were made more cinematic with more attention paid to camera angles and character movement despite change to a lighter atmosphere

units despite general low sales for their game business division aruze credited release of from new world with that division showing a profit that year japanese gaming magazine famitsu gave much praise to narrative and its characters noting use of comedy and numerous side stories related to each player character rob fahay of eurogamer enjoyed story s pacing but found amount of humour off putting compared to balance struck in covenant and took longer to like cast gamepro found varied cast to be game s strongest element and gamespots bethany massimilla said story remains compelling if insane throughout gamespys gerald villoria felt that storyline lack cohesion jeremy dunham of ign criticised an imbalance between dungeon exploration and narrative that negatively affected an otherwise enjoyable story tristan kalogeropoulos noted more absurd storyline and characters compared to earlier shadow hearts games and negatively noted stereotypes of american culture and history used in game rpgfans patrick gann lauded storytelling and characters but was disappointed by game s good ending as it ran against themes of both game and series famitsu noted that game seemed to have solid production values massimilla though environment and dungeon designs were but praised character designs as strongest aspect of game s visuals villoria similarly praised character designs and dunham cited graphics and cgi cutscenes as one of game s strengths despite lacking higher resolution or widescreen support kalogeropoulos praised cgi and real time cutscenes while gann lauded amount of effort put into visual and stylistic presentation by nautilus voice acting divided opinion some gave praise while others faulted it in contrast music was met with a generally positive response gameplay was described by famitsu simply as an orthodox rpg while fahay commented that battle system remains just as strong and compelling as it was in covenant gamepro enjoyed battle system but found stellar upgrades underdeveloped and was extremely critical of puzzle designs massimilla enjoyed combat options but disliked both dungeon design and reliance of character progression on side quests villoria praised breadth and depth of combat but found random encounters underwhelming compared to scripted boss fights dunham enjoyed additions and tweaks to battle system but faulted dungeon design kalogeropoulos praised battle system for encouraging player interaction in actions normally governed by chance in rpgs in addition to variety of move types but noted that character growth system was geared more towards than casual players gann lauded game design but noted that there were still weak parts of overall design inherent to shadow hearts series like other reviewers he criticised dungeon
