illegal smith was issued a pass through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th smith argued that he was forced down below yellow line i was always told that rule is if you get forced down there then you are winner of race and on last lap anything goes that s what i was going with i had a nose inside of him and i could have piled up whole field ninth place finisher johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below yellow line on last lap of previous day s craftsman truck series race which were circulated on day of amp energy 500 i didn t know what to really think

beforehand in pre race drivers meeting about gaining a position illegally earnhardt said he felt smith deserved to win saying there was a lack of clarity over what going below yellow line meant smith stated he did not ask for clarification of rule because of his low profile status nascar president mike helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded penalty to smith and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below yellow line at any time during a race similarities were made between smith s overtake and earnhardt s pass of kenseth below yellow line
