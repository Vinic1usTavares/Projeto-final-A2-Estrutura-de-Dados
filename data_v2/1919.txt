philadelphia council was assigned to serve as director of council s summer camp at treasure island scout reservation on delaware river he believed that summer camp experience should do more than just teach proficiency in scoutcraft skills rather principles embodied in scout oath and scout law should become realities in lives of scouts along with his assistant camp director carroll a edson he started an experimental honor society to acknowledge those campers he felt best exemplified these qualities calling program wimachtendienk or brotherhood in one of lenape dialects full original name for organization was wimachtendienk wingolauchsik witahemui brotherhood of those who serve cheerfully it is still referred to via inclusion of letters w w w on most lodge patches https history oa bsa org node goodman and edson decided that a camp fraternity was way to improve summer camp experience and to encourage older scouts to continue attending scout summer camp in developing this program they borrowed from traditions and practices of several other organizations edward cave s boy s camp book 1914 was consulted for concept of a camp society that would perpetuate camp traditions college fraternities were also influential for their concepts of brotherhood and rituals and idea of new members pledging themselves to new organization inspired by ernest thompson seton s previous woodcraft indians program american indian motifs were used to make organization interesting and appealing to youth other influences include brotherhood of andrew and phillip a presbyterian church youth group with which goodman had been involved as a young man and freemasonry traditions and rituals of freemasonry contributed more to basic structure of oa ritual than any other organization in fact there appears to be no known fraternal organization more faithful in form to freemasonry than oa familiar terms such as lodge and obligation were borrowed from masonic practice as were most of ceremonial structures and ritual formulae even early national meeting was called a grand lodge a masonic reference goodman and edson ultimately devised a program where troops chose at summer camp s conclusion those boys from among their number who they felt best exemplified ideals of scouting those elected were acknowledged as having displayed in eyes of their fellow scouts a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood edson and goodman said they based oa s lore and ceremonies on lore of lenni lenape indians who had occupied treasure island in earlier times and based group s structure on a loose interpretation of hiawatha and last of mohicans both popular fiction by james fenimore cooper scouts considered this move a success and went on to repeat this pattern following summer at treasure island those scouts honored at treasure island in 1915 and 1916 would become members of what is now unami lodge by 1921 goodman had spoken to scout leaders in surrounding states about their honor society which resulted in multiple lodges being established by scout councils in northeastern united states name of society was then changed to order of arrow and in october 1921 goodman convened first national meeting of what at that time was called national lodge of order of arrow in philadelphia where goodman was elected as grand chieftain committees were organized to formulate a constitution refine ceremonial rituals devise insignia and plan future development in early 1920s many scout executives were skeptical of what they called secret camp fraternities by september 1922 opposition to order of arrow was such that a formal resolution opposing camp fraternities was proposed at a national meeting of scout executives goodman argued against motion using scout ideals as our great objective he said a camp activity that will further advancement of those ideals should not be suppressed motion was narrowly defeated and fledgling order continued as an experimental program throughout 1920s and 1930s in 1931 there were oa lodges in 7 percent of bsa councils nationwide by 1948 about two thirds of bsa s councils had established oa lodges that year oa was also integrated as an official part of scouting program 21st century over century since order of arrow s founding more than one million scouts and scouters have worn oa sash on their uniforms denoting membership in

american ceremonies regalia and artwork they consider to be offensive in 2015 oa member philip rice wrote a letter to state news of michigan state university to protest hosting national order of arrow conference on msu campus he felt oa s former logo a stylized image of a generic native face with a swirling headdress was offensive but better than central michigan university s defunct chippewa logo and washington redskins logo he also objected to a prominent image of original chief bonnet worn by a young white man on oa s website he acknowledged recent changes toward social awareness such as changing logo to a rough hewn arrowhead but concluded that oa remains guilty of flagrant cultural appropriation and borderline racism use of native american sacred objects by non native groups such as boy scouts has been condemned by native activists mother of former scouts writes while native children in residential schools had their culture and language beaten from them boy scouts were using language and their version of indian culture in their oa ceremony she stresses that proper use of drum pipe and eagle feather along with other sacred ways is a great responsibility in native american cultures that traditional ways are not a costume and that these sacred ways are still part of lives of native american people who want them preserved intact for their own children rather than used by just anyone she called oa s use of headdresses face paint eagle feathers and dancing with a pipe downright offensive after researching oa and watching their ceremonies she said use of these items by boy scouts indicates that there is very little understanding of native people they claim to admire and respect david professor in university of illinois history department states order of arrow is one
