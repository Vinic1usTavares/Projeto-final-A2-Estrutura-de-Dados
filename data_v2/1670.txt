early life alfred manuel martin jr was born on may 16 1928 in berkeley california he was given his father s name elder martin usually nicknamed al was a truck driver for city of berkeley al martin had been born in kauai son of portuguese immigrants and had moved to oakland billy martin s mother s birth name was salvini but she went by first name jenny for most of her life daughter of italian immigrants who had lived in san francisco but who moved across bay about time of 1906 earthquake she also changed her last name first when she married donato pisani around 1918 by whom she had a son frank nicknamed tudo before marriage broke up jenny later claimed donato was unfaithful there is some doubt that jenny and al ever married but they lived together as a wedded couple for a time during which billy martin was born at his maternal grandmother s house in west berkeley billy martin acquired his name because his grandmother who never mastered english would croon bello beautiful repeatedly over baby who only learned his birth name when a teacher used it at school martin couple broke up soon after billy was born and each later accused other of infidelity in any event billy martin would have no further contact with his father until he was in his thirties and conflict between parents likely left him with emotional wounds with al martin having returned to his native hawaii jenny no longer used his name either in conversation or as part of hers and before billy s first birthday had met john jack downey a laborer and jack of all trades whom she married in late 1929 and whose name she took for herself but not for her sons billy martin later called his stepfather a great guy jenny always regretted that fame came to her son under name billy martin not billy downey billy was an indifferent student once he started school and from age of about 12 was often in trouble with teachers or principal his unusual home situation his small size and large nose and his residence in poverty stricken west berkeley caused other children to mock him leading to conflict intensely competitive and thin skinned he quickly gained a reputation as a street fighter who would do almost anything to win sports proved an outlet for martin s competitiveness he boxed at an amateur level but it was baseball that proved to be his calling his older brother tudo 10 years his senior had grown up with augie galan an outfielder for chicago cubs from 1934 to 1941 who continued in major leagues until his retirement in 1949 galan like other professional ballplayers made james kenney park in berkeley his off season training ground for there was a well maintained baseball field there tudo was a good enough ballplayer that he was often invited to play and billy would follow along as boy got to play more and more as he grew galan took a special interest in tutoring martin in art of baseball when martin reached berkeley high school which he attended from 1942 to 1946 he was dressed worse than many students from more upscale housing east of san pablo avenue but gained acceptance through sports especially baseball raising his batting average from a poor 210 as a sophomore to an outstanding 450 as a senior he was an aggressive player and was involved in fights both in and out of baseball uniform one such on field incident his senior year led to his dismissal from team and concerned professional baseball teams considering signing him he was given a workout by brooklyn dodgers but they chose another california infielder jackie robinson oakland oaks a pacific coast league team had been quietly scouting martin for years impressed with everything but his temper soon after martin s high school graduation oaks trainer red adams persuaded team s new manager casey stengel to give martin a tryout stengel had seen martin play in a high school all star game and though martin did not play well stengel had told him that he had a future in baseball within weeks of tryout an infielder for oaks class d affiliate idaho falls was injured and stengel recommended that team owner brick laws sign martin laws did so but first attempted without success to put a clause in contract that would have nullified it if martin misbehaved in a way similar to fight that had ended his high school career he would not be last baseball owner to attempt to regulate martin s behavior in such a manner playing career 1946 1961 reaching majors 1946 1949 18 year old martin was unimpressive with idaho falls in 1946 hitting 254 while playing mostly third base and racking up many throwing errors he had a good spring training with oaks in 1947 but was sent to class c phoenix senators of arizona texas league martin felt he should have remained with oaks and told stengel so manager s response prove me wrong playing most day games in arid southwest in era before widespread air conditioning senators endured harsh playing and living conditions as many of them boarded in a barracks beyond right field fence nevertheless martin thrived there wearing uniform number 1 a number he tried to secure with each team he played for he hit 393 highest average in organized baseball in 1947 drove in 173 runs and was named league s most valuable player when team s regular second baseman was injured in a fight with opposing catcher clint courtney with whom martin would lock horns himself martin was moved from third base and would remain as a second baseman for most of remainder of his playing career phoenix s season ended before that of oaks and martin was called up to parent club though he did not play much martin won two games with doubles and was an instant hit with fans at oaks park when not playing martin closely shadowed stengel wanting to learn why manager made decisions he did this impressed stengel who during his time as an outfielder for new york giants had sought to learn from their manager john mcgraw stengel and martin grew closer in what has sometimes been described as a father son relationship stengel had no children and martin had been abandoned by his father according to martin biographer peter golenbock two men punk kid and old time ballplayer would develop a bond that would not be broken for a decade binding them was their deep love for game of baseball martin made oaks roster in 1948 but was slow to get regular playing time as oaks had a former major leaguer at each position and stengel did not want to use martin until young ballplayer was ready instead manager had martin sit on bench next to him as he pointed out nuances of game martin also learned about life on and off field from his teammates stengel assigned veteran players to work with martin and be his roommate on road trips at first mel duezabou a student of art of hitting with a lifetime minor league batting average over 300 who improved martin at plate later in season duezabou was replaced with cookie a fellow infielder and former dodgers star who was able to help martin with fielding and advise him on what to expect in major leagues as injuries depleted oaks regulars martin got increasing playing time and finished season with a 277 batting average 3 home runs and 42 runs batted in he became a team leader active in brawls on field and a loud and annoying bench jockey in an era when a player often had to contend with a stream of insults from opposing team s dugout oaks won pcl pennant and governors cup playoffs martin s reward for championship was a new car bought by laws but to his distress stengel s reward was manager s job with new york yankees leaving martin feeling abandoned he was especially dispirited because his lifelong desire was to be a yankee stengel s replacement with oaks was charlie dressen highly knowledgeable about game dressen was initially wary of martin as a stengel favorite but was won over by second baseman s hard work and desire to learn martin s education continued under dressen as he learned such things as art of stealing signs and learned to try to force other team into game deciding mistakes although team did not play as well as it had in 1948 martin improved his statistics hitting 286 with 12 home runs and 92 runs batted in at same time stengel who was managing yankees to 1949 american league pennant and a world series triumph talked of martin to new york press leading many to assume he would soon be a yankee on october 13 1949 martin and fellow oak jackie jensen were acquired by yankees yankee years 1950 1957 thumb upright casey stengel in 1953 press coverage of martin s sale by oaks to yankees dismissed him as a utility infielder calling him alfred m martin a name he detested he was among those younger yankees players including whitey ford yogi berra and mickey mantle who reported in february 1950 to a pre spring training instructional camp in phoenix to work on fundamentals under stengel s eye martin hoped to become starting second baseman for defending world champion yankees but incumbent jerry coleman had just won american league rookie of league award on reporting to spring training in st petersburg florida he stood out for his brashness if nothing else taking care to correct press on how to refer to him confident of stengel s protection martin sometimes defied yankee coaches such as frank crosetti and jim turner but won over most of his teammates as he showed his desire to learn and win goals consistent with yankee way that individual achievement was insignificant compared to team victory martin made his major league debut on april 18 1950 opening day for yankees as they visited boston red sox at fenway park as a pinch hitter inserted in eighth inning with yankees down 9 4 with two men on base martin doubled off green monster in left field to drive in runners yankees batted around and in his second at bat of inning he singled with bases loaded to drive in two more runs first time in major league history that a player got two hits in an inning in his debut game despite feat martin was not made an everyday player but sat next to stengel in dugout listening and learning when he did play he quickly became a favorite of yankee stadium crowd and they would remain loyal to him for rest of his life despite his stellar start martin was little used by yankees in 1950 and 1951 as coleman remained starting second baseman martin was sent to minor leagues in may 1950 to give him everyday playing experience a decision with which he vociferously disagreed and so stated to yankee general manager george weiss an outburst that martin always believed poisoned relationship between himself and team front office he was recalled after a month but remained mostly on bench with only 39 plate appearances for yankees in 1950 batting 250 yankees won pennant again and swept philadelphia phillies in 1950 world series in which martin did not play and coleman was most valuable player after season with korean war raging 22 year old was drafted into army but gained a hardship discharge after two months something that made him less of a hero in west berkeley he was discharged in late april and rejoined yankees but was used sparingly rookie of year gil absorbing what playing time at second base was not used by coleman martin wearing uniform number 1 for yankees for first time hit 259 in 51 games martin helped bring rookie outfielder mickey mantle out of his shell introducing him to new york nightlife in 1951 world series which yankees won in six games over giants martin did not bat but was inserted as a pinch runner in game two with yankees leading by a run after losing game one martin scored a crucial insurance run in yankee victory evading tag from catcher roy noble and after game was singled out for praise by giants manager leo durocher thumb left martin s game saving catch of jackie robinson s popup in game 7 of 1952 world series coleman s induction into armed forces before 1952 season opened way for martin to be regular yankee second baseman his debut as such was delayed when he broke his ankle demonstrating technique of sliding into second base on a television show in march and it was not until may 12 that he made his regular season debut once he did he hit 267 in 109 games his highest as an everyday player becoming sparkplug that stengel had sought for his team energizing it when stengel offered 100 to any player who let himself be hit by a pitch martin earned 300 for game in 1952 world series against dodgers martin got 5 hits in 23 at bats but that included a three run home run to break open game two and tie series in game four with dodgers leading series two games to one and threatening to tie one run game in fifth inning charlie dressen who was coaching third base for dodgers called for squeeze play martin stole sign and runner was out when pitcher allie reynolds threw a pitchout killing rally in game seven with yankees up 4 2 in seventh inning two outs and bases loaded jackie robinson hit a high wind blown pop fly when first baseman joe collins appeared to lose ball in sun martin raced in from second base catching ball in fair ground near home plate only inches off grass all three runners would most likely have scored had ball dropped giving dodgers lead going into eighth inning martin biographer david falkner called catch one of great moments in world series history as yankees regular second baseman in 1953 martin saw his average drop to 257 but set what would be career highs with 149 games played 146 at second base 15 home runs and 75 runs batted in he was also ejected for first two occasions in his career once for arguing balls and strikes other for fighting with martin s growing reputation as a fighter opposing players often slid into second base hard hoping to injure him stengel stated billy s being hit with hardest blocks this side of a professional football field nevertheless he finished second in league in fielding percentage among second basemen yankees won their fifth consecutive pennant and in 1953 world series martin dominated collecting 12 hits tying a series record with 23 total bases breaking babe ruth s record of 19 as yankees beat dodgers in six games martin s hit in ninth inning of game six scored winning run he was elected series most valuable player stengel exulted look at him he doesn t look like a great player but he is a helluva player try to find something he can t do you can t thumb upright martin left with phil rizzuto in 1950s there had been congressional investigations into whether athletes and others were given preferable treatment to avoid conscription and in early 1954 martin was drafted into army his renewed request for a hardship discharge denied he complained to a reporter that he was given worse treatment than his fellow soldiers allowed fewer weekend passes and not allowed to play on fort ord baseball team he missed entire 1954 season in which yankees uniquely during martin s career with them did not win pennant and much of 1955 season he was transferred to fort carson in colorado where he was allowed to live off base he played on and managed baseball team and rose to rank of corporal in august 1955 a furlough allowed him to return to yankees and when they won pennant it was extended for 1955 world series although martin batted 300 for regular season and 320 with four runs batted in during series yankees lost to dodgers in seven games and martin berated himself for letting down stengel he was discharged from army later in october having been awarded good conduct medal during 1956 season weiss began to hint to media that martin was a poor influence on his fellow players especially on his roommate mantle with whom he often caroused until early hours of morning a dignified man weiss did not feel that martin fit image he wanted for yankees and may have been offended by player s outburst on being sent to minors in 1950 by 1956 yankees were developing next wave of infielders including bobby richardson and tony weiss would have liked to trade martin but was deterred by fact that second baseman was extremely popular with yankee fans and with press covering team although martin appeared in 1956 all star game his only all star appearance as a player his abilities as a player never fully returned after leaving army with richardson progressing rapidly through yankee farm system martin worried that his days with team were numbered nevertheless he hit 264 with nine home runs for yankees in 1956 and in 1956 world series against dodgers martin played well both in field and at plate getting hit that gave yankees lead for good in game four to tie series and hitting 296 with two home runs as yankees won in seven games thus finishing his world series career as a player with a 333 batting average thumb 180px left martin in 1957 weiss warned martin before 1957 season to avoid trouble and infielder did nothing to aid his own cause by injuring both himself and mantle reigning mvp in an intentional collision between their golf carts as they played a round on a florida course during spring training while martin recovered from this and other injuries bobby richardson played showing a fielding range that martin no longer possessed but incident that gave weiss leeway to trade martin was a brawl at copacabana nightclub in new york on may 16 although it was fellow yankee hank bauer who was accused of throwing first punch martin believed that weiss would blame him and as trade deadline of june 15 approached his foreboding and tension grew stories differ about how martin learned he had been traded to kansas city a s on trade deadline biographer david falkner stated that martin out of lineup in game at kansas city s municipal stadium was informed by farm director lee macphail and that stengel refused to see martin but martin in his autobiography alleged that he had been sitting in bullpen and that stengel came to inform him marty appel in his biography of stengel stated that martin was called in to see stengel was told of trade and martin blamed manager for not preventing it according to appel no one had worn yankees uniform more proudly than billy it was like a fraternity jacket to him an eighteen year exile was beginning for him and his sadness bitterness melancholy resentment and hurt never really faded his career as a journeyman infielder playing with six teams none more than a year and never to see world series again had begun among consequences of trade was loss of relationship with stengel with whom he rarely spoke in years that followed later career 1957 1961 martin switched dugouts after trade to a s and in his first game got two hits including a home run off yankees johnny then yankees left town without martin who now faced playing for a seventh place team with little hope of doing better he hit 360 in his first ten games but a s lost nine of them although martin hit 257 with kansas city an improvement over 241 he was hitting with yankees a s lost 94 games finishing 38 games behind yankees at end of season martin was traded to detroit tigers in a 13 player deal and he stated angrily they just can t throw us players around from one club to another without us having a say so detroit manager jack tighe called martin key to our future he was expected to electrify team as he had yankees without talent on field and stengel in dugout to back him up martin was unable to do that as after a decent start tigers settled down to a losing season and players became annoyed at martin s ways tigers had him play shortstop but he lacked range and throwing arm needed to be effective and made 20 errors for season he hit 255 with seven home runs but tigers finished fifth 15 games behind yankees after season martin and al were traded to cleveland in exchange for don mossi ray and ossie alvarez with martin at second base indians finished second in 1959 five games behind chicago white sox and ahead of third place yankees despite relatively good finish martin was embittered contending that if manager joe gordon had used him properly indians would have won pennant in august martin who did not wear a batting helmet was hit on head by a pitch from tex clevenger of washington senators breaking a cheekbone and giving him an unconscious fear of being hit again diminishing his effectiveness at plate he was traded after season to cincinnati reds manager fred hutchinson hoped martin could instill some fight into his team although he could not make reds a winner with his diminished skills he still was a battler on field notoriously fighting pitcher jim brewer of chicago cubs on august 4 1960 in aftermath of his beaning by clevenger teams pitched martin inside as did brewer after one such pitch martin on next swung and let his bat go though it landed far from pitching mound when he went out to retrieve it brewer approached martin swung at him and sometime during brawl a punch broke brewer s orbital bone though whether it was martin who did it or reds pitcher cal is uncertain martin was ejected his sixth and final ejection as a player and was suspended for five games and fined by national league president warren giles with brewer out for season cubs sued martin litigation dragged on for a decade and case was eventually settled in 1969 for 10 000 plus 12 000 attorney s fees martin who in press defended his actions as justified given pitchers threw inside to him asked do they want a check or cash although martin played 103 games for reds in 1960 batting 246 he had only three home runs and 16 runs batted in and following season was sold to milwaukee braves his old manager with oaks dressen led braves but even he could not find a starting position for martin he had only six at bats for braves with no hits and on june 1 1961 was traded to minnesota twins for billy martin given starting second baseman position started well and finished well for twins but in between had a prolonged batting slump between braves and twins he batted 242 for 1961 his lowest full season average he reported for spring training in 1962 but was soon approached by manager sam mele a longtime friend and told that he had been released by team no longer able to compete on field martin s playing career was over at age of 32 scout coach and minor league manager 1962 1968 martin accepted an offer by twins owner calvin griffith to be a scout for team he also took a job with grain belt brewery in public relations combination worked well martin proved himself a competent evaluator of talent while selling twins in bars across minnesota he urged twins to sign pitching prospect jim palmer but griffith was unwilling to pay 50 000 signing bonus palmer requested and pitcher went on to a hall of fame career with baltimore orioles with his survival in baseball on line martin kept his nose clean his drinking moderate and his fists with manager mele s consent griffith made martin third base coach before 1965 season leading to immediate media speculation that when twins hit a rough patch martin would be appointed as manager mele later denied having any feeling that martin was after his job and twins experienced few losing streaks in 1965 winning american league pennant martin worked with players to make them more aggressive on base paths he recognized talent of young rod carew and spent much time working with him to make him a better ballplayer twins had tried to trade shortstop versalles previous winter martin worked on his hitting and base running and versalles was voted league s most valuable player although twins lost 1965 world series to los angeles dodgers in seven games martin was given much of credit for getting them there in 1966 martin damaged his chances of promotion to managerial job by getting in a fight with twins traveling secretary howard fox twins and yankees shared a charter flight and players got rowdy martin refused fox s request that he intercede with his former teammates including mantle and ford to get them to quiet down when twins reached their hotel fox was slow to give martin his room key violating baseball s usual etiquette that manager and coaches got theirs first when martin demanded it fox threw it at him and after words were exchanged martin hit him in face martin was fined by griffith a friend of fox s when mele was fired in 1967 his replacement was not martin as had been widely speculated but cal ermer twins started 1968 season poorly and martin was called into griffith s office expecting to be offered ermer s job instead owner wanted to make martin manager of denver bears twins top affiliate at that time with an 8 22 record martin was reluctant to accept but did when his wife gretchen told him that he needed to prove his ability as a manager before getting a job as one in major leagues bears started well under 500 but by end of season had a winning record martin had stressed to team that they were a single unit with him as boss he instituted aggressive base running he had used in minnesota and focused on fundamentals when team lost he told them and anyone else within earshot exactly why they had lost third baseman graig nettles who would play again for martin as a major leaguer stated martin made players afraid to lose he defended them before outside world confronting umpires he was ejected from games eight times team was 65 50 under martin and by season s end there was widespread speculation that martin would be a major league manager in 1969 despite two al expansion teams seattle pilots and kansas city royals having vacancies and expressing interest in hiring martin he stated that his loyalty was to twins who had had another disappointing season on october 11 1968 twins gave martin a one year contract as manager said griffith i feel like i m sitting on a keg of dynamite managing career minnesota twins 1969 as twins manager martin continued aggressive baseball he had urged on team as third base coach team lost first four games of season on road but came home to largest opening day crowd since franchise moved to minnesota winning streaks of 5 and 8 games in april established team in first place in new american league west and kept fans coming to metropolitan stadium martin set a tone of willingness to do anything to win when oakland a s slugger reggie jackson hit home runs in his first two at bats against twins minnesota pitcher dick woodson threw a pitch behind jackson s head after a second pitch closer to jackson s head than to plate slugger charged mound provoking a full scale brawl for which jackson later blamed martin who he said had ordered pitches despite winning baseball owner griffith was less than enamored with martin s conduct griffith wanted martin to meet regularly with him to discuss team martin repeatedly showed up during time set aside for griffith s daily nap when pitcher dave boswell and outfielder bob allison got into a fight outside lindell a c sports bar in august martin joined battle repeatedly punching boswell who won 20 games that year martin claimed that boswell had come at him first which boswell denied although it was boswell who was fined by team griffith considered firing martin but decided that victories on field justified keeping him twins won western division by 9 games over oakland with boswell winning 8 games down stretch twins played orioles who had won 109 games during regular season twins had won 97 and who were managed by earl weaver in 1969 american league championship series alcs baltimore won first two games of best of five series at home with both games going extra innings at home for game three martin was expected to start star pitcher jim kaat but instead chose bob miller who was knocked out of box in second inning and twins were eliminated martin had been given a one year contract for 1969 he asked for a two year deal for 1970 and 1971 griffith was unhappy both that martin had not pitched kaat a friend of his and that explanation he had asked martin for had been because i m manager martin s decision was defensible as kaat had been struggling with injuries and miller had won during pennant race other events during season such as fight with boswell and martin kicking former us vice president hubert humphrey out of locker room when he tried to visit after a twins loss also embarrassed team twins executives had also received numerous complaints about martin drinking heavily during road trips and were angered when griffith told minneapolis tribune columnist sid hartman off record that twins were thinking of firing him although martin had led team to a division title fox and other twins executives felt martin was more trouble than he was worth and urged his dismissal griffith fired him on october 13 1969 there was outrage among twins fans and attendance which had been boosted by martin s presence and team s success sank in 1970 twins won their second straight division title but again lost alcs to baltimore in three games this time with kaat pitching and losing game three detroit tigers 1971 1973 martin spent 1970 season out of baseball for first time since 1946 but stayed in twin cities as an interviewer for minneapolis station kdwb he received nibbles of interest including from a s owner charlie finley and each later blamed other for failure to come to terms detroit tigers had won world series in 1968 but dropped below 500 two years later team general manager jim campbell felt that team could win again with right manager on october 2 1970 campbell fired manager mayo smith and gave martin a two year deal for 1971 and 1972 at an annual salary of 65 000 martin seemed to be an odd fit for tigers given their reputation under campbell but general manager felt that martin was spark tigers needed to return to contention martin announced that tigers would win 1971 american league east title and that orioles were over hill he made it clear that he was going to run team his way and his clubhouse tirades for poor play even during spring training were reported in media and concerned detroit management he had a well publicized feud with slugger willie horton whom martin repeatedly benched and who kept himself out of lineup with an alleged injury that martin disputed there were repeated conflicts with umpires and with personnel off field he accused organist in oakland of trying to distract his players and scoreboard operators in baltimore of spying on his team after a poor april martin s players won seven in a row to surge to within 4 games of top placing red sox near start of june results helped establish martin as one of best managers in baseball at least on field his generalship could not paper over flaws in ball club and tigers finished second 11 games behind orioles nevertheless martin led tigers to a 91 71 record a 12 game improvement from 1970 proving to many people that his success in minnesota had not been a fluke martin was rewarded with a new two year contract through 1973 with an increase in salary at spring training martin was relaxed and confident his tigers a favorite to win american league east season started late due to a player s strike and missed games were not made up which left teams playing an unequal number of games once play started martin was his usual self berating opposing managers and umpires from dugout and being ejected for it in second game of season against baltimore and weaver this was his first ejection as tigers manager there was a close al east pennant race in 1972 when tigers and orioles were joined by yankees and red sox in contending for division title with detroit winning those players hostile to martin remained silent season came down to a three game set between tigers and red sox with boston a half game ahead tigers won first two though they lost meaningless third game making them al east champs by a half game in 1972 american league championship series tigers faced oakland a s tigers lost game one in extra innings with a s up 5 0 in game two tigers pitcher hit speedy a s shortstop bert campaneris in legs before a national television audience campaneris threw his bat towards mound and a brawl ensued many believed martin had ordered campaneris hit tigers recovered from 2 0 deficit by winning games three and four at tiger stadium but lost game five and series martin was praised for taking tigers as far as he did but his lineup choices for game five were questioned playing catcher bill with a broken thumb while a healthy catcher duke sims played left field instead of horton both of martin s choices were involved in plays that resulted in a s runs which a better fielding player might have prevented nevertheless martin again received a revised two year contract through 1974 season 1973 season was not as successful for martin and tigers nevertheless martin did have some successes making john hiller a successful closer after pitcher had survived a heart attack and discovering ron leflore in a michigan prison leflore would go on to a successful major league career martin wanted campbell to trade some aging veterans to renew squad but campbell refused martin briefly quit during spring training when campbell did not uphold a fine he had imposed on horton factional conflict within team muted by team s 1972 success resurged as team fell behind in standings after spending much of summer in a spirited three way race with orioles and yankees martin angered campbell owner john fetzer and other tigers executives by criticizing front office in media campbell had defended martin in past when fetzer expressed concern about martin s off field behavior but became

short was a person martin knew and trusted from time in 1960s when short was an executive with twins after martin was dismissed by tigers short told his manager whitey herzog that he would fire his own grandmother to have a chance to hire martin short days later fired herzog and hired martin provoking herzog s comment i m fired i m grandmother martin faced a serious challenge in trying to rebuild a team that was 47 81 and would lose 105 games that season no pitcher on staff won more than nine games that year and team had worst fan attendance in baseball but martin felt short understood him and he was given a five year contract that not only made him field manager but gave him powers of general manager as well he would have complete authority over 25 man roster and would also be responsible for farm system martin faced a receptive clubhouse most of players had grown up watching him as a yankee on television thumb left martin in 1974 over winter of 1973 1974 martin made several trades bringing ferguson jenkins from cubs in exchange for bill jenkins and jim bibby would anchor pitching staff he promoted jim sundberg and mike hargrove to rangers from lower minor leagues

series at oakland at end of april marked by aggressive baserunning rangers were in first place martin taught rangers to improve their play and to beware his rage outfielder tom grieve later stated that he made team afraid to lose rangers stayed close to division lead through may and june though they dropped to fourth place and eight games back at all star break rangers kept race close until late september and finished second five games back their record of 84 76 a considerable improvement on 1973 martin was named al manager of year and home attendance more than doubled given their strong performance in 1974 and martin s reputation for building winners rangers were favorite in al west for 1975 over three time defending world champion a s team underperformed however jenkins going from 25 wins to 17 and other key players not doing as well as in 1974 after a slow start rangers recovered to some extent but near end of june found themselves 12 games behind a s relations between martin and ranger front office were strained by off field issues including martin s drinking and conflict with some of players including sundberg as he lost control of his team martin struck rangers traveling secretary bert hawkins allegedly for organizing a players wives club in july after a dispute with corbett over whether to sign free agent catcher tom egan martin told media that owner who had made a fortune selling plumbing pipes knows as much about baseball as i do about pipe corbett began consulting minority owners to decide whether to fire martin and informed manager of this one day later on july 20 after martin ordered public address announcer to play thank god i m a country boy during seventh inning stretch instead of take me out to ball game as corbett had instructed he was fired first stint with yankees 1975 1978 1975 and 1976 thumb upright gabe paul martin was not out of work for very long two weeks after texas fired martin manager bill was fired by yankees former yankee second baseman was hired to take his place marking martin s first time in a yankee uniform since 1957 trade some players and writers have concluded that he had long campaigned for yankee job what is beyond dispute is that after martin was dismissed by texas new york general manager gabe paul acting on behalf of owner george steinbrenner quickly got in touch with martin an agreement soon followed and martin officially returned to bronx on august 1 well aware of martin s behavioral proclivities paul and steinbrenner believed they could keep martin under control they not only wrote good conduct clauses into martin s contract but picked coaching staff themselves with little chance of catching first place red sox martin spent remainder of 1975 season evaluating his team cultivating press and getting ready for 1976 at that time paul was operating head of franchise steinbrenner had been suspended from baseball by commissioner bowie kuhn following his conviction for making illegal contributions to richard nixon s 1972 re election campaign but continued to make decisions such as martin s hiring behind scenes with martin at helm yankees went 30 26 in their final 56 games of 1975 season they ended season in third place where they had been when he took over martin worked with paul during offseason to dispose of players such as bobby bonds and doc medich obtaining in return mickey rivers willie randolph and others 1976 yankee season was probably his most trouble free as a major league manager martin endeared himself to his players quickly by effectively winning a game in milwaukee he pointed out that first base umpire had almost unnoticed called time out just before an apparent game winning grand slam by don money steinbrenner had returned to helm of yankees when kuhn shortened his suspension during spring training but did not interfere with martin s managing content to sit back and watch as yankees continued to win yankees won al east by 11 games over baltimore securing their first postseason appearance since 1964 in 1976 american league championship series they played kansas city aggressive baserunning plus bench jockeying that may have caused royals third baseman george brett to make two crucial errors helped new york win game one but kansas city won two of next three martin s choice of ed figueroa to pitch decisive game five at yankee stadium was controversial as figueroa had not pitched well late in season and had lost game two but he was in good form and helped yankees to a 6 3 lead in eighth inning when brett tied game with a three run home run martin did not let home run faze him and had a verbal exchange with next batter john mayberry which helped wake yankees up from their stunned disbelief at brett s home run yankee first baseman chris chambliss drove first pitch of bottom of ninth over right field wall garnering yankees their first pennant since 1964 and martin his first as a manager yankees faced defending world champion reds in 1976 world series and lost in four straight games martin was ejected from game four at yankee stadium after rolling a baseball towards umpire bruce froemming only yankee to ever be kicked out of a world series game 1977 championship season thumb left reggie jackson at press conference announcing his signing with yankees 1976 in offseason steinbrenner sought to sign free agent outfielder reggie jackson convinced that he would add punch to middle of yankee lineup steinbrenner wooed slugger taking him to lunch at 21 club and walking with him on manhattan s sidewalks as fans called out to jackson urging him to become a yankee though new york did not make highest offer jackson signed with team sources record martin s views on jackson s signing differently pennington stated that martin was not opposed and told steinbrenner he could use a right fielder whereas golenbock deemed martin certainly didn t want reggie feeling that jackson was too much of a prima donna who might rebel against manager s authority and be tougher to handle than a bull at a rodeo falkner wrote that while martin did not see jackson as filling team s needs he was not opposed both martin and paul stated that once bobby was signed by california angels martin supported signing jackson nevertheless martin was embittered by steinbrenner taking jackson to famous restaurants when he had not invited martin to lunch even though manager was spending offseason in nearby new jersey when yankees lost six of first eight games of 1977 season steinbrenner called separate meetings with players manager and press and told martin that he had better get team to turn things around or he could expect to be fired steinbrenner told press what he had told martin in may jackson alienated most of his teammates by saying in an interview that he rather than respected team captain thurman munson was straw that stirs drink on team martin was drinking heavily and had briefly quit in spring training following an argument with steinbrenner who was according to falkner owner whose idea of hands on was a stranglehold jackson s ties to steinbrenner who had given him his contract made martin powerless to discipline slugger golenbock noted question of whether strife between martin and jackson involved a racial element has divided yankee players and those who have written about 1977 team in his 2013 autobiography jackson stated that there was and that martin and some white yankees would tell racist jokes among black yankees who were there when martin was elliott maddox agreed with jackson but others such as chambliss denied there was racism tensions between martin and jackson exploded on national television on june 18 at fenway park nbc saturday afternoon game of week with yankees a half game behind red sox martin pulled jackson off field mid inning replacing him with paul blair for failing to hustle on a shallow outfield fly ball by jim rice allowing rice to reach second base extremely angry martin had to be restrained by coaches elston howard and yogi berra from getting into a fight with jackson in dugout scenes shown across nation by nbc steinbrenner was convinced that he should fire martin but negotiations brokered by backup catcher fran healy secured a truce nevertheless rumors that martin would be fired some originated by steinbrenner would continue season long all of this went on in full glare of new york s newspapers and with public firmly on martin s side steinbrenner stayed his hand according to appel in his history of yankees team was winning turnstiles were clicking and yanks were dominating sports pages by august 7 there was renewed conflict on team including between martin and jackson and yankees had fallen five games behind red sox martin had pledged to bat jackson cleanup as he wanted but had rarely done so healy and munson interceded with martin and when martin batted jackson fourth on august 10 both jackson and team responded by going on hot streaks despite a season of turmoil yankees won 40 of their last 50 games to take division by 2 games over both boston and baltimore appel noted 77 yanks won 100 games and division title but billy martin looked much more like a man who had taken each of 62 defeats as a sock in face hidden behind dark glasses losing weight drinking excessively he had been through hell and back yankees played royals again in 1977 american league championship series teams split first two games at yankee stadium and royals won game three in kansas city needing to win two straight on road to win pennant yankees won game four and martin benched jackson from starting lineup in game five feeling that he did not hit royals pitcher paul well in eighth inning with yankees losing 3 1 martin put jackson in as a pinch hitter and jackson singled off reliever doug bird to drive in a run yankees scored three runs in ninth to win their second straight pennant 5 3 1977 world series was against los angeles dodgers in game one in new york yankees won 4 3 in 12 innings on a single by blair who had replaced jackson late in game for defensive reasons yankees lost game two and on off day before game three at dodger stadium there was more conflict in press between martin and jackson a conference in gabe paul s hotel room smoothed matters over and yankees won games three and four but lost game five to send series back to new york prior to game six yankees announced that martin was being given a bonus and an extended contract relieving some of intense pressure on him media had reported that he would be fired if yankees lost world series jackson who had been mockingly dubbed mr october by munson during conflict before game three made name his own by hitting three home runs off three dodger pitchers on consecutive pitches and yankees won 8 4 before a jubilant crowd which invaded field after final pitch jackson and martin were interviewed for television with arms around each other noted that martin had fought other teams in league fought his star player and fought his owner who respected no man according to appel it would be only world championship of martin s managing career and it was a painful one 1978 and first departure events of 1977 placed martin among most prominent new york celebrities a status he would keep until his death as headline writers would refer to billy without fear of readers misunderstanding who was meant he was seen in city s nightlife often with different young women at a time when his second marriage was disintegrating after years of turmoil he also garnered numerous endorsement deals but cashed checks rather than pay taxes on them as a result he would be under constant scrutiny from internal revenue service for last decade of his life paul left to run indians after 1977 season and was replaced by al rosen paul s departure removed one of buffers between martin and steinbrenner martin blamed owner for constant interference during season there was no relief from conflict when 1978 season began with mickey rivers benched after appearing to loaf after a fly ball and an alcohol fueled altercation between team members on an airplane that helped put an end to yankees flying on commercial airlines in favor of charter flights steinbrenner blamed martin for failure to keep discipline martin did not believe in trying to regulate players conduct off field something he had learned from casey stengel injuries to several players including much of starting staff meant yankees did not commence season as well as previous year by mid june yankees were seven games behind red sox and steinbrenner was impatient martin was under extreme stress for much of summer amid repeated rumors that he would be fired by july 17 yankees were 13 games behind boston that day against royals jackson came to plate in bottom of tenth inning with munson on base and martin put bunt sign on after jackson fouled first pitch off sign was taken off with jackson instructed to swing away jackson tried to bunt next two pitches and popped out a furious martin wanted jackson suspended for remainder of season after game but agreed to suspend jackson for five games after consulting with upper management matters came to a head when jackson returned jackson told reporters that he did not know why martin had suspended him martin also learned from white sox owner bill veeck that steinbrenner had been trying to arrange a trade of managers with white sox while publicly insisting that martin would finish out 1978 season plan called for white sox manager bob lemon to go to yankees with martin succeeding lemon in chicago however deal was not made and lemon was subsequently fired by veeck martin told reporters of jackson and steinbrenner referring to latter s illegal contributions to nixon two of them deserve each other one s a born liar other s convicted next day july 24 1978 martin announced he was stepping aside for health reasons at a tearful press conference he did so on advice of his longtime legal adviser louisiana judge eddie sapir who concluded earlier in day that yankees would almost certainly fire him for cause by resigning for reasons of health martin obligated steinbrenner to honor his contract steinbrenner replaced martin with lemon there was considerable anger among yankee fans at martin s forced departure and towards steinbrenner some holders of season tickets burned them outside yankee stadium billy ii second stint with yankees 1979 steinbrenner almost immediately had second thoughts about martin s departure and negotiations for his return including meetings between two began within two days of resignation at first plan was for martin to return in 1979 working elsewhere in organization until then but rosen felt lemon who replaced martin needed to be given a full year talks were successfully kept quiet and at old timers day at yankee stadium july 29 1978 martin was introduced as yankee manager for 1980 and after by public address announcer bob sheppard meeting an ovation from crowd reputed to be second only to that given lou gehrig on his retirement in 1939 however believed it might have been greater saying fans liked gehrig they loved billy left thumb martin center with pitcher catfish hunter and brad gulden during a 1979 game soon after thurman munson s death re hiring was only a verbal commitment and was to some extent dependent on martin staying out of trouble which he did not do during offseason martin engaged in fisticuffs with reno gazette reporter ray hagar while visiting city as a guest of reno bighorns basketball team steinbrenner insisted that martin could only return to yankees if there was no conviction nor out of court settlement and this occurred though money likely changed hands behind scenes in interim yankees under lemon had made a dramatic comeback to win division pennant and their second consecutive world series over dodgers in 1979 yankees got off to a slow start under lemon injuries to jackson and gossage and key players proving less effective than year before had yankees reeling steinbrenner fired lemon on june 18 and brought back martin yankees failed to improve and munson s death in a private plane crash on august 1 devastated team yankees were 34 30 when martin took over and finished 89 71 in fourth place after season martin got into a fight with marshmallow salesman joseph cooper at a hotel in minneapolis cooper alleged that he said that martin should not have won his american league manager of year award which he believed should have gone to dick williams or earl weaver martin in his autobiography replied by mocking cooper s profession and in process angered him to point where cooper challenged martin to a fight martin responded by wagering 500 that he could beat cooper and proceeded to do so facing pressure from commissioner s office to do something about martin s off field conduct steinbrenner fired martin five days later oakland athletics martin did not get any immediate interest after being dismissed by yankees but in february 1980 oakland owner charlie finley sought to hire him a s had fallen far from their championship heyday of early 1970s as finley had refused to go along with escalating salaries of free agency in 1979 team had lost 108 games in hopes of reviving franchise finley turned to martin job brought martin back to his east bay roots but he also knew it might be his last chance both because of conflict that surrounded him and his lack of success with 1979 yankees 1980 a s had few standouts and many of young players were in awe of martin some who later became stars credited martin with developing them he had rickey henderson steal only on signs until henderson learned how to read pitchers in their windup then martin turned henderson loose according to pennington under billy s tutelage henderson became best leadoff hitter and base stealer in history of major league baseball many in baseball were surprised to find a s only 2 games behind heavily favored royals at end of may a s finished second in al west with an 83 79 record although they were 14 games behind royals 29 game improvement was enough to garner martin a manager of year award attendance at oakland alameda county coliseum rose by 500 000 enabling finley to sell team at a better price new owners haas family owners of levi strauss were inexperienced in baseball they gave martin additional title of player development director with complete control of baseball side of operation effectively making him both general manager and field manager martin brought his aggressive style of play which was dubbed billyball by a sportswriter early in 1981 season name stuck a s later trademarked it a s began season going 18 3 and martin appeared on cover of time magazine five man rotation of mike norris rick langford matt keough steve and brian kingman had a cumulative era of 1 42 they also threw 94 complete games far and away most in american league in part because martin did not trust his untested bullpen he was applauded by baseball fans across country even when he was kicked out of a game and suspended by league for a week for kicking dirt on umpire oakland momentum was finally checked by 1981 major league baseball strike which shut down baseball for nearly two months midseason season was split into two halves division leaders at time of strike in al west a s to play second half winners royals in a special division series a s won in three straight games to face yankees in 1981 american league championship series opportunity to beat yankees meant much to martin and steinbrenner seeing oakland success was privately stating that he might have been too quick to fire martin after marshmallow salesman incident but veteran new york lineup and pitching staff was able to dominate a s as yankees won first three games to take series with best combined record in american league in 1981 expectations were high for a s following year however 1982 season did not go well for a s who never got much over 500 by all star break they were 28 50 long out of pennant race none of starting pitchers would match their 1981 form nor ever would again leading to accusations from baseball historians and statisticians that martin abbreviated their careers by overusing them in 1981 in 2006 rob neyer estimated that four top starters from 1981 team threw anywhere from 120 140 pitches per complete game a heavy workload for pitchers as young as a s rotation had been in 1981 a s went 68 94 and finished fifth easily worst full season record of martin s managerial career on october 20 1982 three weeks after season ended a s fired him with three years remaining on his contract although did not hold martin responsible for on field debacle they had grown increasingly concerned about his off field behavior and feared he was growing unstable incidents included considerable drinking and traveling with a mistress while on road last straw came when martin trashed his own office after team officials refused him a loan to pay a tax debt there has been speculation that martin had been assured by steinbrenner that he would be yankee manager in 1983 if he could get himself fired by oakland and he may have been acting to that end remaining stints with yankees right upright thumb martin as yankees manager in 1983 yankees had finished fifth in 1982 their first losing record in steinbrenner era doing so under three managers lemon gene michael and clyde king all fired by steinbrenner on january 11 1983 yankees announced that martin had been hired as manager under a long term contract he would remain on yankees payroll for rest of his life jackson had departed for california angels but other yankees from martin s earlier tenures remained such as randolph and ron guidry and team had added strong players like dave winfield and don baylor steinbrenner had pledged non interference but as team struggled early in season resumed his second guessing of martin both directly and by leak to media as relations between owner and manager deteriorated martin had conflicts with reporters and a brawl with a patron in an anaheim bar during 1983 season martin was involved in one of most controversial regular season games known as pine tar incident when martin challenged a home run by george brett on ground that amount of pine tar on bat broke rules brett was ruled out and home run disallowed as this occurred with two out in top of ninth it ended game with yankees leading 4 3 american league president lee macphail ruled in favor of royals protest game was resumed some weeks later with kansas city leading 5 4 and two out in top half of ninth at start of resumed game martin tried to protest on grounds that brett had missed a base umpires had anticipated this and had obtained an affidavit from crew who had worked original game saying that brett had indeed touched all bases yankees did not play as well during and after distraction of pine tar game and fell further behind division leading orioles yankees finished second 91 71 seven games behind orioles on december 16 steinbrenner removed martin as manager giving him a scouting assignment and replacing him with berra yankees finished third under berra 17 games behind tigers when at start of 1985 season steinbrenner pledged that berra would remain manager for whole season there was immediate speculation that martin would return at earliest opportunity as it turned out steinbrenner fired berra after 16 games and replaced him with martin stated martin george and i have greatest relationship i ve ever had with him with an mvp season from don mattingly and a strong effort from rickey henderson who had been acquired by yankees team played well throughout summer coming to within a game and a half of division leading toronto blue jays on september 12 they then lost eight in a row and as yankees fell out of race according to pennington martin seemed to melt down with it on september 22 1985 while at a hotel bar in baltimore martin fought one of his pitchers ed whitson who was larger heavier and trained in martial arts martin suffered a broken arm yankees recovered to win 97 games but finished two games back of blue jays eliminated on second to last day of season on october 27 1985 martin was fired again as yankee manager replaced by longtime yankee player lou piniella nevertheless steinbrenner believing that martin could again bring a championship to yankees and fearing he might do so elsewhere increased martin s salary four time manager of yankees turned down lucrative offers from white sox and indians steinbrenner kept martin as a close advisor in 1986 he was formally part of broadcasting staff under his personal services contract which owner extended so that martin was now earning over 300 000 per year a sum he was unlikely to match as manager elsewhere steinbrenner had considerable affection for martin and wanted him to be without financial worries martin had long wanted to see his number 1 retired by yankees seeking to keep his past and future manager happy steinbrenner agreed and billy martin day took place at yankee stadium on august 10 1986 at ceremony during which number was retired and martin given a plaque in monument park he stated i may not have been greatest yankee to ever put on uniform but i was proudest new york finished second behind red sox in 1986 but were never really in contention and finished fourth in 1987 after season pinella was asked to accept a promotion to general manager so that steinbrenner could make martin manager for a fifth time in 1988 despite minimal expectations martin got 1988 yankees off to a good start however on night of may 7 martin was involved in a brawl at a dallas area nightclub in which he came out worst already foreseeing end and with marital troubles on may 30 martin was kicked out of a game against a s flinging dirt on umpire dale scott martin was suspended for three games and fined by league however umpires union thought this was too lenient seven american league crew chiefs announced that martin would be ejected as soon as he left yankee dugout a month later steinbrenner fired martin citing a combination of factors in explaining his decision pennington suggested that while many yankee fans took to talk radio in anger at martin s firing there was less outrage than there had been in 1970s and greater concern for martin as a person he became a special adviser to steinbrenner though in practice he had no duties and rarely visited new york pinella returned as manager but was fired at end of 1988 season after yankees played sub 500 ball during his second stint steinbrenner replaced him with dallas green yankees saw little success under green in 1989 and he was fired in august replaced by bucky dent steinbrenner was unconvinced that dent could lead yankees back to a championship and planned to keep martin close at hand as manager in waiting should dent falter in 1990 he apparently told martin of this during a november meeting at yankee stadium soon afterward martin got in touch with several of his former coaches and told them to be ready to join him for a sixth managerial tenure with yankees death thumb billy martin s grave in gate of heaven cemetery martin was still a special consultant to steinbrenner when he was killed in a low speed single vehicle accident on christmas day 1989 his vehicle ran into a drainage culvert near entrance of driveway to his farm in port crane north of binghamton new york he was pronounced dead at a hospital in johnson city new york also present in vehicle that night was martin s friend bill reedy who had been drinking with martin at a local bar and who was seriously injured in accident reedy at first stated that he had driven vehicle with martin passenger but after learning that martin had died changed his story saying that he had lied to protect martin against consequences of a drunk driving conviction he was convicted in a jury trial of driving with a blood alcohol level of 10 was fined and his license suspended a subsequent civil trial also found he was driver golenbock who wrote his book after criminal trial but before civil was convinced that martin was driver in this he joined martin s children and some of his close friends like mickey mantle who believed martin would not have allowed another to drive him that night martin s biographers point to inadequacies in police investigation pennington noted that those who believe martin was driver are minority reedy was seen holding car keys as two left bar and positions of men when rescuers arrived pointed to reedy being driver no autopsy was performed allegedly due to opposition by martin s widow and by steinbrenner new york city medical examiner michael baden was allowed to examine body martin was eulogized by cardinal john o connor at st patrick s cathedral new york before his interment at gate of heaven cemetery in hawthorne new york his grave is located about from babe ruth s in section 25 following epitaph spoken by martin at his number retiring ceremony at yankee stadium in 1986 appears on headstone i may not have been greatest yankee to put on uniform but i was proudest steinbrenner and former

york yankees 1988 1988 total reference managerial techniques bill james noted that billy martin of course improved every team he ever managed in his first year in control usually by huge margins within a year or two all of those teams were ready to get rid of him according to chris jaffe in his book evaluating baseball managers martin was perfect manager to hire if you wanted an immediate improvement and worst manager for a team seeking sustained success part of this jaffe argued was because martin would do whatever it took to win that day and not worry about any negative side effects in future even if it meant a shortened career for his players subsequent ineffectiveness of young starting pitchers on 1981 a s is cited by jaffe as one example of this others include pitcher catfish hunter who completed every game he started but one during martin s partial season with 1975 yankees and who was never same pitcher after that year and ferguson jenkins with texas in 1974 who pitched 29 complete games for rangers and who declined thereafter a similar attitude permeated his use of relief pitchers he wanted who he wanted when he wanted without concern towards keeping their arms well rested in 1988 elias sports bureau proclaimed martin best manager in major league history based on modeling that found that martin s teams won 7 45 more games per year than they should have as predicted by statistics higher than any other manager martin sought to catch other team by surprise using such techniques as stealing home once having two twins steal home on different pitches of same at bat with slugger harmon killebrew at plate stealing home is a tactic unlikely to succeed yet martin made it work and his teams got better jaffe noted that with minnesota in 1969 martin ended such risky tactics well before end of season by which time he had set tone he wanted both with his team and with opponents according to jimmy keenan and frank russo in their biography of martin for society for american baseball research sabr he played game hard and made no excuses for way he handled himself on or off field many people including his off and on boss george steinbrenner considered martin a baseball genius for intuitive way he managed his teams hall of fame manager tony la russa stated of him without reservation i would call billy most brilliant field manager i ever saw he was unmatched none of us felt up to him stengel stated in an interview a month before his death in 1975 he s a good manager he might be a little selfish about some things he does and he may think he knows more about baseball than anybody else and it wouldn t surprise me if he was right when asked why he had admired martin as a player stengel replied if liking a kid who never let you down in clutch is favoritism then i plead guilty james deemed martin third most successful manager of 1970s behind sparky anderson and earl weaver and most controversial pennington also noted that those who fired martin for his off field behavior went out of their way to praise what he had done on field campbell for instance said that from foul line to foul line billy did a good job while a s told sapir that we won t find a better manager than martin falkner noted that what martin wanted was to win period and quoted him as saying i would play hitler mussolini and tojo on my team if i thought it would help me win willie randolph stated you always knew if you got to eighth or ninth inning and you were tied or one run down billy would find a way to win falkner noted he wanted to win that was all and for time he was in game everyone knew it and he won jaffe suggested that person martin was most akin to was not any other baseball manager but hernando cortez conquistador who burned his own ships after arriving in mexico forcing his soldiers to conquer or die that was billyball sixteenth century style pennington believed that martin was very much a person of his times in age of several round clock espn channels ceaseless chatter of sports talk radio and omnipresent smartphone cameras billy could not exist at least not as an employed baseball manager pennington suggested though that had martin been born 20 years later his friends would have confronted him about his drinking problem in martin s day such things were more often ignored pennington believes martin s reputation for brawling and drinking has kept him out of hall of fame even if other managers who are in hall such as weaver and leo durocher got into fights and drank sometimes to excess they did not acquire same reputation for those things as did martin golenbock suggested that martin s alcoholism together with his pride in being a yankee kept him in a relationship with steinbrenner that kept him willing to try to manage team again and again despite difficult relationship with owner personal life and public image martin was married four times and had two children a daughter named kelly ann and a son named billy joe his first marriage was to lois berndt they had a daughter she divorced him in 1955 after he had contested action for more than a year on grounds that he was catholic he married gretchen winkler in 1961 they had a son and stayed married until 1979 when two divorced he was married a third time to heather while he was managing in oakland but was never faithful to her and eventually married his
