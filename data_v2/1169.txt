then lost andersen after season when he was declared a new look free agent due to third collusion settlement according to red sox then general manager lou gorman trade made sense at time and he spent ensuing years defending decision making process in his 2005 autobiography one pitch from glory gorman noted that boston already had wade boggs at major league level at third base and had rated prospects tim naehring and scott cooper higher than bagwell on organization s depth chart while he had seen some time in minors at first base he was blocked from that position by mo vaughn gordon pursued andersen only after receiving assurances from mlb s player relations committee that andersen would not be lost to new look free agency however red sox returns paled in comparison to bagwell s achievements not only did they lose anderson to free agency after one month but naehring and cooper were both out of baseball by 1997 disproportionate results of trade notwithstanding bagwell

postseason six times with an exaggerated and unusual batting style bagwell waited for each pitch in a low crouch with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees appearing as if he was sitting on an invisible bench he stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing next he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with bat forward into his powerful uppercut swing that wide stance keeps him from over striding joe torre observed which can be your biggest problem when you re trying to hit for power low crouch also shrunk his strike zone allowing him to walk more often standing 6 feet tall and weighing he did not present image of an imposing home run hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career rookie of year award and early career 1991 93 astros invited bagwell to major league camp in spring training of 1991 bagwell expecting for club to assign him to their aaa affiliate tucson enthused them with his play because they too already had an established major leaguer at third base in ken caminiti they approached bagwell about shifting to first base which he accepted having not previously played position as a regular bagwell received a crash course playing minor league games in morning and astros games in afternoon until opening day observed sporting news rookie jeff bagwell never played first base

extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie while ranking tenth in league in walks with 75 his obp placed fifth at 387 of power surge commented bagwell to hitting coach rudy jaramillo that s awesome to which he reacted awesome we can get more out of you than that by altering an approach to contact pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to houston jaramillo taught bagwell to hit with backspin resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving he also habituated bagwell to manipulate count waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike accounted bagwell of newfound advantage i didn t hit many home runs in minor leagues but when i hit one when i got backspin on it it went a long way although firmly established as astros first baseman from opening day in 1991 bagwell remarked years later that transitioning from third base was not automatic first basemen approach fielding plays from their right side which is opposite to playing third base he recounted one conversation that occurred during an astros pitching change in a game against st louis shortstop ozzie smith was on first and asked bagwell how s it going bagwell responded i m really struggling with my backhand smith replied well here s what you do you can t field ball deep you have to get out in front of it remarked bagwell i was basically being given a lesson from ozzie smith at first base during a pitching change it s pretty cool next year bagwell hit 273 driving in 96 runs with 18 home runs in 1993 astros improved to a third place finish
