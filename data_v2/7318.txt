scotland was divided into a series of kingdoms in early middle ages i e between end of roman authority in southern and central britain from around 400 ce and rise of kingdom of alba in 900 ce of these four most important to emerge were picts scots of dal riata britons of alt clut and anglian kingdom of bernicia after arrival of vikings in late 8th century scandinavian rulers and colonies were established on islands and along parts of coasts in 9th century house of alpin combined lands of scots and picts to form a single kingdom which constituted basis of kingdom of scotland scotland has an extensive coastline and vast areas of difficult terrain and poor agricultural land in this period more land became marginal due to climate change resulting in relatively light human settlement particularly in interior and highlands northern britain lacked urban centres and settlements were based on farmsteads and around fortified positions such as brochs with mixed farming primarily based on self sufficiency in this period changes in settlement and colonisation meant that pictish and brythonic languages began to be subsumed by gaelic english and at end of period by old norse life expectancy was relatively low leading to a young population with a ruling aristocracy freemen and relatively large numbers of slaves kingship was multi layered with different kings surrounded by their war bands that made up most important elements of armed forces and who engaged in both low level raiding and occasional longer range major campaigns expansion of christianity from margins of scotland was key to development of this period as it became religion of many inhabitants initially influenced by celtic tradition originating from what is now ireland by end of era it had become integrated into organisational structures of catholic church this period produced some highly distinctive monumental and ornamental art culminating in development of insular art style common across britain and
