third test of 1948 ashes series was one of five tests in a cricket series between teams representing australia and england match was played at old trafford in manchester from 8 13 july with a rest day on 11 july match was drawn after whole of fourth day and first half of fifth day was washed out due to rain england had upper hand before weather intervened draw maintained australia s 2 0 lead in series which was established through victories in first two tests as australia were holders of ashes draw meant that england could do no better than level series 2 2 by winning last two tests and thus australia retained ashes test started amid controversy following omission of leading england batsman len hutton for performing poorly in previous match having largely failed apart from brief periods to challenge australia in first two tests hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten visitors supremacy australia made their first change for series ending test career of veteran batsman bill brown after two poor matches england captain norman yardley won toss and elected to bat but his team were quickly in trouble with denis compton forced from field after being bloodied in head by a ray lindwall bouncer at this stage hosts were at 33 2 with an injured player and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup having received treatment compton returned with england in difficulty at 119 5 midway through day and proceeded to score 145 not out aided by several dropped catches helping england to recover to 363 all out on second afternoon england could have been in an even stronger position but compton and seamer alec bedser were involved in a mix up resulting in latter being run out and ending a 121 run partnership lindwall was most successful bowler taking 4 99 during england innings australian opener sid barnes who had gained much attention throughout season for fielding at point blank range in front of batsman on strike was hit in ribs by a dick pollard pull shot and had to be carried from ground and hospitalised in reply australia batted steadily to be 126 3 by end of second day but then fell to be 172 6 effectively seven wickets down with barnes unable to bat after collapsing again before evading follow on by reaching 221 australia scored slowly through innings finding hosts bowlers difficult to negotiate bedser took 4 81 and pollard 3 53 england began their second innings and were strongly placed on 174 3 at end of third day an overall lead of 316 with seven wickets in hand they had been aided by several dropped chances against cyril washbrook who reached 85 by close of play however rain meant that no play was possible on fourth day and england did not have opportunity to capitalise on their favourable position and set australia a high runchase yardley declared on final morning but play did not start until mid afternoon due to continuing inclement weather australian batsman thereafter played for a draw they batted slowly and reached 92 1 when stumps were drawn not making an attempt to chase 317 for victory arthur morris made 54 not out his second half century of match to go with his 51 in first innings registering australia s top score on both occasions despite fact that 30 of playing time was lost to rain match still managed to set a record for highest attendance at a test match in england surpassing mark set in previous test background led by donald bradman australia had proceeded through first two months of their 1948 england tour undefeated after winning 10 of 12 games before tests eight of these by an innings they won first test by eight wickets before second test they defeated northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with yorkshire bradman s men then crushed england by 409 runs in second test at lord s between tests they defeated surrey by ten wickets and crushed gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs having amassed 774 7 declared their highest score of season and second highest ever by an australian team in england when teams reconvened at old trafford for third test leading english batsman len hutton had been dropped reason was said to be hutton s struggles with lindwall s short pitched bowling in previous test during which he scored 20 and 13 perry 2001 p 224 observers noticed hutton backing away from fast bowlers english selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on rest of side which was not in good batting form as it was a poor example from a key player bowes p 190 according to journalist and retired australian test leg spinner bill o reilly hutton s second innings at lord s had been worst of his career and gave impression he had been scared of australian pace attack o reilly p 83 omission generated considerable controversy and pleased australians who felt hutton was england s best batsman and thought he had been treated poorly by selectors former australian batsman jack fingleton pointed out that while hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in previous test fingleton pp 128 130 he also had a strong track record against tourists having made 52 and 64 for marylebone cricket club against australia in lead up matches and 94 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three test innings during previous ashes series of 1946 47 fingleton p 126 o reilly regarded hutton s omission as punitive and vindictive he said if hutton needed to be shielded from new ball attack then england should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down order o reilly said that as hutton had a large range of attacking strokes he was not a stereotypical defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down opening bowlers and could be used in middle order as an aggressor o reilly p 84 hutton s opening position was taken by debutant george emmett who made 43 and nine for gloucestershire in australia s preceding tour match in that match two of australia s leading pacemen keith miller and bill johnston did not bowl despite scoring 76 and 92 in preceding match against warwickshire emmett was not having a prolific season he ended summer with an average of 36 11 england made three further changes spinner jack young and paceman dick pollard replaced spin pair of doug wright and jim laker in bowling department meaning england would only play one slow bowler wright and laker had struggled to penetrate australian batting lineup in second test taking match figures of 2 123 and 2 128 respectively in contrast pollard had taken match figures of 4 85 for lancashire in a match against australia earlier in season and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in past fortnight selection was seen as being influenced by fact test was being staged at lancashire s home ground where pollard was familiar with conditions and australians had a high regard for him o reilly p 86 in month since being dropped for second test in favour of wright after taking 1 107 in first test young had returned to play for middlesex taking 27 wickets in five matches alec coxon yorkshire allrounder who made his test debut in previous match at lord s and opened bowling taking match figures of 3 172 and scoring 19 and a duck was replaced by jack crapp a debutant batsman crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for gloucestershire in preceding match against tourists it was only third century scored against australia during tour fingleton p 199 and was part of a season in which crapp had made four centuries and six half centuries in 16 matches thus far coxon s omission was believed to have been caused more by off field events than sporting merit there was a story that he punched denis compton whom he disliked and considered self important in dressing room but coxon always denied this however there was certainly an altercation and coxon was never selected again o reilly interpreted omission of yorkshiremen hutton and coxon at expense of gloucestershire pair of crapp and emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in english selection panel he pointed out that only one of four selectors england captain norman yardley who was also from yorkshire was from north of country o reilly pp 85 86 australia dropped bill brown who had scored 73 runs at a batting average of 24 33 in three test innings during season brown was australia s reserve opener but bradman opted to play him out of position in middle order instead of using a specialist brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in matches against worcestershire and marylebone cricket club scoring 25 and 26 according to o reilly brown had appeared out of place in middle order because he was used to opener s classical role of defending against and wearing down opening bowlers rather than attacking he was replaced by all rounder sam loxton who had hammered an unbeaten 159 including several sixes against gloucestershire fingleton pp 197 198 and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork which he used to charge and attack off spin of tom goddard fingleton pp 198 199 scorecard umpires f chester d davies toss elected to bat first result

a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days outfield was also smooth and green a contrast to its state during world war ii when it was left cratered by german bombing raids fingleton p 130 yardley won toss and elected to bat change in england s opening pair did not result in an improvement on scoreboard a run out was narrowly avoided following a mix up on first ball and cyril washbrook and emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to bowlers australians themselves started with ray lindwall and bill johnston taking new ball but bradman had misjudged breeze and had to swap his bowlers ends for this purpose loxton bowled a solitary over he was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at debutant emmett who ignored opportunity to attack and let balls pass o reilly p 87 at other end washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots apart from a missed cut against johnston s bowling overall however english openers appeared comfortable in first half hour of play arlott p 80 with 22 runs on board after half an hour of play fingleton p 131 washbrook played around a yorker from johnston and was bowled much to disappointment of his lancashire home crowd johnston had been bowling from over wicket and his left arm deliveries had generally been swinging back into right handed washbrook however opening batsman did not detect johnston s variation ball which was released from wide of crease and angled across more sharply without curling back in washbrook played inside line of ball which hit his stumps australia nearly had two wickets in same over as new batsman bill edrich struggled he played loosely outside off stump to first ball but did not get an edge and on third delivery he faced from johnston edrich survived again receiving a ball on middle and leg stump he tried to defend it straight back down pitch rather than conventional stroke to leg side and managed to edge ball past slips for four o reilly p 88 six runs after fall of washbrook diminutive emmett fended a rising ball from lindwall to sid barnes at short leg leaving england 28 2 surprised by lindwall s bouncer emmett took his eyes from ball and fended with one hand on horizontally held bat while ducking his head down below his arms ball bounced slowly off pitch and after hitting emmett s bat rebounded gently up in air for barnes to collect in australia s match against gloucestershire immediately preceding test lindwall bowled a bouncer to emmett who hesitantly parried it away for a single lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to emmett during match and o reilly thought paceman was quietly waiting until tests to expose his opponent s weakness against short ball o reilly concluded that australia s pace duo had again disposed of english opening batsmen with minimum amount of effort o reilly p 89 edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and denis compton attempted to establish themselves he was hurried by pace of lindwall and johnston making many last moment movements to either hit ball or withdraw from a shot lindwall bowled a series of short balls one hit compton on arm and batsman attempted to hook another bouncer but edged it into his face upon hearing umpire s call of no ball while ball was travelling towards him and knowing he was immune from dismissal compton decided to change his stroke having initially positioned himself to deflect ball into leg side he then attempted to hook ball but could not readjust quickly enough velocity of ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to boundary before landing this forced compton to leave field with a bloodied eyebrow with score at 33 2 pollard 1990 p 12 after a ten minute delay crapp strode to centre for his debut innings and he got off mark from his first ball gliding lindwall past gully for a single lindwall then struck edrich on hand with another short ball provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to harold larwood a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with bodyline a strategy of intimidatory bowling fingleton p 132 edrich and crapp then engaged in grim defensive play resulting in one 25 minute period during which only one run was added as england reached lunch with their total on 57 2 edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting while crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes one of motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by time compton recovered from his concussion so he could resume batting o reilly p 90 edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent whereas crapp was usually circumspect for a series of accurate overs from ernie toshack crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to arthur morris at silly point toshack s first five overs were all maidens arlott p 82 upon resumption crapp began to accelerate hitting a six which flew directly back over bowler s head and over sightscreen and three driven boundaries from off spin of ian johnson this was a stark contrast to johnson s first ten overs before lunch which had yielded only seven runs crapp was eager to use his feet to get to pitch of johnson s deliveries and subsequently dealt with spin fairly comfortably whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult o reilly pp 90 91 he then hit toshack to barnes at short leg but catch was dropped however crapp did not capitalise as toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs arlott p 83 australia took new ball with score at 87 and lindwall trapped crapp who did not offer a shot leg before wicket for 37 batsman misjudged line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump tom dollery came in and took a single to get off mark but then missed a johnston yorker and was bowled this dismissal mirrored that of washbrook s in that dollery failed to detect johnston s variation ball and thus played for swing when there was none england had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 4 captain norman yardley came in and played fast bowling of lindwall and johnston with relative ease retreating onto back foot to allow himself more time to play his shots edrich was struck on hand and yardley edged to keith miller in slips cordon on half volley fingleton p 133 after 170 minutes of slow batting edrich gloved a rising lindwall delivery and was caught behind by wicket keeper don tallon at 119 5 compton returned to field his head wound having been stitched to stop bleeding he and yardley played carefully until tea break and only england captain offered a chance barnes was unable to complete reflex catch at short leg from bowling of toshack after resumption of play yardley on drove lindwall for a four but lofted ernie toshack who had been bowling leg theory into packed on side where he was caught by johnson at forward square leg toshack s defensive bowling had caused english skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left score on 141 6 o reilly p 92 this brought wicket keeper godfrey evans to crease and exposed hosts lower order last of specialist batsmen compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg side delivery from johnson s off spin he overbalanced and stumbled forwards and tallon removed bails there were no television replays to assist umpires in those days and although attempted stumping appeared close to naked eye benefit of doubt was given to batsman and appeal rejected o reilly p 93 compton made use of this and attacked toshack successfully forcing bradman to make a bowling change in fading light compton combined with gloveman to add 75 runs for seventh wicket in 70 minutes before lindwall removed evans who attempted a wild slash to leave england 216 7 compton reached stumps on 64 accompanied by alec bedser who was on four as england ended day at 231 7 compton had been dropped one handed on 50 by tallon before being missed on 64 by wicket keeper from bowling of johnston just before stumps fingleton pp 133 134 9 july day two england resumed on second day at 231 7 amid dark skies and threat of rain australia was unable to break through despite taking new ball bedser stubbornly defied australians playing with a straight bat and stretching forward onto front foot to block ball fingleton p 134 tallon dropped compton for third time off bowling of johnston when batsman was on 73 lindwall bowled well below his top pace in morning session and batsmen slowly accumulated their runs bedser was more defensive of two englishmen and compton drove toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of series after 235 minutes of batting lindwall then beat compton in each of his last three overs before lunch but englishman survived england reached lunch at 323 7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket compton was on 123 and bedser on 37 having brought up their century partnership fingleton p 135 five minutes were lost in morning session when a stray dog invaded playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of australian fielders who attempted to catch it immediately subsequent to resumption compton took two boundaries from lindwall s first over and another from johnston s subsequent over he then hit a ball into covers and bradman and loxton collided in an attempt to prevent a run compton called bedser through for a run on but loxton recovered and threw ball to wicket keeper s end with bedser a long way short of crease fingleton p 136 it ended an innings of 145 minutes in which bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121 run partnership with compton according to o reilly it was only mistake compton made in his innings o reilly pp 92 93 stand fell five runs short of england s highest test partnership for eighth wicket against australia a mark set by patsy hendren and harold larwood arlott p 86 pollard came to crease and soon pulled a ball from johnson into ribs of barnes who was standing at short leg barnes stood closer than virtually all in that position with one foot on edge of cut strip and he was unable to evade ball barnes dropped like a fallen tree and had to be carried from ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination throughout season barnes had received a mixed reception for his tactics it was agreed they had a negative effect on batsman and there was a debate as to whether it was in spirit of rules fingleton pp 73 74 compton hit two fours and bradman responded by putting all of his men on boundary to offer compton a single so pollard would be on strike and could be attacked australia skipper then brought his men in close during latter part of over to prevent compton from taking a single and regaining strike for following over arlott p 87 compton was unable to farm strike as he desired o reilly p 97 toshack then bowled pollard and bradman caught young from johnston s bowling as england were dismissed for 363 compton was unbeaten on 145 after 324 minutes of batting having struck 16 fours lindwall took 4 99 and johnston 3 67 miller did not bowl so four remaining frontline bowlers sent down no less than 38 overs each thumb barnes pictured here in a photo at age of 16 was taken to hospital after being hit in ribs alt a teenage boy leans over his bat in front of stumps in readiness to face a ball he is wearing a white shirt trousers and a cap australia came out to bat halfway through middle session having dropped brown barnes s injury left australia with only arthur morris as a specialist opener johnson was thus deployed as australia s makeshift second opener he had never opened at test level but had once batted at no 3 when used as a nightwatchman after fall of first wicket late on a day s play he was unable to make an impact bedser removed him for one caught by evans at chest height off inside edge from a ball that reared from pitch fingleton p 137 it was a difficult catch as evans was standing up to stumps and he had little time to react to ball s change of direction o reilly criticised use of johnson as an opener as vice captain lindsay hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach johnson s dismissal brought bradman in to face new ball australian captain thus had to face bedser who had already dismissed him three times in tests with a new ball and pollard who had troubled him in match against lancashire pollard then trapped bradman lbw with an off cutter that struck australian captain on back foot for seven to leave australia in trouble at 13 2 this provoked a strong cheer from crowd in support of pollard lancashire local australia were pinned down as pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run aiming for leg stump to stifle scoring fingleton p 138 he was partnered by bedser who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes morris and vice captain lindsay hassett rebuilt innings adding 69 for third wicket in 101 minutes they played without trying to take risks hassett fell after being beaten in flight by young aiming to break young s restrictive leg side bowling hassett charged down pitch and lofted a drive for four however in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover he mishit ball which was caught by washbrook at wide mid off fingleton p 139 o reilly p 98 miller joined morris and they took score to 126 3 at stumps with their personal tallies on 23 and 48 respectively run rate picked up in last 50 minutes of day as pair added 44 runs miller was more attacking of australian duo during this time arlott p 88 10 july day three on third morning players were greeted by sunshine and a large saturday crowd had arrived from afar to watch proceedings as a result gates were closed by 9 00 in morning with ground already filled large gallery again encroached on playing arena which was not fenced in first hour australia struggled against new ball miller was beaten three times in one over by bedser before pollard trapped him for 31 after australia had added only nine runs in first hour four runs later bedser removed morris for 51 leaving australia 139 5 it had been a slow morning for morris who took 21 minutes to add to his overnight total and reached his half century 45 minutes into day s play having added only four runs to his overnight score fingleton p 140 at same time barnes had come out to bat upon miller s dismissal despite having collapsed while practising in nets due to aftereffects of his rib injury he batted after refusing to stay in hospital and returning to ground in spite of his bruised and discoloured ribs he made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before injury became too much and he had to be taken from ground with assistance of bradman among others before being sent to hospital to be put under observation barnes would eventually miss two and a half weeks of cricket tallon and loxton added a further 33 before former was caught behind from edrich with score at 172 6 lindwall came into bat with australia facing prospect of follow on he received five consecutive bouncers from edrich one of which hit him in hand and caused visible pain evoking cheers from home crowd loxton and lindwall added a further 36 before former was bowled by pollard leaving australia 208 7 still five runs behind follow on mark johnston helped lindwall advance australia beyond follow on before bedser removed both johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from pollard in direction of edrich at first slip but evans dived across trying to catch ball in his right hand wicket keeper could not hold on to ball at full stretch and resulting deflection further to right wrong footed edrich who was moving other way and it went past him from second slip crapp dived left behind edrich but ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers however in next over bedser johnston edged ball in same manner and crapp caught ball easily arlott p 91 lindwall was last man out for 23 while toshack was unbeaten without scoring australia were thus bowled out for 221 giving england a lead of 142 runs bedser and pollard were most successful bowlers taking 4 81 and 3 53 respectively at start of england s second innings washbrook took a single from lindwall who then removed emmett for a duck paceman pitched an outswinger on off stump and emmett edged it to wicket keeper tallon who took it in his right hand while taking a dive fingleton p 141 emmett s departure brought lindwall s tormentor edrich to crease bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at edrich fearing such actions would be interpreted as retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction after not bowling in first innings miller came on and immediately broke through washbrook s defences only to see ball graze stumps without dislodging bails washbrook then drove lindwall for four before miller bounced him in next over after two miller outswingers had evaded outside edge of washbrook batsman appeared unsettled one bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four and another flew in air narrowly evading loxton at fine leg o reilly p 99 lindwall followed miller s lead towards washbrook and was no balled by umpire davies for dragging his foot beyond line following a disagreement davies threw lindwall his jumper but matter faded away and bowler was not no balled again after discussing matter with bradman fingleton pp 141 142 lindwall then bounced washbrook again and this time england opener went for hook shot ball flew high in air straight towards hassett at fine leg who dropped catch on his third juggled attempt having received a life on 21 washbrook settled down as loxton replaced lindwall while johnson replaced miller washbrook scored on both sides of wicket and reached 50 in only 70 minutes as england proceeded to 80 1 fingleton p 142 lindwall returned for a new spell and almost hit washbrook in head after tea edrich hit miller for four although lindwall did not retaliate for bouncers he received in first innings miller did so with four consecutive short balls earning ire of crowd perry 2005 p 243 miller struck edrich on body before bradman intervened ordered him to stop perry 2005 p 244 and apologised to edrich fingleton p 143 edrich and washbrook settled and put together a 124 run partnership in only 138 minutes england s largest of series to that point edrich hit a four to long on followed by a lofted off drive for six from bowling of toshack generating momentum in their favour however washbrook called edrich through for a quick single soon after batsmen hesitated and after both englishmen had paused in middle of their run o reilly p 100 morris threw down edrich s stumps from cover ending partnership at 125 2 edrich had struck eight boundaries and a six in his 53 right 130px thumb hassett pictured left in late 1930s dropped washbrook twice on third afternoon alt two men in cricket uniforms walk along a paved path wearing white shirts trousers and shoes man on left has his sleeves rolled up while his taller colleague is wearing a woolly sweater both have dark hair manicured grass is to their left and a pavilion is behind them toshack then removed compton for a duck caught in slips by miller leaving england three wickets down with score still on 125 crapp joined washbrook and helped see off new ball stopping australia s fightback as england reached 174 by close without further loss washbrook was unbeaten on 85 and crapp 19 england were 316 runs in front with two days of play remaining and seven wickets in hand their position was aided by australian fielders who dropped washbrook twice more lancastrian was on 78 when he again hooked lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by hassett australian vice captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from ball much to amusement of crowd after adding two more runs washbrook was dropped in slips cordon by johnson from bowling of toshack fingleton p 144 at end of day s play washbrook purchased a drink for hassett in gratitude for dropped catches 13 july day five rest day was followed by fourth day which was abandoned due to persistent rain despite this 21 000 spectators came in anticipation of weather clearing so that some play would be possible however a northeasterly depression from faroe islands brought ongoing precipitation and prevented any play yardley declared at start of fifth day after a pitch inspection leaving australia a victory target of 317 but rain kept falling and entire first session was abandoned umpires had decided to start play half an hour later than normal but this was not possible and they helped ground staff to clean up wet surface bradman chose to use light roller and play was supposed to begin as soon as lunch break ended fingleton p 145 further delay meant play began after tea break and pitch played very slowly because of excess moisture which also caused there to be little bounce in surface with australia not looking to chase runs because time available was not reasonable yardley often had seven men in close catching positions fingleton p 146 in first half hour australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs young replaced pollard and johnson immediately swept him for four before edging next ball to crapp who completed catch johnson fell for six to leave australia at 10 1 bradman came in and played his first 11 balls from young without scoring while morris hit two streaky shots for four from bedser yardley used spin of young and compton for an hour while morris and bradman made little effort to score for 105 minutes morris stayed at one end and bradman at other neither looked to rotate strike with singles bradman only played eight balls from morris s main end and at one point was so startled by his partner s desire for a single that he sent him back tourists thereafter batted in an unhurried and defensive manner to ensure a draw which was sealed by a series of periodic rain interruptions they ended on 92 1 from 61 overs a run rate of 1 50 with 35 maidens it was slowest innings run rate to date in series morris finished unbeaten on 54 his fourth consecutive half century of series o reilly criticised approach taken by australians in closing stages of match attributing it to bradman s orders he said pitch was made so tame by heavy rain that they could have played in a natural and attractive manner to entertain spectators rather than defending carefully he said bradman s unwillingness to take a risk or to accept challenging call of some particular phase of game is one of greatest flaws in his leadership o reilly pp 102 103 attendance of 133 740 exceeded previous record for a test in england which was set in preceding match at lord s even though more than 30 of playing time had been lost aftermath after being aided by rain while in a disadvantageous position during third test australians had only one tour match a victory over middlesex to prepare for next test at headingley barnes was unable to recover from his injury in this short space of time and was replaced by neil harvey perry 2002 p 101 instead of opting to use reserve opener brown to replace barnes australia played hassett out of position to partner morris while harvey took a middle order slot for england s part washbrook s second innings half century at old trafford aided by multiple dropped catches was regarded as a major factor in his retention for headingley match fingleton pp 140 144 having scored only 63 runs in first five innings of series he was reunited with hutton whose controversial exile lasted only one test before emmett was dropped dollery who had made only 38 in three innings in second and third tests was replaced by all rounder ken cranston despite being productive in domestic matches during season cranston had struggled in his previous outings against tourists in two matches against australia he had managed only 47 runs in three innings and a total of 2 109 washbrook and hutton put on 168 for first wicket first time
