people logged on mattel s website requesting e mail updates on cher doll co creator of show max mutchnick kept prototype will grace producer tim kaiser in an interview with new york times said that doll s appearance was not any kind of forced product placement as some speculated explaining it was just a natural fit because jack s affection for cher is a thread that is running through show already kaiser continued saying that nbc saw strength of episode s storyline and understood that if a cher doll is in show that much it s an integral part of episode kaiser said that gypsies tramps and weed writer katie palmer originally didn t know mattel planned to market a cher doll and learned about it after working on script curt king a spokesman for nbc further commented that doll s role in episode was due to producers thinking of a lot of humor that would come out of it mark malinowski senior vice president and director at ketchum entertainment marketing revealed that mattel was launching cher doll and in a brainstorming meeting they mentioned will grace as jack character in love with cher we thought it would be great to try to include doll in a plot line of an episode because it would be organic playing off something that already exists i don t think any viewer will see this and think product placement it s strategic for product and relevant for audience particularly gay men who watch show because characters of jack and will are gay it was also noted that mattel did not pay a fee to show s producers or nbc to have cher doll appear in episode television critic scott d pierce revealed that nbc did not want television critics to give away too much detail about jack and cher s time together in a june 2004 interview actress megan mullally who plays karen in regards to cher s appearance said i wasn t sure about cher s appearance they flew her in like she was sort of dropped in on a crescent moon she did scene and was like airlifted back out and when i met her she was in her full cher land drag so i didn t get to experience her as a person reception in its original american broadcast gypsies tramps and weed was watched by approximately 22
