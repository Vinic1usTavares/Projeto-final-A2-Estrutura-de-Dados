was an aircraft carrier built for imperial japanese navy ijn during mid 1930s a sister ship was intended to follow soryu but hiryus design was heavily modified and she is often considered to be a separate class soryus aircraft were employed in operations during second sino japanese war in late 1930s and supported japanese invasion of french indochina in mid 1940 during first months of pacific war she took part in attack on pearl harbor battle of wake island and supported conquest of dutch east indies in february 1942 her aircraft bombed darwin australia and she continued on to assist in dutch east indies campaign in april soryu aircraft helped sink two british heavy cruisers and several merchant ships during indian ocean raid after a brief refit soryu and three other carriers of 1st air fleet kido butai participated in battle of midway in june 1942 after bombarding american forces on midway atoll carriers were attacked by aircraft from island and carriers and dive bombers from
