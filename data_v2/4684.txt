thumb upright 1 2 most minerals on earth formed after photosynthesis by cyanobacteria pictured began adding oxygen to atmosphere mineral evolution is a recent hypothesis that provides historical context to mineralogy it postulates that mineralogy on planets and moons becomes increasingly complex as a result of changes in physical chemical and biological environment in solar system number of mineral species has grown from about a dozen to over 5400 as a result of three processes separation and concentration of elements greater ranges of temperature and pressure coupled with action of volatiles and new chemical pathways provided by living organisms on earth there were three eras of mineral evolution birth of sun and formation of asteroids and planets increased number of minerals to about 250 repeated reworking of crust and mantle through processes such as partial melting and plate tectonics increased total to about 1500 remaining minerals more than two thirds of total were result of chemical changes mediated by living organisms with largest increase occurring after great oxygenation event use of term evolution in 2008 paper that introduced term mineral evolution robert hazen and co authors recognized that an application of word evolution to minerals was likely to be controversial although there were precedents as far back as 1928 book evolution of igneous rocks by norman bowen they used term in sense of an irreversible sequence of events leading to increasingly complex and diverse assemblages of minerals unlike biological evolution it does not involve mutation competition or passing of information to progeny hazen et al explored some other analogies including idea of extinction some mineral forming processes no longer occur such as those that produced certain minerals in enstatite chondrites that are unstable on earth in its oxidized state also runaway greenhouse effect on venus may have led to permanent losses of mineral species however mineral extinction is not truly irreversible a lost mineral could emerge again if suitable environmental conditions were re established presolar minerals thumb presolar grains stardust from murchison meteorite provide information on first minerals in early universe there were no minerals because only elements available were hydrogen helium and trace amounts of lithium mineral formation became possible after heavier elements including carbon oxygen silicon and nitrogen were synthesized in stars in expanding atmospheres of red giants and ejecta from supernovae microscopic minerals formed at temperatures above evidence of these minerals can be found in interstellar grains incorporated into primitive meteorites called chondrites which are essentially cosmic sedimentary rocks number of known species is roughly a dozen although several more materials have been identified but not classified as minerals because it has a high crystallization temperature about diamond was probably first mineral to form this was followed by graphite oxides rutile corundum spinel carbides moissanite nitrides and silicon nitride and silicates forsterite and silicate perovskite these ur minerals seeded molecular clouds from which solar system was formed processes after formation of solar system mineral evolution was driven by three primary mechanisms separation and concentration of elements greater ranges of temperature and pressure combined with chemical action of volatiles and new reaction pathways driven by living organisms separation and concentration thumb upright 1 75 cutaway views of some terrestrial planets showing layers highest level in classification of minerals is based on chemical composition however defining elements for many mineral groups such as boron in borates and phosphorus in phosphates were at first only present in concentrations of parts per million or less this left little or no chance for them to come together and form minerals until external influences concentrated them processes that separate and concentrate elements include planetary differentiation for example separation into layers such as a core and mantle outgassing fractional crystallization and partial melting intensive variables and volatiles thumb gypsum crystals formed as water evaporated in lake lucero new mexico allowable combinations of elements in minerals are determined by thermodynamics for an element to be added to a crystal at a given location it must reduce energy at higher temperatures many elements are interchangeable in minerals such as olivine as a planet cools minerals became exposed to a greater range of intensive variables such as temperature and pressure allowing formation of new phases and more specialized combinations of elements such as clay minerals and zeolites new minerals are formed when volatile compounds such as water carbon dioxide and o2 react with them environments such as ice caps dry lakes and exhumed metamorphic rock have distinctive suites of minerals biological influence life has made dramatic changes in environment most dramatic was great oxygenation event about 2 4 billion years ago in which photosynthetic organisms flooded atmosphere with oxygen living organisms also catalyze reactions creating minerals such as aragonite that are not in equilibrium with their surroundings chronology before formation of solar system there were about 12 minerals estimate for current number of minerals has been changing rapidly in 2008 it was 4300 but as of november 2018 there were 5413 officially recognized mineral species in their chronology for earth hazen et al 2008 separated changes in mineral abundance into three broad intervals planetary accretion up to 4 55 ga billion years ago reworking of earth s crust and mantle between 4 55 ga and 2 5 ga and biological influences after 2 5 ga they further divided ages into 10 intervals some of which overlap in addition some of dates are uncertain for example estimates of onset of modern plate tectonics range from 4 5 ga to 1 0 ga eras and stages of earth s mineral evolution era stage age ga cumulative no of species ur minerals 4 6 12 era of planetary accretion 4 55 ga

nickel matrix in first era sun ignited heating surrounding molecular cloud 60 new minerals were produced and were preserved as inclusions in chondrites accretion of dust into asteroids and planets bombardments heating and reactions with water raised number to 250 stage 1 sun ignites before 4 56 ga presolar nebula was a dense molecular cloud consisting of hydrogen and helium gas with dispersed dust grains when sun ignited and entered its t tauri phase it melted nearby dust grains some of melt droplets were incorporated into chondrites as small spherical objects called chondrules almost all chondrites also contain calcium aluminium rich inclusions cais earliest materials formed in solar system from an examination of chondrites from this era 60 new minerals can be identified with crystal structures from all of crystal systems these included first iron nickel alloys sulfides phosphides and several silicates and oxides among most important were magnesium rich olivine magnesium rich pyroxene and plagioclase some rare minerals produced in oxygen poor environments no longer found on earth can be found in enstatite chondrites stage 2 planetesimals form soon after new minerals formed in stage 1 they began to clump together forming asteroids and planets one of most important new minerals was ice early solar system had a snow line separating rocky planets and asteroids from ice rich gas giants asteroids and comets heating from radionuclides melted ice and water reacted with olivine rich rocks forming phyllosilicates oxides such as magnetite sulfides such as carbonates dolomite and calcite and sulfates such as gypsum shock and heat from bombardment and eventual melting produced minerals such as a major component of earth s mantle eventually asteroids heated enough for partial melting to occur producing melts rich in pyroxene and plagioclase capable of producing basalt and a variety of phosphates siderophile metal loving and silicate loving elements separated leading to formation of a core and crust and incompatible elements were sequestered in melts resulting minerals have been preserved in a type of stony meteorite quartz potassium feldspar and zircon and in iron nickel meteorites iron nickel alloys such as kamacite and transition metal sulfides such as troilite carbides and phosphides an estimated 250 new minerals formed in this stage crust and mantle reworking thumb a zircon crystal thumb pegmatite sample from grand canyon thumb upright 1 35 schematic of a subduction zone second era in history of mineral evolution began with massive impact that formed moon this melted most of crust and mantle early mineralogy was determined by crystallization of igneous rocks and further bombardments this phase was then replaced by extensive recycling of crust and mantle so that at end of this era there were about 1500 mineral species however few of rocks survived from this period so timing of many events remains uncertain stage 3 igneous processes stage 3 began with a crust made of mafic high in iron and magnesium and ultramafic rocks such as basalt these rocks were repeatedly recycled by fractional melting fractional crystallization and separation of magmas that refuse to mix an example of such a process is bowen s reaction series one of few sources of direct information on mineralogy in this stage is mineral inclusions in zircon crystals which date back as far as 4 4 ga among minerals in inclusions are quartz muscovite biotite potassium feldspar albite chlorite and hornblende in a volatile poor body such as mercury and moon above processes give rise to about 350 mineral species water and other volatiles if present increase total earth was volatile rich with an atmosphere composed of n2 co2 and water and an ocean that became steadily more saline volcanism outgassing and hydration gave rise to hydroxides hydrates carbonates and evaporites for earth where this stage coincides with hadean eon total number of widely occurring minerals is estimated to be 420 with over 100 more that were rare mars probably reached this stage of mineral evolution stage 4 granitoids and pegmatite formation given sufficient heat basalt was remelted to form granitoids coarse grained rocks similar to granite cycles of melting concentrated rare elements such as lithium beryllium boron niobium tantalum and uranium to point where they could form 500 new minerals many of these are concentrated in exceptionally coarse grained rocks called pegmatites that are typically found in dikes and veins near larger igneous masses venus may have achieved this level of evolution stage 5 plate tectonics with onset of plate tectonics subduction carried crust and water down leading to fluid rock interactions and more concentration of rare elements in particular sulfide deposits were formed with 150 new minerals subduction also carried cooler rock into mantle and exposed it to higher pressures resulting in new phases that were later uplifted and exposed as metamorphic minerals such as and biologically mediated mineralogy thumb stromatolite fossil in section of a 2 1 ga banded iron formation thumb a lead uranium oxide mineral inorganic processes described in previous section produced about 1500 mineral species remaining more than two thirds of earth s minerals are result of transformation of earth by living organisms largest contribution was from enormous increase in oxygen content of atmosphere starting with great oxygenation event living organisms also started to produce skeletons and other forms of biomineralization minerals such as calcite metal oxides and many clay minerals could be considered biosignatures along with gems such as turquoise azurite and malachite stage 6 biology in an anoxic world before about 2 45 ga there was very little oxygen in atmosphere life may have played a role in precipitation of massive carbonate layers near continental margins and in deposition of banded iron formations but there is no unambiguous evidence of effect of life on minerals stage 7 great oxygenation event starting around 2 45 ga and continuing to about 2 0 or 1 9 ga there was a dramatic rise in oxygen content of lower atmosphere continents and oceans called great oxygenation event or great oxidation event goe before goe elements that can be in multiple oxidation states were restricted to lowest state and that limited variety of minerals they could form in older sediments minerals siderite uraninite and pyrite are commonly found these oxidize rapidly when exposed to an atmosphere with oxygen yet this did not occur even after extensive weathering and transport when concentration of oxygen molecules in atmosphere reached 1 of present level chemical reactions during weathering were much like they are today siderite and pyrite were replaced by iron oxides magnetite and hematite dissolved fe2 ions that had been carried out to sea were now deposited in extensive banded iron formations however this did not result in new iron minerals just a change in their abundance by contrast oxidization of uraninite resulted in over 200 new species of uranyl minerals such as and as well as mineral complexes such as other elements that have multiple oxidation states include copper which occurs in 321 oxides and silicates boron vanadium magnesium selenium tellurium arsenic antimony bismuth silver and mercury in total about 2500 new minerals formed stage 8 intermediate ocean next roughly billion years 1 85 0 85 ga are often referred to as boring billion because little seemed to happen more oxidized layer of ocean water near surface slowly deepened at expense of anoxic depths but there did not seem to be any dramatic change in climate biology or mineralogy however some of this perception may be due to poor preservation of rocks from that time span many of world s most valuable reserves of lead zinc and silver are found in rocks from this time as well as rich sources of beryllium boron and uranium minerals this interval also saw formation of supercontinent columbia its breakup and formation of rodinia in some quantitative studies of beryllium boron and mercury minerals there are no new minerals during great oxidation event but a pulse of innovation during assembly of columbia reasons for this are not clear although it may have had something to do with release of mineralizing fluids during mountain building stage 9 snowball earth between 1 0 and 0 542 ga earth experienced at least two snowball earth events in which much possibly all of surface was covered by ice making it dominant surface mineral associated with ice were cap carbonates thick layers of limestone or dolomite with aragonite fans clay minerals were also produced in abundance and volcanoes managed to pierce through ice and add to stock of minerals stage 10 phanerozoic era and biomineralization thumb upright late cambrian trilobite fossil last stage coincides with phanerozoic era in which biomineralization creation of minerals by living organisms became widespread although some can be found in earlier records it was during cambrian explosion that most of known skeletal forms developed and major skeletal minerals calcite aragonite apatite and opal most of these are carbonates but some are phosphates or calcite in all over 64 mineral phases have been identified in living organisms including metal sulfides oxides hydroxides and silicates over two dozen have been found in human body before phanerozoic land was mostly barren rock but plants began to populate it in silurian period this led to an order of magnitude increase in production of clay minerals in oceans plankton transported calcium carbonate from shallow waters to deep ocean inhibiting production of cap carbonates and making future snowball earth events less likely microbes also became involved in geochemical cycles of most elements making them cycles mineralogical novelties included organic minerals that have been found in carbon rich remnants of life such as coal and black shales anthropocene thumb mineral forms when tin artifacts corrode in sea water and is found near some shipwrecks strictly speaking purely biogenic minerals are not recognized by international mineralogical association ima unless geological processes are also involved purely biological products such as shells of marine organisms are not accepted also explicitly excluded are anthropogenic compounds however humans have had such an impact on surface of planet that geologists are considering introduction of a new geological epoch anthropocene to reflect these changes in 2015 and co authors proposed that definition of minerals be extended to include human minerals and that their production constitutes an 11th stage of mineral evolution subsequently hazen and co authors catalogued 208 minerals that are officially recognized by ima but are primarily or exclusively result of human activities most of these have formed in association with mining in addition some were created when metal artefacts sank and interacted with seafloor a few would probably not be officially recognized today but are allowed to remain in catalog these include two and that may have been a hoax hazen and co authors identified three ways that humans have had a large impact on distribution and diversity of minerals first is through manufacture a long list of synthetic crystals have mineral equivalents including synthetic gems ceramics brick cement and batteries many more have no mineral equivalent over 180 000 inorganic crystalline compounds are listed in inorganic crystal structure database for mining or building of infrastructure humans have redistributed rocks sediments and minerals on a scale rivalling that of glaciation and valuable minerals have been redistributed and juxtaposed in ways that would not occur naturally origin of life over two thirds of mineral species owe their existence to life but life may also owe its existence to minerals they may have been needed as templates to bring organic molecules together as catalysts for chemical reactions and as metabolites two prominent theories for origin of life involve clays and transition metal sulfides another theory argues that calcium borate minerals such as and borate and possibly also may have been needed for first acid rna to form other theories require less common minerals such as mackinawite or greigite a catalog of minerals that were formed during eon includes clay minerals and iron and nickel sulfides including mackinawite and greigite but borates and were unlikely minerals may also have been necessary to survival of early life for example quartz is more transparent than other minerals in sandstones before life developed pigments to protect it from damaging ultraviolet rays a thin layer of quartz could shield it while allowing enough light through for photosynthesis phosphate minerals may also have been important to early life phosphorus is one of essential elements in molecules such as adenosine triphosphate atp an energy carrier found in all living cells rna and dna and cell membranes most of earth s phosphorus is in core and mantle most likely mechanism for making it available to life would be creation of phosphates such as apatite through fractionation followed by weathering to release phosphorus this may have required plate tectonics further research thumb cinnabar red on dolomite since original paper on mineral evolution there have been several studies of minerals of specific elements including uranium thorium mercury carbon beryllium and clay minerals these reveal information about different processes for example uranium and thorium are heat producers while uranium and carbon indicate oxidation state records reveal episodic bursts of new minerals such as those during boring billion as well as long periods where no new minerals appeared for example after a jump in diversity during assembly of columbia there were no new mercury minerals between 1 8 ga and 600 million years ago this remarkably long hiatus is attributed to a sulfide rich ocean which led to rapid deposition of mineral cinnabar most of mineral evolution papers have looked at first appearance of minerals but one can also look at age distribution of a given mineral millions of zircon crystals have been dated and age distributions are nearly independent of where crystals are found e g igneous rocks sedimentary or metasedimentary rocks or modern river sands they have highs and lows that are linked with supercontinent cycle although it is not clear whether this is due to changes in subduction activity or preservation other studies have looked at time variations of mineral properties such as isotope ratios chemical compositions and relative abundances of minerals although not under rubric of mineral evolution history for most of its history mineralogy had no historical component it was concerned with classifying minerals according to their chemical and physical properties such as chemical formula and crystal structure and defining conditions for stability of a mineral or group of minerals however there were exceptions where publications looked at distribution of ages of minerals or of ores in 1960 russell gordon found cycles in distribution of mineral dates charles meyer finding that ores of some elements are distributed over a wider time span than others attributed difference to effects of tectonics and biomass on surface chemistry particularly free oxygen and carbon in 1979 a g introduced concept of stages of mineral evolution in russian language journal akademii nauk and in 1982 n p noted increasing complexity of minerals over time near surface of earth then in 2008 hazen and colleagues introduced a much broader and more detailed vision of mineral evolution this was followed by a series of quantitative explorations of evolution of various mineral groups these led in 2015 to concept of mineral ecology study of distributions of minerals in space and time in april 2017 natural history museum in vienna opened a new permanent exhibit on mineral evolution references further reading external links special issue on mineral evolution elements magazine mineral evolution database category minerals category mineralogy
