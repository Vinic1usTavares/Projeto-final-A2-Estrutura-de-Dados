sr west country and battle of britain classes collectively known as light pacifics or informally as spam cans are air smoothed 4 6 2 pacific steam locomotives designed for southern railway by its chief mechanical engineer oliver bulleid incorporating a number of new developments in british steam locomotive technology they were amongst first british designs to use welding in construction process and to use steel fireboxes which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post war economy arlett 1989 p 29 30 they were designed to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives merchant navy class to permit use on a wider variety of routes including in south west of england and kent coast they were a mixed traffic design being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains and were used on all types of services frequently far below their capabilities a total of 110 locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950 named after west country resorts or royal air force raf and other subjects associated with battle of britain due to problems with some of new features such as bulleid chain driven valve gear sixty locomotives were rebuilt by british railways during late 1950s fairclough wills 1970 p 11 results were similar to rebuilt merchant navy class fairclough wills 1970 p 34 classes operated until july 1967 when last steam locomotives on southern region were withdrawn although most were scrapped twenty locomotives are preserved on heritage railways in britain background financial success enjoyed by southern railway during 1930s was based on completion of its london suburban electrification scheme in 1929 and subsequent electrification of main lines to brighton and sussex coast and to guildford and portsmouth whitehouse thomas 2002 p 34 despite electrification plans southern railway s less heavily used lines in west country beyond salisbury did not merit cost lines in devon and cornwall were meandering heavily graded and although with heavy summer holiday traffic were lightly used during winter months seasonality of railway traffic meant that west country branches were worked by ageing t9 class 4 4 0 and versatile n class 2 6 0 which could be better utilised on mixed traffic services elsewhere as a result an order was placed with brighton railway works in april 1941 for twenty passenger locomotives of a type to be determined bradley 1976 p 55 during 1943 bulleid began planning for post war locomotive requirements of railway and identified need for a stop gap steam locomotive design for those main lines in south east england scheduled for electrification had second world war not taken place although new merchant navy class was available for heaviest continental expresses resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure following war would require a lighter locomotive with wider route availability bradley 1976 p 55 at same time there would be a continuing need for fast freight locomotives capable of operating on both electrified and non electrified routes without impeding intensive use of system by passenger trains whitehouse thomas 2002 p 60 suburban electrification used electric multiple units which had no equivalent freight design although bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941 these were as yet unproven and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for foreseeable future design detailed design work for new mixed traffic locomotives was undertaken at brighton railway works where they were scheduled to be constructed earliest drawings were for a moderately sized 2 6 0 with similarities to london and north eastern railway class which bulleid had helped design for west highland line when he was nigel gresley s assistant however such a design would have been inadequate for kent coast lines which required a powerful 2 6 2 or 4 6 0 class it is not clear why design was subsequently enlarged to become a smaller version of merchant navy class 4 6 2 as likely traffic requirement did not warrant such lavish provision but incorporation of components from that class enabled standardisation during wartime production difficulties bradley 1976 p 56 weight reduction and reduced loading gauge in order to improve on route availability of merchant navy class with its 21 ton axle loading weight was reduced by 5 tons this allowed design to operate on routes where maunsell 2 6 0s were largest permitted and came mainly from several changes reduced overall length smaller boiler more fabricated assemblies smaller tender west country only also cab was reduced in width and remodelled to comply with reduced loading gauge over some routes bulleid s features thumb right alt an almost solid disc not spoked locomotive wheel with a series of cast in radial indentations and prominent round holes intended to reduce its weight distinctive bulleid firth brown wheels seen here on 34072 257 squadron based on mechanical experience gained from merchant navy locomotives bulleid incorporated his chain driven valve gear into what became new design this now infamous component was unique in british locomotive design chain driven valve gear diagram retrieved 13 april 2007 it gained notoriety because it was difficult to access when things went wrong and in tandem with fast moving bulleid steam reverser could cause irregular valve movements entire system was in a sealed oil bath another unique design that provided constant lubrication to moving parts locomotive also carried a similar air smoothed casing to merchant navy class this was not regarded as streamlining by bulleid a fact demonstrated by flat front end authorities differ as to purpose of casing according to creer it was intended to be an aid in cleaning locomotive with carriage washers to reduce labour requirements during post war period whereas bradley asserts that intention was to lift steam and exhaust gases away from cab bradley 1976 p 10 as with merchant navies class soon gained nickname spam cans due to resemblance to distinctive tin cans in which spam was sold smokebox was an integral part of air smoothed casing being a sheet metal fabrication to same profile as firebox that acted as a former to maintain shape of casing in between casing was supported by channel section steel crinolines strengtheners used to maintain shape attached to frames smokebox housed five nozzle lemaitre blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large diameter chimney as with merchant navy class electric lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate powered by a steam powered generator below footplate bulleids in retrospect gauges were lit by ultra violet light this enabled clearer night time vision of boiler steam pressure gauge and brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle making it easier for crew to see signals along track close attention was paid to ergonomics of cab which was designed with controls required for operation grouped according to needs of both driver and fireman thus promoting safe operation day lewis 1964 pp 149 150 as an aid to fireman a treadle used steam pressure to open firehole doors where coal is shovelled into firebox footplate was entirely enclosed improving crew working conditions in winter other refinements and innovations used on merchant navy class included steam powered clasp brakes and unusual 6 ft 2 in 1 88 m bulleid firth brown bfb wheels frames boiler cylinders compared with merchant navy class shorter overall length led to shorter frames and reduced wheelbase to boiler was also shorter and of smaller diameter at smokebox end but retaining operating pressure fairclough wills 1970 p 5 inner and outer belpaire firebox was also smaller than merchant navy 1976 p 57 also constructed using welded steel cylinders were smaller at glover 1965 p 224 tender thumb 34016 bodmin taking water at alton bulleid designed a reduced capacity tender based upon merchant navy version it could carry water and of coal on a six wheel underframe it retained bfb wheels and streamlining panels or raves that gave top of tender a similar cross sectional outline to carriages as with merchant navy class water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight and tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp type similar to that on locomotive four train brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on tank top behind coal space construction for construction history of class see list of sr west country and battle of britain class locomotives first batch of twenty locomotives was ordered in april 1941 although changes in design to light pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944 due to wartime contract work at brighton works boilers were built under contract at north british locomotive company before first of class had been delivered order was increased to thirty with a second batch of ten ordered in september 1944 deliveries from brighton works began in may 1945 with prototype no 21c101 exeter and proceeded at rate of about two locomotives per month class was gradually run in on central section until october 1945 when they were successfully trialled on plymouth and kentish services by time first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed with these entering service between june and october 1946 bradley 1976 p 59 from this batch onwards traction was improved by addition of steam sanding to front driving wheel with covers added to protect motion from sand falling from filler pipes bradley 1976 p 67 a third batch of twenty five was ordered and designated battle of britain class these were identical to west country class and new designation was purely concerned with giving locomotives names that befitted their intended allocation to eastern section by time of nationalisation of british railways in january 1948 seventy light pacifics had been built at brighton works with a fourth batch of twenty on order there was a delay in production during first three months of british railways control but last twenty ordered by southern railway entered traffic between april 1948 and february 1949 bradley 1976 p 74 in march 1949 british railways ordered a final 20 from brighton works despite a pressing need for smaller tank locomotives bradley 1976 p 76 this imbalance was rectified by building forty one examples of lms fairburn 2 6 4t for southern region also at this time brighton works staff were embroiled in difficulties associated with bulleid s experimental and problematic leader class as a result brighton sought assistance from other southern region works to complete this final order ashford works cut frames and constructed tenders and eastleigh works constructed six of final batch of locomotives thumb upright 1 2 34110 66 squadron last of class built leaving in 1963 completion of final locomotive no 34110 66 squadron in january 1951 was delayed for several months pending consideration of proposals from british railways management for a major modification to a standard two cylinder design without chain driven valve gear but locomotive entered service as bulleid intended subsequent modifications first six locomotives were initially fitted with plywood sheeting over cab side windows as a wartime material saving measure with no 21c107 wadebridge first to receive glass windows bradley 1976 p 58 two of front route indicator irons of which there are five were originally located on smoke deflectors which meant that indicator discs stood proud of casing this necessitated a trial relocation to smokebox door at three and nine o clock positions on no lyme regis and fitted as standard from no axminster onwards batch constructed between june and october 1946 received a modified steam regulator and lms style parallel buffer casings as with merchant navy class they were fitted with a new design of cab front spectacle plates from mid 1947 due to poor forward visibility small windows on front face of cab were redesigned to an angled profile giving improved visibility to driver this was a feature fitted to all bulleid designed locomotives post nationalisation they were introduced in britain in 1934 with gresley designed cock o north creer morrison 2001 p 13 over next decade revised design was fitted to existing members of class bradley 1976 pp 60 61 another modification was reduction of boiler pressure to to reduce maintenance costs southern railway built batches had a narrow footplate due to width restricted hastings line between tonbridge and wills 1970 p 10 but these were never used on this duty and cab was widened to on british railways batch southern e group 2004 footplate sizes retrieved 13 april 2007 tenders of nos 21c170 were fitted with tia traitement integral armand chemical feed water equipment that precipitated scale forming constituents in hard water of southern england into a non adhesive mud that could be cleared using a manual blow down valve bradley 1976 p 61 this equipment was retrospectively fitted to earlier members of class in 1948 tender design was enlarged to provide a water capacity of to ease maintenance and lubrication panels of air smoothed casing ahead of cylinders were removed from 1952 and front sanders were blanked off this coincided with removal of tender raves on all but five locomotives as they obstructed packing of coal into bunker and restricted driver s view when reversing southern e group 2004 removal of raves retrieved 13 september 2009 resultant cut down tender included new enclosed storage for fire irons and glass spectacle plates to protect crew from flying coal dust when running tender first southern e group 2004 tender modifications retrieved 13 september 2009 when rebuilding programme see below was halted in 1961 further modifications were made to unrebuilt locomotives most notable was on no 34064 fighter command which was fitted with a giesl ejector in 1962 on grounds that a desired spark arrestor would suffocate an ordinary blastpipe nine elms 2009

fitted in mid 1980s siviter 2003 p 106 numbering and naming locomotives bulleid employed same idiosyncratic numbering scheme that he had used for merchant navy class beginning at no 21c101 and reaching no 21c170 at time of nationalisation his scheme was abolished by british railways which renumbered existing these 34001 34070 and new locomotives 34110 thumb left alt a west country class

scroll is below shield allowing identification as a member of west country class nameplate configuration 1 west country 34007 wadebridge first 48 members of class were named after places in west country served by its trains or close to its lines this represented a publicity success due to many of locomotives being able to visit their namesake areas burridge 1975 p 72 many west country locomotives sported an additional plaque with coat of arms of town or region locomotive was named after this plaque was mounted on casing between gunmetal locomotive nameplate and west country class scroll above middle driving wheel several members of class had only nameplate and west country class scroll a gap being left where a crest would have been mounted burridge 1975 p 66 background of nameplate was usually painted red though sometimes examples could be found in black if locomotive works undertaking overhaul of engine could not locate correct colour paint burridge 1975 p 68 thumb

squadron once it became clear that locomotives would be used further afield than west country a decision was made to name remainder after raf squadrons airfields commanders and aircraft that had participated in battle of britain over kent surrey and sussex bradley 1976 p 59 battle of britain nameplates incorporated name of locomotive with class name below in a design that resembled wings of an aircraft this was painted air force blue though other colours were sometimes substituted for same reasons as above burridge 1975 pp 72 78 an enamelled crest of aircraft personality or squadron was placed below nameplate in same position as west country class equivalent first locomotives constructed by british railways were of battle of britain class but naming policy reverted to west country for nos final two locomotives were battle of britain class no 34109 sir trafford leigh mallory and no 34110 66 squadron result of delay in completing was that squadron crest for 66 squadron was never made as manufacturer had retired during intervening period burridge 1975 p 74 thus 66 squadron was only battle of britain class member not to have a crest operational details original intention was to base first batch of locomotives at exmouth junction depot at exeter for use on west of england main line to salisbury and plymouth and secondary lines to barnstaple bude and other holiday resorts in devon and cornwall by winter of 1945 there was a more pressing need for them on kent coast services bradley 1976 p 58 class also began to be used on continental boat trains to and from dover and folkestone once these were resumed in 1946 later batches were used on cross country services such as brighton to bournemouth cardiff and plymouth trains or somerset and dorset joint railway trains from bournemouth to wells and bath because of good route availability locomotives could be used on non electrified lines between london and brighton these included oxted line and occasionally bluebell line between east grinstead and lewes where they were also used for freight and parcels traffic and excursion trains over electrified lines thus original intention for west country class locomotives to work in south west england and battle of britain class in kent hampshire sussex and surrey was never operationally practical and both classes were to be found all over network most important journey undertaken by a member of class occurred on 30 january 1965 when no 34051 winston churchill hauled funeral train of its namesake from waterloo station to his final resting place close to

cardiff charter train west of bath on 11 june 2011 as with merchant navy class they could generate great power using mediocre quality fuel due largely to bulleid s excellent boiler they also ran smoothly at high speed but they were also beset with same technical problems of their larger sisters bradley 1976 pp 66 70 these may be summarised as follows adhesion problems lighter loading on their driving axles meant that they were even more prone to wheelslip than merchant navy class requiring very careful control when starting a heavy train once underway they were noted for their free running excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed maintenance problems chain driven valve gear proved to be expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear leaks from oil bath onto wheels caused oil to splash onto boiler lagging once saturated with oil lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided combustible material and sparks from heavy braking would set lagging on fire underneath air smoothed casing southern e group 2004 bulleid mn merchant navy class 4 6 2 notes from a bulleid fundamentalist retrieved 16 april 2007 for cause of lagging fires which were common on both merchant navys and light pacifics fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into boiler lagging in service in either case local fire brigade would be called to put fire out with cold water coming into contact with hot boiler causing stress to casings many photographs show an un rebuilt locomotive with warped casings result of a lagging fire high fuel consumption this was highlighted during 1948 locomotive exchanges undertaken by british railways and very apparent at exmouth junction shed where light pacifics burned of coal per mile 13 5 kg km compared to 9 02 kg km for t9 class that they replaced bradley 1976 p 66 restricted driver visibility due to air smoothed casing and soft steam exhaust from multiple jet blastpipe exhaust problem was never adequately resolved and smoke continued to beat down onto casing while moving obscuring driver s vision there was much experimentation in order to resolve this problem with varying degrees of success and photographic evidence shows many guises of this project creer morrison 2001 pp 72 73 accidents and incidents for lewisham rail crash see subsection below on 29 october

restricted driver visibility was mentioned in report on disastrous lewisham rail crash on 4 december 1957 outside st john s railway station in which 90 people were killed and 173 injured driver of no spitfire had failed to see one yellow and one double yellow caution signal in foggy conditions and was travelling too fast to stop when he saw a red signal and train crashed into back of a stationary local train members of class were later fitted with automatic warning system equipment a recommendation of incident report fitting of trackside equipment was already underway but priority had been given to routes equipped with semaphore signals not electric colour light signals as at lewisham report on disaster indicated that it was necessary with signals concerned being on right hand side of train and because of limited visibility from left hand side of a steam locomotive for either fireman to observe those signals but with driver being responsible for asking him to do so or for driver to cross over footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from other side in event driver did neither and neither driver nor fireman looked out for aspect of signals report ascribed blame to driver but recommended that class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility noting that in fog with less than 80 yards of visibility three signals involved would not be visible at all from driver s side of footplate however it noted that even from a schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler it was unlikely that these signals could have been seen from driver s side in dense foggy conditions of incident report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility rebuilding due to problems experienced with class and following success of rebuilt merchant navy class designed by r g jarvis british railways ordered rebuilding of sixty locomotives to a more conventional design at eastleigh between 1957 and 1961 derry 2004 p 70 first locomotive to be rebuilt was no 34005 barnstaple which adopted many features from br standard locomotive classes creer morrison 2001 pp 84 87 casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding boiler pressure reduced to and chain driven valve gear was replaced with modified walschaerts valve gear fitted both outside as well as between frames rapid onset of 1955 modernisation plan during early 1960s meant that remaining fifty locomotives were not rebuilt and continued in as built condition until withdrawal southern e group 2004 discontinuation of rebuilding programme retrieved 13 april 2007 performance of rebuilt locomotives rebuilding solved most of maintenance problems whilst retaining excellent features of original design repair costs were reduced by up to 60 and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8 4 bradley 1976 p 97 however walschaerts valve gear made rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on track a complaint that was not evident with original design increased weight reduced their route availability meaning that they could not be used on certain routes available to un rebuilt examples such as line to ilfracombe arlett 1989 p 32 withdrawal electrification of chatham main line to dover and ramsgate in 1959 deprived class of some of its work as did transfer of lines west of salisbury to western region on 30 december 1962 this resulted in withdrawal of several unrebuilt locomotives stabled at exmouth junction shed in june 1963 by end of year ten had been withdrawn including 12 year old no 34110 66 squadron having travelled only 600 000 miles bradley
