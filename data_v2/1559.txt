pan am flight 214 was a scheduled flight of pan american world airways from san juan puerto rico to baltimore maryland and philadelphia pennsylvania on december 8 1963 boeing 707 serving flight crashed near elkton maryland while flying from baltimore to philadelphia after being hit by lightning all 81 occupants of plane were killed it was first fatal accident on a pan am jet aircraft since company had taken its first delivery of type five years earlier an investigation by civil aeronautics board concluded that cause of crash was a lightning strike that had ignited fuel vapors in one of aircraft s fuel tanks causing an explosion that destroyed one of wings exact way that lightning had ignited fumes was never determined however investigation revealed various ways that lightning can damage aircraft in flight which led to new safety regulations crash also led to research into safety of different types of aviation fuel and research into methods of reducing dangerous fuel tank vapors accident pan american flight 214 was a regularly scheduled flight from isla verde international airport in san juan puerto rico to philadelphia international airport with a scheduled stopover at baltimore s friendship airport it operated three times a week as counterpart to flight 213 which flew from philadelphia to san juan via baltimore earlier same day flight 214 left san juan at 4 10p m eastern time with 140 passengers and 8 crew members and arrived in baltimore at 7 10p m crew did not report any maintenance issues or problems during flight upon arrival 67 of passengers disembarked in baltimore after refueling aircraft left baltimore at 8 24p m with remaining 73 passengers for final leg to philadelphia international airport as flight approached philadelphia pilots established contact with air traffic control near philadelphia at 8 m controller informed pilots that airport was experiencing a line of thunderstorms in vicinity of airport accompanied by strong winds and turbulence controller asked if pilots wanted to proceed directly to airport or to enter a holding pattern to wait for storm to pass crew of pan am flight 214 elected to hold at 5 000 feet in a holding pattern with five other aircraft air traffic controller told them that delay would be approximately 30 minutes there was heavy rain in holding area with frequent lightning and gusts of wind up to at 8 m aircraft exploded pilots were able to transmit a final message mayday mayday mayday clipper 214 out of control here we go seconds later first officer of national airlines flight 16 holding 1 000 feet higher in same holding pattern radioed in clipper 214 is going down in flames aircraft crashed at 8 59p m in a corn field east of elkton maryland near delaware turnpike setting rain soaked field on fire aircraft was completely destroyed and all of occupants were killed aircraft was first pan american jet plane to crash in five years they had been flown by airline it was tenth fatal accident involving boeing 707 and at time it was fourth highest number of fatalities in an aviation accident in u s history aftermath thumb wreckage from flight after crash after crash witnesses and residents rushed to scene of crash but there was little that could be done other than begin collection of bodies wreckage was engulfed in intense fires that burned for more than four hours first responders and police from across county along with men from bainbridge naval training center assisted with recovery they patrolled area with railroad flares and set up searchlights to define accident scene and to make sure that debris and human remains were undisturbed by curious spectators one firefighter steward godwin collapsed at scene at about 1 30a m of a heart attack on seventh day a memorial service was held at crash site remains of victims were brought to national guard armory in philadelphia where a temporary morgue was set up relatives came to armory but officials there ruled out any possibility of being able to visually identify victims it took state medical examiner nine days to identify all of victims using fingerprints dental records and nearby personal effects in some cases team reconstructed victims faces as much as possible using mannequins main impact crater contained most of aircraft s fuselage left inner wing left main gear and nose gear portions of plane s right wing and fuselage right main landing gear horizontal and vertical tail surfaces and two of engines were found within of crater a trail of debris from plane extended as far as from point of impact complete left wing tip was found a little under from crash site parts of wreckage ripped a hole in a country road shattered windows in a nearby home and spread burning jet fuel across a wide area civil aeronautics board was notified of accident and was dispatched from washington d c to conduct an investigation witnesses of crash described hearing explosion and seeing plane in flames as it went down of 140 witnesses interviewed 99 reported seeing an aircraft or a flaming object in sky seven witnesses stated that they saw lightning strike aircraft seventy two witnesses said ball of fire occurred at same time or immediately after lightning strike twenty three witnesses reported that aircraft exploded after they saw plane on fire aircraft aircraft involved was a boeing 707 121 registered with tail number n709pa named clipper tradewind it was oldest aircraft in u s commercial jet fleet at time of crash it had been delivered to pan am on 27 october 1958 and had flown a total of 14 609 hours it was powered by four pratt whitney 6 turbojet engines at time of accident aircraft was estimated to have a book value of 3 400 000 nearly five years earlier in 1959 same aircraft had been involved in an incident when right outboard engine had been torn from wing during a training flight in france plane entered a sudden spin during a demonstration of aircraft s minimum control speed and aerodynamic forces caused engine to break away pilot regained control of aircraft and landed safely in london using remaining three engines detached engine fell into a field on a farm southwest of paris where flight had originated with no injuries passengers and crew plane carried 73 passengers who all died in crash all passengers were residents of united states pilot of plane was george f knuth 45 of long island he had flown for pan am for 22 years and had accumulated 17 049 hours of flying experience including 2 890 in boeing 707 he had been involved in another incident in 1949 when as pilot of pan am flight 100 a lockheed constellation in flight over port washington new york a cessna 140 single engine airplane crashed into his plane two occupants of cessna were killed in accident but captain knuth was able to land safely with no injuries to crew or passengers of pan am flight first officer of flight was john r dale 48 of long island he had a total of 13 963 hours of flying time of which 2 681 were in boeing 707 second officer was paul l age 42 of new rochelle new york he had 10 008 hours of flying experience including 2 808 in boeing 707 aircraft flight engineer was john r of long island he had a total flying time of 6 066 hours including 76 hours in boeing 707 investigation thumb a cab engineer examines badly damaged flight recorder of pan am flight 214 thumb diagram showing flight 214 s fuel tank layout civil aeronautics board cab assigned more than a dozen investigators within an hour of crash they were assisted by investigators from boeing company pan american world airways air line pilots association pratt whitney federal bureau of investigation and federal aviation agency costs of investigations by cab at time rarely exceeded 10 000 but agency would spend about 125 000 investigating this crash in addition to money spent by boeing federal aviation administration faa engine manufacturer and other aircraft parts suppliers on additional investigations initial theories of cause of crash focused on possibility that plane had experienced severe turbulence in flight that had caused a fuel tank or fuel line to rupture leading to an in flight fire from leaking fuel u s house representative samuel s stratton of schenectady new york sent a telegram to federal aviation administration urging them to restrict jet operations in turbulent weather but faa responded that it saw no pattern that suggested need for such restrictions and boeing company concurred other possibilities of cause of crash included sabotage or that aircraft had been hit by lightning but by nightfall after first day investigators had not found evidence of either there was also some speculation that metal fatigue as a result of aircraft s 1959 incident could be involved in crash but aircraft had gone through four separate maintenance overhauls since accident without any issues being detected investigators rapidly located flight data recorder but it was badly damaged in crash built to withstand an impact 100 times as strong as force of gravity it had been subjected to a force of 200 times force of gravity and its tape appeared to be hopelessly damaged alan s boyd chairman of cab told reporters shortly after accident it was so compacted there is no way to tell at this time whether we can derive any useful information from it eventually investigators were able to extract data from 95 percent of tape that had been in recorder recovery of wreckage took place over a period of 12 days and 16 truckloads of debris was taken to bolling air force base in washington d c for investigators to examine and reassemble investigators revealed that there was evidence of a fire that occurred in flight and one commented that it was nearly certain that there had been an explosion of some kind before it crashed eyewitness testimony later confirmed that plane had been burning on its way down to crash site within days investigators reported that it was apparent that crash had been caused by an explosion that had blown off one of wing tips of airplane wing tip had been found about from crash site bearing burn marks and bulging from an apparent internal explosive force remnants of of wing tip had been found at various points along flight path short of impact crater investigators revealed that it was unlikely that rough turbulence had caused crash because crews of other aircraft that had been circling in area reported that air was relatively smooth at time they also said that plane would have had to dive a considerable distance before aerodynamic forces would have caused it to break up and explode but it was apparent that aircraft had caught fire near its cruising altitude of 5 000 feet before this flight there had been no other known case of lightning causing a plane to crash despite many instances of planes being struck investigators found that on average each airplane is struck by lightning once or twice a year scientists and airline industry representatives vigorously disputed theory that lightning could have caused aircraft to explode calling it improbable closest example of such an instance occurred near milan italy in june 1959 where a lockheed l 1049 super constellation crashed as a result of static electricity igniting fuel vapor coming from fuel vents despite opposition investigators found multiple lightning strike marks on left wing tip and a large area of damage that extended along rear edge of wing leading investigators to believe that lightning was cause cab launched an urgent research program in an attempt to identify conditions in which fuel vapors in wings could have been ignited by lightning within a week of crash faa issued an order requiring installation of static electricity dischargers on approximately 100 boeing jet airliners that had not already been equipped with them aviation industry representatives were critical of order saying there was no evidence that dischargers would have any beneficial effect since they were never designed to handle effects of lightning and they said order would create a false impression that risk of lightning strikes had been resolved cab conducted a public hearing in philadelphia in february 1964 as part of their investigation experts had still not concluded that lightning had caused accident but they were investigating different ways lightning could have triggered explosion faa said that it was going to conduct research to determine relative safety of two types of jet fuel used in united states both of which were present in fuel tanks of flight 214 criticism of jp 4 jet fuel that had been present in tanks centered around fact that its vapors can be easily ignited at low temperatures encountered in flight jp 4 advocates countered that it was as safe or safer than kerosene other fuel used in jets at time pan american world airways conducted a flight test in a boeing 707 to investigate whether fuel could leak from tank venting system during a test flight that attempted to simulate moderate to rough turbulence in flight test did not reveal any fuel discharge but there was evidence that fuel had entered vent system collected in surge tanks and returned to fuel tanks pan american said that it would test a new system to inject inert gas into air spaces above fuel tanks in aircraft in an attempt to reduce risk of hazardous fuel air mixtures that could ignite on march 3 1965 cab released final accident report investigators concluded that a lightning strike had ignited fuel air mixture in number 1 reserve fuel tank which had caused an explosive disintegration of left outer wing leading to a loss of control despite one of most intensive research efforts in its history agency could not identify exact mechanics of how fuel had ignited concluding that lightning had ignited vapors through an as yet unknown pathway board said it is felt that current state of art does not permit an extension of test results to unqualified conclusions of all aspects of natural lightning effects need for additional research is recognized and additional programming is planned legacy crash of pan am flight 214 called attention to fact that there were previously unknown risks to aircraft in flight from lightning strikes one month after crash faa formed a technical committee on lightning protection for fuel systems with experts from faa cab other government agencies and lightning experts committee made commitments to conduct both long range and short range studies of hazards of lightning on fuel systems of aircraft and how to defeat those hazards in 1967 faa updated airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes with requirements that fuel systems of aircraft must be designed to prevent ignition of fuel vapor within system by lightning strikes and published guidance related to that requirement additional requirements to protect aircraft from lightning were enacted in 1970 many aircraft design improvements emerged as a result of new guidelines and regulations there was increased attention to electrical bonding of components installed in outer surfaces of fuel tanks located in wings such as fuel filler caps drain valves and access panels to surrounding structures fuel vent flame were added to aircraft to detect and extinguish fuel vapors that had ignited at fuel vent outlets thickness of aluminum surfaces of wings was thickened in order to reduce chances that a lightning strike could cause a complete melt through of wing surface into internal components of wings see also flight 508 another accident caused by a lightning strike twa flight 800 aircraft accident caused by ignition of fuel vapors references external links
