louse plural lice is common name for members of order phthiraptera which contains nearly 5 000 species of wingless insect lice are obligate parasites living externally on warm blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal except for monotremes pangolins and bats lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus chewing lice live among hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris while sucking lice pierce host s skin and feed on blood and other secretions they usually spend their whole life on a single host cementing their eggs called nits to hairs or feathers eggs hatch into nymphs which moult three times before becoming fully grown a process that takes about four weeks humans host two species of louse head louse and body louse are subspecies of pediculus humanus pubic louse pthirus pubis body louse has smallest genome of any known insect it has been used as a model organism and has been subject of much research lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least middle ages they appear in folktales songs such as kilkenny louse house and novels such as james joyce s finnegans wake they commonly feature in psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis a louse was one of early subjects of microscopy appearing in robert hooke s 1667 book micrographia morphology and diversity humans host three different kinds of lice head lice body lice and pubic lice lice infestations can be controlled with lice combs and medicated shampoos or washes sucking lice are small wingless insects ranging from in length they have narrow heads and oval flattened bodies they have no ocelli and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent their antennae are short with three to five segments and their mouth parts which are retractable into their head are adapted for piercing and sucking there is a cibarial pump at start of gut it is powered by muscles attached to inside of cuticle of head mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside proboscis containing a salivary canal ventrally and a food canal dorsally thoracic segments are fused abdominal segments are separate and there is a single large claw at tip of each of six legs chewing lice are also flattened and can be slightly larger than sucking lice ranging in length from they are similar to sucking lice in form but head is wider than thorax and all species have compound eyes there are no ocelli and mouthparts are adapted for chewing antennae have three to five segments and are slender in suborder ischnocera but club shaped in suborder amblycera legs are short and robust and terminated by one or two claws many lice are specific to a single species of host and have co evolved with it they are usually cryptically coloured to match fur or feathers of host lice are divided into two groups sucking lice which obtain their nourishment from feeding on sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host and chewing lice which are scavengers feeding on skin fragments of feathers or hair and debris found on host s body most are found on only specific types of animals and in some cases on only a particular part of body some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species although one to three is typical for mammals and two to six for birds for example in humans different species of louse inhabit scalp and pubic hair lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in in their bodies these may assist in digestion because if insect is deprived of them it will die if their host dies lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt to find a new host a louse s color varies from pale beige to dark gray however if feeding on blood it may become considerably darker female lice are usually more common than males and some species are parthenogenetic with young developing from unfertilized eggs a louse s egg is commonly called a nit many lice attach their eggs to their hosts hair with specialized saliva saliva hair bond is very difficult to sever without specialized products lice inhabiting birds however may simply leave their eggs in parts of body inaccessible to preening such as interior of feather shafts living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish whereas dead louse eggs are yellower lice are being born as miniature versions of adult known as nymphs young moult three times before reaching final adult form usually within a month after hatching ecology average number of lice per host tends to be higher in large bodied bird species than in small ones lice have an aggregated distribution across bird individuals i e most lice live on a few birds while most birds are relatively free of lice this pattern is more pronounced in territorial than in colonial more social bird species host organisms that dive under water to feed on aquatic prey harbor fewer taxa of lice bird taxa that are capable of exerting stronger defense such as stronger t cell immune response or larger glands harbor more taxa of lice than others reductions in size of host populations may cause a long lasting reduction of louse taxonomic richness for example birds introduced into new zealand host fewer species of lice there than in europe louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female biased in less social hosts presumably due to stronger isolation among louse subpopulations living on separate birds in latter case extinction of a species results in extinction of its host specific lice host switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes lice may reduce host life expectancy if infestation is heavy but most seem to have little effect on their host habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably an attempt by birds to rid themselves of lice lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically lice may reduce thermoregulation effect of plumage thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others lice infestation is a disadvantage in context of sexual rivalry evolution classification order phthiraptera is clearly a monophyletic grouping united as members are by a number of derived features including their parasitism on warm blooded vertebrates and combination of their metathoracic ganglia with their abdominal ganglia to form a single ventral nerve junction order has traditionally been divided into two suborders sucking lice anoplura and chewing lice mallophaga however recent classifications suggest that mallophaga are paraphyletic and four suborders are now recognized anoplura sucking lice occurring on mammals exclusively parasites of elephants and warthogs ischnocera mostly avian chewing lice however one family parasitizes mammals amblycera a primitive suborder of chewing lice widespread on birds however they also live on south american and australian mammals nearly 5 000 species of louse have been identified about 4 000 being parasitic on birds and 800 on mammals lice are present on every continent in all habitats that their host animals and birds occupy they are found even in antarctic where penguins carry 15 species of lice in genera and phylogeny lice have been subject of significant dna research in 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera pediculus and pthirus head lice pediculus humanus capitis body lice pediculus humanus humanus and pubic lice pthirus pubis human head and body lice genus pediculus share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice while pubic lice genus pthirus share a common ancestor with gorilla lice using phylogenetic and analysis reed et al hypothesized that pediculus and pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic in other words two genera descended from same common ancestor age of divergence between pediculus and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6 7 million years ago which matches age predicted by chimpanzee hominid divergence because parasites rely on their hosts events are likely genetic evidence suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3 4 million years ago unlike genus pediculus divergence in pthirus does not match age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago reed et al propose a pthirus species host switch around 3 4 million years ago while it is difficult to determine if a switch occurred in evolutionary history this explanation is most parsimonious containing fewest evolutionary changes additionally dna differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80 000 and 170 000 years ago before leaving africa human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones head lice live and feed on scalp while body lice live on clothing and feed on body because body lice require clothing to survive divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides an estimate of date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history mitochondrial genome of human species of body louse pediculus humanus humanus head louse pediculus humanus capitis and pubic louse pthirus pubis fragmented into a number of at least seven million years ago analysis of mitochondrial dna in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in african than in non african lice human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in prehistory dominating theory of anthropologists regarding human migration is out of africa hypothesis genetic diversity accumulates over time and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate because there is more genetic diversity in african lice lice and their human hosts must have existed in africa before anywhere else phylogeny of phthiraptera is shown not

lice have been intimately associated with human society throughout history in middle ages they were essentially ubiquitous at death of thomas becket archbishop of canterbury in 1170 it was recorded that vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron and onlookers burst into alternate weeping and laughing a mediaeval treatment for lice was an ointment made from pork grease incense lead and aloe robert hooke s 1667 book micrographia or some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses with observations and inquiries thereupon illustrated a human louse drawn as
