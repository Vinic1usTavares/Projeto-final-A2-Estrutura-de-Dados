over 2 3 million times and setting a record for most data transferred by a single torrent in only three months technical difficulties several gaming and technology sites reported an overheating bug with starcraft ii that in some cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards source of problem is fact that frame rate is not locked on menu screens this causes graphics card to continuously render image resulting in excessive heat blizzard has acknowledged problem and posted a temporary workaround they also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting manufacturer for hardware related issues in response to reports blizzard s public relations manager bob said there is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat when we saw this issue first reported we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem cause is most likely hardware related has also suggested that problem is not with starcraft ii but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling they do however agree that overheating only occurs on non framerate locked screens and provide fix that blizzard has offered to users other articles recommend that users regularly clean dust out of their computer to improve cooling efficiency of their systems blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding issue that has since been removed message was screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient this is because game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing screen very quickly reception starcraft ii wings of liberty has been met with critical acclaim since its release it received an aggregated score of 92 39 at gamerankings and 93 100 at metacritic game was particularly praised for retaining popular rts gameplay from starcraft while introducing new features and improved storytelling gamesradar felt that in many ways starcraft ii wings of liberty feels like starcraft 2 0 and that s a good thing stating that it delivers on all fronts com said game was best rts game released in years and one of best games on pc in relation to its story gametrailers stated if there s anything immediately apparent from wings of liberty s story it s that series narrative structure has evolved well beyond original s sparse between sortie intermissions calling it an epic and entertainingly told yarn while eurogamer criticized dialogue as being flat and characters as being either cliched banal or both giant bomb echoed this view while also noting hyperion portion between missions finding it to have more depth of character more believable pathos more surprise twists than i honestly expected out of story ign however noted that no doubt franchise fans will eat it up but newcomers may be wondering what all fuss is about while going through early missions that lack kind of urgency you would hope when fate of civilization is in peril joystiq was very positive towards improved multiplayer matchmaking service calling it similar to xbox live and playstation network which is a welcome change from archaic matchmaking of battle net in previous blizzard games while gamespot called amount of online content remarkable noting variety of maps and up to 12 player online support when comparing single and multiplayer modes gamespy felt that single player portion was less inspiring mostly because of extremely shallow learning curve with online multiplayer being so smooth so challenging and so much plain old fun john meyer of wired praised improved graphics engine saying that it shows decades of polish and a slick new presentation matt peckham of pc world also noted that some buyers expressed dissatisfaction with absence of lan based multiplayer gameplay lack of cross realm play and campaign being limited to terran race game revolution in relation to only being able to play terran campaign however pointed out that wings of liberty has 29 missions original starcraft had just over 30 fair odds say next one will have roughly same amount brought about 30 too we already got full game for 50 and we re getting offered two expansions if you want to feel outraged about something pick something else ars technica gave overall game a verdict of buy and especially praised single player campaign as fun as hell they were also very impressed with game modding tools that allow users to create their own content and distribute it to other fans two ugly issues they identified with game were lack of lan play and decision to split up regions they suggested that these decisions were influenced by activision rather than by game designers at blizzard and felt that this would turn many people off of game and make things difficult for people who have international friends in a separate article ars technica vigorously supported starcraft ii against a series of 1 star ratings given to game on amazon com in protest against lack of lan play they argued in blizzard s defense against complaints that it was not a full game because only terran campaign was released but did suggest that customers

starcraft ii does not offer ability to play directly over a local area network lan as is possible with starcraft all network games are routed through internet via blizzard s gaming servers latency
