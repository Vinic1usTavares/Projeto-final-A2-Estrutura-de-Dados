united states assay commission was an agency of united states government from 1792 to 1980 its function was to supervise annual testing of gold silver and in its final years base metal coins produced by united states mint to ensure that they met specifications although some members were designated by statute for most part commission which was freshly appointed each year consisted of prominent americans including numismatists appointment to assay commission was eagerly sought after in part because commissioners received a commemorative medal these medals different each year are extremely rare with exception of 1977 issue which was sold to general public mint act of 1792 authorized assay commission beginning in 1797 it met in most years at philadelphia mint each year president of united states appointed unpaid members who would gather in philadelphia to ensure weight and fineness of silver and gold coins issued previous year were to specifications in 1971 commission met but for first time had no gold or silver to test with end of silver coinage beginning in 1977 president jimmy carter appointed no members of public to commission and in 1980 he signed legislation abolishing it history founding and early days 1792 1873 in january 1791 treasury secretary alexander hamilton submitted a report to congress proposing establishment of a mint hamilton concluded his report in response to hamilton s report congress passed mint act of 1792 in addition to setting standards for new nation s coinage congress provided for an american version of british trial of pyx following january congress passed legislation changing date on which designated officials met to second monday in february meetings did not take place immediately mint was not yet striking gold or silver minting of silver began in 1794 and gold in 1795 and some coins were saved for assay first mint document mentioning assay pieces is from january 1796 and indicates that exactly 80 in silver had been put aside first assay commissioners did not meet until monday march 20 1797 a month later than prescribed date once they did annual meetings took place each year until 1980 except in 1817 as there had been no gold or silver struck since last meeting until 1837 commission examined coins since last testing rather than for a particular calendar year thumb left 325px inscription on cover of a mint journal for coins set aside for assay commission in 1801 usual meeting was delayed causing mint director elias boudinot to complain to president john adams that depositors were anxious for an audit so mint could release coins struck from their bullion numismatist fred reed suggested that delay was probably due to poor weather making it difficult for officials to travel from new capital of washington d c to philadelphia for assay in response on march 3 1801 congress changed designation of officials required to attend to district judge of pennsylvania attorney for united states in district of pennsylvania and commissioner of loans for state of pennsylvania meeting finally took place on april 27 1801 1806 and 1815 sessions were delayed because of outbreaks of disease in philadelphia one in 1812 was held a month late because of a heavy snowstorm which prevented commissioners from reaching mint no meeting took place in 1817 a fire had damaged philadelphia mint in january 1816 and no gold or silver awaited commission in 1818 congress substituted collector of port of philadelphia for pennsylvania loans commissioner as a member of assay commission with coinage act of 1834 congress removed automatic disqualification of mint officers in event of an unfavorable assay leaving decision to president mint act of 1837 established assay commission in form it would have for most of remainder of its existence it provided that an annual trial shall be made of pieces reserved for this purpose i e set aside for assay at mint and its branches before judge of district court of united states for eastern district of pennsylvania attorney of united states for eastern district of pennsylvania and collector of port of philadelphia and such other persons as president shall from time to time designate for that purpose who shall meet as commissioners for performance of this duty on second monday in february annually usual procedure for members of public to be named to commission after public appointments began was for mint director to send president a list of candidates for his approval according to jesse p watson in his monograph on bureau of mint admission of members of public to assay commission meant that permanency and high official dignity were no longer characteristic of commission in 1861 as american civil war broke out north carolina joined confederate states charlotte mint taken over by confederacy eventually closed as dies that had been shipped from philadelphia mint wore out and it could obtain no more nevertheless 12 half eagles 5 gold coins were sent from charlotte to philadelphia through enemy lines in october 1861 they were duly tested by 1862 assay commission and were found to be correct in 1864 with metal nickel used in cent in short supply mint director james pollock asked that year s commission to opine on a substitute for copper nickel used in cent members endorsed french bronze 95 copper and 5 tin or zinc as a metal to be used in cent and a proposed two cent piece pollock sent conclusions to treasury secretary salmon p chase who forwarded them and draft legislation to maine senator william p fessenden

relating to coinage and mint and retired several denominations including two cent piece act also changed officers required to serve on assay commission act also required mint to put aside one of every thousand gold coins struck and one of every two thousand silver coins for assay it provided procedure for putting coins aside sealing them in envelopes and placing them in a pyx to be opened by assay commissioners 1881 assay commission found that approximately 3 000 silver dollars struck at carson city mint 1881 cc had been struck in 892 silver rather than legally mandated 900 it is unclear if treasury took any steps to attempt to recover issued pieces 1885 commission detected a single silver dollar which was 1 51 grains 0 098 g below specifications permitted tolerance being in 1921 assay commission found that some coins struck at denver mint were struck in 905 or 906 silver above legal 900 by more than permitted tolerance investigation found that ingots which had been rejected and

struck and by 1941 many reserved coins could not be kept in pyx instead being placed in packing boxes overflowing with sealed envelopes by late 1940s more than ten million coins were being struck each day at philadelphia alone in 1947 congress reduced number of silver coins required to be put aside for assay from one in 2 000 to one in 10 000 this was done at urging of department of treasury as having to store so many assay coins was a burden to mint and it felt that number of coins available to commission would still be sufficient final years and abolition 1950 1980 thumb right mint director nellie tayloe ross addresses 1952 assay commissioners by 1950s there was considerable competition among numismatists to be appointed an assay commissioner appointees received no compensation but appointment was prestigious and carried with it a prized assay medal procedure was changed so that mint director submitted names of more individuals than would actually be appointed to white house where final choices were made it remained possible for director to ask for special consideration for certain individuals later nominations were also screened by federal bureau of investigation and by irs mint director received nominations for assay commissioner from legislators political organizations government officials and from members of public in 1971 for first time assay commission had no silver coins to test none were struck by mint for circulation in 1970 although part silver kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970 they were only for collectors and were not put aside for assay commissioners could instead test 21 975 dimes and 11 098 quarters all made from copper nickel clad though as associated press reporting on 1973 assay commission put it a discovery of a bum coin hasn t occurred in years only one in every 100 000 clad or silver clad pieces was put aside for assay commission and only one in every 200 000 dimes at 1974 meeting one copper nickel eisenhower dollar was discovered which weighed below specification after reference to rules coin was deemed barely within guidelines numismatist charles logan in his 1979 article about impending end of assay commission stated that this incident pointed out basic problem with annual trial first members were not exactly sure how their job was done or what requirements were second they really did not want to report a fault in coinage finally even if one dollar coin had been found faulty it would have had little consequence except to prompt greater vigilance at mint thumb left elongated coin for leonard w stark coin dealer and 1963 assay commissioner in early 1977 outgoing mint director mary brooks sent a list of 117 nominees to new president jimmy carter from which it was expected that about two or three dozen names would be selected carter refused to make any public appointments feeling assay commission was unneeded given that mint performed same work through routine internal checks and that 2 500 appropriated each year was a poor use of taxpayer money only government members served on assay commission in 1977 1980 even so hundreds of numismatists applied to be on 1978 commission carter made no appointments that year only members were those designated by statute 1979 meeting attended by government employed commission members and mint director stella hackel sims was held eight days late on february 22 due to schedule conflicts in june 1979 carter s presidential reorganization project recommended abolition of assay commission and two other small agencies report estimated that having an assay commission cost federal government about 20 000 and that work was done better by vending machine manufacturers to avoid having their machines jam in august columnist jack anderson deemed commission an example of wasteful spending in washington characterizing its activities more than a decade ago government stopped putting either gold or silver in its coins but commission continues to hold its annual luncheon meeting solemnly commissioners measure amounts of metals in u s coins and strike a medal to commemorate their activities this useless exercise costs taxpayers about 20 000 a year as coin collector and columnist gary palmer put it in 1979 who really cares if weight of a nickel quarter is off by a grain or two on march 14 1980 carter approved legislation abolishing assay commission as well as other two agencies as recommended by his reorganization project president wrote in a signing statement that with end of gold and silver coinage need for commission had diminished numismatic leaders objected to ending of commission considering expense small and tradition worth keeping although they concurred commission had become an anachronism at time of its abolition assay commission was oldest existing government commission in 2000 and 2001 new jersey congressman steven rothman introduced legislation to revive assay commission stating that re establishing commission would assure public confidence in gold silver and platinum bullion coins struck by mint bills died in committee functions and activities thumb 250px mint director nellie tayloe ross left looks on as two members of 1942 assay commission weigh a coin general function of assay commission was to examine gold and silver coins of mint and ensure they met proper specifications assay commissioners were placed on one of three committees in most years counting weighing and assaying committees counting committee verified that number of each type of coin in packets selected from pyx matched what mint records said should be there weighing committee measured weight of coins from pyx checking them against weight required by law assaying committee worked with philadelphia mint s assayer as he measured precious metal content of some of coins in some years there was a committee on resolutions in 1912 it urged that a leaflet be published for visitors to mint s coin collection and that a medal be struck to commemorate collection full assay commission adopted that committee s report congress in 1828 had required that weights kept by mint director be tested for accuracy in presence of assay commissioners each year by statute passed in 1911 commission was required to inspect weights and balances used in assaying at philadelphia mint and to report on their accuracy this included government s official standard pound weight that had been brought from united kingdom according to a description of 1948 meeting silver coins selected for assay were first placed between steel rollers until thickness was reduced to and then were chopped into fine pieces and dissolved in nitric acid fineness of silver in coin could be determined by amount of salt solution needed to precipitate all silver in liquid numismatist francis described work of assay commission commission operated under rules first adopted by 1856 commission and then passed down year to year and amendable by any assay commission although in practice little change was made under rules director of mint called assay commissioners to order then introduced federal judge who was an ex officio member who presided over meetings if judge was absent members elected a chairman chairman divided members into committees if there had been a change of officers at a mint commissioners examined coins from before and after after committees completed their work members re assembled to report their findings and to vote on their report every assay commission passed coinage that it was called upon to examine if pieces varying from standard were found that was also noted 1885 assay commission reported one substandard silver coin which came from carson city mint but urged president to take no action noting that coin was underweight by an amount too small to be measured by scales at carson city remains of coins used in assay were melted by mint those put aside for assay commission that were not used were placed in circulation from philadelphia and were not marked or distinguished in any way there were thousands of coins for commission of which only a few were assayed commissioners often purchased some of remaining pieces as souvenirs although commemorative coins could not be purchased if congress had given exclusive right to sell them to a sponsoring organization they were instead destroyed commissioners thumb upright charles g dawes was an assay commissioner in 1899 and 1900 he later became vice president appointments of members of public to assay commission by president are known to have been made as early as 1841 final ones were made in 1976 many early commissioners were chosen for their scientific or intellectual attainments such qualifications were not required of later public appointees who included such prominent figures as ellin berlin wife of songwriter irving berlin first women to be appointed to assay commission were mrs kellogg fairbanks of chicago and mrs b b munford of richmond virginia both in 1920 recordholder for service as a commissioner is herbert gray torrey 36 times an assay commissioner between 1874 and 1910 missing only 1879 by virtue of his office as assayer of new york assay office recordholder as a presidential appointee is dr james lewis howe head of department of chemistry at washington and lee university 18 times an assay commissioner serving in 1907 and then each year from 1910 to 1926 an employee of national bureau of standards was included in presidential appointments each year he brought with him weights used in assay which were checked by agency in advance although no future president served as an assay commissioner comptroller of currency charles g dawes was a commissioner in 1899 and 1900 he was vice president of united states from 1925 to 1929 among those appointed was coin collector and congressman william a ashbrook 14 times an assay commissioner between 1908 and 1934 ashbrook s presence on 1934 assay commission has led to speculation that he might have used his position as an assay commissioner he left congress in 1921 to secure one or more 1933 saint gaudens double eagles almost all of which were melted due to end of gold coinage for circulation assay commissioners were traditionally allowed to purchase coins from pyx that were not assayed and numismatic historian roger burdette speculates that ashbrook generally well treated by treasury department due to his onetime congressional position might have exchanged other gold pieces for 1933 coins thumb left members of 1942 commission ensure proper number of coins are there three known specimens of 1873 cc quarter without arrows by date and only known dime of that description may have been salvaged from assay pieces as remainder of those coins had been ordered melted as underweight a similar mystery attends 1894 barber dime struck at san francisco 1894 s of which published mintage is 24 although it is not certain whether this total includes one sent to philadelphia to await 1895 assay commission fact that one of 1895 assay commissioners was robert barnett chief clerk of san francisco mint has led numismatic writers nancy oliver and richard kelly to speculate that he may have been made an assay commissioner in order to retrieve dime 1895 assay commission report confirms that dime was there as it was counted by counting committee dime is not mentioned as having been either weighed or assayed oliver and kelly in a may 2011 article in numismatist suggest that barnett used that privilege of assay commissioners to obtain rarity he is not known however to have written or spoken of matter before his murder in 1904 in 1964 former assay commissioners formed old time assay commissioners society otacs when president carter stopped appointing public members to commission in 1977 otacs fundraised in an unsuccessful attempt to induce government to continue that tradition society met annually

snowden initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to assay commissioners but to advertise mint s medal striking capabilities nascent custom lapsed when snowden left office in 1861 numismatists r w julian and ernest e in their work on assay commission medals theorize that resumption of assay commission medal striking in 1867 was at request of mint engraver

officeholders designated by mint act of 1792 no assay took place until 1797 by which time all three had left those offices there was no specially designed medal in 1954 instead assay commissioners who
