tropical depression ten was a short lived tropical cyclone that made landfall on florida panhandle in september 2007 system developed as a subtropical depression on september 21 in northeastern gulf of mexico from interaction of a tropical wave tail end of a cold front and an upper level low initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over center tracking northwestward depression moved ashore near fort walton beach early on september 22 and dissipated over southeastern alabama shortly thereafter initially depression was forecast to move ashore as a minimal tropical storm and threat of depression prompted state of emergency declarations in mississippi and louisiana it was first tropical cyclone to threaten new orleans area since hurricane katrina and destructive 2005 hurricane season overall impact from cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall however precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in eustis florida where 20 houses were destroyed and 30 more were damaged meteorological history tropical depression ten formed from complex interaction between an upper level low a tropical wave that produced tropical storm ingrid and tail end of a cold front by september 17 system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over bahamas and western atlantic ocean upper level low over florida panhandle increased convection across area and on september 18 system began crossing florida initially very disorganized surface pressures gradually decreased across region with a weak low pressure area developing on september 19 a reconnaissance aircraft flight into system on september 20 reported a well defined low and strong wind gusts in squalls as system tracked into northeastern gulf of mexico along with limited and disorganized thunderstorm activity convection gradually became better organized with a well defined band in its eastern semicircle and intermittent thunderstorm activity near center despite an overall disorganized structure with a poorly defined circulation and an upper level low aloft national hurricane center initiated advisories on subtropical depression ten at 1500 utc on september 21 while it was located about south of st vincent island florida citing potential for additional development right along coastline in post analysis it was classified a subtropical cyclone three hours earlier with a mid level ridge to its northwest subtropical depression was anticipated to parallel coastline of gulf coast of united states as a result it was forecast to attain winds of and move ashore along southern mississippi circulation became better defined as convection modestly increased over center and within six hours of its development system transitioned into a tropical depression cyclone continued tracking northwestward making landfall around 0000 utc on september 22 near fort walton beach florida with winds of cloud pattern deteriorated as it tracked inland and 3 hours after it moved ashore national hurricane center issued its last advisory on depression as depression tracked into alabama it became increasingly disorganized and system dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on september 22 its remnant surface low continued west northwest before dissipating near louisiana texas border early on september 23 preparations and impact right thumb tornado damage in eustis florida thumb right total rainfall from depression combination of wind shear and low level helicity produced moderate convection across central florida in association with precursor low pressure system late on september 20 a supercell developed near lake and tracking quickly northward it spawned an ef1 tornado near eustis tornado tracked for and reached winds of about tornado destroyed 20 homes left 30 others severely damaged injured one person and caused power outages for about 300 people damage totaled 6 2 million 2007 usd tornadoes were also reported near marianna and chipley precursor low pressure system also generated lightning that struck and killed a man in hendry county florida outer
