justice was a pre dreadnought battleship built for french navy in mid 1900s she was second member of which included three other vessels and was a derivative of preceding with primary difference being inclusion of a heavier secondary battery justice carried a main battery of four guns like republique but mounted ten guns for her secondary armament in place of guns of earlier vessels like many late pre dreadnought designs justice was completed after revolutionary british battleship had entered service rendering her obsolescent on entering service justice became flagship of 2nd division of mediterranean squadron based in toulon she immediately began normal peacetime training routine of squadron and fleet maneuvers and cruises to various ports in mediterranean she also participated in

escort troopship convoys carrying elements of french army from french north africa to face germans invading northern france she thereafter steamed to contain austro hungarian navy in adriatic sea taking part in minor battle of antivari in august increasing threat of austro hungarian u boats and unwillingness of austro hungarian fleet to engage in battle led to a period of monotonous patrols that ended with italy s entry into war on side of france which allowed french fleet to be withdrawn in mid 1916 she became involved in events in greece being stationed in salonika to put pressure on greek government to enter war on side of allies but she saw little action for final two years of war immediately after end of war she was sent to black sea first to oversee surrender of german

served in this capacity only briefly however and was placed in reserve in april 1920 decommissioned in march 1921 and sold for scrap in december design thumb left line drawing of liberte class liberte class battleships were originally intended to be part of but construction of british s with their heavy secondary battery of guns prompted french naval general staff to request that last four republiques be redesigned to include a heavier secondary battery in response ironically designer louis emile bertin had proposed such an armament for republique class but general staff had rejected it since larger guns had a lower rate of fire than smaller guns that had been selected for republique design because ships were broadly similar apart from their armament libertes are sometimes considered to be a sub class of republique type justice was long overall and had a beam of and an average draft of she displaced up to at full load battleship was powered by three vertical triple expansion steam engines with twenty four niclausse boilers they were rated at and provided a top speed of coal storage amounted to which provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of she had a crew of 32

protected by up to of armor on fronts of turrets while secondary turrets had of armor on faces casemates were protected with of steel plate conning tower had thick sides modifications tests to determine whether main battery turrets could be modified to increase elevation of guns and hence their range proved to be impossible but navy determined that tanks on either side of vessel could be flooded to induce a heel of 2 degrees this increased maximum range of guns from new motors were installed in secondary turrets in 1915 1916 to improve their training and elevation rates also in 1915 47 mm guns located on either side of bridge were removed and two on aft superstructure were moved to roof of rear turret on 8 december 1915 naval command issued orders that light battery was to be revised to eight of 47 mm guns and ten guns light battery was revised again in 1916 with four 47 mm guns being converted with high angle anti aircraft mounts they were placed atop rear main battery
