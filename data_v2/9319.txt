william wilberforce 24 august 1759 29 july 1833 was a british politician philanthropist and a leader of movement to abolish slave trade a native of kingston upon hull yorkshire he began his political career in 1780 eventually becoming an independent member of parliament mp for yorkshire 1784 1812 in 1785 he became an evangelical christian which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform in 1787 he came into contact with thomas clarkson and a group of anti slave trade activists including granville sharp hannah more and charles middleton they persuaded wilberforce to take on cause of abolition and he soon became one of leading english abolitionists he headed parliamentary campaign against british slave trade for twenty years until passage of slave trade act of 1807 wilberforce was convinced of importance of religion morality and education he championed causes and campaigns such as society for suppression of vice british missionary work in india creation of a free colony in sierra leone foundation of church mission society and society for prevention of cruelty to animals his underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for enslaved abroad in later years wilberforce supported campaign for complete abolition of slavery and continued his involvement after 1826 when he resigned from parliament because of his failing health that campaign led to slavery abolition act 1833 which abolished slavery in most of british empire wilberforce died just three days after hearing that passage of act through parliament was assured he was buried in westminster abbey close to his friend william pitt younger early life and education wilberforce was born in a house on high street of hull in east riding of yorkshire england on 24 august 1759 only son of robert wilberforce 1728 1768 a wealthy merchant and his wife elizabeth bird 1730 1798 his grandfather william 1690 1774 or 1776 had made family fortune in maritime trade with baltic countries lead cotton tools and cutlery were among more frequent exports from

began attending hull grammar school which at time was headed by a young dynamic headmaster joseph milner who was to become a lifelong friend wilberforce profited from supportive atmosphere at school until death of his father in 1768 caused changes in his living arrangements with his mother struggling to cope nine year old wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both st james place london and wimbledon at that time a village south west of london he attended an indifferent boarding school in putney for two years he spent his holidays in wimbledon where he grew extremely fond of his relatives he became interested in evangelical christianity due to his relatives influence especially that of his aunt hannah sister of wealthy christian merchant john thornton a philanthropist and a supporter of leading methodist preacher george whitefield wilberforce s staunchly church of england mother and grandfather alarmed at these nonconformist influences and at his leanings towards evangelicalism brought 12 year old boy back to hull in 1771 wilberforce was heartbroken at being separated from his aunt and uncle his family opposed a return to hull grammar school because headmaster had become a methodist and wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby pocklington school from 1771 to 1776 influenced by methodist scruples he initially resisted hull s lively social life but as his religious fervour diminished he embraced theatre going attended balls and played cards in october 1776 at age of 17 wilberforce went up to st john s college cambridge deaths of his grandfather and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study instead he immersed himself in social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards gambling and late night drinking sessions although he found excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful witty generous and an excellent conversationalist wilberforce was a popular figure he made many friends including more studious future prime minister william pitt despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a b a in 1781 and an m a in 1788 early parliamentary career wilberforce began to consider a political career while still at university and during winter of 1779 1780 he and pitt frequently watched house of commons debates from gallery pitt already set on a political career encouraged wilberforce to join him in obtaining a parliamentary seat in september 1780 at age of twenty one and while still a student wilberforce was elected member of parliament mp for kingston upon hull spending over ps8 000 as was custom of time to ensure he received necessary votes free from financial pressures wilberforce sat as an independent resolving to be no party man criticised at times for inconsistency he supported both tory and whig governments according to his conscience working closely with party in power and voting on specific measures according to their merits wilberforce attended parliament regularly but he also maintained a lively social life becoming an of gentlemen s gambling clubs such as s and boodle s in pall mall london writer and socialite madame de stael described him as wittiest man in england and according to georgiana duchess of devonshire prince of wales said that he would go anywhere to hear wilberforce sing wilberforce used his speaking voice to great effect in political speeches diarist and author james boswell witnessed wilberforce s eloquence in house of commons and noted i saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon table but as i listened he grew and grew until shrimp became a whale during frequent government changes of 1781 1784 wilberforce supported his friend pitt in parliamentary debates in autumn 1783 pitt wilberforce and edward eliot later to become pitt s brother in law travelled to france for a six week holiday together after a difficult start in rheims where their presence aroused police suspicion that they were english spies they visited paris meeting benjamin franklin general lafayette marie antoinette and louis xvi and joined french court at fontainebleau pitt became prime minister in december 1783 with wilberforce a key supporter of his minority government despite their close friendship there is no record that pitt offered wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments this may have been due to wilberforce s wish to remain an independent mp alternatively wilberforce s frequent tardiness and disorganisation as well as chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible may have convinced pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material wilberforce never sought office and was never offered one when parliament was dissolved in spring of 1784 wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for county of yorkshire in 1784 general election on 6 april he was returned as mp for yorkshire at age of twenty four conversion in october 1784 wilberforce embarked upon a tour of europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career he travelled with his mother and sister in company of isaac milner brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster who had been fellow of queens college cambridge in year when wilberforce first went up they visited french riviera and enjoyed usual pastimes of dinners cards and gambling in february 1785 wilberforce returned to london temporarily to support pitt s proposals for parliamentary reforms he rejoined party in genoa italy from where they continued their tour to switzerland milner accompanied wilberforce to england and on journey they read rise and progress of religion in soul by philip doddridge a leading early 18th century english nonconformist thumb 240px left william wilberforce by john rising 1790 pictured at age of 29 after his earlier interest in evangelical religion when he was young wilberforce s journey to faith seems to have begun afresh at this time he started to rise early to read bible and pray and kept a private journal he underwent an evangelical conversion regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to service of god his conversion changed some of his habits but not his nature he remained outwardly cheerful interested and respectful tactfully urging others towards his new faith inwardly he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self critical harshly judging his spirituality use of time vanity self control and relationships with others at time religious enthusiasm was generally regarded as a social transgression and was stigmatised in polite society evangelicals in upper classes such as sir richard hill methodist mp for shropshire and selina hastings countess of huntingdon were exposed to contempt and ridicule and wilberforce s conversion led him to question whether he should remain in public life he sought guidance from john newton a leading evangelical anglican clergyman of day and rector of st mary woolnoth in city of london both newton and pitt counselled him to remain in politics and he resolved to do so with increased diligence and conscientiousness thereafter his political views were informed by his faith and by his desire to promote christianity and christian ethics in private and public life his views were often deeply conservative opposed to radical changes in a god given political and social order and focused on issues such as observance of sabbath and eradication of immorality through education and reform as a result he was often distrusted by progressive voices because of his conservatism and regarded with suspicion by many tories who saw evangelicals as radicals bent on overthrow of church and state in 1786 wilberforce leased a house in old palace yard westminster in order to be near parliament he began using his parliamentary position to advocate reform by introducing a registration bill proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures he brought forward a bill to extend measure permitting dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists arsonists and thieves bill also advocated reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason a crime that at time included a husband s murder house of commons passed both bills but they were defeated in house of lords abolition of slave trade initial decision british initially became involved in slave trade during 16th century by 1783 triangular route that took british made goods to africa to buy slaves transported enslaved to west indies and then brought slave grown products such as sugar tobacco and cotton to britain represented about 80 percent of great britain s foreign income british ships dominated trade supplying french spanish dutch portuguese and british colonies and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men women and children across atlantic in horrific conditions of middle passage of estimated 11 million africans transported into slavery about 1 4 million died during voyage british campaign to abolish slave trade is generally considered to have begun in 1780s with establishment of quakers anti slavery committees and their presentation to parliament of first slave trade petition in 1783 same year wilberforce while dining with his old cambridge friend gerard edwards met rev james ramsay a ship s surgeon who had become a clergyman on island of st christopher later st kitts in leeward islands and a medical supervisor of plantations there what ramsay had witnessed of conditions endured by slaves both at sea and on plantations horrified him returning to england after fifteen years he accepted living of teston kent in 1781 and there met sir charles middleton lady middleton thomas clarkson hannah more and others a group that later became known as testonites interested in promoting christianity and moral improvement in britain and overseas they were appalled by ramsay s reports of depraved lifestyles of slave owners cruel treatment meted out to enslaved and lack of christian instruction provided to slaves with their encouragement and help ramsay spent three years writing an essay on treatment and conversion of african slaves in british sugar colonies which was highly critical of slavery in west indies book published in 1784 was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest and it excited ire of west indian planters who in coming years attacked both ramsay and his ideas in a series of proslavery tracts thumb 300px right diagram of a slave ship brookes illustrating inhumane conditions aboard such vessels wilberforce apparently did not follow up on his meeting with ramsay however three years later and inspired by his new faith wilberforce was growing interested in humanitarian reform in november 1786 he received a letter from sir charles middleton that re opened his interest in slave trade at urging of lady middleton sir charles suggested that wilberforce bring forward abolition of slave trade in parliament wilberforce responded that he felt great importance of subject and thought himself unequal to task allotted to him but yet would not positively decline it he began to read widely on subject and met with testonites at middleton s home at barham court in teston in early winter of 1786 1787 in early 1787 thomas clarkson a fellow graduate of st john s cambridge who had become convinced of need to end slave trade after writing a prize winning essay on subject while at cambridge called upon wilberforce at old palace yard with a published copy of work this was first time two men had met their collaboration would last nearly fifty years clarkson began to visit wilberforce on a weekly basis bringing first hand evidence he had obtained about slave trade quakers already working for abolition also recognised need for influence within parliament and urged clarkson to secure a commitment from wilberforce to bring forward case for abolition in house of commons it was arranged that bennet langton a lincolnshire landowner and mutual acquaintance of wilberforce and clarkson would organize a dinner party in order to ask wilberforce formally to lead parliamentary campaign dinner took place on 13 march 1787 other guests included charles middleton sir joshua reynolds william windham mp james boswell and isaac hawkins browne mp by end of evening wilberforce had agreed in general terms that he would bring forward abolition of slave trade in parliament provided that no person more proper could be found same spring on 12 may 1787 still hesitant wilberforce held a conversation with william pitt and future prime minister william grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on pitt s estate in kent under what came to be known as wilberforce oak at pitt challenged his friend wilberforce why don t you give notice of a motion on subject of slave trade you have already taken great pains to collect evidence and are therefore fully entitled to credit which doing so will ensure you do not lose time or ground will be occupied by another wilberforce s response is not recorded but he later declared in old age that he could distinctly remember very knoll on which i was sitting near pitt and grenville where he made his decision wilberforce s involvement in abolition movement was motivated by a desire to put his christian principles into action and to serve god in public life he and other evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and un christian trade and greed and avarice of owners and traders wilberforce sensed a call from god writing in a journal entry in 1787 that god almighty has set before me two great objects suppression of slave trade and reformation of manners moral values conspicuous involvement of evangelicals in highly popular anti slavery movement served to improve status of a group otherwise associated with less popular campaigns against vice and immorality early parliamentary action on 22 may 1787 first meeting of society for effecting abolition of slave trade took place bringing like minded british quakers and anglicans together in same organisation for first time committee chose to campaign against slave trade rather than slavery itself with many members believing that slavery would eventually disappear as a natural consequence of abolition of trade wilberforce though involved informally did not join committee officially until 1791 thumb 200px left am i not a man and a brother medallion created as part of anti slavery campaign by josiah wedgwood 1787 society was highly successful in raising public awareness and support and local chapters sprang up throughout great britain clarkson travelled country researching and collecting first hand testimony and statistics while committee promoted campaign pioneering techniques such as lobbying writing pamphlets holding public meetings gaining press attention organising boycotts and even using a campaign logo an image of a kneeling slave above motto am i not a man and a brother designed by renowned pottery maker josiah wedgwood committee also sought to influence slave trading nations such as france spain portugal denmark holland and united states corresponding with anti slavery activists in other countries and organising translation of english language books and pamphlets these included books by former slaves ottobah cugoano and olaudah equiano who had published influential works on slavery and slave trade in 1787 and 1789 respectively they and other free blacks collectively known as sons of africa spoke at debating societies and wrote spirited letters to newspapers periodicals and prominent figures as well as public letters of support to campaign allies hundreds of parliamentary petitions opposing slave trade were received in 1788 and following years with hundreds of thousands of signatories in total campaign proved to be world s first grassroots human rights campaign in which men and women from different social classes and backgrounds volunteered to try to end injustices suffered by others wilberforce had planned to introduce a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for abolition of slave trade during 1789 parliamentary session however in january 1788 he was taken ill with a probable stress related condition now thought to be ulcerative colitis it was several months before he was able to resume work and he spent time convalescing at bath and cambridge his regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated use of moderate quantities of opium which proved effective in alleviating his condition and which he continued to use for rest of his life in wilberforce s absence pitt who had long been supportive of abolition introduced preparatory motion himself and ordered a privy council investigation into slave trade followed by a house of commons review with publication of privy council report in april 1789 and following months of planning wilberforce commenced his parliamentary campaign on 12 may 1789 he made his first major speech on subject of abolition in house of commons in which he reasoned that trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice drawing on thomas clarkson s mass of evidence he described in detail appalling conditions in which slaves travelled from africa in middle passage and argued that abolishing trade would also bring an improvement to conditions of existing slaves in west indies he moved 12 resolutions condemning slave trade but made no reference to abolition of slavery itself instead dwelling on potential for reproduction in existing slave population should trade be abolished with tide running against them opponents of abolition delayed vote by proposing that house of commons hear its own evidence and wilberforce in a move that has subsequently been criticised for prolonging slave trade reluctantly agreed hearings were not completed by end of parliamentary session and were deferred until following year in meantime wilberforce and clarkson tried unsuccessfully to take advantage of egalitarian atmosphere of french revolution to press for france s abolition of trade which was in any event to be abolished in 1794 as a result of bloody slave revolt in st domingue later to be known as haiti although later briefly restored by napoleon in 1802 in january 1790 wilberforce succeeded in speeding up hearings by gaining approval for a smaller parliamentary select committee to consider vast quantity of evidence which had been accumulated wilberforce s house in old palace yard became a centre for abolitionists campaign and a focus for many strategy meetings petitioners for other causes also besieged him there and his ante room was thronged from an early hour like noah s ark full of beasts clean and unclean according to hannah more interrupted by a general election in june 1790 committee finally finished hearing witnesses and in april 1791 with a closely reasoned four hour speech wilberforce introduced first parliamentary bill to abolish slave trade however after two evenings of debate bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88 political climate having swung in a conservative direction in wake of french revolution and in reaction to an increase in radicalism and to slave revolts in french west indies such was public hysteria of time that even wilberforce himself was suspected by some of being a jacobin agitator this was beginning of a protracted parliamentary campaign during which wilberforce s commitment never wavered despite frustration and hostility he was supported in his work by fellow members of so called clapham sect among whom was his best friend and cousin henry thornton holding evangelical christian convictions and consequently dubbed saints group mainly lived in large houses surrounding common in clapham then a village to south west of london wilberforce accepted an invitation to share a house with henry thornton in 1792 moving into his own home after thornton s marriage in 1796 saints were an informal community characterised by considerable intimacy as well as a commitment to practical christianity and an opposition to slavery they developed a relaxed family atmosphere wandering freely in and out of each other s homes and gardens and discussing many religious social and political topics that engaged them pro slavery advocates claimed that enslaved africans were lesser human beings who benefited from their bondage wilberforce clapham sect and others were anxious to demonstrate that africans and particularly freed slaves had human and economic abilities beyond slave trade and that they were capable of sustaining a well ordered society trade and cultivation inspired in part by utopian vision of granville sharp they became involved in establishment in 1792 of a free colony in sierra leone with black settlers from britain nova scotia and jamaica as well as native africans and some whites they formed sierra leone company with wilberforce subscribing liberally to project in money and time dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms reality was fraught with tension crop failures disease death war and defections to slave trade initially a commercial venture british government assumed responsibility for colony in 1808 colony although troubled at times was to become a symbol of anti slavery in which residents communities and african tribal chiefs worked together to prevent enslavement at source supported by a british naval blockade to stem region s slave trade on 2 april 1792 wilberforce again brought a bill calling for abolition memorable debate that followed drew contributions from greatest orators in house william pitt younger and charles james fox as well as from wilberforce himself lord melville as home secretary proposed a compromise solution of so called gradual abolition over a number of years this was passed by 230 to 85 votes but compromise was little more than a clever ploy with intention of ensuring that total abolition would be delayed indefinitely war with france on 26 february 1793 another vote to abolish slave trade was narrowly defeated by eight votes outbreak of war with france same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of issue as politicians concentrated on national crisis and threat of invasion same year and again in 1794 wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before parliament a bill to outlaw british ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies he voiced his concern about war and urged pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities growing more alarmed on 31 december 1794 wilberforce moved that government seek a peaceful resolution with france a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with pitt abolition continued to be associated in public consciousness with french revolution and with british radical groups resulting in a decline in public support in 1795 society for effecting abolition of slave trade ceased to meet and clarkson retired in ill health to lake district however despite decreased interest in abolition wilberforce continued to introduce abolition bills throughout 1790s early years of 19th century once again saw an increased public interest in abolition in 1804 clarkson resumed his work and society for effecting abolition of slave trade began meeting again strengthened with prominent new members such as zachary macaulay henry brougham and james stephen in june 1804 wilberforce s bill to abolish slave trade successfully passed all its stages through house of commons however it was too late in parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through house of lords on its reintroduction during 1805 session it was defeated with even usually sympathetic pitt failing to support it on this occasion and throughout campaign abolition was held back by wilberforce s trusting even credulous nature and his deferential attitude towards those in power he found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be right thing and was reluctant to confront them when they did not final phase of campaign following pitt s death in january 1806 wilberforce began to collaborate more with whigs especially abolitionists he gave general support to grenville fox administration which brought more abolitionists into cabinet wilberforce and charles fox led campaign in house of commons while lord grenville advocated cause in house of lords thumb 300px left house of commons in wilberforce s day by augustus pugin and thomas rowlandson 1808 1811 a radical change of tactics which involved introduction of a bill to ban british subjects from aiding or participating in slave trade to french colonies was suggested by maritime lawyer james stephen it was a shrewd move since majority of british ships were now flying american flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom britain was at war a bill was introduced and approved by cabinet and wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self imposed silence so as not to draw any attention to effect of bill approach proved successful and new foreign slave trade bill was quickly passed and received royal assent on 23 may 1806 wilberforce and clarkson had collected a large volume of evidence against slave trade over previous two decades and wilberforce spent latter part of 1806 writing a letter on abolition of slave trade which was a comprehensive restatement of abolitionists case death of fox in september 1806 was a blow but was followed quickly by a general election in autumn of 1806 slavery became an election issue bringing more abolitionist mps into house of commons including former military men who had personally experienced horrors of slavery and slave revolts wilberforce was re elected as an mp for yorkshire after which he returned to finishing and publishing his letter in reality a 400 page book which formed basis for final phase of campaign lord grenville prime minister was determined to introduce an abolition bill in house of lords rather than in house of commons taking it through its greatest challenge first when a final vote was taken bill was passed in house of lords by a large margin sensing a breakthrough that had been long anticipated charles grey moved for a second reading in commons on 23 february 1807 as tributes were made to wilberforce whose face streamed with tears bill was carried by 283 votes to 16 excited supporters suggested taking advantage of large majority to seek abolition of slavery itself but wilberforce made it clear that total emancipation was not immediate goal they had for present no object immediately before them but that of putting stop directly to carrying of men in british ships to be sold as slaves slave trade act received royal assent on 25 march 1807 personal life in his youth william wilberforce showed little interest in women but when he was in his late thirties his friend thomas babington recommended twenty year old barbara ann spooner 1777 1847 as a potential bride wilberforce met her two days later on 15 april 1797 and was immediately smitten following an eight day whirlwind romance he proposed despite urgings of friends to slow down couple married at church of st in bath somerset on 30 may 1797 they were devoted to each other and barbara was very attentive and supportive to wilberforce in his increasing ill health though she showed little interest in his political activities they had six children in fewer than ten years william b 1798 barbara b 1799 elizabeth b 1801 robert b 1802 samuel b 1805 and henry b 1807 wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children other concerns political and social reform wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to existing political and social order he advocated change in society through christianity and improvement in morals education and religion fearing and opposing radical causes and revolution radical writer william cobbett was among those who attacked what they saw as wilberforce s hypocrisy in campaigning for better working conditions for slaves while british workers lived in terrible conditions at home never have you done one single act in favour of labourers of this country he wrote critics noted wilberforce s support of suspension of habeas corpus in 1795 and his votes for pitt s gagging bills which banned meetings of more than 50 people allowing speakers to be arrested and imposing harsh penalties on those who attacked constitution wilberforce was opposed to giving workers rights to organise into unions in 1799 speaking in favour of combination act which suppressed trade union activity throughout britain and calling unions a general disease in our society he also opposed an enquiry into 1819 peterloo massacre in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform concerned about bad men who wished to produce anarchy and confusion he approved of government s six acts which further limited public meetings and seditious writings wilberforce s actions led essayist william hazlitt to condemn him as one who preaches vital christianity to savages and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states thumb 225px right unfinished portrait by sir thomas lawrence 1828 wilberforce s views of women and religion were also conservative he disapproved of women anti slavery activists such as elizabeth heyrick who organised women s abolitionist groups in 1820s protesting f or ladies to meet to publish to go from house to house stirring up petitions these appear to me proceedings unsuited to female character as delineated in scripture wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for catholic emancipation which would have allowed catholics to become mps hold public office and serve in army although by 1813 he had changed his views and spoke in favour of a similar bill more progressively wilberforce advocated legislation to improve working conditions for chimney sweeps and textile workers engaged in prison reform and supported campaigns to restrict capital punishment and severe punishments meted out under game laws he recognised importance of education in alleviating poverty and when hannah more and her sister established sunday schools for poor in somerset and mendips he provided financial and moral support as they faced opposition from landowners and anglican clergy from late 1780s onward wilberforce campaigned for limited parliamentary reform such as abolition of rotten boroughs and redistribution of commons seats to growing towns and cities though by 1832 he feared that such measures went too far with others wilberforce founded world s first animal welfare organisation society for prevention of cruelty to animals later royal society for prevention of cruelty to animals in 1824 wilberforce was one of over 30 eminent gentlemen who put their names at inaugural public meeting to fledgling national institution for preservation of life from shipwreck later named royal national lifeboat institution he was also opposed to duelling which he described as disgrace of a christian society and was appalled when his friend pitt engaged in a duel with george tierney in 1798 particularly as it occurred on a sunday christian day of rest wilberforce was generous with his time and money believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a significant portion of their income to needy yearly he gave away thousands of pounds much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes he paid off debts of others supported education and missions and in a year of food shortages gave to charity more than his own yearly income he was exceptionally hospitable and could not bear to sack any of his servants as a result his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity although he was often months behind in his correspondence wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships military promotions and livings for clergymen or for reprieve of death sentences evangelical christianity a supporter of evangelical wing of church of england wilberforce believed that revitalisation of church and individual christian observance would lead to a harmonious moral society he sought to elevate status of religion in public and private life making piety fashionable in both upper and middle classes of society to this end in april 1797 wilberforce published a practical view of prevailing religious system of professed christians in higher and middle classes of this country contrasted with real christianity on which he had been working since 1793 this was an exposition of new testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of christianity as a response to moral decline of nation illustrating his own personal testimony and views which inspired him book proved to be influential and a best seller by standards of day 7 500 copies were sold within six months and it was translated into several languages wilberforce fostered and supported missionary activity in britain and abroad he was a founding member of church missionary society since renamed church mission society and was involved with other members of clapham sect in numerous other evangelical and charitable organisations horrified by lack of christian evangelism in india wilberforce used 1793 renewal of british east india company s charter to propose addition of clauses requiring company to provide teachers and chaplains and to commit to religious improvement of indians plan was unsuccessful due to lobbying by directors of company who feared that their commercial interests would be damaged wilberforce tried again in 1813 when charter next came up for renewal using petitions meetings lobbying and letter writing he successfully campaigned for changes to charter speaking in favour of charter act 1813 he criticised british in india for their hypocrisy and racial prejudice while also condemning aspects of hinduism including caste system infanticide polygamy and our religion is sublime pure beneficent he said theirs is mean licentious and cruel moral reform greatly concerned by what he perceived to be degeneracy of british society wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform lobbying against torrent of that every day makes more rapid advances and considered this issue and abolition of slave trade as equally important goals at suggestion of wilberforce and bishop porteus king george iii was requested by archbishop of canterbury to issue in 1787 proclamation for discouragement of vice as a remedy for rising tide of immorality proclamation commanded prosecution of those guilty of excessive drinking blasphemy profane swearing and cursing lewdness profanation of lord s day and other dissolute immoral or disorderly practices greeted largely with public indifference wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to cause and by founding society for suppression of vice this and other societies in which wilberforce was a prime mover such as proclamation society mustered support for prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws including brothel keepers distributors of pornographic material and those who did not respect sabbath years later writer and clergyman sydney smith criticised wilberforce for being more interested in sins of poor than those of rich and suggested that a better name would have been society for suppressing vices of persons whose income does not exceed ps500 per annum societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support although their activities did lead to imprisonment of thomas williams london printer of thomas paine s age of reason wilberforce s attempts to legislate against adultery and sunday newspapers were also in vain his involvement and leadership in other less punitive approaches were more successful in long term however by end of his life british morals manners and sense of social responsibility had increased paving way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during victorian era emancipation of enslaved africans hopes of abolitionists notwithstanding slavery did not wither with end of slave trade in british empire nor did living conditions of enslaved improve trade continued with few countries following suit by abolishing trade and with some british ships disregarding legislation wilberforce worked with members of african institution to ensure enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries in particular us had abolished slave trade in 1808 and wilberforce lobbied american government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly same year wilberforce moved his family from clapham to a sizable mansion with a large garden in kensington gore closer to houses of parliament never strong and by 1812 in worsening health wilberforce resigned his yorkshire seat and became mp for rotten borough of bramber in sussex a seat with little or no constituency obligations thus allowing him more time for his family and causes that interested him from 1816 wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require compulsory registration of slaves together with details of their country of origin permitting illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected later in same year he began publicly to denounce slavery itself though he did not demand immediate emancipation as they had always thought slaves incapable of liberty at present but hoped that by degrees a change might take place as natural result of abolition in 1820 after a period of poor health and with his eyesight failing wilberforce took decision to further limit his public activities although he became embroiled in unsuccessful mediation attempts between king george iv and his estranged wife caroline of brunswick who had sought her rights as queen nevertheless wilberforce still hoped to lay a foundation for

proposed redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of franchise in event reform act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist mps into parliament as a result of

thumb 150px right wilberforce monument in grounds of hull college hull erected in 1834 five years after his death sons robert and samuel wilberforce published a five volume biography about their father and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840 biography was controversial in that authors emphasised wilberforce s role in abolition movement and played down important work of thomas clarkson incensed clarkson came out of retirement to write a book refuting their version of events and sons eventually made a half hearted private apology to him and removed offending passages in a revision of their biography however for more than a century wilberforce s role in campaign dominated history books later historians have noted warm and highly productive relationship between clarkson and wilberforce and have termed it one of history s great partnerships without both parliamentary leadership supplied by wilberforce and research and public mobilisation organised by clarkson abolition could not have been achieved as his sons had desired and planned wilberforce has long been viewed as a christian hero a statesman saint held up as a role model for putting his faith into action more broadly he has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping political and social attitudes of time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action in 1940s role of wilberforce and clapham sect in abolition was downplayed by historian eric williams who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics as west indian sugar industry was in decline williams approach strongly influenced historians for much of latter part of 20th century however more recent historians have noted that sugar industry was still making large profits at time of abolition of slave trade and this has led to a renewed interest in wilberforce and evangelicals as well as a recognition of anti slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns memorials wilberforce s life and work have been widely commemorated in westminster abbey a seated statue of wilberforce by samuel joseph was erected
