democratic primary for 2010 united states senate election in pennsylvania took place on may 18 2010 when congressman joe sestak defeated incumbent arlen specter which led to end of specter s five term senatorial career just prior to start of primary campaign after serving in senate as a republican for 29 years specter had switched to democratic party in anticipation of a difficult primary challenge by pat toomey sestak was ultimately defeated by toomey in general election political observers and journalists described race between specter and sestak as one of bitterest and most watched of all 2010 primary elections although sestak was initially urged to run by democratic establishment specter gained wide support from democrats after he switched parties major political figures like president barack obama and pennsylvania governor ed rendell later tried to sway sestak from continuing race fearing he would damage specter s chances in general election former president bill clinton offered sestak a position in obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy an offer republicans would later criticize sestak refused to drop out and criticized specter s party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self preservation nevertheless sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and specter s support from such individuals as joe biden and harry reid and organizations like afl cio and pennsylvania democratic committee specter led sestak by more than 20 percentage points for most of race but this lead narrowed significantly in final month of campaign when sestak concentrated his funds and efforts on television commercials questioning specter s democratic credentials specter grew more critical of sestak as race progressed attacking his house attendance record accusing him of failing to pay his staffers minimum wage and alleging he was demoted while serving in u s navy for creating a poor command climate political observers said sestak s commercials played a major part in his victory and that a national swing in momentum toward republicans and against incumbents ultimately harmed specter s chances background chris matthews speculation thumb 230 px left media reports indicated chris matthews news commentator with msnbc was considering running in democratic primary alt a smiling man with blond hair wearing a gray suit jacket and black tie beginning in april 2008 media reported growing speculation that chris matthews news commentator and host of msnbc s hardball with chris matthews might run in 2010 democratic primary for united states senate pennsylvania seat then occupied by republican arlen specter in an interview with new york times magazine matthews said that he believed specter had been in senate for too long but that running for senate would mean giving up a career he loved mark author of article wrote matthews has been particularly obsessed with pennsylvania of late devoting hours on and off air to state s upcoming democratic primary staying in close contact with state s party apparatus speculation was further fueled by matthews appearance on an april 14 episode of colbert report host stephen colbert asked matthews about rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement to which matthews replied did you ever want to be something your whole life when you grow up some kids want to be a fireman i want to be a senator but i have to deal with these things as they come matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by media but did not deny possibility subject of matthews possible candidacy was raised at an october dinner fundraiser for presidential candidate barack obama held by robert wolf president of ubs s investment bank discussing dinner later matthews told new york times people have asked me about it i ve never told anyone that i m running on november 28 patriot news of harrisburg reported that matthews met that week with pennsylvania democratic party chairman t j rooney and executive director mary isenhour to discuss possibly running against specter isenhour told paper matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money and she did not believe he had yet come to a firm decision adding he s got a really good job with msnbc i think he s going to put some thought into it before he jumps in same day political blog fivethirtyeight com reported that matthews had already met with potential campaign staff something matthews claimed was absolutely not true increased speculation led some like former spokesman for hillary clinton s 2008 presidential campaign phil singer to criticize matthews for openly weighing a political campaign bid while working as a news broadcaster singer believed matthews should resign or be suspended from network until a decision was made speculation grew as matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with pennsylvania representatives and major democratic fundraisers matthews discussed a possible campaign with pennsylvania governor ed rendell and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind specter however speculation came to an end on january 7 2009 when matthews told his hardball staff he was not going to run for senate such media outlets as new york times and washington post suggested matthews alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with msnbc to renew his contract which was set to expire in june 2009 arlen specter party switch thumb 230 px right long time republican senator arlen specter switched to democratic party in part because he believed he was unlikely to win republican primary alt a frowning man with gray hair wearing a gray suit jacket and red tie watches a woman in foreground speaking into a microphone image of woman is out of focus as early as 2008 five term republican pennsylvania senator arlen specter had made clear his plans to seek re election specter had narrowly avoided a primary defeat against conservative challenger pat toomey during his 2004 senate race and he was expected to face an even greater challenge from toomey in 2010 particularly since conservative faction of pennsylvania republican party had vowed to defeat specter in upcoming primary some high profile democrats including vice president joe biden and governor rendell began encouraging specter to join democratic party by publicly offering to help specter raise money if he switched a march 2009 quinnipiac university polling institute poll found specter trailing toomey 41 percent to 27 percent among republican primary voters in large part due to voter angst over specter s support for american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 which was supported by president obama since pennsylvania primaries are closed poll noted that specter could not be assisted by support from moderates or democrats clay f richards assistant director of quinnipiac university polling institute said of poll results pennsylvania republicans are so unhappy with sen specter s vote for president barack obama s stimulus package and so called pork barrel spending that they are voting for a former congressman they hardly know a march 2009 article in hill quoted specter as stating he was considering leaving republican party to run for re election as an independent candidate specter later denied validity of those claims announcing on march 18 to eliminate any doubt i am a republican and i am running for reelection in 2010 as a republican on republican ticket however on april 28 2009 specter announced he was leaving republican party and becoming a democrat because he disagreed with increasingly conservative direction republican party was heading in and found his personal philosophy was now better aligned with democrats although specter said that he primarily based his decision on principle he also admitted it was partially due to his poor chances at winning republican primary i have traveled state and surveyed sentiments of republican party in pennsylvania and public opinion polls observed other public opinion polls and have found that prospects for winning a republican primary are bleak prior to switching parties specter said he had been assured by senate majority leader harry reid that he would keep his seniority on senate if he joined democratic party arrangement displeased some senate democrats and on may 3 senate voted to strip him of his seniority in spite of this this temporarily made specter most junior democrat in senate and severely limited his influence as a legislator nevertheless specter s decision was praised by many major democrats including reid and president barack obama who promised to campaign for him republicans however criticized decision accusing specter of betraying his principles and party to preserve his political career michael steele chairman of republican national committee said specter flipped bird to party and that specter made decision based solely because he knew he would lose election senator john cornyn chairman of national republican senatorial committee and a past supporter of specter said decision represents height of political self preservation specter defended his position by arguing republican party had strayed too far from vision of president ronald reagan adding i am not prepared to have my 29 year record in united states senate decided by pennsylvania republican primary electorate joe sestak declares candidacy second term u s representative joe sestak a former u s navy admiral began privately discussing possibility of seeking democratic nomination with his family in december 2008 senator bob menendez chairman of democratic senatorial campaign committee approached sestak in april 2009 and asked him to run but sestak claimed he was not initially interested nevertheless media speculation about sestak s possible campaign began as early as mid april 2009 and intensified day specter changed political parties while most democrats embraced long time senator sestak issued a statement criticizing specter s decision declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with pennsylvanians rather than senate democratic leadership and washington political establishment menendez approached sestak again this time asking him not to run against specter but sestak did not agree to back down later when asked by fox news sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for office but declined to immediately endorse specter and said he had to wait and see during a may 3 appearance on cnn s state of union with john king sestak questioned whether specter was really a genuine democrat adding i think arlen has to tell us not that it was too hard to run against someone what i need to know is what is he running for sestak insisted he would not make a final decision for several months on may 4 he met with andy stern president of service employees international union which fueled speculation that he was seeking labor support for a campaign meanwhile joe torsella former president of national constitution center had planned on running for democratic nomination and initially announced specter s party change would not affect his decision to run however torsella announced on may 14 he was dropping out of race because specter s decision changed political landscape and he wanted to avoid a campaign that would probably be negative personal and more about senator specter s past than our common future it had been reported that governor rendell for whom torsella previously worked as an aide pushed for torsella to step aside so specter could run unopposed but torsella s staff denied those claims despite torsella s departure sestak continued to consider entering race and began gaining support from democratic party s more liberal factions like progressive change campaign committee which began a draft sestak campaign fund sestak became further encouraged to run after taking a tour of all 67 pennsylvania counties to meet with party leaders and discuss such issues as jobs economy and health care sestak said that leaders voiced serious concerns to him about direction of country and although his lack of name recognition was a problem sestak said many of people he encountered voiced support for him on may 27 website talking points memo posted a handwritten letter by sestak to candidates declaring his intent to run for senate sestak did not dispute authenticity of letter but told press he wanted to discuss matter with his family before making a formal decision sestak told media outlets he realized president obama wished him not to run against specter but that he felt choice should be with voters of pennsylvania rather than president governor rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run believing it would damage sestak s own political future plus cost democratic party both sestak s house seat and possibly damage specter s general election chances nevertheless sestak formally declared his candidacy for democratic nomination on august 4 2009 in a speech before a veterans of foreign wars hall in his native delaware county shortly after announcement toomey issued a statement welcoming sestak to race describing him as a consistent liberal who really believes in his values as compared to specter who he called a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re election candidates joe sestak u s congressman arlen specter incumbent u s senator pennsylvania rep william c kortz and retired manufacturer joseph vodvarka also ran in democratic primary but neither remained for duration of race kortz who was little known outside western pennsylvania area dropped out of race on january 14 2010 after raising only 20 000 of 2 million he sought to raise for his campaign vodvarka an allegheny county man who had been mostly overlooked

additional 1 million by june 30 2009 which brought his total to about 4 2 million sestak called it largest campaign war chest of any senate challenger specter however was ahead with 6 7 million in campaign funding as of march 31 sestak also faced challenges arising from his low name recognition and specter s support among high profile members of democratic establishment like obama and biden specter spent early months of his campaign trying to reestablish and strengthen his democratic credentials seeking union support and making speeches highlighting his support of positions supported by party such as economic stimulus package reforming health care increasing minimum wage protecting abortion rights and supporting stem cell research in a june 2009 speech to pennsylvania democratic committee members in pittsburgh specter said i m again a democrat and i m pleased and proud to be a democrat commentators observed that sestak s involvement in race would test specter s loyalty to democratic party and likely force him to make more liberal votes in senate even before sestak formally declared his candidacy on august 4 2009 specter and sestak began exchanging criticisms about each other that were so heated new york times writer janie lorber suggested contest will become one of more vicious for next year s midterm elections sestak repeatedly said specter was not a real democrat and continued to assert specter s switch was based on self preservation rather than principles specter called sestak a flagrant hypocrite for questioning specter s loyalty to democratic party citing fact that sestak himself was registered as an independent until he became a democrat in 2006 just before he ran for congress sestak claimed that was because he was serving in military and wished to be nonpartisan but specter called that a lame excuse for avoiding party affiliation undercut by his documented disinterest in political process pointing out that records indicated sestak voted in only 12 out of 35 elections from 1971 to 2005 a day after sestak formally entered race specter described sestak s recent 67 county tour as a taxpayer financed self promotion tour around state specter s campaign also accused sestak of neglecting his duties in house and missing more than 100 votes in last year which specter called worst attendance record for any pennsylvania congressman sestak responded to latter point that most of missed votes were procedural in nature and were missed because of statewide tour and because he visited his father who was dying at time sestak accused specter of launching a gop negative style campaign which specter denied toomey and obama get involved thumb sestak center and specter far right debating at 2009 netroots nation convention in pittsburgh specter and sestak participated in an august 14 panel discussion hosted by netroots nation which included questions from online viewers consisting mainly of liberal and progressive bloggers and advocates media reports suggested specter faced tougher questions from crowd with many questioning whether they could trust him based on his switching parties specter dismissed suggestions that his recent democratic votes were politically motivated by primary and cited his support of lilly ledbetter fair pay act and children s health insurance reauthorization act as proof of his democratic credentials sestak argued a change in leadership was necessary and that his military background as a united states navy admiral gave him necessary experience sestak also pointed out that specter worked with former senator bob dole to defeat president bill clinton s health care plan in 1993 when some in crowd brought up how senator chuck grassley a past ally of specter s was arguing that obama s health care plan would lead to death panels specter said that grassley was wrong and that he would call him about matter when some in crowd chanted call him now specter took several audience members backstage and left a phone message for grassley as they watched salon com said based on stunt specter may have won day if not battle however a straw poll of 250 online activists attending event showed

later following an e mail exchange with expected republican challenger toomey about health care sestak proposed an unorthodox joint town hall with toomey about issue which was held september 2 at muhlenberg college in allentown specter was not invited to participate and political pollster g terry madonna of franklin marshall college described it as an informal pact between sestak and toomey to weaken their joint rival something two men denied commentators suggested toomey was willing to help sestak at this stage of race because he preferred sestak as a general election opponent over specter who could possibly draw republican and independent voters from toomey also in september obama appeared in a 30 second television ad for specter praising him for his support of president s economic recovery initiatives a september poll by franklin marshall college found specter maintained a 37 percent to 11 percent lead over sestak but also that 54 percent of people felt a change was needed as opposed to 34 percent who felt specter deserved a sixth term that poll also found 73 percent felt they did not know enough about sestak to form an opinion which pollster madonna said indicated race would be focused more on specter s incumbency and record than about sestak or toomey thumb left 260px vice president joe biden with senator arlen specter in 2009 biden and president barack obama

declaration of support so early in primary season when president has option of remaining neutral until final outcome becomes clearer governor rendell said that obama and biden felt obligated to strongly support specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties philadelphia mayor michael nutter and radio personality michael also spoke on specter s behalf senate majority leader reid took unusual steps of scheduling no senate votes that day so both specter and pennsylvania senator bob casey jr could attend fundraiser that move drew criticism from republicans as well as from sestak who felt specter was skirting his senate responsibilities yet hypocritically criticizing sestak at same time for missing more than 100 votes in u s house event was expected to raise about 2 5 million which was to be split between specter s campaign and democratic senatorial campaign committee after fundraiser obama and specter traveled via air force one to pittsburgh to address labor activists at afl cio convention there specter assured audience he would support employee free choice act a proposed bill that would make union formation easier which specter had previously opposed as a republican specter maintains lead as primary entered into october specter continued to criticize sestak on his record of missed votes in congress he claimed sestak missed 122 in past year or nearly 17 percent of his total votes whereas specter missed four in a letter specter told sestak he should drop out of campaign and start voting on a more consistent basis or resign from house so he can cease to be a burden to taxpayers around same time sestak launched a website called real specter which highlighted right leaning votes specter made and alliances he held during his 29 years as a republican in senate specter continued to maintain a significant lead against sestak of 19 percentage points according to a quinnipiac university poll released that month but sestak pointed out that gap was 32 points in july and cited poll as proof that he was gaining ground in race also that month new reports indicated toomey was growing in popularity and in one poll was actually ahead of specter with 43 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him compared to 42 percent for specter this was attributed by some to challenge presented by sestak and declining popularity of obama whose approval rating had dropped from 56 percent in july to 49 percent in october on october 14 specter reported he had raised 1 8 million during previous three month period bringing his total to about 8 7 million senator said that he was aided in large part by his september 15 fundraiser hosted by obama in that same period sestak raised only 758 000 about a quarter million dollars lower than previous quarter making his total allocation about 4 7 million sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12 hour days a week as a result sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff sestak called on specter to participate in six debates one for each media market in pennsylvania but specter only agreed to participate in one because that was amount of debates he participated in as a republican on december 7 sestak was endorsed by congressman barney frank who said that he was impressed by sestak s leadership on economic and military issues as well as his positions against military s don t ask don t tell policy and defense of marriage act endorsement was important to sestak because it was first time a prominent member of congress broke with democratic establishment to back him over specter frank also said of specter s switching parties i have to say i don t think it did our profession any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive new polls in january indicated voter support was growing for toomey who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over specter and an eight point lead over sestak specter continued to lead against sestak in democratic primary poll this time by a 21 point margin some political scientists believed toomey s gain over specter could be attributed to voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with health care proposal pending in congress however some democratic leaders felt sestak s challenge to specter was having a detrimental effect not only to specter but to democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning general election this feeling was enhanced by growing national support for republican party and especially by unexpected victory of tea party backed republican scott brown in a special election for a traditionally democratic massachusetts senate seat specter acknowledged to new york times that national political mood might work against him in primary but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive race grows more heated primary continued to grow more heated in february 2010 on february 5 two candidates held their first face to face debate and used 30 minute forum to strongly criticize each other with sestak continuing to associate specter with failed republican policies and specter arguing his opponent was more focused on criticizing him than debating policy sestak continued to attack specter for switching parties asking is best democrats can do someone who has been on other side with respect for 50 years and cast 2 000 votes with president bush likewise specter once again criticized sestak s missed votes in congress which he said would have been enough to earn sestak a court martial for going awol in his former naval career sestak also criticized specter for voting in favor of iraq war and specter in turn condemned sestak for supporting obama s proposed troop increase for war in afghanistan which specter opposed next day pennsylvania democratic committee voted to endorse specter over sestak with 77 percent of voters supporting incumbent senator or 229 votes compared to sestak s 72 sestak criticized committee for its decision but also argued it solidified his own position as a political outsider independent from mainstream washington establishment media outlets said vote indicated specter had convinced most important figures in state party that he was not simply a crossover politician later in february specter accused sestak of mistreating his employees and disobeying state and federal minimum wage laws by severely his house staff citing federal election commission reports specter claimed ten of sestak s sixteen campaign staffers were making less than minimum wage and that they were so underpaid they were eligible for food stamps he also noted that sestak s three highest paid staffers were members of his family including his brother richard sestak who worked as campaign manager t j rooney a specter supporter wrote a letter to sestak expressing concern about potential violation of minimum wage laws which read it is inconceivable to me that our standard bearer wouldn t be paying his workers minimum wage sestak responded by acknowledging his staff could make more money elsewhere but said they choose to work hard and make some sacrifices because they know how important it is to elect someone to united states senate who shares their principles specter maintains momentum as primary race entered into march specter appeared to be maintaining his momentum with polls indicating he not only led sestak by 24 percentage points but had recaptured a projected lead against toomey in general election by a margin of 49 to 42 percent pollsters indicated specter was still benefiting greatly from his strong name recognition whereas sestak and toomey remained relatively little known peter brown assistant director of quinnipiac university polling institute said there remains no evidence that his primary challenger congressman joe sestak has made much progress as we get within three months of may primary however time writer karen tumulty noted that while thus far sestak has failed to meet expectations poll also indicated some weaknesses for specter namely more than half of surveyed pennsylvanians did not feel he deserved another term and among democrats who knew candidates well enough to form an opinion of both sestak led specter 54 percent to 37 percent on march 16 governor rendell restated his past

which was considered one of most important endorsements in primary race it was one of several major labor endorsements specter had received including state service employees international union and pennsylvania state education association which represented 200 000 state teachers representatives from afl cio cited specter s backing of president obama s stimulus package as a major factor in their decision sestak criticized union federation s decision pointing out he had a 100 percent rating from national afl cio while specter had a 61 percent rating he also attacked specter for previously backing president george w bush s economic policies and said pennsylvania workers need a senator they can count on to be there when they need him not only when he needs them during an election philadelphia inquirer writer thomas fitzgerald called endorsement a powerful affirmation of how smoothly specter has managed his political transition to democratic party since leaving republican party less than a year ago on april 11 sestak held a debate with toomey in philadelphia without specter present which media observers described as an explicit criticism of specter for refusing to hold more than one debate with sestak during that debate sestak strongly attacked toomey s voting record in what morning call reporter colby described as an obvious effort to show democrats that he could hold his own in a general election matchup at end of debate toomey voiced respect for sestak and described him as a more principled man than specter who he criticized for not participating in more debates later that month when senate candidates publicly released their quarterly campaign finance reports on april 15 it was revealed toomey raised more in first three months of 2010 than either democratic candidate adding 2 3 million to his total 4 1 million war chest compared to specter adding 1 1 million to his total 9 1 million fund political analysts attributed this to national swing in momentum toward republicans and said that it could indicate republicans would be victorious in many senate races including in pennsylvania sestak raised 442 000 in three month period down from his previous quarter which specter s campaign said proved democratic donors had rejected his candidacy specter s fundraising advantage was significant because it allowed him to start early in running political campaign commercials television advertisements starting in april both specter and sestak launched television advertisements that were particularly critical of each other sestak who had been saving most of his roughly 5 million campaign funds until final month of primary race unveiled a 60 second spot that highlighted his navy career and described role his daughter s experience as a brain cancer survivor played in his decision to enter politics commercial did not discuss specter by name but made several implicit references to him such as sestak s statements that too many politicians are concerned about keeping their jobs instead of helping people and if we want real change in washington we can t keep sending same career politicians to represent us specter launched several commercials most focusing on his plans to promote job growth one advertisement however focused entirely on attacking sestak highlighting not only his voting attendance record labeling him no show joe but also his navy service commercial stated sestak was relieved of duty in navy for creating a poor command climate a reference to sestak s 2005 transfer from a senior pentagon planning post to a lesser position which effectively ended his naval career navy times had previously reported transfer resulted from sestak forcing subordinates to work unreasonable hours although sestak himself disputed that accusation and attributed transfer to fact that new top officer admiral michael mullen simply wanted to appoint his own team sestak called on specter to stop broadcasting commercial accusing senator of republican style negative campaign tactics which he compared to those used against senator john kerry by swift vets and pows for truth during 2004 presidential election sestak said in a statement it s time to tell arlen specter democrats don t swift boat we re better than that a group of veterans gathered in philadelphia to echo sestak s call that commercial should be removed with retired u s air force lieutenant general robert e kelley announcing we re all here because we re enraged at fact that someone anyone in united states today would question someone who has 30 years of service specter s campaign replied they would not remove commercial because it was accurate and instead called on sestak to remove his own advertisement claiming it violated united states department of defense guidelines because it used military images references and jargon without a disclaimer that it was not endorsed by department sestak gains in closing weeks sestak and specter held their first and only televised debate on may 1 at philadelphia s fox affiliate during which two candidates bitterly attacked each other s character and honesty two began arguing even before hour long debate formally began when sestak objected to specter s use of notes and said that rules did not allow them debate organizer ruled notes were allowed specter criticized sestak for campaign advertisements that accused senator of lying about sestak s record specter said nobody has ever called me a liar and demanded an apology to which sestak did not respond specter also repeatedly asked sestak to publicly release his military records to which sestak again refused to respond sestak accused specter of using republican style tactics in vein of karl rove former adviser to george w bush and said specter s attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting bush s failed economic policies specter insisted questions raised about sestak s naval record were legitimate because much of sestak s campaign was based on his military background adding it goes to his ability to get things done to get along with people he s all peaches and cream on television specter criticized sestak for supporting troop build up in afghanistan while sestak noted that specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in 1990s philadelphia inquirer noted debate was every bit as contentious as their

trailing only four points at 42 percent quinnipiac poll indicated strongest factor in these changes was that sestak was gaining better name recognition due to his television commercials according to poll 43 percent of respondents now had a favorable view of him compared to only 33 percent in march day after poll was released sestak unveiled a new television advertisement strongly critical of specter highlighting incumbent senator s republican history and showing images of him with george w bush and republican vice presidential candidate sarah palin commercial featured a clip of specter saying my change in party will enable me to be reelected and ended with a narrator saying arlen specter switched parties to save one job his not yours same week advertisement ran t j rooney said in an interview with politico that a sestak primary victory would be cataclysmic for party in general election and warned democratic voters if we want to keep this seat in democratic hands only person capable of delivering that victory is arlen specter specter received several high profile endorsements during final weeks leading up to primary senator john kerry who had been an early supporter of sestak s 2006 house campaign endorsed specter in senate race calling him fighter and a friend and i am proud to vouch for his character philadelphia inquirer called sestak a worthy opponent and said that his determination made race especially competitive but ultimately embraced specter whose overall career record newspaper said was a good choice for democrats pittsburgh post gazette also endorsed

found sestak ahead 38 36 percent with about a quarter of voters undecided in both cases lead fell within survey s margin of error g terry madonna director of franklin marshall poll said that sestak

defeat led to end of specter s nearly 30 year senate career longest of any pennsylvania senator in history afterward sestak declared this is what democracy should look like a win for people over establishment it should come as no surprise to anyone that people want a change specter conceded defeat and said it s been a great privilege to serve people of pennsylvania it s been a great privilege to be in united states senate commentators suggested specter s defeat signaled an electorate unsatisfied with establishment in both major parties and indicated that backing of prominent politicians had little effect on voters during this political age sestak s victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for obama who strongly and publicly advocated for specter during race several news outlets reflected that sestak s television advertisements condemning specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been primary factor in his victory washington post said pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to specter s longevity and his switch to democratic party toomey went on to defeat sestak in general election winning by a margin of 51 to 49 percent clinton job offer to sestak during a february 2010 television interview sestak said that in july 2009 he was offered a job in president obama s administration if he dropped out of race during a february 18 taping of larry kane voice of reason a philadelphia area local news show host larry kane asked sestak whether such an offer had been made to which sestak responded yes without elaborating beyond that it was a high ranking assignment and that he did not plan to take it in subsequent press inquiries sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement when asked about matter by washington post he said there has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if i got out likewise during an appearance on fox news channel he said i was asked a direct question yesterday and i answered it honestly there s nothing more to go into i m in this race now over next month white house officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether sestak s claims were true on march 16 white house press secretary robert gibbs said he had reviewed matter and found conversations that had been held with sestak were not problematic in march congressman darrell issa ranking republican on house committee on oversight and government reform sent a letter to white house counsel robert bauer stating if sestak s claim was true obama administration may have violated a federal statute that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a senate election interest in alleged job offer reignited after sestak defeated specter in primary on may 18 seven republicans from senate judiciary committee wrote to attorney general eric holder seeking a review of legal implications of offer around this time sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made but he downplayed importance of incident and defended obama s integrity on may 28 white house formally responded to allegations and acknowledged white house chief of staff rahm emanuel enlisted former president bill clinton to offer sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if sestak dropped his candidacy if sestak accepted he would have been allowed to remain in house while serving in unpaid position bauer said that nobody in administration itself directly discussed offer with sestak and he does not believe there was anything improper illegal or unethical about conduct republicans in congress disagreed arguing action contradicted claims obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government darrell issa in particular felt it was an impeachable offense and referred to it as obama s watergate nevertheless matter gradually became less of a focus during primary election where other topics like spending and economy took spotlight with issa poised to become chairman of house committee on oversight and government reform following republican party recapturing house during 2010 midterm elections it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation into job offer based on his prior critical comments about matter however on november 5 issa announced he would not pursue an investigation some politicians and members of media said that job offer made to sestak was neither illegal nor abhorrent and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels chris of washington post felt matter only appeared to be a scandal because white house badly mishandled response and chicago tribune writer john kass wrote
