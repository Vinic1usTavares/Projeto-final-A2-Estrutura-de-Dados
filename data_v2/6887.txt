have been either sacred ruler or kende of hungarians or their military leader or gyula although most details of his life are debated by historians because different sources contain contradictory information despite this many hungarians refer to him as founder of our country and arpad s preeminent role in hungarian conquest of carpathian basin has been emphasized by some later chronicles dynasty descending from arpad ruled kingdom of hungary until 1301 biography early life arpad was son of almos who is mentioned as first head of confederation of hungarian tribes by all hungarian chronicles his mother s name and family are unknown according to historian gyula kristo arpad was born around 845 his name derived from hungarian word for barley arpa which is of turkic origin byzantine emperor constantine porphyrogenitus r 913 959 states that hungarians had never at any time had any other prince before arpad which is in sharp contrast to hungarian chronicles report of position of arpad s father constantine porphyrogenitus de administrando imperio ch 38 p 173 in porphyrogenitus s narration khazar khagan initiated centralization of command of hungarian tribes in order to strengthen his own suzerainty over them khagan initially wanted to appoint a chieftain named levedi to lead hungarians however levedi did not accept this offer and suggested that either almos or arpad should be promoted instead of him khagan approached hungarians with this new proposal they preferred arpad to his father because he was greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour and capable of this rule thereafter arpad was made prince according to custom of by lifting him upon a shield constantine porphyrogenitus refers to arpad as great prince of turkey referring to hungary constantine porphyrogenitus de administrando imperio ch 40 pp 178 179 reliability of byzantine emperor s report of arpad s election is debated by modern historians for instance victor spinei states that it is rather vague and scarcely credible but andras rona tas writes that its core is reliable latter historian adds that arpad s election was promoted by almos who forced levedi kende to renounce accordingly in rona tas s view arpad succeeded levedi as sacred ruler or kende which enabled his father to preserve his own position of actual leader of hungarians or gyula towards hungarian conquest earliest reliable source of arpad s life is an early 10th century document continuation of chronicle by george monk it narrates that byzantine emperor leo vi wise r 886 912 sent his envoy nicetas sclerus to hungarians in 894 or 895 to give presents and incite them against bulgarian empire sclerus met with their two leaders arpad and kurszan at lower danube sclerus s mission succeeded a hungarian army soon crossed danube on byzantine ships against bulgaria an interpolation in porphyrogenitus s text suggests that invading hungarians were under command of arpad s son liuntika positions held by arpad and kurszan at time of their negotiations with sclerus are debated by historians spinei wrote that arpad was gyula and kurszan was kende in contrast kristo said that kurszan was gyula

killed in or transylvania hungarian illuminated chronicle ch 28 p 98 engel kristo and molnar who accept reliability of this report wrote that almos s death was a ritual murder similar to sacrifice of khazar khagans in case of a disaster affecting their people in contrast with them rona tas states that even if report on almos s murder reflects true event only possible explanation would be that arpad or someone in his entourage killed aged prince spinei rejects illuminated chronicle s report on almos s murder in transylvania because last mention of almos in contrasting narration of gesta

name is completely unknown to all sources written in east francia which was one of main powers of carpathian basin at turn of 9th and 10th centuries these sources including annales and annales only mention another hungarian leader kurszan according to kristo and other historians these sources suggest that kurszan must have been gyula commanding hungarian forces while arpad succeeded his murdered father as sacred kende proposing a contrasting theory romanian historian curta wrote that kurszan was kende and arpad gyula only succeeded him when kurszan was murdered by bavarians in 902 or 904 in contrast to nearly contemporaneous sources hungarian chronicles written centuries after instance gesta hungarorum and illuminated arpad s pre eminent role in conquest of carpathian basin gesta hungarorum also highlights arpad s military skills and his generosity this chronicle also emphasizes that one of heads of seven hungarian tribes acquired land of transylvania for himself and his posterity only after arpad had authorized him to conquer it anonymus notary of king bela deeds of hungarians ch 24 p 59 gesta hungarorum says that arpad took an oath of leading men and warriors of hungary and had his son prince zoltan elevated to prince in his life anonymus notary of king bela deeds of hungarians ch 52 p 115 however reliability of this report and list of grand princes in gesta
