battle of sourton down was a successful parliamentarian ambush at sourton down near okehampton in south west england on 25 april 1643 during first english civil war ambush took place after a failed parliamentarian attack on royalists held launceston after parliamentarians had retreated to okehampton sir ralph hopton led a royalist army towards okehampton planning to attack town at dawn when parliamentarian commander major general james chudleigh found out he had a dilemma he was outnumbered but did not want to leave his artillery for enemy to capture he opted to counterattack and ambushed 3 600 strong royalist force on sourton down laying in wait with just 108 of his own cavalry ambush caught marching army completely by surprise and a large part of their force was immediately routed chudleigh called for reinforcements from his infantry in okehampton but they were spotted on march there and scattered under fire from royalist artillery parliamentarians still outnumbered despite their successes chose to retreat royalists who were in complete disarray and still did not know size of force they had faced did likewise defeat was humiliating for hopton along with weapons and equipment abandoned by his forces and captured by parliamentarians there was a letter to hopton from king ordering him to march his forces to somerset to meet up with a larger royalist army from oxford background in march 1643 first english civil war had been ongoing for seven months since king charles i had raised his royal standard in nottingham and declared earl of essex and by extension parliament traitors that action had been culmination of religious fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years state of war in west country when war started cornwall was generally more supportive of royalist cause while devon and somerset were sympathetic towards parliament though significant opposition existed in both areas in july 1642 sir ralph hopton and marquess of hertford left king in york to raise a royalist army in south west they initially established their headquarters at wells in somerset which hopton represented as a member of long parliament but were driven out by local parliamentarians in early august and subsequently retreated to sherborne castle and then minehead there hopton and hertford split up hertford took army s infantry to wales while hopton sailed with their dragoons to west cornwall there hopton successfully recruited a cornish royalist army which led local parliamentarians to withdraw from cornwall although hopton fancied himself as commander of cornish forces king divided command hopton commanded horse william ashburnham foot and sir john berkeley was named commissary general in reality power was shared even further with cornish troops generally more willing to be commanded by fellow cornishmen and so sir bevil grenville sir nicholas slanning and john also had prominent roles parliamentarians responded to growing army in cornwall by raising their own local army in devon initially under command of earl of pembroke james chudleigh was sent from london with orders to raise and command 1000 dragoons to be levied in somerset devon and cornwall and reinforced garrison at barnstaple in north devon in december 1642 earl of stamford was given command of parliament s army in west country in january 1643 and he appointed chudleigh as his deputy soon after prelude in january 1643 at battle of braddock down near bodmin in cornwall hopton had removed last parliamentarian foothold in cornwall hopton wanted to press on and take plymouth but city was a difficult target as it could be easily reinforced by sea and hopton s cornish forces refused to cross river tamar which formed boundary of cornwall a number of skirmishes took place between two sides parliamentarians secured a victory in modbury but suffered from desertions a truce was agreed in march which continued through into april part of which required hopton to remove his army from devon and encamp within cornwall at end of truce parliamentarians commanded by chudleigh attacked launceston but were repelled and retreated back to okehampton royalists made no real initial attempt to pursue chudleigh s force instead dealing with disorder amongst their cornish soldiers parliamentarians had mustered over 5 000 men at okehampton during truce but after loss at launceston army split up and chudleigh retained just over 1 000 infantrymen and three or four troops of dragoons reports of parliamentarian disarray reached royalists hopton recorded that there came a friend from okehampton who assured that enemy at okehampton was in very great disquiet and fear hopton along with his fellow commanders decided to try and take advantage of disarray by camping on sourton down overnight ready to launch an attack on okehampton at dawn they marched in a column with 3 000 infantry 300 cavalry 300 dragoons and 4 guns force was split around artillery 150 dragoons led acting as scouts followed by 150 cavalry and then half foot soldiers behind artillery was other half of infantry backed up by remainder of dragoons and cavalry by chance a parliamentarian quartermaster spotted enemy army and reported back to chudleigh at around 9pm that enemy was within of their position chudleigh was incensed at failure of their scouts he wrote that by intolerable neglect of our lying deputy scout master we were surprised by whole enemy body of horse and foot his problems were worsened by fact that against his orders carriages and oxen needed to transport his artillery had been taken to crediton meaning that if he retreated from okehampton he would have leave his big guns behind after holding a quick meeting chudleigh resolved not to retreat but instead launch a counterattack in his later writings chudleigh suggested that retreat in all probability would have been ruin of whole kingdom battle thumb upright 0 7 left sir ralph hopton led royalist army at sourton down alt a 1626 oil painting of ralph hopton chudleigh opted to leave his main force of 1 000 foot soldiers in okehampton and meet enemy with only his 108 cavalry he led ambush party out to sourton down where he found a valley backed by hills high enough to avoid his army being silhouetted against horizon there he split party into six squadrons of eighteen and they spread out to lay in wait in night s darkness royalist forces approached completely unaware of threat of ambush in his memoirs hopton recalled his belief that his army was handsomest body of men that had been gotten together in those parts all war and were never in better order nor in better he admits that they were not paying enough attention hopton himself lord mohun berkeley and thomas bassett were at head of column carelessly entertaining themselves when ambush was sprung around 11pm on 25 february captain thomas drake led first squadron of cavalry to attack causing panic in royalist column horses had charged out of darkness shouting and firing their carbines which flashed in night cavalrymen had been instructed to make as much noise as possible to try and make it seem like there were more of them hopton s dragoons were predominantly new levies who broke immediately their retreat also routed cavalry travelling behind them and hopton himself was carried away with his men attack coincided with start of a thunderstorm and cornish infantry were spooked and amongst cries that they were fighting devil they scattered many abandoning their weapons in their haste to escape chudleigh s entire force of 108 cavalry had now engaged and initially overwhelmed royalist artillery until slanning was able to counterattack and establish a defensive position amongst ancient earthworks on moor reinforced with sharpened wooden stakes chudleigh avoided engaging fortified position and instead used his cavalry to harry remaining broken royalist forces to prevent them from while he awaited reinforcement of his infantry in okehampton as his infantry arrived royalists spotted lit matches of approaching musketeers and used their cannons to attack them in face of this artillery attack chudleigh s infantry broke before reaching site of battle leaving chudleigh outnumbered he ordered his men to hang lit matches in gorse bushes to cover their retreat back to okehampton royalist leaders had not been able to gain much intelligence about size of enemy force they had faced due to storm and darkness with that in mind along with their losses they opted to hold their position until daybreak they then retreated to a village about south west of sourton down and then later that day back to launceston aftermath routed royalists left behind a large amount of weapons stores and gunpowder during their retreat defeat was particularly humiliating for hopton his portmanteau was among items captured which contained letters from king ordering cornish army to join forces with marquess of hertford and prince maurice in somerset although parliamentarians succeeded in forcing their opponents to retreat they inflicted relatively few fatalities in civil war in south west john barratt suggests that royalists probably only lost between 20 and 100 men in fighting along with around a dozen more who were taken prisoner at least one of those hostages 15 year old captain christopher escaped and managed to round up some of deserters during his return parliamentarians were excited at capture of enemy plans parliamentarian commander in south west earl of stamford was said to have leapt out of his chair for joy despite suffering from gout he raised a large army pulling in troops from garrisons throughout devon and calling in additional reinforcements from somerset to try and win what he believed would be deciding contest of war for west he marched 6 800 strong army into cornwall where they suffered a heavy defeat to royalists in battle of stratton battle decimated parliamentarians army in devon and secured royalist control of cornwall hopton was subsequently able to push into somerset establishing garrisons throughout county which forced parliamentarians to send another force under command of sir william waller into south west to counter them parliamentarians emphasised their victory at sourton down by publishing at least three pamphlets one of which was authorised by house of commons celebrating success and ridiculing royalists retreat pamphlets claimed to be accurate reports of battle but were propaganda which exaggerated number of troops in royalist army and number of fatalities one of reports went so far as to suggest that hopton had been killed in battle claiming that he died of his wound being shot in back in his flight in response royalist poet sir john denham wrote a satirical piece he titled a western wonder mocking exaggerated reports and praising subsequent royalist victory at stratton notes references bibliography category 1643 in england
