lake untersee lower lake is largest surface freshwater lake in interior of gruber mountains of central queen maud land in east antarctica it is situated to southwest of schirmacher oasis lake is approximately long and wide with a surface area of and a maximum depth of lake is permanently covered with ice and is partly bounded by glacier ice lake untersee is an unusual lake with ph between 9 8 and 12 1 dissolved oxygen at 150 percent supersaturation and very low primary production in water column despite high oxygen supersaturation in most of lake there is a small sub basin at southern end that is anoxic and its sediments may have a higher methane concentration than those of any other known lake on earth much of primary production is in microbial communities that grow on floor of lake as stromatolites water temperature varies between and and ice cover on lake is thick ice cover may have persisted for over 100 000 years and some scientists studying climate change fear significant environmental changes associated with global warming in coming decades in past water chemistry of lake has been compared to clorox however chemical activity of bleach is due to cl in addition to a ph that is higher than that measures in lake untersee and lake untersee does not have high chlorine or chlorite concentrations geography lake untersee lies in interior of gruber mountains of central queen maud land in east antarctica which is roughly on same longitude as in skeleton coast national park on northern coast of namibia it is situated 90 kilometres 56 mi to southwest of schirmacher oasis cirque lies at east side of lake lake is approximately long and wide and has a surface area of is also reported its maximum depth is it is permanently covered with ice which has an average thickness of in summer lake is dammed by anuchin glacier and meltwater from anuchin glacier is main source of water lake has no outlet water is lost through sublimation and ablation of ice cover lake is categorized as an ultra oligotrophic lake lake ober see a smaller glacial lake is located a few kilometres to northeast and is similar in most respects history isotope studies have established that lake has long had a permanent ice cover further studies carried out during austral summer confirm lake s homogeneous characteristics with thermal convection as reason given for its hydro geochemical and nature it is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of adjacent glacier ice it is also stated that lake existed during holocene period when it emerged from a melt water pond studies of lake untersee have revealed that there are several large boulders which dam lake geodetic studies carried out during two summer seasons indicated that boulders move at an annual rate of residence time of boulders has been estimated as 500 years floating boulders which are several metres in diameter have evolved as result of debris deposits from pro glacial interaction mass wasting from hills surrounding lake and displacement of glacial ice by lake ice lake was first discovered by german antarctic expedition of 1938 39 after that several expeditions have studied lake s characteristics first reconnaissance study of lake was carried out by n g and d d in early 1969 followed by more studies by russian and german scientists namely by w d et al 1985 e kaup et al 1988 and a et al 1988 research in studies carried out prior to 1991 92 on physical and chemical parameters of lake water lake untersee was stated to be well mixed and however studies performed in summer of 1991 92 found significant stratification in a wide trough in southeastern part of lake where it is up to deep there were sharp vertical gradients of temperature ph dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity while a thermocline was recorded at a depth between and an followed at with a extending from to bottom of lake below water column was anoxic and smelled of hydrogen sulfide presence of hydrogen sulfide was associated with decreased sulfate concentrations indicating that it probably arose from bacterial reduction of sulfate salt content of upper levels of lake is about 50 times that of glacial melt water salinity increased below with sodium ion concentration and electrolytic conductivity more than doubling lake is highly alkaline ph 10 4 down to a depth of below this depth ph drops reaching slightly acidic value of 6 1 at maximum depth proportion of methane in sediment at lake bottom is highest recorded for any lake in world according to nasa scientists in 2008 as part of tawani foundation 2008 antarctic international expedition see below dale andersen and ian hawes discovered conical stromatolites growing in lake untersee largest living ones known to date small microbial pinnacles are also present and it appears that large conical stromatolites and small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities these communities provide an important analog to some of oldest fossil stromatolites found to date expeditions in november and december 2008 tawani foundation 2008 antarctic international expedition headed by richard hoover of nasa s marshall space flight center used lake as a test bed in its hunt for extreme life conditions in lake are similar in some respects to those thought to exist on other moons and planets that contain water ice and methane thus this lake might provide an analog to environments that exist elsewhere in space expedition did find several new strains of extremophile microorganisms in lake s waters including a that metabolises hydrogen this expedition involved an interdisciplinary international team of ten scientists and two teachers who explored not only lake untersee but also schirmacher oasis aspects of this expedition had three objectives to test laser induced fluorescence emission l i f e to be used for exploration of mars regolith and poles monitor global climate change and to evaluate methods for detecting hydrocarbon contamination and subsequent bio remediation in a fragile endangered ecosystem results indicate that lake untersee as a permanently ice covered region has very little usable soil and could be likened to polar regions of mars experiments conducted have examined of eukaryotes identified prokaryotes and viruses inhabiting lake provided evidence of virus mediated horizontal gene transfer and adaptive metabolic or cold protective phenotype alterations identified microbial nanowire connections between multiple species at ice water interface in water column and in sediment and established biomass estimates of life in lake ice during early spring growing season using laser induced fluorescence emission l i f e imaging techniques two scientific divers were also part of this team dale andersen with seti institute s carl sagan center for study of life in universe and ian hawes of aquatic research solutions dived in lake untersee to study its unique microbial communities
