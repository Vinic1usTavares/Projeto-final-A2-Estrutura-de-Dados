piggies is a song by english rock group beatles from their 1968 album beatles also known as white album written by george harrison as a social commentary song serves as an orwellian satire on greed and consumerism among several elements it incorporates from classical music track features harpsichord and orchestral strings in baroque pop style which are contrasted by harrison s acerbic lyrics and sound of grunting pigs although credited to george martin recording was largely produced by chris thomas who also contributed harpsichord part in context of turbulent political climate of 1968 piggies was adopted by counterculture as an anti establishment theme song it was also among tracks on beatles that cult leader charles manson used as foundation for his helter skelter theory of an american race related countercultural revolution inspired especially by line what they need s a damn good whacking manson s followers left clues relating to lyrics at scenes of tate labianca murders in august 1969 piggies has received widely varying responses from music critics and its reputation suffered due to association with manson following latter s trial in 1971 while some reviewers admire its musical qualities and recognise sardonic humour in lyrics others consider song to be mean spirited and lacking in subtlety harrison s demo of song recorded at his home in surrey was included on beatles 1996 compilation anthology 3 a live version by harrison reinstating a verse that was omitted from studio recording appears on his 1992 album live in japan folk singer and activist theo bikel and anarcho punk musician danbert nobacon are among artists who have covered piggies background and inspiration george harrison began writing piggies in early 1966 around time that beatles were recording their album revolver he returned to song two years later after discovering his manuscript in attic of his parents house in liverpool same visit led to harrison starting a new composition while my guitar gently weeps which he similarly completed for inclusion on beatles self titled double album also known as white album upright 6 thumb left in piggies harrison drew from premise of george orwell s dystopian novel animal farm as an anti establishment song piggies recalls harrison s revolver composition taxman in his 1980 autobiography i me mine harrison describes piggies as a social commentary he intended it as a light hearted satire on consumerism and class distinction through its theme of social strata within a community of farm animals in this case one consisting entirely of pigs song references george orwell s 1945 novel animal farm according to harrison s early draft of piggies lyrics contained a final verse subsequently cut for beatles recording that ends with animals paying piggy thanks to thee pig brother musicologist walter everett cites these words as evidence that harrison s main inspiration for song was orwell s work particularly his fable of autocracy masquerading as democracy animal farm while also identifying orwell s book as an influence on composition author ian inglis views piggies as one of several white album songs in which beatles drew inspiration from their childhood in 1940s during harrison s liverpool visit in early 1968 his mother louise responded to his request for assistance with lyrics by providing line what they need s a damn good whacking harrison then taped a demo of song at his house in esher surrey in late may that year following this recording john lennon supplied final phrase in line clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon replacing words to cut their pork chops which harrison had sung on demo version when performing piggies in concert during early 1990s harrison reinstated omitted final verse from 1966 particularly in united states slang usage of word pig had grown from being a derogatory term for a police officer to refer also to consumerism and establishment figures in general this was especially so in 1968 as counterculture became more politically focused coinciding with rise of black power movement and number of mass demonstrations against america s involvement in vietnam war although author jon wiener terms harrison and lennon radicals among beatles citing their past outspokenness about vietnam and their readiness to embrace lsd experimentation and transcendental meditation harrison denied that he was using pig in its new context inglis nevertheless says that song tile alone references countercultural view of police officers composition music piggies features baroque musical elements in its melody and texture music journalist steve smith groups song with paul mccartney written for no one and she s leaving home as examples of beatles forays into baroque pop harrison biographer simon leng recognises composition as essentially a folk song however that was then given a satirical drawing room musical arrangement on official recording by prominence of harpsichord and orchestral strings song s musical key is a its structure comprises two verses a middle eight or bridge section an instrumental passage over verse melody followed by a final verse that leads into a coda or outro and a formal ending in his commentary on piggies musicologist alan pollack remarks on its abundance of classical music traits these include use of arpeggio fragments in harrison s opening guitar motif and repetition of this four bar passage before each verse and bridge a device typical of schubert s various lieder and works of other nineteenth century composers during song expected cycle of fifth notes in major scale is interrupted through inclusion of a c7 chord which first appears at end of passage leading into middle eight before melody drops down a tone to minor ii bm chord same section s first line ends with surprise inclusion of a blues based riff soon after which c7 chord is used again in ascent to iv subdominant chord helping to accentuate phrase damn good whacking as a further example of melody s baroque characteristics bridge contains an implied but unfulfilled of vi in addition over coda recurring four bar instrumental passage is partly shifted to a parallel minor through use of more classically oriented am chord rather than its major equivalent as before following instrumental coda song ends with strings playing a ambiguous cadence which everett describes as an unexpected diminished fourth away from tonic lyrics inglis writes that while nursery rhyme form was harrison s musical source for piggies his lyrics adopt a political perspective creating a savage attack on corporate greed of contemporary capitalism in first verse harrison sings of little piggies for whom life is getting worse in verse two bigger piggies are described as stirring up dirt that those smaller animals crawl in while they themselves are dressed in starched white shirts according to music journalist kit o toole whereas song s harpsichord led introduction suggests a salon featuring royalty in their finery lyrics immediately nullify this image in their depiction of pigs toiling in mud thereby heightening overall satirical effect everett comments that same contrast between refined instrumentation and uncompromising subject matter was later adopted by stevie wonder for his track village ghetto land issued on songs in key of life 1976 during middle eight harrison refers to privileged pigs in their who don t care what goes on around they appear devoid of empathy and therefore deserve a damn good whacking in third verse harrison declares that piggies are everywhere leading piggy lives he presents a final image of couples dining holding their cutlery before devouring bacon production recording thumb right harpsichord an instrument widely associated with classical music features prominently on beatles recording beatles recorded basic track for piggies at emi studios now abbey road studios in london on 19 september 1968 after harrison had performed song alone on esher demo playing acoustic guitar and whistling over solo use of harpsichord on official recording came about through happenstance acting as a producer in george martin s absence on some of white album sessions chris thomas noticed instrument set up in preparation for a later session for a classical recording in emi s studio 1 harrison agreed that a harpsichord part would suit song and so beatles session was moved from studio 2 group taped eleven takes of piggies before achieving requisite performance line up was harrison on acoustic guitar thomas on harpsichord mccartney on bass and ringo starr on tambourine lennon was present at session but with only 4 track recording facilities available in studio 1 and available tracks taken up by other four musicians he did not play on basic track having attended london s royal academy of music as a child thomas performed harpsichord solo in an authentic classical style according to pollack who highlights how melody played by last three fingers of right hand alternates with a repeated note played by thumb overdubbing on 20 september recording was copied over to 8 track tape in studio 2 to allow for overdubbing harrison then added his lead vocal together with harmony vocals on last verse creating a mock operatic chorus over latter section through combination of studio effects and overdubs his vocal performance on song consists of three contrasting segments in inglis description these comprise a naturalistic approach at start of track a distorted middle and chorus singing at end to produce sharp nasal sound over middle eight harrison sang through a filter that limited signal to a narrow 3 5 kilohertz band described by everett as remarkable pitch of harrison s vocals in final verse ranges from a low e bass note in one of harmony parts to a descant falsetto b4 in high harmony part lennon created a tape loop of pre recorded pig noises sourced from emi s library as well as supplying his own grunting sounds drum beats were also added marking transition from solo into third verse final overdubs on song were carried out on 10 october during last week of recording for beatles having returned from his extended holiday martin wrote a string arrangement for four violins two violas and two cellos these parts were recorded during same orchestral overdubbing session as for lennon s track glass onion towards end of piggies harrison added spoken words one more time before orchestra played last two chords in his overview of recording author and critic tim riley interprets thick scouse delivery of this introduction to final grand cadence as harrison smearing social elitists with their own symbols of high culture everett refers to contrast between various classical elements and combination of pig sounds and rude final cadence as representing an orwellian comparison of pigs to socially horrid though outwardly refined tyrants mixing on piggies was completed on 11 october mono mix has animal sounds appearing at different points in song relative to stereo version in addition harrison s guitar is more prominent in mono mix release and reception apple records beatles emi distributed record label released beatles on 22 november 1968 with piggies sequenced as fourth track on side two of double lp it appeared between two other songs with animal names in their titles blackbird and rocky raccoon animal themed sequencing was a deliberate decision on part of lennon and mccartney who prepared running order of album s 30 tracks with martin after harrison had left for los angeles to work with apple signing jackie lomax according to author mark hertsgaard piggies kept beatles countercultural flame alive as song was embraced as an anti authoritarian anthem by counterculture following a year of protests and civil unrest in many western countries among many such events in united states police officers clashed violently with anti vietnam war demonstrators at democratic national convention in chicago in august 1968 david a an american arch conservative paired song with back in u s s r when he accused beatles of being pro communist and leading a move towards revolutionary socialism with white album along with mccartney s rocky raccoon however piggies was also criticised by radical new left as an example of beatles resorting to whimsical parody instead of directly addressing contemporary issues among more conservative elements of british establishment and public release of beatles coincided with a less tolerant attitude towards band harris john cruel britannia in on 19 october two days after 24 hour session to sequence album lennon along with yoko ono was arrested for possession of cannabis lennon described bust as a set up by london drug squad during a radio interview shortly afterwards in los angeles harrison questioned local police department s motto to serve and protect when asked about criminality of smoking marijuana in mid november he represented beatles on smothers brothers comedy hour which was in conflict at time with cbs television network over its political satire and regularly subjected to censorship author john winn describes harrison s guest appearance as an important show of support following richard nixon s recent us election win writing in international times barry miles found piggies unsubtle and likely to appeal to those involved with chicago s pig police william mann of times noted recurring nature theme throughout album from brief mentions of monkeys lizards elephants and tigers to song titles such as blackbird and piggies and asked of harrison s characters are they chicago police or just company directors melody makers alan walsh admired instrumentation on recording and deemed piggies to be beatles satire track a kick at upper class reactionaries or journalists or both in his unfavourable review of white album in new york times mike jahn considered that many of tracks were either so corny or sung in such a way that it is hard to tell whether beatles are being serious among which words of harrison s song served as an act of lyrical overstatement available at rock s backpages subscription required record mirror remarked that birdsong effects of blackbird were replaced by snorts and grunts on piggies which reviewer described as a society beef or pork if you like in style of folk singer roy harper available at rock s backpages subscription required writing in rolling stone jann wenner considered song to be an amazing choice to follow blackbird given contrast between two pieces blackbird so encouraging piggies so smug though accurate what they need s a damn good whacking ha wenner paired it with starr s don t pass me by as lesser tracks beside superb numbers found elsewhere on album but added that on their own they re totally groovy alan smith of nme praised melody and use of classical instrumentation and described song as a telling piece about modern life and a fascinating piece of humorous cynicism charles manson interpretation right upright 65 thumb mugshot of manson taken in 1971 musician and cult leader charles manson interpreted several songs on beatles as an inducement for his followers known as manson family to carry out a series of murders in los angeles in august 1969 inspired by line what they need s a damn good whacking manson adopted piggies as one of tracks to justify such attacks on white bourgeoisie believing that beatles were instructing him through their music manson envisioned these attacks as prelude to an apocalyptic racial war between establishment and black community that would leave him and his followers to rule america on counterculture principles at scenes of murders of sharon tate leno and rosemary labianca gary hinman and others words political piggy pig and death to pigs were written on walls with victims blood in case of leno labianca items of cutlery were inserted into his body in reference to lyric clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon speaking to rolling stone co founder david dalton before his trial manson also drew parallels between pig noises that close track and a similar sound followed by machine gun fire that appears in lennon s white album sound collage revolution 9 like its rival counterculture publications los angeles free press and tuesday s child rolling stone initially supported manson dalton contending that it was a case of conservative minded authorities framing some poor hippie guru according to author steve turner piggies became notorious as a result of manson family s 1971 murder trial which was successfully prosecuted by californian attorney vincent bugliosi harrison was appalled at manson s interpretation of song he also found it disturbing that manson came to define long haired hippie type in public s eyes after prosecution s case had resulted in widespread condemnation of rock music and idealism associated with late 1960s hippie movement paytress mark family misfortunes in in his 1974 book helter skelter bugliosi says he was denied permission to quote from lyrics of piggies in book yet not so for relevant lennon mccartney songs such as helter skelter revolution 1 and blackbird retrospective assessment and legacy writing in 1977 nicholas schaffner said that despite merciless stereotypes presented in its lyrics piggies and harrison s three other white album compositions firmly established him as a contender beside beatles principal songwriters lennon and mccartney four years later philip norman described song as humorous among more recent beatles biographers ian macdonald views piggies as a bludgeoning satire on straight society dismissing it as dreadful and an embarrassing blot on harrison s discography according to author doyle greene writing in his 2016 book on 1960s counterculture beatles and manson are permanently connected in pop culture consciousness as a result of manson having founded his theory of race war on mccartney s helter skelter piggies and other tracks from 1968 double album in his book revolution making of beatles white album david quantick recognises song s musical qualities describing it as a powerful song full of angry climaxes with a fine vocal performance and a charming baroque feel yet he bemoans its arrogant and misanthropic message quantick concludes although beatles preached peace and love and meant it large parts of white album indicate that they could be a bit selective about it ian inglis considers that intentions behind harrison s send up of capitalist consumerism were reasonable and acknowledges sinister connotations that song gained through manson he says that track fails however melodically and lyrically and lacks cohesion in its musical arrangement as well as any subtlety or charm reviewing harrison s career in a 2002 issue of goldmine magazine dave thompson termed piggies whimsically foreboding and grouped it with late period beatles songs such as something and long long long that anticipated harrison s successes as a solo artist after group s break up in 1970 tim riley describes song s narrative as smug anti elitism outdone only by of john s glass onion and sexy sadie with regard to george martin s contention that beatles should have been edited down to a single disc however he views piggies as one of white album essentials contributed by harrison along with while my guitar gently weeps and savoy truffle among reviewers of 2009 remastered album sean of beats per minute cites track as evidence that despite disharmonious atmosphere within group during 1968 all four beatles were working at their highest levels with harrison at his most acerbic on piggies mark richardson of pitchfork media highlights song as one of beatles iffy jokes that nevertheless succeed due to high standard of band s songwriting and effective sequencing of double album coinciding with 50th anniversary of its release jacob of independent listed piggies at number 14 in his ranking of white album s 30 tracks he admired harpsichord passage as a highlight of album and wrote on first listen piggies is too strange to enjoy once its orwellian nature is embraced however it becomes a joyous two fingers in face of establishment told by harrison in baroque pop form other versions theo bikel an actor folk singer and activist who was a delegate at 1968 democratic convention in chicago covered piggies on his 1969 album a new day reviewing opening night of bikel s residency at troubadour in los angeles in june 1970 billboard magazine described song as one of more meaningful titles that singer had adopted from work of popular acts such as beatles rolling stones and donovan 1976 television adaptation of
