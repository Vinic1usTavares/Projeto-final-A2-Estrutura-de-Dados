cassiel watch city unseen and unheard by its human inhabitants they observe and listen to thoughts of berliners including a pregnant woman in an ambulance on way to hospital a young prostitute standing by a busy road and a broken man who feels betrayed by his wife their raison d etre is as cassiel says to assemble testify preserve reality damiel and cassiel have always existed as angels they were in berlin before it was a city and before there were any humans among berliners they encounter in their wanderings is an old man named homer who dreams of an epic of peace cassiel follows old man as he looks for then demolished potsdamer platz in an open field and finds only graffiti covered wall although damiel and cassiel are pure observers visible only to children and incapable of any interaction with physical world damiel begins to fall in love with a profoundly lonely circus trapeze artist named marion she lives by herself in a caravan in west berlin until she receives news that her group circus alekan will be closing down depressed she dances alone to music of crime city solution and drifts through city meanwhile actor peter falk arrives in west berlin to make a film about city s nazi past falk was once an angel who having grown tired of always observing and never experiencing renounced his immortality to become a participant in world also growing weary of infinity damiel s longing is for genuineness and limits of human existence he meets marion in a dream and is surprised when falk senses his presence and tells him about pleasures of human life thumb graffiti on berlin wall is depicted in film damiel is finally persuaded to shed his immortality he experiences life for first time he bleeds sees colours tastes food and drinks coffee meanwhile cassiel taps into mind of a young man just about to commit suicide by jumping off a building cassiel tries to save young man but is unable to do so and is left tormented by experience sensing cassiel s presence falk reaches out to him as he had damiel but cassiel is unwilling to follow their example eventually damiel meets trapeze artist marion at a bar during a concert by nick cave and bad seeds and she greets him and speaks about finally finding a love that is serious and can make her feel complete next day damiel considers how his time with marion taught him to feel amazed and how he has gained knowledge no angel is capable of achieving production development thumb berlin art depicting angels served as an inspiration to filmmakers after living and working in united states for eight years director wim wenders returned to his native west germany and wished to reconnect to it with a film about his favourite part of it west berlin planning to make until end of world in 1985 he realised project would not be ready for two years and wishing to return to photography as soon as possible he considered another project rainer maria rilke s poetry partially inspired story wenders claimed angels seemed to dwell in rilke s poetry and director had also jotted angels in his notes one day and noted angel themed artwork in cemeteries and around berlin in his treatment wenders also considered a backstory in which god exiled his angels to berlin as punishment for defending humans after 1945 when god had decided to forsake them wenders employed peter handke who wrote much of dialogue poetic narrations and film s recurring poem song of childhood wenders found names damiel and cassiel in an encyclopedia about angels and also had photographs of solveig dommartin bruno ganz and otto sander that served as muses idea that angels could read minds led to wenders considering personal dialogue no one would say aloud wenders did not view angel protagonist as representative of himself instead deciding angel could be an embodiment of film and that purpose of film could be to help people by opening their eyes to possibilities handke did not feel able to write a single coherent story but promised to regularly send notes on ideas during production screenwriter richard also assisted wenders in scripting scenes around handke s contributions given nature of this arrangement wenders would hold daily meetings with his crew frequently at late hours to plan logistics for following day french producer anatole dauman did not see a large budget as necessary and project was funded with 5 million dm casting actor role damiel marion cassiel homer aged poet himself credited as der nick cave and bad seeds themselves crime city solution themselves wenders believed it would be important for actors playing two main angel characters to be familiar and friendly with each other ganz and sander had performed in some of same stage productions for 20 years sander and ganz also recommended curt bois to wenders and asked bois to perform bois performance as homer marked his final feature film in an 80 year career beginning as a child actor peter falk s role was not planned until photography had already begun with wenders planning an artist or political official to have an analogous role until assistant claire denis suggested columbo star would be familiar to everyone falk described part as craziest thing that i ve ever been offered but quickly agreed he was accustomed to improvisation newly created role required and when wenders and falk met they conceived ideas of character sketching and searching for a hat nick cave and his band were based in west berlin with wenders calling him a real berlin hero and deciding it was inconceivable for me to make a film in berlin without showing one of his concerts filming film was shot by henri alekan whose cinematography represents angels point of view in monochrome as they cannot see colours and switches to colour to show human point of view during filming alekan used a very old and fragile silk stocking that had belonged to his grandmother as a filter for monochromatic sequences adding a touch of sepia to black and white wenders felt it was natural that angels without experience of physical world would not see colour and also thought black and white cinematography by alekan would provide a novel view of berlin a challenge in cinematography was posed by using camera for perception of angels as angels are not restrained in how far they can observe in any dimension story s circus alekan is named in cinematographer s honour filming took place at actual locations in west berlin such as hans s berlin state library though wall was recreated in studio due to shooting true wall being outlawed some pieces of recreation were made from inexpensive wood with one being destroyed by rain during production with little idea of how to portray angels and no costume design wenders said filmmakers consulted artwork experimented and found idea of armor during production and told u s filmmaker brad silberling they did not decide on overcoats until later hairstyle was loosely inspired by a photograph of a japanese warrior although circus scenes required extensive and risky acrobatics dommartin was able to learn trapeze and rope moves in a mere eight weeks and did all work herself without a stunt double during production filmmakers called german police after falk went missing falk had been spending hours exploring west berlin and was discovered in a cafe post production peter handke arrived in west berlin during editing process led by peter handke believed it bordered on a silent film aside from some music and lacked much of notes he had sent to wenders during filming handke thus proposed adding his writings via voice over after falk left berlin he recorded much of his voice over in a sound studio in los angeles much of this was improvised though wenders still supervised by telephone with filming performed in lengthy takes and camera used as eye of angel much of movement was conveyed in camerawork rather than in editing effects there was five hours of footage to edit down to final cut a pie fight between stars was filmed for final scene but later edited out composer jurgen knieper assumed harps and violins would suffice for a score for a film about angels until he saw a cut of film seeing angels were discontent he wrote a different score employing a choir voices and whistling laurent petitgand contributed circus music an ensemble work performed with accordions saxophones and keyboards themes and interpretations thumb story contains similarities to fallen angel concept though unrelated to evil concept of angels spirits or ghosts who help humans on earth had been common in cinema from here comes mr jordan 1941 to 1946 works it s a wonderful life and a matter of life and death many earlier u s and u k films demonstrate high amounts of reverence while others allow reasonable amounts of fun powell and pressburger s a matter of life and death presents an early example of spirits being jealous of lives of humans shift from monochrome to colour to distinguish angels reality from that of mortals was also used in powell and pressburger s film while wings of desire does not portray berliners as living in a utopia academic roger cook wrote that fact that people have pleasure gives as english title suggests wings to desire god is not mentioned in film and is only referred to in sequel faraway so close when angels state a purpose to connect humans with him scholars robert phillip kolker and peter beickene attributed apparent lack of god to new age beliefs remarking damiel s fall is similar to story of lucifer though not related to evil reviewer jeffrey overstreet concurred that wenders had left his church upbringing behind and cinematic angels are inventions he could craft to his specifications with little regard for biblical beliefs overstreet characterized them as whimsical metaphors characters who have lost joy of sensual human experience nevertheless professor craig detweiler believed sky level view of berlin and idea of guardian angels evoke god authors martin brady and joanne leal added that even if damiel is tempted by seemingly profane things atmosphere of berlin means human damiel is still in a place of poetry myth and religion in one scene damiel and cassiel meet to share stories in their observations with their function revealed to be one of preserving past professor alexander graf wrote this connects them to cinema with wenders noting wings of desire itself depicts or shows places in berlin that have since been destroyed or altered including a bridge potsdamer platz and wall closing titles state dedicated to all former angels but especially to yasujiro francois and andrej all references to wenders fellow filmmakers yasujiro ozu francois truffaut and andrei tarkovsky these directors had all died before release of film with kolker and beickene arguing they were an influence on wenders ozu had taught wenders order truffaut observation of people especially youth and tarkovsky a less clear influence on wenders consideration of morality and beauty identifying directors as angels could tie in with film characters function to record left thumb yasujiro ozu one of film dedication s angels academic laura marcus believed a connection between cinema and print is also established in angels affinity for libraries as wenders portrays library as a tool of memory and public space making it a miraculous place depiction of damiel by using a pen or an immaterial pen to write song of childhood is also tribute to print and literacy introducing or as marcus hypothesized perhaps even releasing visual images that follow kolker and beickene interpreted use of poetry as part of screenwriter peter handke s efforts to elevate language above common rhetoric to spiritual reviewing poetry detweiler remarked that handke s song of childhood bears parallels to st paul s 1 corinthians 13 when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child professor terrie waddell added that poem established centrality of childhood as a key theme noting that children can see angels and accept them without question tying them in with phenomenon of imaginary friends film has also been read as a call for german reunification which followed in 1990 essayists david caldwell and paul rea saw it as presenting a series of two opposites east and west angel and human male and female wenders angels are not bound by wall reflecting east and west berlin s shared space though east berlin remains primarily black and white scholar martin believed film presumed reunification would never happen and contemplated its statements on divides including territorial and higher divides physicality and spirituality art and reality black and white and colour researcher helen stoddart in discussing depiction of circus and trapeze artist marion in particular submitted that marion is classic circus character creating an image of danger and then potential stoddart argued that homer and marion may find future in what remains of history found in berlin stoddart considered circular nature of story including a parallel between angel who cannot see physical damiel and faux angel marion who can see faces marion also observes that all directions lead to wall and final french dialogue we have embarked while screen states to be continued suggests final movement to a new beginning style thumb upright rainer maria rilke s poetry influenced concept and style british film institute writer leigh singer assessed cinematic style as bold and artistic in its use of colour existential voiceover and languorous pacing singer also commented on use of symbolism and combinations of diverse pieces of culture from poetry of rainer maria rilke to music of nick cave in singer s estimation cinematography is able to communicate angels invisible intimacy and empathy professor terrie waddell described dialogue and monologue as lyrical in mold of rilke s poetry scholar alexander graf considered how these voice overs and verbal exchanges are frequently combined with background radio and television sounds and concluded image and soundtrack that comprise style convey a point of blindness men and women are plagued by their everyday problems children are like angels in their own dreamy world professor russell j a kilbourn judged style as opposed to realism and emphatically german in looking at particular situations of human life authors martin brady and joanne leal remarked storytelling shies away from an entirely narrative format and film s writing style is embodied in homer character as angel of story telling perception of people becomes key to storytelling with brady and leal quoting handke s vision for a new narrative you have only interpreted and changed world what matters is to describe it psychologist ryan wrote that by focusing on beauty of each moment wings of desire conveys awe and wonder as singer observed wings of desire serves as a symphony of a city in capturing a wintry pre unification berlin kilbourn said that place highlighted in german title der himmel uber berlin like desire referenced in english title is of great importance and that frequent angel s eye view shots of east and west berlin allows for quasi objective voyeuristic surveillance observing angels trench coat fashion sociologist andrew greeley wrote it fit wet blustery cold northern germany setting looking at coats and dr detweiler found visualization of angels so cool and stylish music is used in differing ways throughout story musicologist annette davison argued knieper s score in angel scenes is artistic with elements of eastern european and orthodox christian music and petitgand s music displays a slippery harmony frequently heard in circus entertainment when marion leaves circus alekan there is an increase in rock music particularly by cave and crime city solution davison submitted this symbolizes utopian promise of sensual mortal world and that lyrics echo plot cave s carny suggests a disappearing carnival worker as circus alekan closes and from her to eternity suggests a desire for a woman s love professor adrian danks wrote that cave s rock music symbolized physical worldly reality of berlin with carny adding a feel of sorrow in background while marion gives breathy accompaniment release
