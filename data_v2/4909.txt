george elsworth smith 1862 1905 was an american gambler and thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast who became a multi millionaire during late nineteenth and early twentieth century smith was given nickname pittsburgh phil in 1885 by chicago gambler william silver bill riley to differentiate him from other smiths that also frequented riley s pool halls pittsburgh phil is considered by many handicappers to have been an expert strategist winning large sums of money at a time when racing statistic publications such as daily racing form were not widely available at time of his death from tuberculosis in 1905 he had amassed a fortune worth 3 250 000 which is comparable to us today his racing maxims published posthumously in 1908 are considered to be foundations of many modern handicapping strategies and formulas early life and initial occupation family george elsworth and mcgill 1 p mccarthy and mcgill source spells his middle name with only one l while later newspaper

george smith s sister anne married and had a son named james christian mcgill 1880 1972 mcgill was orphaned at a young age when his parents died in mid 1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised along with his infant sister eleanor by mrs smith and george smith smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters cole pp 1 consequently much of published biographical information on pittsburgh phil s early life his rise to fame and reasoning behind his methods on track comes from interviews with his nephew james mcgill who was a close confidant in ten years preceding george smith s death mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 10 cork cutting and early sporting exploits thumb cork blocking initial occupation of smith at a pittsburgh cork factory in early 1900s smith family initially lived on a small farm in sewickley pennsylvania but moved in 1872 to allegheny city when george smith was 10 years old smiths eventually settled in neighborhood of pleasant valley mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 25 which was located across ohio river from pittsburgh in present day city neighborhood of california kirkbride george smith s father died within a year in late 1872 or 1873 which created financial hardships for his mother and sisters and resulted in george going to work at age of 12 at local cork cutting factory possibly armstrong cork co for 5 per week smith was not happy with this occupation once remarking on banality of profession later in life i thought i could do a little better than cutting corks inasmuch as i knew how to divide six by two cole p 9 smith set aside money from his weekly pay after giving majority to his mother to purchase and train gamecocks hiding fowl from his devout roman catholic mother and sisters who greatly disapproved of gambling he also bet on outcomes of national league baseball games in pittsburgh pool halls and would attribute his often sizable winnings to pay raises at cork factory most of pool halls in 1870s pittsburgh also broadcast horse races via telegraph often colorful race descriptions soon captured young smith s attention and he wrote down and stockpiled names and times of winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts in fall of 1879 smith placed his first bet on a 5 1 odds horse named gabriel running in a race at brighton beach racetrack at coney island he won 38 when horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while race was run determined that he could win at horse racing smith quit his job at cork factory and accrued more than 5 000 from betting on horse races in next two years hiding proceeds under his mattress at home upon his mother eventually discovering money he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on past performances of horses and not merely guessing by 1885 smith had become one of most touted gamblers in pittsburgh and had won over 100 000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand however smith was becoming too famous in pittsburgh he could not maintain favorable high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in crowd would lower odds by betting his choices pittsburgh phil a new name first horse race that smith witnessed live was 1885 kentucky derby in which joe cotton was favorite and won at 4 5 odds but he did not bet on outcome smith decided that best gambling prospects at time were in chicago and made his way to william silver bill riley s in late 1885 riley was a civil war veteran from brooklyn with prematurely gray hair that owned one of first clubs in chicago dedicated to betting on horse racing it was riley that saddled smith with nickname pittsburgh phil on their first meeting to differentiate george smith s bets from rest of room full of smiths riley usually named his customers based on their appearances but by mcgill s reckoning he chose name pittsburgh phil because smith was from pittsburgh and phil was short for philadelphia smith quickly gained a reputation as being one of most successful plungers or men that bet large sums of money on races in chicago within a few years he relocated to new york city and focused most of his betting operations out of new york tracks mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 75 king cadmus and parvenu smith also purchased and raced thoroughbred horses under name pleasant valley stable his racing colors during early 1890s were royal purple and canary yellow mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 76 smith s brother bill became his principal horse trainer during 1890s and early 1900s one of his most successful horses was a two year old bay colt named king cadmus smith purchased king cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for 4 000 at stable dispersal sale of late august belmont colt was a son of kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named king crab horse only won two races in his entire racing career but smith won 195 000 from cadmus two victories first win occurred on september 3 1891 at sheepshead bay race track and resulted in smith winning approximately 115 000 which was largest payout from a horse race recorded in us at that time cadmus other win occurred at morris park racetrack in 1892 with smith netting another 80 000 king cadmus was a fast runner but he had a vicious temperament seriously injuring several of smith s employees in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three year old in 1892 parvenu sired by out of necromancy was purchased by smith in 1891 as a two year old and was initially considered to be a poor racing prospect by general public due to his repeated losses early in season however smith saw potential in colt and recognized that he could win a large amount of money if horse could win a race against high odds on august 29 1892 parvenu was entered in a race at sheepshead bay and was given 30 1 initial odds by bookmakers which would have won smith close to 300 000 however all bets had to be rescinded before start of race because there was a miscalculation of horse handicapping weights causing odds on parvenu to drop to 10 1 in new pool as a result smith only won 50 000 but despite this mishap smith was rewarded when horse won nine consecutive races netting approximately 200 000 before parvenu was retired at age four due to a spinal injury mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 68 thumb left jockeys skeets martin left and tod sloan at morris park racetrack in 1899 professional relationship with tod sloan smith employed several jockeys on a race to race basis during his career as a thoroughbred owner including henry skeets martin fred edward garrison and samuel doggett however smith considered tod sloan to be best jockey in his employ and commissioned rider to race in only his colors from 1895 to 1897 new york times suburban for dwyer june 23 1897 mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 69 smith met sloan in fall of 1895 at a san francisco racetrack after sloan had been suspended for ten days for trying to beat barrier or disregarding starting barrier that had recently been adopted at us tracks smith was taken with sloan s unique riding style later termed monkey crouch that redistributed rider s weight over neck and withers and allowed horses to run faster however smith did not trust bookmakers at california tracks and suspected them as well as trainers of rampant cheating and paying off jockeys to not win on certain horses consequently smith paid sloan 500 for every race he won insuring that his jockey would always be trying to win on any of smith s mounts mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 70 sloan returned to new york with smith in 1896 where he became one of top jockeys on east coast giving smith most profitable years of his career smith soon tired of sloan s off track antics which included lavish parties and often arrogant statements that questioned smith s judgment on track a case in point was sloan s behavior prior to running of 1897 brooklyn handicap which occurred over a sloppy mud laden track that year sloan had won several races on belmar a gray 5 year old by belvidere and felt confident that horse would win brooklyn handicap openly criticizing smith s choice of howard mann in front of his other employees however smith knew that belmar was not a fast runner in mud and that sloan would not push horse to win because he disliked being splattered with mud mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 71 smith instead put skeets martin who was better at racing on sloppy tracks on 4 year old howard mann he advised martin to use your own judgment with this horse and don t bother about belmar tod probably won t be anywhere near you after first hundred yards howard mann won easily winning 50 000 for smith while belmar finished in 8th place when james r keene asked smith in late 1897 for permission to take sloan to england to race in cambridgeshire handicap smith accepted offer sloan achieved great success while racing in england but he lost his racing license permanently in 1900 sloan and smith remained friends after dissolving their partnership later loaning sloan 5 000 without interest after his license was revoked after sloan s departure smith used skeets martin as his principal jockey but in 1899 martin also left us for better racing prospects in england willie shaw was ultimately hired to replace sloan and raced for smith from 1899 until 1903 suspension smith kept few horses in 1902 and consequently allowed james r keene to employ willie shaw for much of season while his overall percentage of wins was still high shaw lost some races in a way that general public thought was suspicious and he was accused of not trying to win shaw s poor performance was soon linked to some action on smith s part and he was accused of paying jockey to lose a claim which smith vehemently denied mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 53 in may 1903 shaw was suspended by jockey club for presumed listless riding on illyria at a may 6 race at jamaica racetrack on june 24 1903 smith was also banned from entering his horses in races overseen by jockey club he admitted to no wrongdoing and he suspected ban was a hold over from willie shaw s suspension and resulted from jockey club s increased efforts to remove plungers from their tracks smith continued to make bets notably securing 60 000 when won 1903 suburban handicap but had sold his stable to e e by end of year personal life smith lived in moderation compared to other horsemen of era with only outward display of ostentation being a diamond ring that he would wear to track engagements mccarthy and mcgill 1 p 24 smith also did not smoke and only drank an occasional glass of wine sloan and luckman p 27 he socialized with very few women and was considered to be a confirmed bachelor by his family he was adamant about not bringing women to racetracks even his own mother including a reference to their distracting influence on men in his maxims a man who wishes to be successful cannot divide his attentions between horses and women a man who accepts responsibility of escorting a woman to race track and of seeing that she is comfortably placed and agreeably entertained cannot keep his mind on his work before him a sensible woman understands this and cannot feel hurt at my words cole p 19 however smith did court daisy dixon an aspiring actress and chorus girl from chicago in 1896 courtship turned sour after he caught her cavorting with his jockey and notorious ladies man tod sloan dixon later married fellow gambler riley who eventually died broke in rawhide nevada in 1908 according to mcgill smith never had an interest in another woman after dixon s betrayal methods smith took notice of every detail in horse racing he kept detailed notes of which horses were good runners during muddy conditions and always inspected horses at end of a race to look for subtle signs of lameness or impediments i e loose girth straps that may have negatively impacted a horse s speed as he became more famous and seemingly successful bookmakers would often refuse to place his bets outright for fear of losing money when he won as a result smith conducted most of his betting through beards or men that he would commission to place bets for him smith tried to keep identity of his beards a secret and never revealed their identities even to his other commissioners his movements were continuously followed by agents for bookmakers and by pinkerton detectives employed by jockey club they wanted to know everything i did and was going to do that never made me mad because it was business on their part just as it was business for me to mislead spies i rarely have been able to keep same set of betting commissioners for any length of time a few bets and my commissioners were pointed out and watched scott and suchlicki p 51 smith rarely wrote down his bets and relied on his memory to serve him when he won and had to collect his money from numerous commissioners that placed his bets with bookmakers sloan and luckman p 165 death and legacy thumb 1916 kentucky derby winner george smith was named after pittsburgh phil by fall of 1903 smith began curtailing his turf activities for frequent trips to adirondacks and hot springs to rest his family

smith traveled to sanitarium in asheville north carolina for treatment of his worsening cough a result of advanced tuberculosis george e smith died at sanitarium on february 1 1905 his death was attributed to shattering of his nerves instead of tuberculosis due to his habit of never showing emotion smith was interred in union dale cemetery in pittsburgh a short distance from his childhood home in allegheny his funeral occurred on february 5 during a snowstorm and was attended by many people he was entombed in a stone mausoleum that reportedly cost 30 000 to build and was built to smith
