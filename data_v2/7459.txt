lafler v cooper 566 u s 156 2012 was a united states supreme court case in which court clarified sixth amendment standard for reversing convictions due to ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining court ruled that when a lawyer s ineffective assistance leads to rejection of a plea agreement a defendant is entitled to relief if outcome of plea process would have been different with competent advice in such cases court ruled that sixth amendment requires trial judge to exercise discretion to determine an appropriate remedy anthony cooper was charged by state of michigan with assault with intent to murder and three other offenses after being incorrectly advised by his lawyer that prosecution would be unable to prove intent to murder he rejected a plea bargain after being convicted at a fair trial he appealed his conviction arguing that his lawyer had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by advising him to reject plea deal michigan courts denied him relief but federal courts granted a writ of habeas corpus requiring state to reduce cooper s sentence to one he would have received under plea agreement state appealed to supreme court which agreed to hear case writing for 5 4 majority justice kennedy ruled that ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations can constitute grounds for relief if there is a fair probability that defense counsel s ineffective assistance resulted in a harsher sentence or conviction in those cases justice kennedy wrote trial judges should exercise discretion in choosing to vacate a conviction and accept original plea bargain resentence defendant or leave original conviction undisturbed justice scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by justice thomas and chief justice roberts in large part which argued that majority had invented a constitutional right to plea bargain justice alito also wrote a dissenting opinion in which he largely agreed with justice scalia and specifically argued that majority s remedy was unsound reactions following supreme court s ruling were mixed with some commentators praising court s recognition of role of plea bargaining in criminal justice and others criticizing implications of not sufficiently protecting defendants rights and of requiring defense counsel to plea bargain at desire of prosecutor background ineffective assistance of counsel assistance of counsel clause of sixth amendment to united states constitution provides that in all criminal prosecutions accused shall enjoy right to have assistance of counsel for his defence u s const amend vi supreme court has interpreted clause to require states to provide indigent criminal defendants with counsel in strickland v washington controlling supreme court decision on ineffective assistance of counsel court ruled that simply having a person who happens to be a lawyer present at trial alongside accused is not enough to satisfy constitutional command strickland court determined that a conviction may be reversed for ineffective assistance of counsel if defendant shows that counsel s performance was deficient such that counsel s errors were so serious that counsel was not functioning as counsel guaranteed defendant by sixth amendment performance prong and counsel s performance gives rise to a reasonable probability that if counsel had performed adequately result would have been different prejudice prong strickland 466 u s at 693 694 michigan trial court on march 25 2003 anthony cooper shot kali mundy repeatedly under waist injuring but not killing her cooper was charged with assault with intent

later rejected offer and went to trial at trial cooper was convicted on all counts and received a sentence of 185 to 360 months imprisonment lafler v cooper cooper later gave evidence his attorney had inaccurately advised him that he could not be convicted of assault with intent to murder because he shot victim below waist state trial court heard and rejected cooper s motion for resentencing not finding that his attorney s defective advice to reject plea agreement constituted ineffective assistance of counsel state court appeals cooper appealed to michigan court of appeals renewing his claim that his attorney s incorrect advice during plea bargaining constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in a per curiam opinion issued on march 15 2005 court of appeals affirmed rejection of claim

for leave to file an appeal which it denied on october 31 2005 because we are not persuaded that questions presented should be reviewed by this court people v cooper 474 mich 905 705 n w 2d 118 2005 federal habeas proceedings cooper filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in united states district court for eastern district of michigan again renewing his claim that his attorney s advice to

violation and that remedy of specific performance was proper cooper v lafler 376 f appx 563 6th cir 2010 supreme court state appealed to supreme court filing a petition for certiorari on january 7 2011 supreme court agreed to hear case granting certiorari and directing parties to brief and argue following question in addition to question presented in petition for certiorari what remedy if any should be provided for ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargain negotiations if defendant was later convicted and sentenced pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures lafler v cooper 562 u s 1127 131 s ct 856 178 l ed 2d 622 2011 cert granted arguments for supreme court s review both parties agreed that first strickland prong had been satisfied that is parties agreed that cooper s trial counsel had performed deficiently central disagreement was on whether cooper had satisfied strickland prejudice prong lafler 566 u s at 174 state argued that cooper did not suffer any prejudice from his counsel s deficient performance because constitution does not guarantee defendants a right to a plea agreement and that far from being prejudiced cooper had exercised his constitutional right to stand trial by rejecting plea deal because cooper had received a fair trial after pleading not guilty state argued cooper s rights had not been violated lafler 566 u s at 164 165 cooper argued that even though there is no right to a plea agreement itself criminal defendants have right to be assisted by competent counsel during plea negotiations accordingly cooper argued that criminal defendants can be prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations even if subsequent trial was fair cooper also pointed out that every federal court of appeals to have considered issue and 25 of 27 states to have considered issue agreed that counsel s deficient performance during plea negotiations can constitute strickland prejudice brief of respondent anthony cooper at 19 20 lafler v cooper in response to supreme court s order directing parties to argue what remedy would be appropriate state argued that no remedy was appropriate state wrote that courts should not order prosecutions to offer a particular plea agreement because doing so would constitute a breach of separation of powers and discretion inherent in plea process state also argued that allowing criminal defendants any remedy would open floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions lafler 566 u s at 172 brief of petitioner blaine lafler at 20 lafler v cooper cooper argued that allowing defendant to accept plea agreement was appropriate remedy putting defendant in same position as if counsel had not performed deficiently opinion of court right 175px thumb justice kennedy delivered opinion of 5 4 majority justice kennedy delivered opinion of court on march 21 2012 in a 5 4 decision supreme court vacated sixth circuit s opinion and remanded for further consideration relying on his opinion in missouri v frye which was also decided same day justice kennedy wrote that sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to plea negotiations lafler 566 u s at 160 court ruled that to establish prejudice and obtain relief a defendant must show that but for ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that plea offer would have been presented to court i e that defendant would have accepted plea and prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening circumstances that court would have accepted its terms and that conviction or sentence or both under offer s terms would have been less severe than under judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed lafler 566 u s at 164 as to remedy for ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations court wrote that any remedy should be tailored to injury suffered from constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests lafler 566 u s at 170 quoting united states v morrison 449 u s 361 364 1981 court noted that injury from deficient counsel during plea bargaining can come in at least one of two forms losing a lesser sentence and losing opportunity to plead guilty to counts less serious than ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial lafler 566 u s at 170 171 in cases where sole advantage a defendant would have received under plea is a lesser sentence supreme court ruled that courts should exercise discretion in determining whether defendant should receive term of imprisonment government offered in plea sentence he received at trial or something in between when resentencing alone will not be full redress for constitutional injury proper exercise of discretion to remedy constitutional injury may be to require prosecution to reoffer plea proposal lafler 566 u s at 171 applying those standards to cooper s case supreme court ruled that cooper had established that he had been prejudiced by his counsel s deficient performance turning to remedy court ruled that district court should require prosecution to re offer plea deal and then decide whether to resentence cooper dissents justice scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by justice thomas and chief justice roberts as to all but part iv lafler 566 u s at 175 187 scalia j dissenting in a rare move scalia read his dissent from bench calling court s holding absurd and unheard of scalia argued that by reversing a conviction following a full dress criminal trial with its innumerable constitutional and statutory limitations upon evidence that prosecution can bring forward and in michigan as in most states requirement of a unanimous guilty verdict by impartial jurors lafler 566 u s at 186 scalia j dissenting majority transformed plea bargaining from being an embarrassing necessary evil to being an embraced constitutionally protected institution of criminal justice system justice scalia remarked that sixth amendment was designed to protect fair trials and that errors which do not impact fairness of a trial cannot constitute strickland prejudice lafler 566 u s at 178 scalia j dissenting impairment of fair trial is how we distinguish between unfortunate attorney error and error of constitutional significance he noted that majority s remedy which left to discretion of trial judge specific relief was unprecedented in history of court s criminal justice jurisprudence lafler 566 u s at 183 scalia j dissenting finally he argued that granting relief would violate antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 which prohibits federal courts from granting relief unless state court issued a decision contrary to or which involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by supreme court of united states lafler 566 u s at 181 quoting d 1 scalia j dissenting justice alito also wrote a dissenting opinion which largely agreed with justice scalia s analysis justice alito then wrote weakness in court s analysis is highlighted by its opaque discussion of remedy that is appropriate when a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal representation lafler 566 u s at 187 188 alito j dissenting reception reactions to supreme court s decision were mixed lawyers on all sides of issue were surprised by broadness of court s ruling an article published in federal sentencing reporter argued that government had won by losing by requiring defense lawyers to bargain at behest of prosecutor brennan center for justice wrote that decision could incentivize defense counsel to advise accepting first plea bargain their clients are offered for fear of being labelled ineffective by a court deciding that rejecting plea was disadvantageous with advantage of hindsight but also noted that decision represented a triumph of realism and justice over narrow legalism and formalism articles published by notre dame law review and university of chicago public law legal theory research paper series argued that court had not done enough to protect defendants rights while an article published in mississippi law journal criticized court for possibly neglecting fundamental goal of sixth amendment right to a fair trial ruling was described as creating a new body of constitutional law and was seen as broadly impactful
