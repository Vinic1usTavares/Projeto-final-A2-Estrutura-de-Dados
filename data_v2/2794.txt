to 1964 with largely same cast by time new series began television had become dominant broadcasting medium in britain and round horne which built up a regular audience of 15 million was last radio show to reach so many listeners horne was surrounded by larger than life characters including camp pair julian and sandy disreputable eccentric j peasmold gruntfuttock and singer of dubious folk songs rambling syd rumpo who all became nationally familiar show encountered periodic scrutiny from bbc management for its double entendres but consistently received backing of director general of bbc sir hugh greene horne died suddenly in 1969 bbc decided that round horne could not continue without its star and they cancelled plans for a fifth series that year over following decades round horne has been re broadcast continually and all 67 shows have been published on cd in 2019 in a poll run by radio times round horne was voted bbc s third best radio show of any genre and best radio comedy

merriman and barry took and when series came to an end they prepared a script for a pilot episode of a new show beyond our ken show in which horne was joined by kenneth williams ron moody hugh paddick and betty marsden was broadcast in october 1957 series was due to begin in april 1958 but in february horne suffered a debilitating stroke he was temporarily paralysed down his left hand side and lost power of speech bbc postponed series after physiotherapy horne was able to begin recording beyond our ken in june in preparation for broadcast of first series between july and november beyond our ken was written around imperturbable establishment figure of horne while other performers played a spectrum of characters never before heard on radio including exaggeratedly upper class rodney and charles williams and paddick genteel dotty pensioners ambrose and felicity williams and marsden hoarse voiced cook fanny haddock a parody of television cook fanny cradock marsden earthy gardening guru arthur fallowfield williams semi articulate rock and roll singer ricky livid paddick and flowered a parody of comedian frankie howerd bill pertwee first episode was not well received by a sample audience but bbc decided to back horne and his team and initial six week contract was extended to 21 weeks before series came to an end a second had been commissioned to run following year after first series moody was succeeded by pertwee took left after second series leaving merriman to write remaining programmes on his own thumb upright feldman in 1972 after seventh series of beyond our ken ended horne was scheduled to appear in a number of other bbc programmes eric merriman objected contending that he had made horne into a star and that no other comedy series should be allowed to use him according to horne s biographer barry johnston when bbc refused to withdraw horne from programme down with women merriman resigned from writing beyond our ken and show came to an end after some pressure from horne to keep remainder of team together bbc commissioned round horne as a replacement on similar lines they turned to took as one of original writers of beyond our ken and his new writing partner marty feldman name of programme came from a pun on horne s name combined with naval term round horn meaning to navigate waters at southern tip of south america cape horn pair aimed to write what they described as down market material in an upmarket way scripts they produced led to a faster paced programme than beyond our ken which included more allusions to contemporary events including politics and films format round horne was based on a revue format and contained parody and satire programme would include an introduction from horne who would sometimes give answers to a supposed quiz from previous week and then lead into sketches that would include a set piece based on a film or novel such as man with golden thunderball and three musketeers martin dibbs in his history of bbc variety department writes that show was characterised by incessant innuendo and camp representation to an extent never before tolerated within bbc as in beyond our ken there was a cast of recurring characters took and feldman developed new characters for williams paddick marsden and pertwee whose ability to change between personas produced a programme described by radio historians andy foster and steve furst as a cast of thousands played by same four accomplished actors horne s role was described in daily telegraph as providing perfect foil to inspired lunacy happening all around him media analysts frank and steve neale consider that as such horne s role was similar to that of jack benny fred allen and tommy handley as a stooge rather than a joke wielder frequently switching roles between announcer and in sketch performer broadcasts 1965 1966 series 1 and 2 first episode of round horne was broadcast on light programme on 7 march 1965 it was described in radio times as five characters in search of authors series consisted of 16 episodes and ran to 20 june 1965 programme was produced by john simmonds and included music from fraser hayes four and studio orchestra hornblowers conducted by paul fenoulhet from episode six fenoulhet was replaced by edwin braden douglas smith an announcer and newsreader on home service and third programme was used as programme s announcer but was given a larger role as series progressed he ended up advertising spoof products and giving human sound effects in addition to his normal role one of early episodes included a sketch by horne a monologue based on centenary of birth of crumpet including a huge crumpet built for queen victoria as an added novelty he hollowed out centre and a gaiety girl was secreted inside when loyal toast was drunk she leapt out wearing pink combs and waving a union jack either that or other way round i don t remember in any event whole affair was a great success and as many people commented afterwards it was a smashing bit of crumpet sketch angered strongly conservative member of parliament sir cyril black who wrote to bbc to complain frank gillard bbc s director of radio wrote to dennis morris chief of light programme asking round horne to watch its step particularly over next few weeks and keep itself within reasonable bounds instead took and feldman wrote a riposte that horne read at end of following programme addressed to minority of who complained let me say to them that our scripts are whiter than white as is face of producer when he reads them you see evil is in eye of beholder and we believe you can make anything sound as if it has a double meaning if you know how so cheerio see you next week further complaints about programme were received and sir hugh greene director general of bbc asked to see scripts before broadcasting all were returned with words i see nothing to object to in this written on them complaints continued from black and from mary whitehouse a campaigner against social liberalism about cast putting emphasis on certain words took replied that when laurence olivier plays hamlet he puts emphasis on certain words it s called acting a second series was commissioned and ran for thirteen weeks from sunday 13 march to 5 june 1966 programme was recorded in front of a studio audience and williams would play up to them with physical humour causing hilarity in studio simmonds spoke to cast telling them that radio audience were hearing unexplained laughter and to try to keep visual pranks to a minimum at end of series roy rich head of bbc light entertainments for radio spoke to took feldman horne and williams and discussed possible changes to programme including removal of fraser hayes four and possible changing of pertwee and marsden no changes were made before next series was commissioned on 7 october 1966 at age of 59 horne suffered a severe heart attack he was much weakened and was unfit to work for three months as a result he did not appear in round horne christmas special which was recorded on 28 november he returned to work in january 1967 to record third series 1967 1968 series 3 and 4 third series ran for 21 episodes from 5 february to 25 june 1967 after recording first episode williams wrote in his diary that script was singularly uninspired i think no innovations or bright ideas for beginning of a new series for first time i am beginning to feel that this show is rather dated and tired bbc hierarchy also thought first show was slightly lacking and williams was also downbeat after second recording writing that i think show is quite dead artistically and format has completely atrophied itself it is moribund now i think i will withdraw after this series trying to turn show around took and feldman wrote out popular camp julian and sandy characters played by paddick and williams from third episode but cast and simmonds all insisted they were put back so writers duly obliged after a few weeks show had settled down and williams recorded in his diary that recording went v well script was v good indeed and audience splendid a great deal of affection there one felt feldman became increasingly successful on television particularly with at last 1948 show 1967 he decided to concentrate on writing and performing on screen and left series took agreed to stay and he was joined by johnnie mortimer brian cooke and for first six episodes of next series donald webster in september 1967 bbc radio was radically reorganised home service third programme and light programme were abolished and replaced by four new national channels radio 1 2 3 and 4 round horne moved from light programme to radio 2 change came with reduced budgets fraser hayes four and eddie braden and hornblowers were replaced with a small instrumental group led by max harris and pertwee was dropped from programme cost fell from ps601 a show in series 3 to in series 4 that year s christmas special was broadcast with new line up and writers fourth series began on 25 february 1968 and ran for 16 episodes to 9 june after first episode williams was unimpressed with new material and wrote in his diary now there are 4 writers on it it is unbelievable really four for half an hour of old crap with not a memorable line anywhere of course one goes on and flogs it gutless and rubbish gets by without feldman took was enjoying show less than he had previously he also felt humour was becoming more obviously dirty and complained to williams that we might as well write a series called get your cock out horne died of a heart attack on 14 february 1969 while hosting annual guild of television producers and directors awards at dorchester hotel in london an award had gone to took and feldman for their television series marty and horne had just urged viewers to tune into fifth series of round horne which was due to start on 16 march when he fell from podium by 24 february 1969 it had been decided that round horne could not continue without its star as a result scripts for series five which horne had jokingly suggested should be subtitled first all nude radio show were hastily adapted into a new series for williams called stop messing about which ran for two series before it was dropped from schedule in 1970 main regular characters thumb upright 2 cast of round horne 1968 left to right hugh paddick kenneth williams kenneth horne betty marsden douglas smith kenneth horne persona adopted by writers for horne was not greatly different from his real life one and largely same as that of his beyond our ken character urbane unflappable tolerant but sometimes surprised central figure around whom other characters revolved times called horne master of scandalous double meaning delivered with shining innocence and in round horne he combined role of straight man to flamboyant julian and sandy rambling syd rumpo and j peasmold gruntfuttock with that of genial host of show feldman called him best straight man i had ever seen who nonetheless had a lot of funny lines jonathan rigby who played horne in a stage show round horne revisited thought him a stand up comedian with a posh accent part of his genius was that he was able to be himself horne introduced some programmes by reading out answers to last week s non existent questions answer to question one complete first lines of following songs if i were a blackbird i d answer is i d whistle and sing and i positively will not accept any other suggestion second song was there s a rainbow round my now we got an amazing number of replies to this we haven t had so many since we asked you to complete over my shoulder goes really it makes it very difficult for us to keep up high reputation for sophisticated comedy we ve never had at other times he would give a short lecture on justly forgotten figures from history such as robert capability allegedly inventor of toad in hole or nemesis fothergill known to ornithologists and police as birdman of potter s bar in many episodes his opening slot was announcing day s forthcoming events such as international free style gnome fingering at five minute hippo wash brompton oratory swan upping at downham and swan downing at upham and two man rabbi bob sled championship down escalators at leicester square tube station he would close programmes by commenting on final sketch or announcing a competition to complete a limerick with two fecund opening lines a young market gardener from bude developed a cactus quite lewd or with a public service announcement such as this police message if any passer by in lisle street last saturday night witnessed a middle aged man stagger out of strip club and get knocked down by a passing cyclist would you please keep quiet about it as my wife thinks i was in folkestone goodbye see you next week douglas smith at start of first series of round horne douglas smith took traditional role of a bbc announcer on comedy shows introducing

dobbins medical for horses and horse deodorant for ufo under fetlock odour in third and fourth series he is included in movie spoofs playing a range of roles including a rumbling volcano horne and see there dominating island sacred volcano of played by douglas smith with a hole in his head and steam coming out of his ears paddick what an awesome sight snow mantling his mighty summit and lava oozing down his sides smith that s porridge actually i had a hurried breakfast this morning horne shut up smith you re a volcano you just loom over us and rumble ominously smith yes i told you i had a hurried breakfast horne shut up smith smith rumble rumble horne that s better his other roles include a telephone box an inflatable rubber boat a bentley and a cow smith moo moo splosh horne splosh smith i kicked over milk pail by fourth series smith has risen to heights of playing world you ve just gone through my khyber pass travelling on a camel and in one programme he gets a solo singing spot barracked by paddick and williams letting an announcer sing it s a disgrace performing nobody loves a fairy when she s forty beatrice lady counterblast nee clissold first of new characters was an elderly ex gaiety girl played by marsden known as bea clissold in her theatrical heyday when she was pure brass of music hall and subsequently an aristocratic widow she has been much married and much divorced and has retired to live in seclusion at chattering parva waited on and complained about by her octogenarian butler spasm williams horne interviews her each week in early programmes when she reminisces about her life and husbands in a commentary on show s characters published in 1974 took wrote her anecdotes of past marriages combine lurid with turgid as narrative flashes back on leaden wings to turn of century and exploits of young bea clissold she appeared in first programme of series and was a major feature of its early episodes after she ceased to be one of central characters she continually popped up with her catch phrase many times many many times originally referring to number of times she was married and later an all purpose innuendo julian and sandy camp pair julian and sandy played by paddick and williams made their debuts in fourth programme of first series and rapidly established themselves as a permanent fixture throughout run of round horne they are out of work actors whom horne encounters each week in new temporary jobs writers original idea was that characters should be elderly and dignified shakespearean actors filling in as domestic cleaners while resting i e unemployed but producer john simmonds thought they seemed rather sad and at his suggestion took and feldman turned characters into chorus boys in a typical sketch horne looks in at a new establishment usually in chelsea with a title such as bona tours bona books bona antiques or bona caterers and is greeted with oh hello i m julian and this is my friend sandy latter adds using gay and theatrical slang palare how bona to vada your dolly old again or what brings you trolling in here having first appeared as house cleaners they are later shown working in a variety of implausible jobs took summed them up from working as part time domestics while resting they progressed to running almost every trendy activity going from fox hunting in carnaby street to gents outfitting department of mi5 use of palare enabled writers to give julian and sandy some double entendres that survived bbc censorship because authorities either did not know or did not admit to knowing their gay meaning in fourth series sandy tells horne that julian is a brilliant pianist a miracle of dexterity at cottage upright which to those familiar with gay slang could either refer to pianistic excellence or to illegal sexual activity in a public lavatory at time gay male sex was a criminal offence in britain julian and sandy became nationally popular characters and are widely credited with contributing a little to public acceptance of homosexuality that led to gradual repeal of anti gay laws beginning in 1967 j peasmold gruntfuttock a week after debut of julian and sandy came first appearance of j peasmold gruntfuttock first broadcast on 5 april 1965 played by williams gruntfuttock is described by writers as walking slum in his first appearance he is a job applicant at bbc inspired by voices in his head and keen to get on close terms with one of female presenters in later programmes he is first king and then dictator of a small enclave in east end and subsequently brother gruntfuttock member of an obscure religious community he writes in regularly with incorrect and sometimes physically implausible answers to last week s questions finally we had i get a kick out of well mr gruntfuttock of hoxton i think we all know what you get a kick out of and on looking at list you sent me it s my considered opinion that you are running a severe risk of doing yourself a permanent injury in fourth series he is a persistent caller of spoof phone in round horne forum of air airing his peculiar personal obsessions in between bouts of heavy breathing he was feldman s favourite round horne character two authors wrote of gruntfuttock he married beneath him which gives you some idea what his wife buttercup betty marsden must be like all in all not a couple one would wish to meet on a dark night or indeed at any time charles and fiona charles and fiona are supposedly characters played by an extremely theatrical actor and actress ageing juvenile binkie paddick and dame celia marsden two originally based on theatre stars alfred lunt and lynn fontanne were introduced in eighth programme of first series and quickly became a fixture they appeared in parodies of stiff upper lip dramas by noel coward and others their fictitious plays had titles such as present encounter and bitter laughter their agonised love affairs are punctuated by brittle staccato dialogue in which they talk of their emotions in tortuous sentences fiona all i could think of back here was you out there thinking of me back here thinking of you out there back here needing you wanting you wanting to need you needing to want you charles i don t have words for it fiona i know charles i know you know fiona i know you know i know charles yes i know their sketches customarily end with an unexpected twist such as revelation that they are living in a telephone box or are dining at ritz in nude or trysting in a refrigerator barry took wrote that they were his own favourite round horne characters during second

graceless lotus blossom bulging out of her cheongsam her attempts to entertain special agent horne with her songs and dances cause him more distress than chou s threats of death rambling syd rumpo first heard in tenth show of first series and a fixture thereafter rambling syd williams is an itinerant folk singer writers describe him as one of last of breed of wandering minstrels who are fast dying out thank heavens often misappropriating tunes of genuine folk songs rambling syd s lyrics consist of dubious sounding nonsense words such as these from runcorn splod cobbler s song i sing as i
