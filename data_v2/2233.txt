william shakespeare bapt 26 april 1564 23 april 1616 was an english poet playwright and actor widely regarded as greatest writer in english language and world s greatest dramatist he is often called england s national poet and bard of avon or simply bard his extant works including collaborations consist of some 39 plays 154 sonnets two long narrative poems and a few other verses some of uncertain authorship his plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright shakespeare was born and raised in stratford upon avon warwickshire at age of 18 he married anne hathaway with whom he had three children susanna and twins hamnet and judith sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in london as an actor writer and part owner of a playing company called lord chamberlain s men later known as king s men at age 49 around 1613 he appears to have retired to stratford where he died three years later few records of shakespeare s private life survive this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance his sexuality his religious beliefs and whether works attributed to him were written by others shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 his early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of best work produced in these genres until about 1608 he wrote mainly tragedies among them hamlet othello king lear and macbeth all considered to be among finest works in english language in last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies also known as romances and collaborated with other playwrights many of shakespeare s plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime however in 1623 two fellow actors and friends of shakespeare s john heminges and henry condell published a more definitive text known as first folio a posthumous collected edition of shakespeare s dramatic works that included all but two of his plays volume was prefaced with a poem by ben jonson in which jonson presciently hails shakespeare in a now famous quote as not of an age but for all time throughout 20th and 21st centuries shakespeare s works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance his plays remain popular and are studied performed and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around world life early life william shakespeare was son of john shakespeare an alderman and a successful glover glove maker originally from and mary arden daughter of an affluent landowning farmer he was born in stratford upon avon and baptised there on 26 april 1564 his actual date of birth remains unknown but is traditionally observed on 23 april saint george s day this date which can be traced to a mistake made by an 18th century scholar has proved appealing to biographers because shakespeare died on same date in 1616 he was third of eight children and eldest surviving son thumb upright 0 9 left john shakespeare s house believed to be shakespeare s birthplace in stratford upon avon although no attendance records for period survive most biographers agree that shakespeare was probably educated at king s new school in stratford a free school chartered in 1553 about a quarter mile 400 m from his home grammar schools varied in quality during elizabethan era but grammar school curricula were largely similar basic latin text was standardised by royal decree and school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon latin classical authors at age of 18 shakespeare married 26 year old anne hathaway consistory court of diocese of worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 november 1582 next day two of hathaway s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded marriage ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since worcester chancellor allowed marriage banns to be read once instead of usual three times and six months after marriage anne gave birth to a daughter susanna baptised 26 may 1583 twins son hamnet and daughter judith followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 february 1585 hamnet died of unknown causes at age of 11 and was buried 11 august 1596 thumb shakespeare s coat of arms as it appears on rough draft of application to grant a coat of arms to john shakespeare it features a spear as a pun on family name after birth of twins shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of london theatre scene in 1592 exception is appearance of his name in complaints bill of a law case before queen s bench court at westminster dated michaelmas term 1588 and 9 october 1589 scholars refer to years between 1585 and 1592 as shakespeare s lost years biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories nicholas rowe shakespeare s first biographer recounted a stratford legend that shakespeare fled town for london to escape prosecution for deer poaching in estate of local squire thomas lucy shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him another 18th century story has shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding horses of theatre patrons in london john aubrey reported that shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster some 20th century scholars have suggested that shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by alexander hoghton of lancashire a catholic landowner who named a certain william shakeshafte in his will little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death and shakeshafte was a common name in lancashire area london and theatrical career it is not known definitively when shakespeare began writing but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on london stage by 1592 by then he was sufficiently known in london to be attacked in print by playwright robert greene in his groats worth of wit there is an upstart crow beautified with our feathers that with his tiger s heart wrapped in a player s hide supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as best of you and being an absolute johannes factotum is in his own conceit only shake scene in a country scholars differ on exact meaning of greene s words but most agree that greene was accusing shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university educated writers as christopher marlowe thomas nashe and greene himself so called university wits phrase parodying line oh tiger s heart wrapped in a woman s hide from shakespeare s henry vi part 3 along with pun shake scene clearly identify shakespeare as greene s target as used here johannes factotum jack of all trades refers to a second rate with work of others rather than more common universal genius greene s attack is earliest surviving mention of shakespeare s work in theatre biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from mid 1580s to just before greene s remarks after 1594 shakespeare s plays were performed only by lord chamberlain s men a company owned by a group of players including shakespeare that soon became leading playing company in london after death of queen elizabeth in 1603 company was awarded a royal patent by new king james i and changed its name to king s men in 1599 a partnership of members of company built their own theatre on south bank of river thames which they named globe in 1608 partnership also took over blackfriars indoor theatre extant records of shakespeare s property purchases and investments indicate that his association with company made him a wealthy man and in 1597 he bought second largest house in stratford new place and in 1605 invested in a share of parish tithes in stratford some of shakespeare s plays were published in quarto editions beginning in 1594 and by 1598 his name had become a selling point and began to appear on title pages shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright 1616 edition of ben jonson s works names him on cast lists for every man in his humour 1598 and sejanus his fall 1603 absence of his name from 1605 cast list for jonson s volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end first folio of 1623 however lists shakespeare as one of principal actors in all these plays some of which were first staged after volpone although we cannot know for certain which roles he played in 1610 john davies of hereford wrote that good will played kingly roles in 1709 rowe passed down a tradition that shakespeare played ghost of hamlet s father later traditions maintain that he also played adam in as you like it and chorus in henry v though scholars doubt sources of that information throughout his career shakespeare divided his time between london and stratford in 1596 year before he bought new place as his family home in stratford shakespeare was living in parish of st helen s bishopsgate north of river thames he moved across river to southwark by 1599 same year his company constructed globe theatre there by 1604 he had moved north of river again to an area north of st paul s cathedral with many fine houses there he rented rooms from a french huguenot named christopher mountjoy a maker of ladies wigs and other headgear later years and death thumb upright shakespeare s funerary monument in stratford upon avon rowe was first biographer to record tradition repeated by johnson that shakespeare retired to stratford some years before his death he was still working as an actor in london in 1608 in an answer to sharers petition in 1635 cuthbert burbage stated that after purchasing lease of blackfriars theatre in 1608 from henry evans king s men placed men players there which were heminges condell shakespeare etc however it is perhaps relevant that bubonic plague raged in london throughout 1609 london public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of plague a total of over 60 months closure between may 1603 and february 1610 which meant there was often no acting work retirement from all work was uncommon at that time shakespeare continued to visit london during years 1611 1614 in 1612 he was called as a witness in v mountjoy a court case concerning marriage settlement of mountjoy s daughter mary in march 1613 he bought a gatehouse in former blackfriars priory and from november 1614 he was in london for several weeks with his son in law john hall after 1610 shakespeare wrote fewer plays and none are attributed to him after 1613 his last three plays were collaborations probably with john fletcher who succeeded him as house playwright of king s men shakespeare died on 23 april 1616 at age of 52 he died within a month of signing his will a document which he begins by describing himself as being in perfect health no extant contemporary source explains how or why he died half a century later john ward vicar of stratford wrote in his notebook shakespeare drayton and ben jonson had a merry meeting and it seems drank too hard for shakespeare died of a fever there contracted not an impossible scenario since shakespeare knew jonson and drayton of tributes from fellow authors one refers to his relatively sudden death we wondered shakespeare that thou went st so soon from world s stage to grave s tiring room thumb left holy trinity church stratford upon avon where shakespeare was baptised and is buried he was survived by his wife and two daughters susanna had married a physician john hall in 1607 and judith had married thomas quiney a vintner two months before shakespeare s death shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 march 1616 following day his new son in law thomas quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by margaret wheeler who had died during childbirth thomas was ordered by church court to do public penance which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for shakespeare family shakespeare bequeathed bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to first son of her body quineys had three children all of whom died without marrying halls had one child elizabeth who married twice but died without children in 1670 ending shakespeare s direct line shakespeare s will scarcely mentions his wife anne who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically he did make a point however of leaving her my second best bed a bequest that has led to much speculation some scholars see bequest as an insult to anne whereas others believe that second best bed would have been matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance thumb shakespeare s grave next to those of anne shakespeare his wife and thomas nash husband of his granddaughter shakespeare was buried in chancel of holy trinity church two days after his death epitaph carved into stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones which was carefully avoided during restoration of church in 2008 good frend for sake forbeare to digg heare be ye man yt spares thes stones and be he yt moves my bones modern spelling good friend for jesus sake forbear to dig dust enclosed here blessed be man that spares these stones and cursed be he that moves my bones some time before 1623 a funerary monument was erected in his memory on north wall with a half effigy of him in act of writing its plaque compares him to nestor socrates and virgil in 1623 in conjunction with publication of first folio droeshout engraving was published shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around world including funeral monuments in southwark cathedral and poets corner in westminster abbey plays thumb center upright 2 25 procession of characters from shakespeare s plays by an unknown 19th century artist most playwrights of period typically collaborated with others at some point and critics agree that shakespeare did same mostly early and late in his career first recorded works of shakespeare are richard iii and three parts of henry vi written in early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama shakespeare s plays are difficult to date precisely however and studies of texts suggest that titus andronicus comedy of errors taming of shrew and two gentlemen of verona may also belong to shakespeare s earliest period his first histories which draw heavily on 1587 edition of raphael holinshed s chronicles of england scotland and ireland dramatise destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for origins of tudor dynasty early plays were influenced by works of other elizabethan dramatists especially thomas kyd and christopher marlowe by traditions of medieval drama and by plays of seneca comedy of errors was also based on classical models but no source for taming of shrew has been found though it is related to a separate play of same name and may have derived from a folk story like two gentlemen of verona in which two friends appear to approve of rape shrew s story of taming of a woman s independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics directors and audiences thumb left oberon titania and puck with fairies dancing by william blake c 1786 tate britain shakespeare s early classical and italianate comedies containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences give way in mid 1590s to romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies a midsummer night s dream is a witty mixture of romance fairy magic and comic scenes shakespeare s next comedy equally romantic merchant of venice contains a portrayal of vengeful jewish moneylender shylock which reflects elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences wit and wordplay of much ado about nothing charming rural setting of as you like it and lively of twelfth night complete shakespeare s sequence of great comedies after lyrical richard ii written almost entirely in verse shakespeare introduced prose comedy into histories of late 1590s henry iv parts 1 and 2 and henry v his characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes prose and poetry and achieves narrative variety of his mature work this period begins and ends with two tragedies romeo and juliet famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence love and death and julius caesar based on sir thomas north s 1579 translation of plutarch s parallel lives which introduced a new kind of drama according to shakespearean scholar james shapiro in julius caesar various strands of politics character inwardness contemporary events even shakespeare s own reflections on act of writing began to infuse each other thumb hamlet horatio marcellus and ghost of hamlet s father henry fuseli 1780 1785 kunsthaus zurich in early 17th century shakespeare wrote so called problem plays measure for measure troilus and cressida and all s well that ends well and a number of his best known tragedies many critics believe that shakespeare s greatest tragedies represent peak of his art titular hero of one of shakespeare s greatest tragedies hamlet has probably been discussed more than any other shakespearean character especially for his famous soliloquy which begins to be or not to be that is question unlike introverted hamlet whose fatal flaw is hesitation heroes of tragedies that followed othello and king lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement plots of shakespeare s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws which overturn order and destroy hero and those he loves in othello villain iago stokes othello s sexual jealousy to point where he murders innocent wife who loves him in king lear old king commits tragic error of giving up his powers initiating events which lead to torture and blinding of earl of gloucester and murder of lear s youngest daughter cordelia according to critic frank kermode play offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty in macbeth shortest and most compressed of shakespeare s tragedies uncontrollable ambition incites macbeth and his wife lady macbeth to murder rightful king and usurp throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn in this play shakespeare adds a supernatural element to tragic structure his last major tragedies antony and cleopatra and coriolanus contain some of shakespeare s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by poet and critic t s eliot in his final period shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays cymbeline winter s tale and tempest as well as collaboration pericles prince of tyre less bleak than tragedies these four plays are graver in tone than comedies of 1590s but they end with reconciliation and forgiveness of potentially tragic errors some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on shakespeare s part but it may merely reflect theatrical fashion of day shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays henry viii and two noble kinsmen probably with john fletcher performances it is not clear for which companies shakespeare wrote his early plays title page of 1594 edition of titus andronicus reveals that play had been acted by three different troupes after plagues of 1592 93 shakespeare s plays were performed by his own company at theatre and curtain in shoreditch north of thames londoners flocked there to see first part of henry iv leonard digges recording let but falstaff come hal rest and you scarce shall have a room when company found themselves in dispute with their landlord they pulled theatre down and used timbers to construct globe theatre first playhouse built by actors for actors on south bank of thames at southwark globe opened in autumn 1599 with julius caesar one of first plays staged most of shakespeare s greatest post 1599 plays were written for globe including hamlet othello and king lear thumb left reconstructed globe theatre on south bank of river thames in london after lord chamberlain s men were renamed king s men in 1603 they entered a special relationship with new king james although performance records are patchy king s men performed seven of shakespeare s plays at court between 1 november 1604 and 31 october 1605 including two performances of merchant of venice after 1608 they performed at indoor blackfriars theatre during winter and globe during summer indoor setting combined with jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques allowed shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices in cymbeline for example jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt ghosts fall on their knees actors in shakespeare s company included famous richard burbage william kempe henry condell and john heminges burbage played leading role in first performances of many of shakespeare s plays including richard iii hamlet othello and king lear popular comic actor will kempe played servant peter in romeo and juliet and dogberry in much ado about nothing among other characters he was replaced around 1600 by robert armin who played roles such as touchstone in as you like it and fool in king lear in 1613 sir henry wotton recorded that henry viii was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony on 29 june however a cannon set fire to thatch of globe and burned theatre to ground an event which pinpoints date of a shakespeare play with rare precision textual sources thumb upright title page of first folio 1623 copper engraving of shakespeare by martin droeshout in 1623 john heminges and henry condell two of shakespeare s friends from king s men published first folio a collected edition of shakespeare s plays it contained 36 texts including 18 printed for first time many of plays had already appeared in quarto versions flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves no evidence suggests that shakespeare approved these editions which first folio describes as stol n and surreptitious copies nor did shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends spontaneous idea after his death to create and publish first folio alfred pollard termed some of pre 1623 versions as bad quartos because of their adapted paraphrased or garbled texts which may in places have been reconstructed from memory where several versions of a play survive each differs from other differences may stem from copying or printing errors from notes by actors or audience members or from shakespeare s own papers in some cases for example hamlet troilus and cressida and othello shakespeare could have revised texts between quarto and folio editions in case of king lear however while most modern editions do conflate them 1623 folio version is so different from 1608 quarto that oxford shakespeare prints them both arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion poems in 1593 and 1594 when theatres were closed because of plague shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes venus and adonis and rape of lucrece he dedicated them to henry wriothesley earl of southampton in venus and adonis an innocent adonis rejects sexual advances of venus while in rape of lucrece virtuous wife lucrece is raped by lustful tarquin influenced by ovid s metamorphoses poems show guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust both proved popular and were often reprinted during shakespeare s lifetime a third narrative poem a lover s complaint in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor was printed in first edition of sonnets in 1609 most scholars now accept that shakespeare wrote a lover s complaint critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects phoenix and turtle printed in robert chester s 1601 love s martyr mourns deaths of legendary phoenix and his lover faithful turtle dove in 1599 two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in passionate pilgrim published under shakespeare s name but without his permission sonnets thumb upright left title page from 1609 edition of shake sonnets published in 1609 sonnets were last of shakespeare s non dramatic works to be printed scholars are not certain when each of 154 sonnets was composed but evidence suggests that shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership even before two unauthorised sonnets appeared in passionate pilgrim in 1599 francis meres had referred in 1598 to shakespeare s sonnets among his private friends few analysts believe that published collection follows shakespeare s intended sequence he seems to have planned two contrasting series one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion dark lady and one about conflicted love for a fair young man fair youth it remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals or if authorial i who addresses them represents shakespeare himself though wordsworth believed that with sonnets shakespeare unlocked his heart 1609 edition was dedicated to a mr w h credited as only of poems it is not known whether this was written by shakespeare himself or by publisher thomas thorpe whose initials appear at foot of dedication page nor is it known who mr w h was despite numerous theories or whether shakespeare even authorised publication critics praise sonnets as a profound meditation on nature of love sexual passion procreation death and time style shakespeare s first plays were written in conventional style of day he wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from needs of characters or drama poetry depends on extended sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits and language is often rhetorical written for actors to declaim rather than speak grand speeches in titus andronicus in view of some critics often hold up action for example and verse in two gentlemen of verona has been described as stilted thumb pity by william blake 1795 tate britain is an illustration of two similes in macbeth and pity like a naked new born babe striding blast or heaven s cherubim hors d upon sightless couriers of air however shakespeare soon began to adapt traditional styles to his own purposes opening soliloquy of richard iii has its roots in self declaration of vice in medieval drama at same time richard s vivid self awareness looks forward to soliloquies of shakespeare s mature plays no single play marks a change from traditional to freer style shakespeare combined two throughout his career with romeo and juliet perhaps best example of mixing of styles by time of romeo and juliet richard ii and a midsummer night s dream in mid 1590s shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry he increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to needs of drama itself shakespeare s standard poetic form was blank verse composed in iambic pentameter in practice this meant that his verse was usually and consisted of ten syllables to a line spoken with a stress on every second syllable blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones it is often beautiful but its sentences tend to start pause and finish at end of lines with risk of monotony once shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse he began to interrupt and vary its flow this technique releases new power and flexibility of poetry in plays such as julius caesar and hamlet shakespeare uses it for example to convey turmoil in hamlet s mind after hamlet shakespeare varied his poetic style further particularly in more emotional passages of late tragedies literary critic a c bradley described this style as more concentrated rapid varied and in construction less regular not seldom twisted or elliptical in last phase of his career shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects these included run on lines irregular pauses and stops and extreme variations in sentence structure and length in macbeth for example language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another was hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself 1 7 35 38 pity like a naked new born babe striding blast or heaven s cherubim hors d upon sightless couriers of air 1 7 21 25 listener is challenged to complete sense late romances with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another clauses are piled up subject and object are reversed and words are omitted creating an effect of spontaneity shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of theatre like all playwrights of time he dramatised stories from sources such as plutarch and holinshed he reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to audience as possible this strength of design ensures that a shakespeare play can survive translation cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama as shakespeare s mastery grew he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech he preserved aspects of his earlier style in later plays however in shakespeare s late romances he deliberately returned to a more artificial style which emphasised illusion of theatre influence thumb upright left macbeth consulting vision of armed head by henry fuseli 1793 1794 folger shakespeare library washington shakespeare s work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature in particular he expanded dramatic potential of characterisation plot language and genre until romeo and juliet for example romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events but shakespeare used them to explore characters minds his work heavily influenced later poetry romantic poets attempted to revive shakespearean verse drama though with little success critic george steiner described all english verse dramas from coleridge to tennyson as feeble variations on shakespearean themes shakespeare influenced novelists such as thomas hardy william faulkner and charles dickens american novelist herman melville s soliloquies owe much to shakespeare his captain ahab in moby dick is a classic tragic hero inspired by king lear scholars have identified 20 000 pieces of music linked to shakespeare s works these include three operas by giuseppe verdi macbeth otello and falstaff whose critical standing compares with that of source plays shakespeare has also inspired many painters including romantics and pre raphaelites swiss romantic artist henry fuseli a friend of william blake even translated macbeth into german psychoanalyst sigmund freud drew on shakespearean psychology in particular that of hamlet for his theories of human nature in shakespeare s day english grammar spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now and his use of language helped shape modern english samuel johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his a dictionary of english language first serious work of its type expressions such as with bated breath merchant of venice and a foregone conclusion othello have found their way into everyday english speech critical reputation shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime but he received a large amount of praise in 1598 cleric and author francis meres singled him out from a group of english writers as most excellent in both comedy and tragedy authors of parnassus plays at st john s college cambridge numbered him with chaucer gower and spenser in first folio ben jonson called shakespeare soul of age applause delight wonder of our stage although he had remarked elsewhere that shakespeare wanted art between restoration of monarchy in 1660 and end of 17th century classical ideas were in vogue as a result critics of time mostly rated shakespeare below john fletcher and ben jonson thomas rymer for example condemned shakespeare for mixing comic with tragic nevertheless poet and critic john dryden rated shakespeare highly saying of jonson i admire him but i love shakespeare for several decades rymer s view held sway but during 18th century critics began to respond to shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius a series of scholarly editions of his work notably those of samuel johnson in 1765 and edmond malone in 1790 added to his growing reputation by 1800 he was firmly enshrined as national poet in 18th and 19th centuries his reputation also spread abroad among those who championed him were writers voltaire goethe stendhal and victor hugo thumb upright a recently statue of william shakespeare in lincoln park chicago typical of many created in 19th and early 20th century during romantic era shakespeare was praised by poet and literary philosopher samuel taylor coleridge and critic august wilhelm schlegel translated his plays in spirit of german romanticism in 19th century critical admiration for shakespeare s genius often bordered on adulation this king shakespeare essayist thomas carlyle wrote in 1840 does not he shine in crowned sovereignty over us all as noblest gentlest yet strongest of rallying signs indestructible victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale playwright and critic george bernard shaw mocked cult of shakespeare worship as claiming that new naturalism of ibsen s plays had made shakespeare obsolete modernist revolution in arts during early 20th century far from discarding shakespeare eagerly enlisted his work in service of avant garde expressionists in germany and futurists in moscow mounted productions of his plays marxist playwright and director bertolt brecht devised an epic theatre under influence of shakespeare poet and critic t s eliot argued against shaw that shakespeare s primitiveness in fact made him truly modern eliot along with g wilson knight and school of new criticism led a movement towards a closer reading of shakespeare s imagery in 1950s a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved way for post modern studies of shakespeare by 1980s shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism feminism new historicism african american studies and queer studies in a comprehensive reading of shakespeare s works and comparing shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well harold bloom has commented that shakespeare was larger than plato and than st augustine he encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions works classification of plays thumb left plays of william shakespeare by sir john gilbert 1849 shakespeare s works include 36 plays printed in first folio of 1623 listed according to their folio classification as comedies histories and tragedies two plays not included in first folio two noble kinsmen and pericles prince of tyre are now accepted as part of canon with today s scholars agreeing that shakespeare made major contributions to writing of both no shakespearean poems were included in first folio in late 19th century edward dowden classified four of late comedies as romances and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies dowden s term is often used in 1896 frederick s boas coined term problem plays to describe four plays all s well that ends well measure for measure troilus and cressida and hamlet dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies he wrote we may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from theatre of today and class them together as shakespeare s problem plays term much debated and sometimes applied to other plays remains in use though hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy speculation about shakespeare authorship around 230 years after shakespeare s death doubts began to be expressed about authorship of works attributed to him proposed alternative candidates include francis bacon christopher marlowe and edward de vere 17th earl of oxford several group theories have also been proposed only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question traditional attribution but interest in subject particularly oxfordian theory of shakespeare authorship continues into 21st century religion shakespeare conformed to official state religion but his private views on religion have been subject of debate shakespeare s will uses a protestant formula and he was a confirmed member of church of england where he was married his children were baptised and where he is buried some scholars claim that members of shakespeare s family were catholics at a time when practising catholicism in england was against law shakespeare s mother mary arden certainly came from a pious catholic family strongest evidence might be a catholic statement of faith signed by his father john shakespeare found in 1757 in rafters of his former house in henley street however document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity in 1591 authorities reported that john shakespeare had missed church for fear of process for debt a common catholic excuse in 1606 name of william s daughter susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend easter communion in stratford other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about shakespeare s religious beliefs scholars find evidence both for and against shakespeare s catholicism protestantism or lack of belief in his plays but truth may be impossible to prove sexuality few details of shakespeare s sexuality are known at 18 he married 26 year old anne hathaway who was pregnant susanna first of their three children was born six months later on 26 may 1583 over centuries some readers have posited that shakespeare s sonnets are autobiographical and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man others read same passages as expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love 26 so called dark lady sonnets addressed to a married woman are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons portraiture no written contemporary description of shakespeare s physical appearance survives and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait so droeshout engraving which ben jonson approved of as a good likeness and his stratford monument provide perhaps best evidence of his appearance from 18th century desire for authentic shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted shakespeare that demand
