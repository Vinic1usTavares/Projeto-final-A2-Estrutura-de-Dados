guy and he deserves more but loving izzie showed him that he can be good is good so it was a little gift and when he tells izzie he s done he s not bitter or angry he s just done writing of two part

and viewership and served as season s most viewed episode sympathy for parents was season s least viewed episode and up to that point series as well garnering only 9 87 million viewers season s finale garnered 16 13 million viewers and received a 6 2 18 rating ranking first for its time slot and entire night in terms of both ratings and viewership although finale was a success for night it was a 1 decrease from season five s finale but served as season s second most viewed episode overall season ranked at 17 for year and had an average of 13 26 million viewers a 5 decrease from previous season s ranking season received mixed reviews among television critics speaking of premiere glenn diaz of buddytv noted that special foreshadowed a very dark season adding talk between george s mom and one of surgeons torres proved to be one of more heart breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough in contrast kelly west of tv blend was critical of premiere writing i don t think based on first episode that we can say that grey s is headed in a new direction nor do i think writers are making much of an effort to bring series back to greatness that was its earlier seasons that said this is grey s anatomy and with that comes usual drama sex love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in mix to keep things moving if that s what you re looking for i think you ll enjoy season premiere just fine capshaw s performance this season was praised with tv addict calling her immensely likeable although sympathy for parents was least viewed episode tv fanatic called episode touching praising chambers performance tv fanatics reaction to season was fairly mixed with steve marsi saying that grey s anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing give peace a chance he said that still popular but lacking its past magic it s trying to decide what to become all we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago we are all for it last week saw doctors plunging into er style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case last night we saw something else equally unusual he praised patrick dempsey s performance saying again it was a single case that took up entire hour but instead of 12 doctors version of events focus was largely on just one and best one dr derek shepherd patrick dempsey s mcdreamy character may be eye candy but he s got substance last night s episode proved that in spades and was one of series best in some time season s finale death and all his friends was highly praised marsi gave episode five stars and expressed that it may have been best episode of series adding writing and acting were absolutely stellar and may lead to many emmy nominations but even more impressively despite a killing spree it remained distinctly grey s some of back and between characters were truly memorable and some of developments so heartbreaking that we don t even know where to begin now seriously season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything a feeling we haven t had from grey s in years and rarely achieved by any program john kubicek of buddytv also noted that finale was best episode adding it was two of best hours of television all year it was certainly best grey s anatomy has ever been which is saying a lot since i d written show off for past few years no show does a big traumatic event like grey s anatomy and shooter gave show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over two hours it was emotional expertly paced and had me in tears for most of finale entertainment weekly wrote at any rate now you can at least see where it all began and while you re still pondering how grey s can still be so damn good sometimes season was one of least acclaimed of series in terms of awards and nominations despite not being nominated for a primetime emmy show received two creative arts emmy awards outstanding prosthetic makeup for a series miniseries movie or a special for how insensitive and outstanding makeup for a single camera series non prosthetic for suicide is painless season also received a nomination for outstanding drama
