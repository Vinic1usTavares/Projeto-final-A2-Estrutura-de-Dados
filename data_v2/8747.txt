raf coastal command was a formation within royal air force raf founded in 1936 it was to act as raf maritime arm after fleet air arm became part of royal navy in 1937 naval aviation was neglected in inter war period 1919 1939 and as a consequence service did not receive resources it needed to develop properly or efficiently this continued until outbreak of second world war during which it came to prominence owing to air ministry s concentration on raf fighter command and raf bomber command coastal command was often referred to as cinderella service a phrase first used by first lord of admiralty at time a v alexander hendrie 2006 p 60 its primary task was to protect convoys from german kriegsmarines u boat force it also protected allied shipping from aerial threat posed by luftwaffe main operations of coastal command were defensive defending supplies lines in various theatres of war most notably battle of atlantic a limited number of detachments served in mediterranean middle east and african theatres under command from 1941 operating from a headquarters in gibraltar franks 2014 p 2014 coastal command squadrons operated from bases in united kingdom iceland gibraltar soviet union west africa and north africa hendrie 2007 p 90 coastal command also served in an offensive capacity in mediterranean and baltic it carried out attacks on german shipping moving war materials from italy to north africa and from scandinavia to germany by 1943 coastal command finally received recognition it needed and its operations proved decisive in victory over u boats service saw action from first day of hostilities until last day of second world war it flew over one million flying 1977 p 43 in 240 000 operations and destroyed 212 u boats hendrie 2006 p 179 coastal command s casualties amounted to 2 060 aircraft to all causes and some 5 866 personnel killed in action during 1940 1945 coastal command sank 366 german transport vessels and damaged 134 total tonnage sunk was 512 330 p 353 and another 513 454 tons damaged hendrie 2006 p 179 a total of 10 663 persons were rescued by command including 5 721 allied crews 277 enemy personnel and 4 665 non aircrews ashworth 1992 p 179 equipment aircraft thumb right 300px a sunderland one of few success stories of pre war procurement on outbreak of war in 1939 coastal command had forces of ten avro anson including four auxiliaries two vickers vildebeest two short sunderland three saro london and one supermarine stranraer squadrons vildebeest and london were all obsolescent ansons made up half of this force but with insufficient range to undertake deep ocean reconnaissance it was left to flying boat squadrons of which four out of six had obsolescent machines this left three squadrons with suitable aircraft lockheed hudson and sunderland that could operate effectively hendrie 2006 p 28 anson engines were in limited supply in 1939 moreover sunderland and hudson airframes were also limited later being delivered at a rate of just two per month hendrie 2006 p 28 to fill gap in production capacity air ministry dispatched several missions to united states to buy more hudson airframes buckley 1995 p 104 not only was supply of available aircraft poor by then director of organisation at air ministry charles portal recognised there would be a future problem in procurement of aircraft coastal command s operational nature would make twenty four hour operations a basic requirement suitable aircraft for take off and landing in particular flying boats in all weather was vital for safety of crews and effectiveness of command new twin engine saro lerwick had been touted as ideal aircraft it only came into service in april 1939 and was then found to be unsuitable there was a need for long range machines to cover south western approaches in december 1939 to august 1940 following reinforcements were sent no 10 squadron raaf received sunderlands no 235 squadron raf no 236 squadron raf no 248 squadron raf and no 254 squadron raf equipped with bristol blenheims from raf fighter command in february 1940 in june 1940 no 53 squadron raf and no 59 squadron rafs with blenheim on loan from raf bomber command and in august 1940 no 98 squadron raf s fairey battles also on loan from bomber service and based in iceland by 15 june a further 15 squadrons were to have been handed over to coastal command this was only achieved by loan of seven squadrons from other commands despite express agreement by air ministry and admiralty daily operational strength of coastal command amounted to 298 aircraft most unsuitable for maritime operations within a month that had risen to 39 squadrons and 612 aircraft however they were made of 11 different types causing training and conversion problems hendrie 2006 p 28 thumb a coastal command bristol beaufort on patrol 1940 by 1 december 1941 situation was improving some 18 consolidated catalinas nine sunderlands 20 armstrong whitworth whitley and 170 american hudsons command s strike aircraft consisted of 60 bristol beaufort and 40 bristol beaufighters and 60 blenheim fighter versions for a total of 397 aircraft in 18 squadrons by june 1942 this figure increased 496 aircraft philip joubert de la ferte was not satisfied he believed command was short of three land based and ten flying boat squadrons he refuted air ministry s assertions that coastal command in terms of suitable aircraft was comparatively well off hendrie 2006 p 29 after arthur harris appointment as goc bomber command situation declined harris since his days as a group captain at air ministry s strategic planning division had attacked use of resources in maritime aviation suggesting that bombing enemy shipyards and port facilities would solve threat to trade defence buckley 1995 pp 70 71 by november 1942 259 hudsons were available but were shared by other services whitley and hampden were too vulnerable to operate near enemy coastlines without heavy fighter escort beaufort squadrons were sent to middle east to operate over balkans and north africa highly successful de havilland mosquito was sought after but priority was given to other two air commands by february 1943 goc coastal command john slessor had some 850 aircraft but in respect of quality he was not impressed slessor continually wrote to air ministry complaining that mosquitoes were being used as reconnaissance machines while over 200 were being used by raf tactical air forces supporting army and merchant shipping was suffering high losses in atlantic his successor sholto douglas written records indicate desire to upgrade rather than produce new aircraft by his tenure january 1944 ten squadrons of consolidated liberators five vickers wellingtons squadrons equipped with leigh light and two handley page halifax hudson and boeing fortress squadrons were available among other technological developments these long range aircraft helped defeat u boats in may 1943 hendrie 2006 p 30 official requirements thumb liberator mark i following conversion in 1941 as an anti submarine aircraft until fall of france in 1940 function of coastal command and its aircraft was to cover english channel north sea and western approaches but fall of western europe and norway resulted in a vast hostile coastline from north cape to bay of biscay entry of italy into war extended that threat to mediterranean irish sea covering british western ports required a further three flying boat squadrons in total a further 200 long range aircraft were needed blackburn botha was unsuitable and anson and hudson were expected to act as interim solutions anson in particular had limited range and did not possess capacity to carry heavy weaponry needed to sink a submarine hendrie 2006 p 30 towards autumn of 1941 u boats began operating further into atlantic coastal command s requirement programme was 150 catalinas and 76 sunderlands for 26 flying boat units 32 liberators and 32 wellingtons or whitleys to equip four long range gr squadrons 64 mosquitoes and 180 gr hudsons for 15 medium to long range units 128 beauforts for eight torpedo bomber squadrons and 160 beaufighters for 10 long range fighter squadrons however four flying boats and two gr short range squadrons were to be sent to west africa and another three flying boat squadrons were for gibraltar hendrie 2006 p 31 by december 1941 operational requirements necessitated aircraft with an extra long range of 2 000 miles as u boats were operating 700 miles from british isles if patrols were deployed 350 600 miles covering port approaches enemy would move to 600 700 mile area and out of range by then asv air to surface vessel radar homing had been developed and aircraft were being developed with all weather and short take off capabilities priority went to coastal command anti submarine warfare units by this time hendrie 2006 p 31 anti submarine warfare was then denoted a s but since been denoted asw in january 1942 it was decided that limit of long range aircraft endurance should be crew s limits due to extreme aircrew fatigue seriously effecting efficiency not fuel supply of aircraft de la ferte decided on 7 january sorties should not exceed 14 hours which reduced flying hours by four per mission this was despite entry of very long range liberators in june 1941 liberator mk i had a stated air ministry range of 2 720 miles but crew endurance methods now meant it would be airborne for just 2 240 de la ferte wrote to ministry arguing liberator should be used for reconnaissance work rather than bomb load for solitary squadron being accepted at that time liberator would assist in closing mid atlantic gap which u boats could operate in without worrying about air interdiction after replacing bowhill in 1941 de la ferte had issued a directive on 12 june 1941 to use wellingtons and whitleys as an interim solution to unrestricted submarine warfare now practised by germans their uneconomical operational cost meant immediate replacement of these medium range machines was pressing some avro lancasters and halifaxes with some difficulty were seconded from bomber command hendrie 2006 pp 32 33 lancaster was denied as a large scale or long term replacement chief of air staff portal argued it was only aircraft capable of carrying an 8 000 lb bomb to berlin and could not be spared as a result raf official history does not include lancaster as a coastal command aircraft with a range of 2 350 miles it could have been invaluable boeing fortress was given to service only because air ministry considered it unfit as a heavy bomber it issued a directive on 27 january 1942 stating all fortresses were to given over to coastal command for a s operations no 59 squadron raf no 206 squadron raf and no 220 squadron raf all used fortress as successful reconnaissance aircraft however bulk of force by early 1942 was still medium range aircraft which could now reach only 600 miles into atlantic u boats were now operating at 700 miles plus hendrie 2006 p 34 de la ferte pushed his case hard to portal to get resources needed for spring 1942 portal had accepted that production of sunderlands was disappointing and it had only just met wastage of existing five squadrons portal also admitted a complete lack of interest on part of all concerned portal insisted he would emphasis command s case but by february 1942 expected rate of new catalina aircraft which command expected at a rate of three per week with a final six to complete a batch of 30 before may were offset by move of three catalina squadrons overseas no 209 240 and 413 squadrons hendrie 2006 pp 40 41 situation continued in same way throughout 1942 by march few suitable aircraft in operational service were serviceable most of time by 15 january 1942 de la ferte knew just one fifth of his aircraft were operational situation slowly improved throughout year despite mounting convoy losses and resistance from bomber command by time john slessor succeeded de la ferte as aoc in c he identified 60 squadrons with a total of 850 aircraft of which 34 were a s squadrons operating 450 machines slessor felt catalina was too vulnerable to u boat flak and prima donnas namely liberator with its long range were not available in sufficient numbers on 18 june 1942 war cabinet was told that coastal command had only 39 liberators when it became obvious that losses to u boats were becoming unacceptable in march 1943 coastal command was finally given sufficient resources it needed hendrie 2006 p 43 anti submarine bomb in september 1939 as with most other aspects of a s no clear plan existed for armament of coastal command s aircraft while operational control was given to admiralty faith of both services in asdic proved ill founded it ruled out submarine threat and caused a refocusing on surface attacks in addition no a s weapons had been developed properly in inter war period most of munitions were left over from first world war due in part to a wish to economise and fact no order had been given to dispose of them hendrie 2006 p 47 primary weapon against u boats in a future conflict was to be anti submarine bomb asb it was developed in 1926 following a 1925 admiralty request trials were undertaken in 1927 inexplicably although weapon was introduced and ready for testing in 1931 not a single test was carried out against any submarines or to determine bomb s behaviour under water air ministry preferred and bombs which were unacceptable to admiralty due to corrosion issues in salt water possible due to ammonium nitrate fillings nevertheless a trial order of 50 was placed in may 1939 a s bomb proved useless aircraft available could only carry two and even if they scored direct hits little damage was done depth charges depth charges dcs were more promising only flying boats were able to carry dc in service in 1939 it could be dropped from low altitude which was an advantage considering no suitable bomb sight was available on 16 august 1940 captain ruck keene suggested dcs should be standard armament for a s aircraft which admiralty accepted captain d v peyton ward suggested on 8 september all convoy escorting aircraft should be armed with dcs hendrie 2006 p 48 dc was modified for use with nose and tail fairings for safe usage in case aircraft had to ditch dc would not explode it had a hydrostatic pistol which meant it would explode at or more this was later found to be too deep other weapons such as depth bomb exploded on contact and was likely to porpoise dcs were standard until september 1941 but were dangerous for use with aircraft that could not confirm accurate heights at night dcs were used instead weapon was cleared for use on 23 january 1941 and by may tests revealed tail fin had improved accuracy of charge when dropped from any height up to fins made less impact when dropped above this height according to some claims dc had to be within to be lethal operational records show lethal radius was depth setting and detonation problems were solved by june 1942 and dc proved a formidable a s weapon pistols with a setting were available and torpex filled weapons were now in circulation hendrie 2006 p 49 in january 1945 depth charges were further improved and settings of with a mean depth of were achieved operational research by peyton ward improved weaponry interviewing crews he was responsible for implementing type 13 pistol which offered depth settings as shallow as ward also developed total release tactic dropping entire load at once to ensure maximum chance of a kill on 31 march 1942 de la ferte advised anti submarine committee using both and dcs was not satisfactory it was more efficient to release a large stick of dcs as required lethal stick was four times bombing error in range mark viii was not cleared for heights above or speeds of and de la ferte hoped for a dc filled with torpex that could be dropped at from director of operational research office came up with a dc that could be dropped from but army and navy received priority by 5 june 1943 new type was in service and developments continued in exploder technology from august 1943 to december 1944 it was found it could be released at any height between at any speed with spacings greater than however it came too late to effect a s operations and dc remained standard type mark ix dc with torpex filling dropped in sticks of four to eight anywhere from point blank altitude and within of target proved decisive despite solid head rockets asb and 40mm cannon none in opinion of slessor compared with mark xi depth charge hendrie 2006 p 50 machine guns and cannon in march first british made browning machine guns were delivered to coastal aircraft units browning and vickers gas operated vgo machine guns became standard weapon vgo fired at a rate of 900 rounds per minute browning at 1 030 vickers was pan fed and could jam but belt fed browning was trouble free gun armament had to be reviewed as its weight curtailed range on 21 october 1942 two forward firing guns with enough ammunition for a 15 second burst weighed single machine guns were considered but dropped two guns increased weight to enemy submarines and aircraft typically fired 20mm cannon and ranged up to while machine guns had a range of only some royal australian air force raaf units used guns and increased number on sunderlands from seven to 18 to ward off air attack and suppress u boat flak hendrie 2006 p 53 in 1937 experiments on hispano suiza hs 404 cannons took place cannons were used for defence in rear of aircraft but were not successful in hudson cannons were tested in 1939 most likely by vickers s prototypes operational research documents explain that weight ammunition loads and fact weapon fired too few rounds before components were worn out contributed to abandonment of its use instead cannons were given to anti shipping wings such as beaufighters which proved successful de havilland mosquitos fitted with a molins 6 pounder class m cannon a modification of qf 6 pounder anti tank gun proved a hugely successful maritime strike aircraft hendrie 2006 p 53 torpedoes torpedo capability was always considered paramount lack of suitable aircraft and shortage of weapon itself resulted in strike arm of coastal command being severely handicapped as late as 10 december 1941 torpedo resources were given to fleet air arm faa which would receive 75 percent of all torpedoes torpedoes were sensitive and highly costly in production terms weather conditions off enemy coasts made their use more complicated and depth of water was considered too shallow it was also uneconomical to use weapon against low tonnage shipping coastal command s main target aside from that beaufort torpedo bomber was being posted overseas from august 1941 onwards hendrie 2006 pp 53 54 on 11 june 1942 a report from ors stated that maritime strike sorties should carry bombs rather than torpedoes as their main weapon it was believed they were more effective particularly if new mark xiv bombsight was available a similar conclusion was made about buoyant bomb which could not be used properly without mark xiv bombsight need for intensive training a lack of aircraft priority being given to navy and production limitations for low level bomb sights all these factors influenced policy on torpedo usage hendrie 2006 p 54 during july august and september 1941 trials were undertaken with catalinas using mark i and mark ii torpedoes of british 18 inch torpedo series it was suggested that a mark xii could be used although speed of flight had to be reduced to at 35 feet without reliable altimeter to give correct altitude this was dangerous work as it made catalina an easy target for enemy flak hendrie 2006 p 54 mark 24 mine fido was an acoustic homing torpedo to be used after dropping of dc loads first success with this weapon was soon after its introduction when it was used in sinking of on 20 june 1943 a few days later another was sunk publicity was lacking even pilot was unable to see weapons with their own eyes such was secrecy surrounding them hendrie 2006 p 56 rockets thumb right attaching 60 pdr sap warheads onto 3 in rocket projectile bodies rocket projectiles were developed during second world war in case of coastal command they were to be used in a s and as maritime strike weapons for aircraft use there were two different types of head a 60 lb one with high explosive and a 25 lb armour piercing head of steel known as rocket spear groups of four rockets were arranged on under wing racks trials began in november 1942 and ended in february 1943 in respect of a s firing range against u boats was considered to be or less and could be fired in pairs or all together in a single salvo first recorded success was no 48 squadron rafs sinking of on 4 june 1943 rockets tended to follow line of flight of aircraft rather than line of sight tests indicated a 30 percent hit rate however just one hit was lethal to a u boat though effective against u boats later dcs were favoured hendrie 2006 p 58 bombsights following production of 600 lb depth bomb a mark iii angular velocity low level bombsight was developed at eighth meeting of anti submarine committee chaired by de la ferte on 16 december 1942 at h q coastal command they examined oru reports of results with device no 59 squadron raf had been given task of testing sight and were operating liberator mkiii during period that results were gathered aoc wing commander g c c bartlett afc p o h r longmuir bomber leader presented following report to committee thirty four bombs were dropped by three aimers p o h r longmuir f o g w f o f w w cole at a stationary target and later on a target towed at 8 knots 9 for a total of forty two bombs average range error was yards hendrie 2006 p 54 however it was considered low level sight s chief advantages would be demonstrated under operational conditions sight was considered a great advancement on any previous method of low level bombing either by eye or with a bombsight best figures from no 59 squadron s trials were 6 yd range error with release from 800 ft and 5 yd error when approaching at 100 ft but releasing from 400 ft with aircraft s nose slightly up hendrie 2006 p 54 some academics in ors stated a 20 yd error range existed but maintained mark iii was promising some crews did not trust device which was case when asked to use equipment of which they had little experience instead many continued relying on their own trusted eyesight a continued lack of resources meant there was no widespread use of sights in later months aircrew changed tactics and with new weapons they decided that it would take too long to zero in on a target using device pilots and crew often opted to use their own judgement by direct sighting with considerable success hendrie 2006 p 54 sensors magnetic airborne detection mad was used to detect submerged u boats it consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in cone of aircraft mostly catalinas that could detect anomalies in earth s magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet mine was used in conjunction with a 65 5 lb retro bomb it was filled with 25 lb of torpex and weapon was rocket propelled backwards to line of flight at a speed that counteracted aircraft s forward motion it was released rearwards from rails on wings of aircraft thus with aircraft s forward motion cancelled out by rocket motor device fell directly onto target it possessed two advantages over use of dcs no pre setting of depth was required and enemy was unaware of attack if no hits were made hendrie 2006 p 56 in july 1942 u boats became aware of coastal command aircraft using another innovation sonobuoys which were thought of as air equivalent of navy s asdic a u boat reported them on 29 july being dropped in north transit area and they were thought by enemy to be devices for preventing u boats from travelling on surface they were in fact for detecting submerged u boats and were used by no 210 squadron raf operating sunderlands in operational records they were coded high tea most crews were unaware of their existence devices stayed in use until 1998 when some wartime crews saw them for first time until then raf had kept them secret hendrie 2006 pp 96 97 even by may 1943 mark ii asv air to surface vessel was still being used by then german metox receivers could detect 1 5m radiations a variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce strength of signal this gave u boats impression aircraft was moving away from it there was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when asv mark iii was becoming available based on raf bomber command s h2s it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9 1 cm instead of 1 5m as with mark is and iis and could not be detected by metox receivers in u boats instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner and thus return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a crt known as plan position indicator ppi mark ii would only cover a forward arc unlike mark iii mark iii would indicate surface vessels via a dot on screen while coast would be given in shape of an outline targets remained visible on screen to within a quarter of a mile mark iii also suffered much less from sea return obscuring targets at short range hendrie 2006 p 107 training early years during 1920s and 1930s only fully trained crews were pilots other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who underwent short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming pilots were responsible for navigation and when accurate navigation was essential a second pilot was carried early in 1936 air navigation school had been formed at raf manston to take over this training for all pilots destined for coastal and bomber commands conversion training for flying boats was also given there ashworth 1992 pp 180 181 from start of war to mid 1941 coastal command had only one functioning operational training unit otu officially it had to provide training for 17 units pressure on otu was such that it offered little more than a conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land based aircraft in 1940 bomber command was asked to support coastal forces even though at that time in war it overstretched itself requests to air ministry to meet outstanding otu requirements were largely ignored single landplane otu was established to train 1 1 crews per month this figure on outbreak of war proved grossly inadequate goulter 1995 p 137 otu squadrons according to goc bowhill should have been prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for general reconnaissance units only at this point did air ministry revise its policy they did so however in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate problems of command bomber command had received several months of working up and breathing space from declaration of war to german invasion of western europe but coastal command had not furthermore bomber command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into otus it seemed as if bomber command was still receiving better treatment goulter 1995 p 137 for torpedo training it was even more difficult shallow water was needed to recover training duds torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run thorney island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site it was later used but at time its location near portsmouth was considered too near english channel and as a result turnberry in south west scotland was selected instead with fighter command giving up site to coastal command goulter 1995 p 137 these torpedo training units ttu were formed in january 1943 training in this regard enabled command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews ashworth 1992 p 186 air ministry was unsympathetic to coastal command and lack of any suitable place for aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement otu airfields required a number of features not available in all locations main requirement was a quiet area so that otu flights would not interfere with stations that were already operational to prevent losses to enemy air attacks it was also necessary to keep otus as far away from enemy airspace as possible while sensitive airspace over convoy routes and near scapa flow were also inappropriate places to launch otus goulter 1995 p 137 by late 1940 there were severe shortages of pilots and wireless operators gunners with 100 pilots and 200 other personnel required in short term otu course was reduced to get crews out to operational commands faster it now took no longer than a month compared with six to eight weeks considered necessary this reduced number of fit pilots and quality of pilots overall number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374 to cope with shortening of training it had to have a well stocked general training programme coastal command did not possess such an administration only 24 pupils were graduating when minimum requirement was 64 goulter 1995 p 138 this was compensated by removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying still bomber command received most of 36 000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942 entry requirements for crews were relaxed and programmes found more recruits that way manpower was also supplemented by commonwealth with canada providing some of 6 500 personnel sought by air ministry by end of 1941 operational strength of coastal command increased by seven squadrons goulter 1995 p 139 in 1942 coastal command s problems did not abate experienced crews were siphoned off to malta to undertake aso against german and italian shipping in mediterranean hudson blenheim and beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69 28 and 20 aircrews by january 1942 leftover crews some 75 percent were far off 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to be experienced efficiency fell among squadrons mixing of experienced crews and inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased goulter 1995 p 169 mid to late war by late 1942 training became sufficient in quality and number of crews increased for example no 17 group raf produced 238 trained crews in august 1943 using 1 007 aircraft available during that year 1 863 crews totalling some 11 482 men were trained on 14 different types of aircraft in 255 800 hours a combination of changed requirements and formation of more specialist and advanced training overseas reduced need for further expansion in 1944 figures in 1943 proved to be highest annual out put of trained crews in wartime with sufficient manpower now available four otus were closed in 1944 by july 1944 26 syllabuses increased to 38 and course hours increased to 12 weeks and 87 hours a s training was soon set in two stages conversion training taking five to six weeks and 32 day and night flying training and then an operational phase in which another 55 hours and 30 sorties were flown in five weeks this phase included ten flights on radar and gunnery training ashworth 1992 p 187 specialised training was conducted from several schools anti submarine training was provided from combined anti submarine training centre at beginning in may 1943 air sea rescue schools were set up at blackpool equipped with avro ansons ashworth 1992 p 187 conversion units such as no 6 otu was detailed to provide conversion training for crews who were to fly consolidated liberator boeing fortress and handley page halifax ashworth 1992 p 187 training still remained below what was needed owing to manpower requirements on front line it was not until october 1944 that it became widely accepted to give crews refresher training on new types of aircraft that this practice became policy even so one conversion course was all that was afforded to any crew increasing training hours from 72 to 87 helped in some respects also by 1945 it had become standard practice for squadron leaders to visit and help otus keep pace with changes operational difficulties by reporting back to schools on how best otu establishment could serve needs of squadrons through training or otherwise goulter 1995 p 242 rather than introducing any revolutionary tactical doctrine crews gradually became more experienced and increased their effectiveness that way while specialist training was provided when it was required survival rates remained mediocre owing to nature of long range operations over water however with greater innovations such as radar better designed aircraft and more potent weaponry crews built on their experiences and service became an effective naval air service western europe norwegian campaign thumb right 250px under attack at bergen on 16 february 1940 no 220 squadron raf hudsons

sunk taylor mayer 1974 p 74 battle of atlantic state upon outbreak of war until late 1939 a s work had largely been ignored in opening months of trade defence war september 1939 to early 1940 three main points arose in this respect firstly germans were incapable of maintaining a sustained anti shipping campaign owing to a small number of u boats second air staff s fear of massed air attacks on shipping did not take place and could be discarded thirdly despite first two points losses to allied shipping from u boat attack was enough for importance of a s to increase royal navy s belief in an asdic equipped surface fleet to effectively sweep seas clear of u boats proved unfounded owing to limitations of asdic and vulnerability of surface vessels coastal command aircraft had proven best able to locate u boats but flawed anti submarine bombs meant that they could not inflict severe damage to enemy submarines buckley 1995 pp 118 119 losses in north atlantic had been just under 50 000 tons from september 1939 to june 1940 buckley 1995 p 120 this was about to get worse when france and low countries fell in may to june 1940 u boats could operate from french atlantic ports reducing their need to make dangerous journey from ports in norway or germany around scotland and increasing their operational range in ocean by several hundred miles luftwaffe with its small but valuable

disrupt british trade routes had begun before start of war graf spee had slipped into atlantic in august 1939 and had caused significant damage in south atlantic before being eliminated as a threat in montevideo harbour in aftermath of battle of river plate other operations were mounted by admiral scheer and admiral hipper into british waters in 1940 with various success although coastal command was tasked with shadowing german surface fleets coastal command had not contributed to any effective engagements fought with german commerce raiders until 1941 from 8 to 10 october 1939 gneisenau and scharnhorst had been spotted by coastal command in north sea however they were incapable of inflicting damage to ships when bomber command arrived they could not locate vessels as they had not been trained to locate enemy vessels at sea or attack moving targets buckley 1995 p 189 coastal command also failed to detect break out of scharnhorst and gneisenau during operation berlin in 1941 german warships succeeded in sinking 22 merchant ships although all were sailing independently however after their return to port on 6 april and being located by a reconnaissance spitfire coastal command s no 22 squadron from st eval in cornwall launched a strike by six beauforts only one piloted by flying officer kenneth campbell succeeded in making a torpedo run with 250 anti aircraft guns flak ships

their base at brest in france and sailed for germany through english channel they succeeded without suffering major damage coastal command only had one complete and one half trained squadron of covering area from norway to bay of biscay or only three aircraft for every intercept operations by raf faa and royal navy failed with heavy losses in aircraft de la ferte 1960 pp 172 173 versus condors coastal command was assigned to mission of defending convoys from aerial assault also it lacked proper training tactics and suitable aircraft to pose a serious threat to luftwaffe operations until beginning of 1942 luftwaffe had also neglected naval aviation corum 1997 p 281 its only suitable weapon for use in battle of atlantic was focke wulf fw 200 condor fw 200s began attacks in july 1940 from airfields in occupied france at time coastal command had only 60 avro ansons armstrong whitworth whitleys short sunderlands and lockheed hudsons all too slow and lightly armed to intercept fw 200 most were also short range sunderland had firepower and endurance but was too slow to catch condor only one or two aircraft were sent to cover convoys as they approached britain as a result air to air combat was rare only five recorded actions took place results were two raf aircraft destroyed one hudson and one whitley for two luftwaffe condors destroyed and one damaged forczyk 2010 p 24

1942 by beaufighters and five were shot down in 1943 despite condors making an effort to stay away from beaufighter escorted convoys this became impossible as numbers of raf aircraft rose in december

obstacle to victory terraine 1989 p 432 statistics tell a different story coastal command sank more u boats than any other allied service a s operations in 1939 were complicated by inadequacy of effective armament more than by lack of long range aircraft until modification of dc to suit its use by aircraft command was left with bombs which were useless against u boats sinking of merchant vessels was immediate and on 13 november 1939 a directive effectively made all sorties a s missions this was essential given sinking of 73 ships in first two months of war however squadrons lacked weapons aircraft and means of detecting u boats hendrie 2006 p 67 convoys from britain lacked surface vessel escort after hudsons could only make sweeps up to but lacked endurance to stay there from gibraltar lack of flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles nevertheless great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light time when u boats could use rising and setting sun to see silhouettes on horizon hendrie 2006 p 69 however it was more difficult in practice french were still a vacillating ally until spring summer 1940 but command was still stretched by german naval forces operating from germany and then norway germans used surface vessels and u boats to break out into atlantic by using periods of dark in winter and weather conditions unfavourable to aircraft that were still without radar tiger moth biplanes were used as were civil pilots to compensate for lack of hudsons these machines were also without armament to defend from enemy fighters it could carry 250 lb dcs but there was no sufficient stock only 100 lb bombs could be used by anson and they were ineffective crew were also insufficiently trained hendrie 2006 p 72 in january 1940 u boats opened another offensive some 21 submarines sank 42 ships all were east of and thus within range of command s aircraft situation worsened although it was not disastrous until after collapse of france hendrie 2006 pp 72 73 need for long range aircraft was identified by first success of coastal command a no 228 squadron sunderland sighted a u boat enable to submerge after sinking three ships it directed destroyers to engage it u 55 was scuttled had it not been for sunderland submarine would have escaped hendrie 2006 p 73 in may and june at very western end of english channel u boats began operating effectively some 17 attacks were made by aircraft on u boats none successful asb was ordered to be replaced with dc no specialised aerial dcs were available a modified 450 lb naval dc was used no effective tactics were available to locate u boats by 1940 they attacked at night and on surface asdic was useless against surfaced submarines and flares could not be used at low altitude required by aircraft to make an attack to combat this closer co operation by navy and coastal command was needed hendrie 2006 pp 74 75 thumb left 350px under attack from short

with endurance air ministry refused raf fighter command was to receive priority to make good losses from battle of britain during 1 october to 1 december 1940 100 allied ships were sunk hendrie 2006 p 76 in first happy time may 1940 to 2 december 1940 u boats sank 298 ships for more than 1 6 million tons almost all in northwest approaches this included 37 tankers 27 british most of these kills were made by 18 u boats blair 1996 p 213 this success was achieved without help of luftwaffe which had itself failed to appreciate importance of maritime aviation meaningful german convoy reconnaissance had been nonexistent blair 1996 p 217 more effective tactics had to be used if there were to be no greater resources for command two major changes adopted by coastal command were sweeps over convoy routes and sweeps against u boat transit routes according to german and italian submarine logs both were effective and denied them chance of shadowing convoys on surface it also rapidly increased chances of a kill transit tactic over bay of biscay resulted in many air to air and air to submarine combats reaching its peak in 1943 hendrie 2006 p 77 as it was in 1940 command was credited with just two sinkings with navy vessels one sunk unaided and two damaged damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available hendrie 2006 p 78 in 1941 situation improved from 1 january to 5 march 1941 79 ships were sunk hendrie 2006 p 80 in return just one u boat was damaged but in august to december three were sunk and another three damaged by air attack with just 12 u boats at sea this was a considerable achievement dcs were being circulated to squadrons and asv was coming online though some crews did not believe in its ability to detect submarines coastal command issued tactical instructions to enact full release of dcs spaced 60 feet apart and set at a depth of 50 feet later pistols achieved 25 32 feet depth spacing was later altered to 100 feet total release was questioned a miss could mean exhausting of ammunition for other sightings aircraft like wellington could carry ten dcs one of which could sink a u boat if it hit within total release of 10 dcs would be wasteful aircraft were ordered to attack within 30 seconds of a sighting as u boats could dive in that time some crews attacked below 100 foot altitude stated and had to avoid striking submarine hendrie 2006 pp 84 85 modified naval dc could not be released at over as it broke up dc could be dropped at speeds of and was very accurate it became standard weapon hendrie 2006 p 86 along with ultra breakthroughs asv also helped contain u boat threat in 1941 maximum range for contact with a u boat was medium range was about variable capacitors were introduced to reduce strength of asv output signal to make it harder for u boats to detect searching aircraft by july 1941 improvements and intelligence drove u boats some west into atlantic where there was less density of shipping and no air support however british air patrols were reduced as enemy was now 500 miles from their bases aircraft density was reduced by 80 percent at 500 miles hendrie 2006 p 87 at this time command had to formulate a new strategy to combat u boats during preceding months command had contributed little to u boat war it contributed to capture of u 570 renamed graph and shared in three kills with naval forces in addition out of 245 air attacks on submarines just 10 to 12 were damaged terraine 1989 p 370 de la ferte on taking office as aoc coastal command demanded more focused effort on offensive operations against u boats what de la ferte meant by offensive operations was interdiction of u boats in transit from u boat pens on french atlantic coast into north atlantic trunk of atlantic u boat menace roots being in biscay ports and branches spreading far and wide to north atlantic convoys to caribbean to eastern seaboard of north america and to sea lanes where faster merchant ships sail without escort terraine 1989 p 371 bay of biscay was main transit point for u boats heading into atlantic five out of six u boats took this route and passed within range of raf air bases coastal command resolved to interdict these routes from june to november 1941 and was known as first bay offensive offensive was ineffective in period 1 september to 30 november 3 600 flying hours were made producing 31 sightings 28 attacks which possible heavily damaged only five u boats only kill came on last day of offensive when u 206 was sunk by a whitley of no 502 squadron raf which was guided by asr terraine 1989 pp 371 372 versus u boats 1942 43 in 1942 allies lost some 8 000 000 tons of shipping and though they replaced 7 000 000 tons u boats still managed to sink 1 160 out of 1 664 allied ships lost most of these sinkings took place in mid atlantic gap well within range of long range sunderlands and liberators only command lacked these aircraft in quantity following entry of united states of america into war german u boats had plenty of targets coastal command found it difficult to maintain strength its units now operated from united states west africa mediterranean iceland russia gibraltar north africa and middle east squadrons were also sent to fight in pacific war hendrie 2006 p 90 thumb right 220px leigh light used for spotting u boats on surface at night fitted to a liberator 26 february 1944 on positive side coastal command began increasing its as efficiency rocket projectiles 250 lb dc with improved pistols for shallower depths and leigh lights were introduced asv radar despite priority of bomber command was also coming into use hendrie 2006 p 91 on 6 july 1942 a u boat was sunk with help of leigh light this triggered some 42 sinkings with help of device hendrie 2006 p 94 germans provided some respite from asv radar with french metox radar warning receiver allies responded by reducing signal making it more difficult for germans to detect them later 9 1 cm wavelength radar was introduced overcoming u boat countermeasures hendrie 2006 p 95 coastal command sank 27 u boats in 1942 and damaged 18 more some of these kills were shared with navy hendrie 2006 p 104 bomber command by contrast whose priority garnered them greater resources at expense of coastal command failed to destroy a single completed u boat on slip until april 1944 hendrie 2006 p 98 arthur harris goc bomber command deplored use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted threat would be checked by attacking production overy 1980 p 71 an indication of effectiveness of air tactics was fact very few allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of british waters by late 1942 de la ferte 1960 p 185 between june 1942 to june 1943 71 enemy submarines were sunk by command nesbit 1997 p 84 in february 1943 john slessor took over as aoc during this time a debate was taking place in raf over how best to attack u boats and sink them in large numbers arthur harris aoc bomber command and united states army air forces usaaf were in favour of knocking out their bases and attacking submarine construction yards partly this was a mark of aocs in air forces particularly harris who hated using his bombers in what he considered to be defensive roles terraine 1989 p 580 slessor agreed with need to take war to u boats he preferred attacking german vessels in bay of biscay in transit to atlantic his operational tool was air vice marshal g r bromet s no 19 group offensive became collectively known as second bay offensive operation gondola lasting from 4 16 february this operation included two b 24 squadrons with scr 517 asv iii radar a total of 300 sorties were managed 19 sightings and 8 attacks were made only one u boat was sunk by no 2 squadron us units were then abruptly moved to moroccan sea frontier despite protests of slessor terraine 1989 p 581 while slessor lost some units his asw capability was enhanced with arrival of h2s radar which was used in coastal command s operations over bay and was undetectable to metox on night of 2 3 february a stirling bomber was shot down over rotterdam enabling germans to examine radar and develop counter measures they were shocked by advanced nature of its design which had proven their own research to be wide of mark harris had won majority of resources for bomber command and used h2s radar was however used for asw no 172 squadron raf and no 407 squadron rcaf had device fitted to supplement their leigh lights no 172 attacked first u boat on 5 march but was shot down submarine noted lack of warning and sent warning to u boat command however operation enclose 20 28 march 1943 achieved revenge during this period 41 u boats passed through bay with 26 sightings and 15 attacks only was sunk by a no 172 squadron wellington operation enclose ii on 6 to 13 april sighted 11 and attacked four of 25 submarines passing through sinking one u boat u 376 sunk by no 172 squadron operation soon

atlantic a turn in fortunes was experienced by coastal command in 1943 command received long range aircraft it needed liberator and increased numbers of british types including halifax and lancaster bomber in part were diverted to coastal command to deal with u boat threat in march in may command sighted 202 u boats and attacked 128 command lost heavily during this period but it succeeded in inflicting a decisive defeat on u boats moreover german blockade runners were prevented from carrying their cargo to germany held ports in france de la ferte 1960 pp 185 86 during may 1943 commander

in sinking of with aircraft of no 228 squadron raf and no 10 squadron raaf during year 1943 u boat losses amounted to 258 to all causes of this total 90 were sunk by coastal command and 51 damaged up until that time in may 1943 coastal command had sighted submarines on 825 occasions which resulted in 607 attacks only 27 were sunk and three were shared destroyed another 120 were damaged against those figures 233 aircraft 116 of which were lost owing to weather conditions were destroyed of this figure 179 were from no 19 group raf attacking u boats over bay of biscay hendrie 2006 pp 116 117

defeat of u boats in mid atlantic and their withdrawal meant bay of biscay became congested with german submarines seeking refuge thus aoc slessor revisited interdiction strategy which had been tried and failed in 1941 and 1943 this time there were crucial differences firstly improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines submerged and surfaced and intelligence breakthroughs in which british ultra organisation had broken naval enigma codes and confirmed a major change in german strategy enabled british to focus on biscay terraine 1989 p 630 when renewed air operations began over bay command found u boats not only adhering to a new strategy of avoidance they discovered germans obeying new tactical instructions german crews were ordered to transit bay in groups submerged and at night but on surface in daylight to concentrate their defensive fire later u boat designs had their firepower upgraded for this purpose also luftwaffe provided junkers ju 88 night fighters to escort submarines increased firepower and determination of german air and submarine crews to fight it out did not deter british crews third bay offensive became bloodiest in aircraft submarine battle yet which involved heavy losses despite efforts to defend themselves by 17 june air attacks had forced german submarines to make trip submerged during daylight terraine 1989 pp 630 131 effects were not just indirect patrols also inflicted increasing losses on u boats from 1 july to 2 august 1943 86 submarines passed through bay 55 were sighted and 16 sunk in exchange for 14 aircraft terraine 1989 p 631 luftwaffe made a significant effort to defend submarines in august and six allied fighters were lost in aerial combat over bay dornier do 217 and ju 88s equipped with henschel hs 293 radio controlled glide bombs were also used and forced royal navy units to abandon attacking submarines in region german submarines were ordered to hug spanish coast which was at limit of coastal command s range and in neutral territory spain was axis friendly so unlikely to protest this tactical move corrected donitz s earlier mistakes of allowing transit within range of allied air bases and germans regained a measure of safety in bay successes won in july 1943 had reached their peak and would not be repeated terraine 1989 p 633 versus u boats 1944 45 defeat of u boats in may 1943 did not signal end of battle of atlantic some 60 vessels remained and posed a threat to convoys in later months schnorchel a device originated by dutch and later adopted by kriegsmarine after germans invaded netherlands were capable of allowing a u boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available however it was sensitive to weather and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters further coastal s mark iii radar could detect mast smoke emitted was visible from 1 000 feet in some cases mast itself could be seen some one foot in diameter projecting two feet and moving at 12 15 knots technological response was to use high tea a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto surface of sea to detect u boats by late 1943 u was losing 20 percent of its strength per month some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged hendrie 2006 p 118 despite end of third and final air offensive over bay of biscay patrols continued until liberation of france bay of biscay patrol statistics for period 1 may to 2 august 1943 show coastal command had flown for 32 343 hours and lost 57 aircraft to all causes sinking 28 u boats and damaging 22 from 3 august 1943 to 31 may 1944 it flew 114 290 hours losing 123 aircraft to all causes and sinking 12 u boats and damaging ten more terraine 1989 p 632 in 1944 and 1945 u boats became less and less effective they remained at sea to tie down as much allied air and sea forces as possible to relieve pressure on other two services heer and luftwaffe when allies launched operation overlord in june 1944 u boats attempted to interdict shipping but lost 24 of their number from 6 30 june a further 12 submarines from norway joined 35 from french ports for operations only to suffer 50 attacks on first day six returned due to damage on 25 august 1944 owing to allied advance toward u boat ports all submarines were ordered to norway this evacuation from france was complete by 30 september between 6 june and 31 august 20 out of 30 schnorchel boats were lost for coastal command end of 1944 witnessed interception of 47 percent of all sighted u boats which resulted in a 20 percent of those attacked being sunk hendrie 2006 pp 121 122 main allied detector at this time was magnetic airborne detector mad mad entered service in 1943 only to find its targets had vanished from coastal waters it was able to plot and recognise distortions in earth s magnetic field caused by submarines it took some skill to use and worked only if it was directly above target it also was effective only at low altitudes it had some success in gibraltar strait but was ineffective in british waters owing to different conditions only recorded mad victory in british waters was sinking of u 1055 on 30 april 1945 off ushant another invention was american 3 cm radar and these devices along with mark 24 mine fido was responsible for destruction of u 905 and u 296

and ten others damaged for loss of just 31 aircraft performance of coastal command s strike wings was down to poor intelligence and equipment which it was refused in favour of diverting them to other roles goulter 1995 pp 122 123 as there was no defined anti shipping role in pre war plans obtaining information on enemy s seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority and once war started it was difficult to establish quickly means of acquiring this information especially after fall of norway and france in april and may 1940 extent of intelligence vacuum at start of coastal command s campaign is demonstrated by fact that air ministry planners were unaware of heavy anti aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels casualty rates often in excess of 20 percent clarified matters in 1940 goutler 1995 p 123 failure of coastal command to acquire any tangible results prompted admiralty to complain to air ministry on 5 november 1940 in december it was agreed that 15 of planned new 100 raf squadrons be given to coastal command these were to be operational by 1941 in interim four aircraft were to be given to each of squadrons to bolster their strength while a further beaufort fighter and beaufort torpedo bomber squadron were also made available goutler 1995 p 125 in mid 1941 just as aso units were finding their feet a large number of personnel and aircraft were sent to malta and desert air force to interdict erwin rommel s afrika korps supplies from italy to north africa goulter 1995 pp 138 139 adding to problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities restocking squadrons and re equipping them was slow not until 1942 did aso squadrons get recognition needed in wake of german operation cerberus maintenance was also poor each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent in coastal command it was 40 and not much higher in others at that point greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased goulter 1995

august 1941 saw this drop to 31 destroyed 73 348 tons and 58 148 000 tons damaged post war assessments reveal even this was over stated final figures were seven sunk 9 556 tons and six 13 088 seriously damaged goulter 1995 p 146 figures improved after autumn 1941 more resources better training and equipment including more capable strike aircraft resulted in increasing kill numbers goulter 1995 p 353 by 1942 increased numbers of better aircraft and armament enabled offensive capabilities of command to increase dramatically later years bristol beaufort solved medium range operational problems but long range strikes were beyond type no 2 group raf from bomber command took on aso from march to october but their blenheims were not suitable answer lay with bristol beaufighter it

atlantic in west meteorological office met relied on reports from ships in this regard need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft however in june 1940 bomber command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and accuracy of general forecasts in response from strong support no 403 squadron rcaf no 404 squadron rcaf and no 405 squadron rcaf were formed for this purpose routes requested by met usually involved distances of up to 1 000 nm hudsons were ideal for this operation but since none were available bristol blenheims filled role on 1 march 1941 coastal command assumed operational control of all units they were redesignated no 1401 to 1406 flights all were handed over to no 18 group raf in october 1940 two more flights 1407 and 1408 were sent to iceland to begin operations from there several types of single engine aircraft were used gloster gladiators hawker hurricanes and supermarine spitfires operations were conducted mostly up to 15 000 feet in wartime as aneroid capsule altimeter was not able to give accurate readings a mk 14b altimeter was used aircraft had to be flown at height measured for two minutes to allow

sea level pressure readings were taken every 100 nm usual flight patterns involved a climb to 18 000 feet on return leg it was flown 500 nm then a slow descent to sea level followed by a return to base at 1 500 feet other flights were made from covering atlantic bay of biscay north sea and western mediterranean sea coastal command covered 91 percent of allied met flights between november 1943

bomber command s no 2 group raf was carrying out this role however various problems with standard equipment led to formation of specialist formations for this duty one of first squadrons to act as a pr photographic reconnaissance unit was no 212 squadron raf which saw service in campaigns in western europe in may and june 1940 under fighter command s control however at end of that campaign admiralty pressed its case for need for coastal and sea reconnaissance with operations now over owing to evacuation of northern europe by allies these reconnaissance operations were given to coastal command on 18 june 1940 this included interpretation unit which analysed photographic evidence organisation was called pru photographic reconnaissance unit it was administered by no 16 group raf but under operational control of coastal command ashworth 1992 pp 156 160 first operations in 1940 concerned operation sea lion planned invasion of britain by wehrmacht unit was to receive 30 pr supermarine spitfire aircraft specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use they would be capable of 1 750 miles round trips however just 13 aircraft were available to unit and their range limited to 1 300 miles eventually an assortment of vickers wellington and spitfire flights were established in august 1940 first pr spitfires arrived but teething problems ensured that it would be a long time before standardisation was achieved with equipment in august coastal command flew 193 sorties over suspected invasion ports in netherlands belgium and france ashworth 1992 p 160 after threat from invasion muted in 1941 command s attention turned to battle of atlantic during this time command used martin maryland which excelled in pr work on 13 july 1941 first pr mosquito arrived though it was some time before aircraft was operational by september 1941 operational strength of pru s first flight was 37 spitfires two marylands and two mosquitoes long range spitfires and mosquitoes could reach deep into german airspace and photograph baltic sea ports and monitor german surface ships flights of eight hours were not uncommon one spitfire reached gdynia searching for german battleship tirpitz tactics needed to vary to avoid spitfires being intercepted by german patrols at heights of 30 000 ft constant trips alerted germans to british operations but admiralty insisted in volume of flights so they could keep tabs on german capital ships with surprise lost only solution was to change height and directions of approach ashworth 1992 p 163 over france losses became quite severe particularly over port of brest france german defences were strong owing to operation cerberus and operation donnerkeil a joint kriegsmarine and luftwaffe plan to enable escape of gneisenau scharnhorst and prinz eugen through english channel five spitfires and a mosquito were lost on pr operations in december 1941 failure to photograph and pin point location of ships led to their successful move to germany in february 1942 it was not until day of german operation that a coastal command aircraft caught sight of ships and by then it was too late thumb left 300px image taken by a pr coastal command spitfire

1943 decreased demand from admiralty meant pru supported raf bomber command more frequently in battle of ruhr extensive use of pr spitfires to identify and report effects of air attacks spitfires of no 542 squadron raf were used in this way to record results of operation chastise pru was also instrumental in locating german missile testing sites on baltic sea near peenemunde allowing bomber command to attack them in september 1943 admiralty asked for pru s help in operation source to cripple german heavy units in norway no 544 squadron raf contributed to success of operation after this success all pr units were standardised at strength of 20 aircraft ashworth 1992 p 167 identification of german missile sites by pru made operation crossbow possible in 1944 coastal command continually identified german v 1 launch ramps despite german camouflage efforts this enabled british aircraft to bomb them and reduce their effectiveness by one third by june 69 ramps had been located although it was not until 26 february 1945 when squadron leader j e s white actually spotted a v 2 on its launch pad ready to fire that it became clear how elusive a weapon of that size could be ashworth 1992
