was w w norton company based in new york city stein thompson cover up content book begins by describing conditions aboard iowa before explosion thompson depicts moosally ship s captain as an inept seaman who gained command of battleship through political connections under moosally s leadership or lack thereof iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies especially with regard to operations with ship s 16 inch guns book details how ship s master chief fire stephen conducted illegal gunnery experiments with 16 inch guns moosally apparently did not check to ensure that experiments were authorized or in some cases appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out stein vogel thompson cover up blue book describes explosion on april 19 1989 and heroic efforts by ship s crew to contain fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of turret s powder magazines after fires were contained moosally ordered crew to immediately begin cleaning up turret cleanup involved removing bodies of deceased turret crewman and disposing of damaged turret equipment all without photographing or otherwise recording locations of bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with resulting investigation weinberg blue thumb right rear admiral richard to thompson navy immediately began efforts to cover up cause of explosion rear admiral richard milligan assigned to lead investigation soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of deceased turret s crewmembers clayton hartwig had intentionally caused explosion after learning that hartwig had named another sailor and friend kendall truitt as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself milligan enlisted help of naval investigative service nis predecessor of naval criminal investigative service or ncis to investigate hartwig and truitt stein weinberg blue nis investigators tried to prove unsuccessfully that hartwig and truitt had had a homosexual relationship with each other and that hartwig had initiated explosion after relationship had soured as nis investigation continued information about navy s focus on two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to media leaks were later said to have come from nis and from navy s headquarters thompson alleges that during its investigation nis agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner captain joseph miceli assigned by navy to lead technical investigation into explosion had supervised preparation of powder and shells used in iowa s 16 inch guns thus according to thompson miceli had a conflict of interest in ensuring that powder ammunition or guns were not at fault in explosion after being briefed on nis s focus on hartwig miceli directed his investigative team to determine how hartwig had initiated explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator blue throughout investigation according to thompson admiral leon a edney navy s vice chief of naval operations interfered with investigation by sending suggestions to milligan on avenues of inquiry and pushing for a finding that hartwig or truitt was responsible edney interfered with investigation in order to prevent any findings that navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner also edney feared that if iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe battleships would be decommissioned and navy would lose associated admiral billets plus other warships and support ships assigned to battleship groups stein blue vogel diehl p 172 thompson glimpse p 135 in september 1989 navy announced that it had determined that hartwig intentionally caused explosion victim s family members many in media and united states congress rejected navy s findings sandia national laboratories acting on a request from united states senate committee on armed services determined that explosion could have been an accident caused by powder bags into gun s breech during loading process forced by revelation to reopen its investigation navy inexplicably according to thompson placed miceli in charge of new inquiry nineteen months later navy concluded that it could not determine who or what had caused explosion provided a partial apology to hartwig s family and closed its investigation diehl p 175 schwoebel pp xix xx 223 224 284 287 thompson pp 352 372 380 382 in
