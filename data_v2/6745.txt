rail transport in new zealand is an integral part of new zealand s transport network with a nationwide network of 4 128 km of track linking most major cities in north and south islands connected by inter island rail and road ferries rail transport in new zealand has a particular focus on bulk freight exports and imports with 19 million net tonnes moved by rail annually with 99 5 of new zealand s exports and imports being transported through country s seaports rail transport played an important role in opening up and development of hinterland outside of new zealand s predominantly dispersed and coastal settlements starting with ferrymead railway in 1863 most public railway lines were short built by provincial governments and connected major centres to their nearest seaport such as christchurch and its port at lyttelton harbour however from 1870s focus shifted to building a nationwide network linking major centres especially during vogel era of railway construction following abolition of provinces narrow gauge of 3ft 6in 1 was adopted nationally railways became centrally controlled as a government department under names new zealand government railways or new zealand railways department nzr and land transport was heavily regulated from 1931 onwards nzr eventually expanded into other transport modes especially with railways road services inter island ferries and rail air service nzr also had an extensive network of workshops by 1981 nzr employed 22 000 staff in early 1980s nzr was corporatised as new zealand railways corporation and drastically restructured especially following deregulation of land transport in 1983 corporation became a state owned enterprise in 1987 required to turn a profit in 1991 rail inter island ferry and infrastructure businesses of railways corporation were split off into new zealand rail limited which was in turn privatised in 1993 and renamed tranz rail in 1995 parcels and bus service business units were also privatised and railways corporation continued to dispose of surplus land central government first auckland metro railway network in 2001 then rest of country in 2004 and finally rail and ferry operations in 2008 creating a new state owned enterprise kiwirail today services are primarily provided by kiwirail and focused on bulk freight with a small number of tourist orientated passenger services such as tranzalpine coastal pacific and northern explorer dunedin railways also operate tourist trains out of dunedin and a number of heritage operators run charter specials from time to time urban passenger rail services exist only in auckland and wellington rail in new zealand has received significant and ongoing government investment since re nationalisation in 2008 with two urban rail systems being upgraded history provincial period 1863 1876 railway network was initially constructed by provincial governments of new zealand from 1863 onwards new zealand s first public railway was opened in that year running short distance between christchurch and wharf at ferrymead and built by canterbury provincial railways canterbury provincial railways were built to broad gauge of in february 1867 southland province opened a branch from invercargill to bluff to international standard gauge of vogel era thumb 200px left first parnell tunnel under construction on auckland drury line in c 1873 line was originally started by auckland province but completed by central government from 1870 central government of sir julius vogel proposed infrastructure including railway development to be funded by overseas loans of ps10 million central government also adopted a national gauge of with passing of railways act 1871 first narrow gauge line was opened on 1 january 1873 in otago province port chalmers branch under auspices of dunedin and port chalmers railway company limited auckland s first railway between auckland and onehunga opened in 1873 vogel also arranged for of england to undertake several rail construction contracts to be built by brogden s navvies recruited in england central government control 1876 1982 following abolition of provinces in 1876 railway lines were controlled by central government originally under public works department and from 1880 under new zealand railways department a minister of railways was responsible for department and was a member of new zealand cabinet a few private companies built railways in new zealand including new zealand midland railway company wellington and manawatu railway company waimea plains railway and thames valley and rotorua railway company only wellington and manawatu railway company nationalised in 1908 achieved any measure of success with rest being purchased by government before completion of their intended railway lines one exception to this rule was railway board in southland which was owned by state mines department and a local county council until its dissolution in 1990 first major route was completed between christchurch and dunedin in 1878 later extended to invercargill following year north island main trunk linking capital city wellington with largest city auckland opened in 1908 after 23 years of construction at network s peak in 1952 about 100 branch lines were operating large scale closures of branch railway lines began in 1960s and 1970s network was initially protected from road transport competition under transport licensing act 1931 but this protection was gradually eased until its total abolition in 1983 along with deregulation of land transport industry networks of north and south islands were independent of one another until introduction of inter island roll on roll off rail ferry service in 1962 by railways department now branded corporatised ownership 1982 1993 in 1982 railways department was corporatised into a new entity at same time land transport was deregulated railways department became new zealand railways corporation corporation embarked on a major restructuring laying off thousands of staff and cutting unprofitable services after 1983 land transport deregulation there was a substantial rationalisation of freight facilities many stations and smaller yards were closed and freight train services were sped up increased in length and made heavier with removal of guard s vans in 1987 and gradual elimination of older rolling stock particularly four wheeled wagons in 1987 railways corporation became a state owned enterprise required to make a profit in 1990 core rail operations of corporation were transferred to new zealand rail limited another state owned enterprise with corporation retaining non core assets which were gradually disposed of including a significant land portfolio in many cases corporation did not dispose of land due to treaty of waitangi claims and has continued to manage land private ownership 1993 2004 new zealand rail limited was privatised in 1993 in 1995 new owners adopted name tranz rail and listed company on new zealand stock market and nasdaq rail freight volumes increased between 1993 and 2000 from 8 5m net tonnes to 14 99m net tonnes carried annually and then gradually fell until 2003 to 13 7m tonnes freight volumes then increased again to 16 1m tonnes carried annually in 2012 tranz rail was accused of deliberately running down some lines through lack of maintenance midland line for example which mostly carries coal from west coast to lyttelton was assessed to be in a safe but poor state by government safety body in 2003 and has needed major repairs tranz rail was accused of forcing freight onto roads and in 2002 introduced a scheme that assumed that most freight would be carried in containers on unit trains made up of fixed consists of flat deck wagons container loading depots were constructed at major freight terminals one of reasons often cited for these policies was that cost of using road transport to tranz rail was less than that of using rail because road infrastructure is provided as a public good whereas rail network was a private good government purchase of auckland rail network government purchased auckland metropolitan rail network from tranz rail for 81 million in 2002 tranz rail retained time slots for freight trains and auckland regional council was granted slots for it to contract operation of suburban passenger trains auckland railway stations not already local council owned were transferred to auckland regional transport network limited owned by auckland territorial authorities which was merged with auckland regional transport authority arta a subsidiary of auckland regional council arc with creation of super city auckland council in 2010 arta was dissolved and its role was taken over by auckland transport a new council controlled organisation private and government ownership 2004 2008 in 2003 share price of tranz rail dropped to a record low on new zealand dropping 88 in value in 12 months as a result of its poor financial state and credit downgrading government then considered various schemes for bailing it out in return for regaining control of rail infrastructure cited reasons included a level playing field for freight movements on road and rail and ensuring access to tracks for all interested parties toll holdings of australia made a successful takeover bid for tranz rail subject to an agreement to sell back infrastructure to government for 1 in exchange toll was granted exclusive use of rail network subject to minimum freight and passenger volumes payment of track access charges and its own investment in new rolling stock this transaction took place in july 2004 and tranz rail was renamed toll nz government committed 200 million of taxpayer funding for deferred maintenance and capital improvements via a new subsidiary of new zealand railways corporation ontrack an interim agreement was signed by toll nz for track access toll paid a nominal track access charge while negotiating a final agreement with ontrack these negotiations did not progress and eventually went to arbitration at start of 2008 renationalisation 2008 current thumb right 5143 at wellington railway station on 1 july 2008 at launch of kiwirail instead of concluding a final track access agreement with toll in 2008 government purchased rail and ferry assets for 690 million effective 1 july 2008 new organisation created to operate services on rail network was named kiwirail ownership of national rail network is vested in kiwirail holdings limited with land owned by new zealand railways corporation kiwirail network formerly ontrack is a division of kiwirail that maintains and upgrades rail infrastructure and is responsible for control of network i e train control and signalling other rail operating companies using rail network include transdev auckland and transdev wellington who operate suburban services in auckland and wellington respectively and dunedin railways who operate tourist trains out of dunedin kiwirail released in 2010 a 10 year turnaround plan for rail industry this was accompanied by significant government investment in kiwirail of over 2 1 billion during period 2008 to february 2017 in may 2017 government announced a further 450 million capital injection and that kiwirail would be subject to a further significant review plan has been significantly undermined by christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 2016 kaikoura earthquake pike river mine disaster coal price collapse coal miner solid energy going into voluntary administration in 2016 and major motive power issues with new dl class of locomotives nevertheless significant improvements in freight volumes have followed other than with coal two of kiwirail s major customers mainfreight and fonterra also invested heavily in rail related infrastructure mainfreight allocated 60 million for investment in new railhead depots while fonterra invested in a new rail hub complex in hamilton and another planned for mosgiel in 2019 government began a future of rail review and in december 2019 released a draft new zealand rail plan outlining changes to rail transport industry draft plan proposes a number of major changes most significant being future funding of rail network through national land transport fund current projects city rail link is an underground rail line currently under construction linking transport centre to mount eden railway station in auckland and is due to open in 2024 light rail networks are planned for auckland and wellington pressure group greater auckland proposed regional rapid rail initiative in 2017 including tilt trains with a maximum speed of 160 km h this network would provide passenger services linking auckland with hamilton tauranga and rotorua in december 2018 government of new zealand committed funding to reintroducing a five year trial rail service between papakura in southern auckland to hamilton starting in 2020 operations freight thumb

majority of its revenue traffic in 2017 2018 financial year freight contributed 350 7 million in revenue or 57 of company s total revenue freight is mostly bulk traffic geared towards export industries with general freight being largely restricted to containerised and products on trunk route major bulk freight includes coal lime steel wood and wood products paper pulp dry and liquid milk cars fertiliser grain and shipping containers freight levels have returned to level that they were at when railway had a virtual monopoly on land transport prior to 1983 in 1980 11 8 million tonnes of freight was moved by rail in 1994 this had decreased to 9 4 million tonnes by 1999 tonnes carried had increased to 12 9 million tonnes slightly more than 1975 peak in 2006 2007 financial year 13 7 million tonnes of freight were carried this equated to 3 96 million net tonne kilometres or number of tonnes of traffic gained in 2008 2009 compared to amount of traffic hauled in 2006 2007 year in recent years amount of freight moved by rail has increased substantially and has started to gain market share in non bulk areas as well freight on north island main trunk line between auckland and palmerston north saw an increase of 39 in freight volumes between 2006 and 2007 five daily trains on 667 km line reduced truck volumes on route by around 120 per day a 2008 study by ministry of transport predicted that by 2031 rail freight volumes would increase to 23 million tonnes per annum or 70 on 2006 2007 financial year in 2018 same report found freight levels had increased by 17 between 2007 and 2012 long distance passenger services as of 2017 there are only four long distance passenger routes northern explorer between auckland and wellington capital connection between wellington and palmerston north coastal pacific between picton and christchurch and tranzalpine between christchurch and greymouth all are operated by great journeys of new zealand a division of kiwirail and are tourism focused except for capital connection which is a commuter service dunedin railways operate tourist trains out of dunedin with frequent services on former otago central railway line and occasional services north from dunedin to palmerston mixed trains were once backbone of new zealand railway passenger system on branch and even main lines but last scheduled mixed train ran between and opua on 6 june 1977 with a rake of assorted wagons and one or two passenger carriages often listed as goods with car in timetables they were slow often stopping and shunting wagons en route in 1930s they ran from christchurch to springfield on midland line and into 1950s overnight between christchurch and dunedin on north island main trunk they ran during day while expresses ran at night on okahukura stratford line they lasted to early 1970s in 1950s and 1960s most provincial routes had railcar and locomotive hauled passenger services in 1965 25 million passengers travelled by rail by 1998 number had decreased to 11 7 million a number of services came to an end in early 2000s including waikato connection between hamilton and auckland kaimai express between auckland and tauranga express between auckland and rotorua bay express between wellington and napier southerner between christchurch and invercargill and northerner night service between auckland and wellington suburban passenger services currently auckland and wellington have suburban passenger services in both cities respective local governments own suburban passenger rolling stock and contract operation of services to a third party in both cases transdev wellington wellington suburban network has five lines johnsonville melling hutt valley and wairarapa in 1938 wellington became second city after christchurch service to lyttelton to have electric suburban trains and from 1970 to 2014 was only city with them from july 2016 services have been operated by transdev wellington prior to transdev kiwirail s tranz metro division held contract wellington s suburban rolling stock consists of electric multiple units with diesel locomotive hauled carriage trains used on wairarapa service all of rolling stock except diesel locomotives is owned by greater wellington rail limited a subsidiary of greater wellington regional council transdev wellington contracts kiwirail to provide and operate required diesel locomotives auckland auckland s network consists of four lines southern eastern western and onehunga all services on these lines are provided by am class electric trains conversion from diesel being completed by end of 2015 with exception of non electrified section of track between papakura and pukekohe where a diesel train shuttle service operates transdev auckland operates electric trains on behalf of auckland transport at in recent years mothballed onehunga branch was reopened 2010 and a new line was built manukau branch opened april 2012 recent major projects include electrification of auckland suburban network and building of city rail link most auckland rolling stock is owned by auckland transport which funds and coordinates all services other cities in 2017 recently elected labour led coalition government proposed to provide commuter rail in christchurch and to provide long distance commuter services from auckland to hamilton and tauranga other cities christchurch dunedin invercargill and napier hastings once had suburban services but they were withdrawn due to a lack of patronage christchurch lyttelton suburban service was stopped in 1972 when passengers were down to a last boat train for ferry service to wellington ran in 1976 10 5 km line to lyttelton was electrified from 1929 to 1970 there were worker s trains north to rangiora two in morning and two in afternoon dunedin had suburban trains to port chalmers and mosgiel withdrawn on 3 december 1982 invercargill to bluff service stopped in 1967 in 1929 sole clayton steam railcar had been used trains ran between napier and hastings but some were replaced by an new zealand railways road services bus in 1926 and soon they ceased altogether worker s concession tickets had been introduced in 1897 initially for wellington hutt service and extended next year to auckland christchurch and dunedin and then between westport and a 1979 nzr report time for change said that wellington suburban services revenue met only 26 of operating costs dunedin was 28 auckland 46 school commuters up to 1930s and 1940s pupils had to commute to larger towns for secondary education from places that only had a primary school for example from rural canterbury to christchurch technical high school another famous example was sir edmund hillary who commuted by school train from to auckland grammar school for three and a half hours a one hour and 40 minutes journey each way school trains ran between picton and blenheim allowing picton students to attend marlborough college split into marlborough boys college and marlborough girls college in 1963 service was cancelled when queen charlotte college opened in picton in 1965 and those students remaining at marlborough colleges switched to buses nzr offered season tickets for primary and secondary school students from 1877 using funds paid for out of education budget and from 1885 for students attending primary schools from a place lacking a local school premier richard seddon and liberal government were keen to place secondary education within reach of poorest man in colony with an extension of free passes in 1898 and 1909 school season passes increased from in 1899 to 29 705 in 1914 15 when one in seven primary and secondary students travelled by train some pupils reached home after dark in winter and had to milk cows before and after school john pascoe said that some children spend up to six hours a day travelling boys and girls were usually segregated infrastructure and mechanical rail network new zealand rail network has around of line of which about is electrified at network s peak in 1953 some of line was open there are currently 1787 bridges and 150 tunnels totalling in length on rail network entire network is built to gauge chosen due to need to cross mountainous terrain in country s interior and lower cost of construction difficult terrain meant that some lines took years to complete and has necessitated a number of complicated engineering feats notably spiral and rimutaka incline latter no longer in use network has been subject of major upgrading works on a number of occasions biggest of these were westfield deviation of north island main trunk from auckland to westfield junction via panmure and glen innes opened 1930 flat deviation in wellington opened 1937 rimutaka deviation to wairarapa opened 1955 and kaimai deviation in bay of plenty opened 1978 all of these involved major tunnelling works of close to each in two latter cases significant infrastructure improvements were also carried out on north island main trunk in mid 1980s some as part of electrification scheme as part of 10 year turnaround plan announced in 2010 a number of regional lines were placed under threat of closure all lines in northland that form part of north auckland line stratford okahukura line in taranaki mothballed since 2009 northern portion of wairarapa line gisborne napier section of palmerston north gisborne line mothballed due to storm damage north of wairoa early 2012 mothballed napier gisborne from october 2012 as part of kiwirail s 10 year long term plan most new capital will be spent on locomotives wagons and auckland wellington christchurch freight corridor signalling six signalling systems are used in new zealand automatic signalling rules asr double line automatic dla single line automatic sla centralised traffic control ctc track warrant control and station limits signals are of colour light type and operate on speed signalling principals i e signals tell driver what speed they should proceed but not necessarily route they will take auckland suburban network is also equipped with european train control system level 1 signalling and train protection motive power steam from its inception until 1950s steam locomotives were main motive power on new zealand s railways initially steam locomotives were mostly imported from united kingdom from various manufacturers first major class was f class tank locomotives of which 88 were imported from 1870s locomotives were imported from united states and generally found to be better suited to new zealand s conditions although pro british public and politicians preferred locomotives from united kingdom in 1889 nzr began manufacturing its own locomotives starting with nzr w class local engineering firm a g price also manufactured a significant number of steam locomotives for nzr diesel dieselisation of rail transport began in late 1940s with small shunting locomotives first mainline diesel locomotives english electric df class was introduced in 1954 but it was not until introduction of da class locomotives following year that steam began to be seriously displaced in north island last steam locomotive to be built by nzr ja 1274 was introduced into service in december 1956 and by 1967 steam had all but disappeared from north island steam remained in south island until november 1971 when last seven ja locomotives that worked main south line were withdrawn from revenue service steam in south island having been displaced by dj class locomotive starting from mid 1970s first generation diesel locomotives were withdrawn being replaced by new locomotives predominantly designs from north america general electric manufactured dx class were introduced from 1972 1975 and original df class were withdrawn and general motors df class introduced from 1979 nzr also rebuilt some of dg class locomotives at same time newest locomotives of da class were rebuilt as dc class locomotives in australia and new zealand last of first generation diesel locomotives were withdrawn in late 1980s and early 1990s thumb chinese built dl class locomotive 9193 hauling a freight train at in november 2012 dl class are newest locomotives on new zealand s network due to a decline in rail freight volumes following land transport deregulation in 1983 and introduction of electrification on north island main trunk no new diesel locomotives were introduced in 1990s some second hand locomotives were imported from queensland rail in mid 1990s and rebuilt as dq class locomotives most of these locomotives were then re exported to then part owned by tranz rail first new diesel locomotives imported to new zealand were dl class locomotives from china arriving from 2010 onwards electric in 1920s two short sections of railway line were electrified at 1500 v dc arthur s pass to electrified 1923 and christchurch to lyttelton 1929 both which have since been decommissioned electrification of wellington suburban network at 1500 v dc began in 1938 with johnsonville line followed by north island main trunk nimt as far as in 1940 and hutt valley lines in 1953 55 nimt electrification was extended to in 1983 and to in 2011 in 1988 25 kv ac electrification of north island main trunk nimt between palmerston north and hamilton was commissioned and a new generation of mainline electric locomotives ef class was introduced couplings thumbnail norwegian couplers on historic railway wagons in little river new zealand norwegian coupling was standard coupler used in new zealand for non passenger rolling stock and locomotives until recent years in 1970s a large heavy duty version of chopper coupler was developed initially for dx class auckland s am class and wellington s fp ft class matangi electric multiple units use scharfenberg coupling janney alliance coupler was first used on heavy coal trains and have been progressively introduced on newer rolling stock and rebuilt locomotives a program of retrofitting older rolling stock has been underway since 2013 workshops new zealand railways department had major workshops at addington christchurch wanganui hillside dunedin petone lower hutt near wellington then hutt lower hutt near wellington and newmarket then auckland all were progressively closed mostly in 1980s leaving only hutt workshops still operating a number of small maintenance depots also currently operate for example at addington christchurch accidents safety regulation is responsibility of new zealand transport agency also investigates accidents and incidents with a view to ensuring regulations and rules were observed transport accident investigation commission may also inquire into selected accidents and incidents to determine circumstances and causes and help prevent similar occurrences in future modern signalling train detection and communications systems as well as an overall decline in rail passenger traffic has greatly decreased number of fatal accidents occurring on new zealand s railway network new zealand s most serious rail disaster occurred on christmas eve 1953 during visit of queen elizabeth ii when a lahar washed away bridge in disaster 151 lives were lost when bridge collapsed as a wellington auckland express passenger train was crossing it next most serious accident was hyde railway disaster of 1943 when cromwell dunedin express derailed after travelling at excessive speed 21 lives were lost driver was later found to have been intoxicated and was jailed for manslaughter heritage
