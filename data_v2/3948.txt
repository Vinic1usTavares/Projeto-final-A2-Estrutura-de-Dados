wang yinglai 13 november 1907 5 may 2001 also known as ying lai wang was a chinese biochemist recognized as first person to create synthetic insulin a major scientific breakthrough that produced a biologically active compound from inorganic chemicals he was one of first group of scientists elected to chinese academy of sciences in 1955 he founded shanghai institute of biochemistry in 1958 and served as its director until his retirement in 1984 early life and education wang was born in kinmen county fujian province on 13 november 1907 in final years of qing dynasty he became an orphan at age of six when his mother died his father an overseas chinese merchant had died four years before despite adverse circumstances he pursued an education throughout 1920s and 1930s when china was mired in wars and turmoil he graduated from department of chemistry of university of nanking university and was admitted to graduate school of university of cambridge in 1938 where he studied under david keilin after obtaining his ph d in 1941 wang stayed to teach at cambridge and conduct research at dunn nutritional laboratory he transferred to molteno institute for research in parasitology in 1944 career wang returned to china at end of world war ii despite efforts by keilin and joseph needham to persuade him to stay at cambridge determined to help develop scientific research in china he accepted a research professorship at medical school of national central university in nanjing and later joined medical institute of academia sinica in 1948 after founding of people s republic of china in 1949 wang became deputy director of newly established shanghai institute of physiology and biochemistry under director bei shizhang in 1955 he was among first group of scientists to be elected to newly established chinese academy of sciences in 1958 he established shanghai institute of biochemistry and served as its director until his retirement in 1984 in these capacities he recruited many prominent chinese scientists from abroad including future academicians cao chen lu tsou zou chenglu wang and niu wang s most significant contribution was total chemical synthesis of insulin he started project in 1958 with a team of scientists who first synthesized 20 amino acids that constitute proteins and then used them to produce chains of insulin his team successfully synthesized insulin in 1965 first in world to do so it was a major breakthrough to produce a biologically active compound from inorganic chemicals many scientists including nobel prize committee member arne and physics laureate chen ning yang believed wang s total synthesis of insulin was worthy of a nobel prize however cultural revolution 1966 1976 intervened and chinese communist government considered nobel prize a symbol of western decadence instead wang was held a virtual prisoner in a building at his institute and forced to study mao zedong thought he was unable to conduct research for most of ten years during an interview in 1986 wang told straits times that we were like proverbial hare which took a long nap while others were not like tortoise after end of cultural revolution wang and his team resumed their work and achieved synthesis from inorganic chemicals of a transfer rna trna another significant biological molecule in late 1970s wang established several training programs for young biochemists many of whom later became accomplished scientists including academicians li xu genjun hong liu and wang awards in 1988 william joseph whelan founder of miami winter symposium for biotechnology created special achievement award of symposium and presented first award to wang in 1996 he was nominated by many scientists for ho leung ho lee prize for achievement in science and technology when he won award with its prize money of one million yuan he used it to fund a scholarship for graduate students at chinese academy of sciences personal life wang met liu liu run ling a student at university when he was recuperating from tuberculosis in beijing they married and had two sons wang jiahu wang jia hu and wang wang jia nan liu worked as a teacher and started a
