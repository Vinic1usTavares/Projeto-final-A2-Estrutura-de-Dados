explains why he failed to join frodo he had been summoned to consult with saruman but had been held captive saruman initially had proposed that wizards ally themselves with rising power of sauron in order to eventually control him for their own ends saruman went on to suggest that they could take ring for themselves and challenge sauron when gandalf refused both options saruman imprisoned him in tower of orthanc at isengard hoping to learn from him location of ring whilst on summit of orthanc gandalf observed that saruman had industrialised formerly green valley of isengard and was creating his own army of half orcs half man fighters and wargs to rival sauron fellowship of ring book ii chapter ii p 341 gandalf s escape from roof on back of a great eagle left saruman in a desperate position as he knew he would now be known as traitor to his former allies but was unable to procure ring directly for himself and therefore could not hope to truly rival sauron in two towers 1954

circa two thousand years before beginning of lord of rings they are envoys of godlike valar sent to challenge sauron by inspiring people of middle earth rather than by direct conflict return of king appendix b third age p 365 tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels letters no 156 p 202 of gandalf i would venture to say that he was an incarnate angel strictly an angelos that is with other istari wizards those who know an emissary from lords of west sent to middle earth as great crisis of sauron loomed on horizon saruman initially travels in east he is later appointed head of white council and eventually settles at gondor s outpost of isengard fifty years before lord of rings after his studies reveal that one ring might be found in river anduin near sauron s stronghold at dol guldur he helps white council drive out sauron in order to facilitate his search silmarillion of rings of power and third age pp 361 365 unfinished tales also contains various drafts not included in lord of rings that describe saruman s attempts to frustrate sauron s chief servants nazgul in their search for ring during early part of fellowship of ring in one version he considers

hunt for ring pp 436 459 another brief account describes how five istari were chosen by valar for their mission unfinished tales part four chapter ii istari pp 508 509 creation and development tolkien had been writing lord of rings for several years when saruman came into existence as solution to a long unresolved plot development and his role and characteristics continued to emerge in course of writing tolkien started work on book in late 1937 but was initially unsure of how story would develop biography part 5 chapter ii p 247 unlike some of other characters in book saruman had not appeared in tolkien s 1937 novel hobbit or in his then unpublished quenta silmarillion and related mythology which date back to 1917 when he wrote of gandalf s failure to meet frodo tolkien did not know what had caused it and later said most disquieting of all saruman had never been revealed to me and i was as concerned as frodo at gandalf s failure to appear letters no 163 p 217 tolkien s son christopher has said that early stages of creation of lord of rings proceeded in a series of waves and that having produced first half of fellowship of ring tolkien rewrote tale from start three times return of shadow foreword p 3 saruman first appeared during a fourth phase of writing in a rough narrative outline dated august 1940 intended to account for gandalf s absence it describes how a wizard titled white or grey who has fallen under influence of sauron lures gandalf to his stronghold and traps him treason of isengard chapter iv pp 70 73 outline suggests that saruman is assisted by giant treebeard an early and evil iteration of ent treebeard from finished book full story of saruman s betrayal was later added to existing chapters treason of isengard chapter vi pp 130 136 several of saruman s other appearances in book emerged in process of writing christopher tolkien believes that old man seen by aragorn legolas and gimli at edge of fangorn forest near beginning of two towers is in original drafts intended to be gandalf in finished version he is saruman treason of isengard chapter xx p 403 chapter xiv p 428 also gandalf says about incident you certainly didn t see me so you must have seen saruman similarly in first drafts of chapter scouring of shire sharkey is successively a ruffian met by hobbits and then that man s unseen boss it is only in second draft of chapter that as christopher tolkien puts it his father perceive d that sharkey was in fact saruman sauron defeated chapter ix scouring of shire p 93 saruman did not appear in first draft of chapter scouring of shire christopher tolkien writes it is striking that here virtually at end of lord of rings and in an element that my father had long meditated that among other things he did not perceive that it was saruman who was real boss sharkey at bag end name used by saruman s henchmen for their diminished leader is said in a footnote to final text to be derived from an term meaning old man saruman s death scene in which his body shrivels away to skin and bones revealing long years of death and a pale shrouded figure rises over corpse return of king book vi chapter viii p 363 was not added until page proofs of completed book were being reviewed by tolkien sauron defeated chapter ix p 103 john d and jared lobdell are among those to write that scene shows similarities to death of 2000 year old sorceress ayesha in h rider haggard s 1887 novel she a history of adventure reader s companion 2005 p 264 characterisation tolkien described saruman at time of lord of rings as having a long face and a high forehead he had deep darkling eyes his hair and beard were white but strands of black still showed around his lips and ears two towers book iii chapter x p 222 his hair is elsewhere described as having been black when he first arrived in middle earth he is referred to as saruman white and is said to have originally worn white robes but on his first entry in fellowship of ring they instead appear to be woven from all colours they and changed hue so that eye was bewildered and he names himself saruman of many colours fellowship of ring book ii chapter ii pp 338 339 power of saruman s voice is noted throughout book jonathan evans calls characterization of saruman in chapter voice of saruman a tour de force j r r tolkien encyclopedia saruman by jonathan evans pp 589 590 roger sale says of same chapter that tolkien valiantly tried to do something worth doing which he simply cannot bring off tolkien and critics 15 tolkien and frodo baggins by roger sale p 270 tom shippey writes that saruman talks like a politician no other character in middle earth has saruman s trick of balancing phrases against each other so that are resolved and none comes out with words as empty as deploring ultimate worst of all real what is real change road to middle earth chapter iv council of elrond pp 135 138 shippey refers to tolkien s northern theory of courage which appears in tolkien s 1936 british academy lecture shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with archaic stoicism and directness that tolkien employs for other characters such as dwarven king dain which shippey believes represent tolkien s view of heroism in mould of beowulf after defeat of his armies having been caught in betrayal of sauron saruman is offered refuge by gandalf in return for his aid but having chosen his path is unable to turn from it evans has compared character of saruman to that of satan in john milton s paradise lost in his use of rhetoric and in this final refusal of redemption conquered by pride and hatred literary themes saruman has been identified by critics as demonstrating fall of an originally good character and has distinctively modern connections with technology tolkien writes that lord of rings was often criticised for portraying all characters as either good or bad with no shades of grey a point to which he responds by proposing saruman along with denethor and boromir as examples of characters with more nuanced loyalties letters no 154 p 197 marjorie burns writes that while saruman is an imitative and lesser double of sauron reinforcing dark lord s character type he is also a contrasting double of gandalf who becomes saruman as he should have been after saruman fails in his original purpose j r r tolkien encyclopedia doubles by marjorie burns pp 127 128 saruman was great once of a noble kind that we should not dare raise our hands against but decays as book goes on master of middle earth chapter 4 p 79 kocher quoting frodo s speech of return of king book vi chapter viii p 362 patricia meyer spacks calls him one of main case histories in book of gradual destructive effect of willing submission to evil wills tolkien and critics 6 power and meaning in lord of rings p 84 85 paul kocher identifies saruman s use of a palantir a seeing stone as immediate cause of his downfall but also suggests that through his study of arts of enemy saruman was drawn into imitation of sauron master of middle earth chapter iii cosmic order p 51 chapter iv sauron and nature of evil p 68 according to jonathan evans and spacks saruman succumbs to lust for power while shippey identifies saruman s devotion to goals of knowledge organization and control as his weakness tolkien writes that istari s chief temptation and that to which saruman fell is impatience leading to a desire to force others to do good and then to a simple desire for power letters no 181 p 237 treebeard describes saruman as having a mind of metal and wheels two towers book iii chapter iv p 84 quote is used as an illustration by shippey spacks and kocher among many others evil in lord of rings tends to be associated with machinery whereas good is usually associated with nature both saruman s stronghold of isengard and his altered shire demonstrate negative effects of industrialization and isengard is overthrown when forests in shape of ents literally rise against it patrick curry says tolkien is hostile to industrialism linking this to widespread urban development that took place in west midlands where tolkien grew up in first decades of 20th century he identifies saruman as one of key examples given in book of evil effects of industrialization and by extension imperialism j r r tolkien encyclopedia industrialization by patrick curry p 294 shippey notes that saruman s name repeats this view of technology in mercian dialect of anglo saxon used by tolkien to represent language of rohan in book root word means clever skillful or ingenious and has associations with both technology and treachery that are fitting for tolkien s portrayal of saruman cunning man road to middle earth chapter 4 horses of mark pp 139 140 he also writes of saruman s distinctively modern association with communism in way shire is run under his control goods are taken for fair distribution which since they are mainly never seen again shippey terms an unusually modern piece of hypocrisy in way evil presents itself in middle earth road to middle earth chapter 5 interlacements and ring p 195 saruman is in part architect of his own downfall kocher randall helms and shippey write that saruman s actions in first half of two towers although intended to further his own interests in fact lead to his defeat and that of sauron his orcs help split fellowship at parth galen and in carrying off two of hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin in turn this frees rohirrim to intervene at battle of pelennor fields and then together with men of gondor to assault sauron s stronghold of mordor and distract him from frodo s final effort to destroy ring shippey says that this demonstrates value of persistence in face of despair even if a way out cannot be seen road to middle earth chapter 5 interlacements and ring pp 186 188 kocher and helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of reversed effects of evil intentions throughout book master of middle earth chapter iii cosmic order pp 44 46 and tolkien s world chapter v structure and aesthetic of lord of rings pp 92 97 in end diminished saruman is murdered his throat cut and shippey notes that when he dies his spirit dissolved into nothing he identifies saruman as best example in book of a distinctive 20th century view of evil that he attributes to tolkien in which individuals are eaten up inside by devotion to some abstraction author of century chapter iv saruman and denethor technologist and reactionary pp 121 128 referring to saruman s demise kocher says that he is one example of consistent theme of nothingness as fate of evil throughout lord of rings master of middle earth chapter iv sauron and nature of evil p 79 adaptations saruman has appeared in film audio and stage adaptations of lord of rings bbc radio produced first adaptation in 1955 in which saruman was played by robert farquharson and which has not survived tolkien was

towers saruman is voiced by fraser kerr he has only one major scene his attempt to persuade gandalf to join him he appears again briefly before battle of helm s deep speaking to his army character is dressed in red and is called saruman and aruman at different points smith and matthews suggest that use of aruman was intended to avoid confusion with sauron films books radio series jrr tolkien s

of rings pp 63 70 bbc radio s second adaptation of lord of rings from 1981 presents saruman much as in books smith and matthews report peter howell s performance as saruman as brilliantly ambiguous drifting from mellifluous to almost savage from moment to moment without either mood seeming to contradict other films books radio series an unexpected party p 83 saruman is played by matti in 1993 television miniseries that was produced and aired by finnish broadcaster yle thumb christopher lee plays saruman in lord of rings and hobbit in peter jackson s film trilogy 2001 2003 saruman is significantly more active in first two films than in corresponding books and he appears in several scenes that are not depicted in tolkien s work he was portrayed by christopher lee in films saruman is depicted presenting himself outright as a servant of sauron smith and matthews suggest that saruman s role is built up as a substitute for sauron story s main antagonist who never appears directly in book jackson confirms this view in commentary to dvd they also suggest that having secured veteran british horror actor christopher lee to play saruman it made sense to make greater use of his star status films books radio series return of king 2003 p 177 despite this increased role in first two films scenes involving saruman that were shot for use in third film lord of rings return of king were not used in cinematic release a decision which shocked lee jackson reasoned that it would be anticlimactic to show saruman s fate in second movie after battle of helm s deep and too retrospective for it to be in third one cut scenes end with saruman falling to his death from top of orthanc after being stabbed by wormtongue and include material from chapter scouring of shire they are included at

that necromancer is sauron resurgent but saruman dismisses this idea saruman also disapproves of quest to reclaim dwarf kingdom of because it will wake sleeping dragon smaug though gandalf and galadriel fear that if sauron reappears smaug will join his forces eventually gandalf presumed that saruman would disapprove so he had oakenshield and company leave rivendell before council began in
