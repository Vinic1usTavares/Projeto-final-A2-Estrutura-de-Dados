1851 atlantic hurricane season was first atlantic hurricane season to be included in official atlantic tropical cyclone record six known tropical cyclones occurred during season earliest of which formed on june 25 and latest of which dissipated on october 19 these dates fall within range of most atlantic tropical cyclone activity none of cyclones existed simultaneously with another of six storms two only have a single point in their track known two other hurricanes were reported during season one near tampico and other near jamaica however they are not in official hurricane database there may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during season meteorologist christopher landsea estimates that between zero and six storms were missed from official database due to small tropical cyclone size sparse ship reports and relatively unpopulated coastlines toc season summary five of six tropical cyclones affected land including three making landfall with winds of over 74 mph 119 km h first struck texas as a hurricane which caused moderate to heavy damage particularly to shipping in matagorda bay one death was indirectly related to hurricane as well as at least two

moving ashore near matagorda bay later that night near peak intensity with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 977 mbar due to lack of observations it is possible hurricane struck as equivalent of a category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson scale cyclone slowly weakened as it turned northwestward with hurricane force wind gusts reported 24 hours after landfall in current day medina county it is estimated that storm dissipated early on june 28 over central texas hurricane produced heavy damage near where it moved ashore having been described as most disastrous experienced there

strengthened and reached peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h early on august 23 about 215 miles 345 km south southeast of pensacola florida turning northeastward hurricane moved ashore near panama city florida at peak intensity with an estimated barometric pressure of 960 mbar it accelerated across southeastern united states weakening to a tropical storm before exiting north carolina into atlantic ocean on august 25 on august 27 it was last observed over newfoundland as a weak tropical storm hurricane passed near saint lucia on august 17 where high tides and rough seas were reported flooding was reported in northern puerto rico during its passage impact is unknown in hispaniola and cuba hurricane produced an estimated storm tide of 12 feet 3 7 m at saint marks combination of waves and storm tide flooded coastal areas destroying 50 of cotton crops in some areas rough seas destroyed a brig killing 17 people and another person drowned due to a shipwreck many ships were expected to have been lost in storm resulting in fear of potentially hundreds of deaths storm caused heavy damage along coastline and in apalachicola winds destroyed roofs of all but two or three buildings dog

carolina a nearby ship with call sign reported estimated winds of 60 mph 95 km h which was judged to be peak intensity of tropical storm another ship on september 16 reported similar winds in same location thus it was estimated to have remained nearly stationary for three days its complete track is unknown tropical storm six a tropical storm developed on october 16 about 155 miles 250 km east of cape canaveral florida it tracked northeastward gradually strengthening to attain peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h early on october 17 on october 18 storm turned more to north northeast as its forward
