sunda slow loris nycticebus coucang or greater slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate and a species of slow loris native to indonesia western malaysia southern thailand and singapore it measures from head to tail and weighs between like other slow lorises it has a wet nose rhinarium a round head small ears hidden in thick fur a flat face large eyes and a vestigial tail sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal typically occurring in evergreen forests it prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies and has an extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size its diet consists of sap floral nectar fruit and arthropods it will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees species is generally solitary one study showed only 8 of its active time was spent near other individuals social behavior makes up a very small part of activity budget though it has monogamous mating system with offspring living with parents it sleeps during day rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above ground often on branches twigs palm fronds or lianas species is usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days young disperses between 16 and 27 months generally when it is sexually mature species is listed as vulnerable on iucn red list it is threatened with extinction due to a growing demand in exotic pet trade and has become one of most abundant primate species on sale at indonesian pet markets its teeth are often pulled out before being sold as pets which can result in infection and or death this process makes reintroduction to wild impossible it also suffers from habitat loss which has been severe in areas in which it is found etymology common name sunda slow loris refers to sunda islands a group of islands in western part of malay archipelago where it is found another common name for species is greater slow loris specific name coucang derives from its common name in indonesia it is commonly known as malu malu meaning shy in indonesian and also as or it is sometimes called because local people do not distinguish between slow loris and cuscus a group of australasian possums in malaysia they are sometimes known as or kera duku kera is malay for monkey while duku is fruit bearing tree in thailand it is called ling lom which translates as wind monkey taxonomy and phylogeny sunda slow loris was first described in part in 1785 by dutch physician and naturalist pieter boddaert under name tardigradus coucang however its discovery dates to 1770 when dutchman arnout vosmaer 1720 1799 described a specimen of it as a type of sloth vosmaer gave it french name le du five fingered sloth of bengal but boddaert later argued that it was more closely aligned with lorises of ceylon now sri lanka and bengal between 1800 and 1907 several other slow loris species were described but in 1953 primatologist william charles osman hill in his influential book primates comparative anatomy and taxonomy consolidated all slow lorises into a single species n coucang in 1971 colin groves recognized pygmy slow loris n pygmaeus as a separate species and divided n coucang into four subspecies in 2001 groves opined that there were three species n coucang n pygmaeus and n bengalensis and that n coucang itself had three subspecies nycticebus coucang coucang n c menagensis and n c javanicus these three subspecies were promoted in 2010 to species status sunda slow loris javan slow loris n javanicus and bornean slow loris n menagensis species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology such as size fur color and head markings at end of 2012 bornean slow loris was itself divided into four distinct species when etienne geoffroy saint hilaire defined genus nycticebus in 1812 he made sunda slow loris type species this was questioned in 1921 by british zoologist oldfield thomas who noted that there was some confusion over which specimen was used as type specimen instead he suggested that type specimen was actually bengal slow loris lori bengalensis lacepede 1800 there was further confusion during 1800s when boddaert s tardigradus coucang was routinely mistaken for carl linnaeus lemur tardigradus a species he had described in 10th edition of systema naturae 1758 fact that lemur tardigradus was actually a slender loris remained obscured until 1902 when mammalogists witmer stone and james a g rehn finally cleared air species has 50 chromosomes 2n 50 and it genome size is 3 58 pg of its chromosomes 22 are metacentric 26 are submetacentric and none are acrocentric its x chromosome is submetacentric and its y chromosome is metacentric to help clarify species and subspecies boundaries and to establish whether morphology based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships phylogenetic relationships within genus nycticebus have been investigated using dna sequences derived from mitochondrial markers d loop and cytochrome b although most of recognized lineages of nycticebus including pygmy slow loris n pygmaeus bornean slow loris n menagensis and javan slow loris n javanicus were shown to be genetically distinct analysis suggested that dna sequences from selected individuals of sunda slow loris n coucang and bengal slow loris n bengalensis shared a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with other members of their own respective species authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization as tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern thailand precise origin of one of n coucang individuals was not known this hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared variations in mitochondrial dna sequences between n bengalensis and n coucang and suggested that there has indeed been gene flow between two species anatomy and physiology sunda slow loris has dark rings around its large eyes a white nose with a whitish strip that extends to forehead and a dark stripe that stretches from back of head along spine its soft thick woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown with a lighter underside species is distinct from bengal slow loris due to dark inverse teardrop markings around eyes which meet dark dorsal stripe on back of head it tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between eyes more distinct dark coloring around eyes and a browner coat than bengal slow loris which is larger grayer and shows less contrast sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than much smaller pygmy slow loris local color variations are known to occur thumb alt a sunda slow loris climbs upside down along a tree branch sunda slow loris generally holds branches with at least three limbs at one time it measures between and weighs unlike bengal slow loris sunda slow loris does not show sexual dimorphism by weight vestigial tail hidden beneath fur is reduced to a stump it has a toothcomb six forward facing teeth on bottom jaw which includes lower incisors and canine teeth structure is generally used for grooming in other primates but lorises also use it to scrape off gum when foraging it has a shortened second digit and hands have a strong grip like other lorises it excretes a strong smelling liquid from glands beneath its arms which is used in communication one major distinguishing feature between all loris species is locomotion sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees on all four limbs typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time its movement has been described as unique similar to crawling or as if it was climbing in every direction sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed in captivity about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally a quarter suspended or hanging a quarter climbing and a quarter clasping multiple branches bridging it may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time behavior and ecology like other slow lorises sunda slow loris is an arboreal and nocturnal primate resting by day in forks of trees or in thick vegetation and feeding on fruit and insects by night unlike other loris species it remains in trees most of its life while bengal slow loris will often sleep on ground sunda slow loris sleeps in a ball in branches or foliage it usually sleeps alone but has been observed to sleep with several conspecifics individuals of same species including other adults adults live in overlapping ranges of despite its slow metabolism rate sunda slow loris has a high energy diet its slow lifestyle may be due to energy costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets largest amount of time is spent eating phloem sap 34 9 floral nectar and nectar producing plant parts 31 7 and fruits 22 5 it also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects gum is taken by licking wounds on trees they are also known to feed on molluscs including giant land snail fulica and birds eggs all slow loris species produce a toxin in glands on insides of their elbows this is spread across their bodies and those of their offspring using toothcomb while grooming when threatened with predators sunda slow loris can bite roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva covered fur or roll up and drop from trees however primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis whereby it hides asiatic reticulated python changeable hawk eagle and sumatran orangutan have been recorded as predators of sunda slow loris social systems sunda slow loris may fit into monogamous single male single female social system though are mainly known to be solitary one study showed only 8 of species active time was spent near other individuals where home ranges overlap spatial groups are formed these groups consist of one male one female and up to three younger individuals interactions between these individuals are largely friendly they include allogrooming following pant growling and click calling although social behaviors only make up around 3 of activity budget when it comes into contact with conspecifics from other home ranges there is usually no reaction as home ranges are not defended in captivity however it can be aggressive with other individuals males have shown antagonistic behaviors such as attacks pursuits threats assertion fighting and subordination fighting often results in serious injury despite this they are known to be generally sociable in captivity with allogrooming being most common social behavior communication there are eight distinct call types made by sunda slow loris adults which can be divided into two categories contact and contact seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers a social play and attention seeking call and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers screams snarls and grunts because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators they do not make alarm calls infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed during estrus females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male when exploring new environments and during handling it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of human hearing range olfactory communication is very important in this species it has roles in alerting others of identity physical state and position of individual it is also important in reproduction like other slow lorises sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication but it is toxic to humans if person is allergic to animal they can go into shock and could even die it also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine when it locates scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on substrate where scent was found sunda slow loris may grin or bare its teeth when stressed infants may grin while adults bear their teeth to show aggression or fear but also during play reproduction thumb upright alt a sunda slow loris hangs from a branch with two legs females hang from branches during copulation reproduction is one of few times sunda slow loris aggregates with conspecifics as it is largely solitary one study recorded that most slow lorises ever seen together was six this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following her this may suggest a more promiscuous mating system where females mate with more than one male despite this its testis size is small compared with similar sized which is indicative of monogamy in wild mating system of sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations sexual maturity is reached between ages of 18 and 24 months in females and can be reached by 17 months in males it is polyestrous having many periods of sexual receptivity during a year in captivity however there is a clear birth peak between march and may it has been observed that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in northern hemisphere are altered estrus cycle lasts 29 45 days with most copulations occurring on same day females in estrus are followed by males with copulation initiated by female female will hang from a branch and may vocalise male will hold female and branch and copulate with her urine marking and vocalising are also used by female to solicit mating male may create a mating plug following copulation gestation period averages 192 2 days after which one young is born although twinning has been observed both males and females will disperse in wild this occurs between 16 and 27 months distribution and habitat sunda slow loris is found in continuous canopy tropical rainforests it is adaptable and will also live in other types of habitat it is found in indonesia on islands of sumatra batam and galang in riau archipelago and pulau and great natuna in natuna islands in malaysia on malay peninsula and pulau tioman in southern peninsular of thailand and singapore despite being presumed extinct in pulau tioman records indicate that slow lorises may still inhabit island facial markings and morphology of tioman slow loris are substantially different to mainland individuals which hints at potential distinctiveness of population sunda slow loris is sympatric shares its range with bengal slow loris in thailand and hybridisation has occurred conservation according to 2008 international union for conservation of nature iucn red list assessment sunda slow loris was evaluated as vulnerable in june 2007 it was transferred from cites appendix ii to appendix i indicating a true concern about state of international trade in this species an act now forbidden by international law it is also protected by indonesian law though law does not seem to be strictly enforced its population size is unknown and further studies need to be carried out to confirm their conservation status thumb left alt a young sunda slow loris having its teeth clipped removing or clipping slow loris teeth can lead to infection and death sunda slow loris is greatly threatened by pet trade and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast asia slow lorises are most commonly traded protected primates in southeast asia when sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to owner this may cause dental infections which have up to a 90 death rate once it has lost its teeth reintroduction to wild is impossible due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress improper nutrition and infection pet trade is inflated by replacements with a greater purchasing power increasing human populations in species range could have an even more serious impact sunda slow loris is further threatened by gathering for illegal traditional medicine fur is reported to heal wounds flesh to cure epilepsy eyes are used in love potions and meat is reported to cure asthma and stomach problems it is also killed as a crop pest severe habitat loss and degradation over large areas of its range have caused large population declines even though species is more adaptable to anthropogenic habitats than other primates in region resulting fragmentation has restricted species dispersal as it depends on continuous canopy cover to move from tree to tree footnotes references literature cited sunda slow loris category mammals of
