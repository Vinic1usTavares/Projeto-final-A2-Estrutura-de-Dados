popular with merchant class who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them earliest success was in 1670s with moronobu s paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women colour in prints came gradually at first added by hand for special commissions by 1740s artists such as masanobu used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour from 1760s success of harunobu s brocade prints led to full colour production becoming standard each print made with numerous blocks specialists have prized portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as kiyonaga utamaro and

of japanese art and serene atmospheric hiroshige most noted for his series fifty three stations of tokaido following deaths of these two masters and against technological and social modernization that followed meiji restoration of 1868 ukiyo e production went into steep decline some ukiyo e artists specialized in making paintings but most works were prints artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing rather production was divided between artist who designed prints carver who cut woodblocks printer who inked and pressed woodblocks onto hand made paper and publisher who financed promoted and distributed works as printing was done by hand printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines such as blending or gradation of colours on printing block ukiyo e was central to forming west s perception of japanese art in late 19th century especially landscapes of hokusai and hiroshige from 1870s japonism became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on early impressionists such as degas manet and monet as well as post impressionists such as van gogh and art nouveau artists such as toulouse lautrec 20th century saw a revival in japanese printmaking

followed two principal paths nativist tradition focusing on japanese themes best known by works of tosa school and chinese inspired in a variety of styles such as monochromatic ink wash painting of toyo and his disciples kano school of painting incorporated features of both since antiquity japanese art had found patrons in aristocracy military governments and religious authorities until 16th century lives of common people had not been a main subject of painting and even when they were included works were luxury items made for ruling samurai and rich merchant classes later works appeared by and for townspeople including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of theatre and pleasure districts hand produced nature of these limited scale of their production a

illustrators to do so he was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties most significantly he began to produce illustrations not just for books but as single sheet images which could stand alone or be used as part of a series hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers as well as imitators such as sugimura and signalled beginning of popularization of a new artform torii kiyonobu i and kaigetsudo ando became prominent emulators of moronobu s style following master s death though neither was a member of hishikawa school both discarded background detail in favour of focus on human figure kabuki actors in yakusha e of kiyonobu and torii school that followed him and courtesans in bijin ga of ando and his kaigetsudo school ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production and its popularity created a demand for

geometrical perspective in uki e genre in 1740s long narrow e prints and combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self penned haiku poetry ukiyo e reached a peak in late 18th century with advent of full colour prints developed after edo returned to prosperity under okitsugu following a long depression these popular colour prints came to be called nishiki e or brocade pictures as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported chinese known in japanese as nishiki first to emerge were expensive calendar prints printed with multiple blocks on very fine paper with heavy opaque inks these prints had number of days for each month hidden in design and were sent at new year as personalized greetings bearing name of patron rather than artist blocks for these prints were later re used for commercial production obliterating patron s name and replacing it with that of artist delicate romantic prints of suzuki harunobu 1725 1770 were amongst first to realize expressive and complex colour designs printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle different colours and half tones his restrained graceful prints invoked classicism of waka poetry and yamato e painting prolific harunobu was dominant ukiyo e artist of his time success of harunobu s colourful nishiki e from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for limited palettes of benizuri e and urushi e as well as hand coloured prints a trend against idealism of prints of harunobu and torii school grew following harunobu s death in 1770 1726 1793 and his school produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to actors actual features than had been trend sometime collaborators koryusai 1735 and kitao shigemasa 1739 1820 were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo e away from dominance of harunobu s idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real world courtesans and geisha koryusai was perhaps most prolific ukiyo e artist of 18th century and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor kitao school that shigemasa founded was one of dominant schools of closing decades of 18th century in 1770s utagawa toyoharu produced a number of uki e perspective prints that demonstrated a mastery of western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in genre toyoharu s works helped pioneer landscape as an ukiyo e subject rather than merely a background for human figures in 19th century western style perspective techniques were absorbed into japanese artistic culture and deployed in refined landscapes of such artists as hokusai and hiroshige latter a member of utagawa school that toyoharu founded this school was to become one of most influential and produced works in a far

during kansei era 1789 1791 ukiyo e of period of kansei reforms brought about a focus on beauty and harmony that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in next century as reforms broke down and tensions rose culminating in meiji restoration of 1868 especially in 1780s torii kiyonaga 1752 1815 of torii school depicted traditional ukiyo e subjects like beauties and urban scenes which he printed on large sheets of paper often as horizontal diptychs or triptychs his works dispensed with poetic dreamscapes made by harunobu opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in latest fashions and posed in scenic locations he also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus a law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor s seal of approval to be sold censorship increased in strictness over following decades and violators could receive harsh punishments from 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval a group of utagawa school offenders including toyokuni had their works repressed in 1801 and utamaro was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th century political and military leader toyotomi hideyoshi utamaro 1806 made his name in 1790s with his bijin e large headed pictures of beautiful women portraits focusing on head and upper torso a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors utamaro experimented with line colour and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in features expressions and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background utamaro s individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to stereotyped idealized images that had been norm by end of decade especially following death of his patron tsutaya juzaburo in 1797 utamaro s prodigious output declined in quality and he died in 1806 appearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later prints of enigmatic sharaku are amongst ukiyo e s best known sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized differences between actor and portrayed character expressive contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with serene mask like faces more common to artists such as harunobu or utamaro published by tsutaya sharaku s work found resistance and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared and his real identity is still unknown utagawa toyokuni 1769 1825 produced kabuki portraits in a style edo townsfolk found more accessible emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding sharaku s realism a consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo e of late 18th century but works of utamaro and sharaku often overshadow those other masters of era one of kiyonaga s followers 1756 1829 abandoned his position as painter for shogun tokugawa to take up ukiyo e design he brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful slender courtesans and left behind a number of noted students with a fine line fl 1786 1808 designed portraits of delicate courtesans utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo e output in late edo period edo was primary centre of ukiyo e production throughout edo period another major centre developed in kamigata region of areas in and around kyoto and osaka in contrast to range of subjects in edo prints those of kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors style of kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of edo until late 18th century partly because artists often moved back and forth between two areas colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in kamigata prints than in those of edo in 19th century many of prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs late flowering flora fauna and landscapes 19th century thumb alt a colour illustration of a violent wave hokusai s great wave off kanagawa 1831 tenpo reforms of 1841 1843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury including depiction of courtesans and actors as a result many ukiyo e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature especially birds and flowers landscapes had been given limited attention since moronobu and they formed an important element in works of kiyonaga and it was not until late in edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre especially via works of hokusai and hiroshige landscape genre has come to dominate western perceptions of ukiyo e though ukiyo e had a long history preceding these late era masters japanese landscape differed from western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination composition and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature self proclaimed mad painter hokusai 1760 1849 enjoyed a long varied career his work is marked by a lack of sentimentality common to ukiyo e and a focus on formalism influenced by western art among his accomplishments are his illustrations of takizawa bakin s novel his series of sketchbooks hokusai manga and his popularization of landscape genre with thirty six views of mount fuji which includes his best known print great wave off kanagawa one of most famous works of japanese art in contrast to work of older masters hokusai s colours were bold flat and abstract and his subject was not pleasure districts but lives and environment of common people at work established masters eisen kuniyoshi and kunisada also followed hokusai s steps into landscape prints in 1830s producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects though not often given attention of their better known forebears utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period prolific kunisada 1786 1865 had few rivals in tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors one of those rivals was eisen 1790 1848 who was also adept at landscapes perhaps last significant member of this late period kuniyoshi 1797 1861 tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles much as hokusai had his historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular especially his series of heroes from suikoden 1827 1830 and 1847 he was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes latter an area rarely explored in dictatorial atmosphere of edo period that could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of weakening of shogunate at time hiroshige 1797 1858 is considered hokusai s greatest rival in stature he specialized in pictures of birds and flowers and serene landscapes and is best known for his travel series such as fifty three stations of tokaido and sixty nine stations of kiso latter a cooperative effort with eisen his work was more realistic subtly coloured and atmospheric than hokusai s nature and seasons were key elements mist rain snow and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions hiroshige s followers including adopted son hiroshige ii and son in law hiroshige iii carried on their master s style of landscapes into meiji era decline late 19th century following deaths of hokusai and hiroshige and meiji restoration of 1868 ukiyo e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality rapid westernization of meiji period that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism and face competition from photography practitioners of pure ukiyo e became more rare and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolescent era artists continued to produce occasional notable works but by 1890s tradition was moribund synthetic pigments imported from germany began to replace traditional organic ones in mid 19th century many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red and were called aka e red pictures artists such as yoshitoshi 1839 1892 led a trend in 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts monsters and supernatural beings and legendary japanese and chinese heroes his one hundred aspects of moon 1885 1892 depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif kiyochika 1847 1915 is known for his prints documenting rapid modernization of tokyo such as introduction of railways and his depictions of japan s wars with china and with russia earlier a painter of kano school in 1870s

reception was mixed and even when praised ukiyo e was generally thought inferior to western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy japanese art drew notice at international exhibition of 1867 in paris and became fashionable in france and england in 1870s and 1880s prints of hokusai and hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping western perceptions of japanese art at time of their introduction to west woodblock printing was most common mass medium in japan and japanese considered it of little lasting value early europeans promoters and scholars of

collectors some such as degas traded their own paintings for such prints tadamasa hayashi was a prominent paris based dealer of respected tastes whose tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo e prints to west in such quantities that japanese critics later accused him of siphoning japan of its national treasure drain first went unnoticed in japan as japanese artists were immersing themselves in classical painting techniques of west japanese art and particularly ukiyo e prints came to influence western art from time of early impressionists early painter collectors incorporated japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as 1860s patterned wallpapers and rugs in manet s paintings were inspired by ukiyo e s patterned

individuality in its artists and as such has no dominant themes or styles works ranged from entirely abstract ones of koshiro 1891 1955 to traditional figurative depictions of japanese scenes of un

face colours are bold and flat and contours are outlined in black woman visiting shrine in night harunobu 17th century bold flat lines define and contain areas of flat colour early ukiyo e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in composition principles of classical chinese painting gradually these artists shed overt chinese influence to develop a native japanese idiom early ukiyo e artists have been called primitives in sense that print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries old techniques their image designs are not considered primitive many ukiyo e artists received training from teachers of kano and other painterly schools a defining feature of most ukiyo e prints is a well defined bold flat line earliest prints were monochromatic and these lines were only printed element even with advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate in ukiyo e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces with figures typically in a single plane of depth attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships as well as details such as lines shapes and patterns such as those on clothing compositions were often asymmetrical and viewpoint was often from unusual angles such as from above elements of images were often cropped giving composition a spontaneous feel in colour prints contours of most colour areas are sharply defined usually by linework aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with modulated colours expected in western traditions and with other prominent contemporary traditions in japanese

humility and restraint ukiyo e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as racy urbane stylishness of iki ukiyo e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to european paintings of same period western style geometrical perspective was known in japan practised most prominently by akita ranga painters of 1770s as were chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a of parallel lines techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo e works geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in background and more expressive chinese perspective in fore techniques were most likely learned at first through chinese western style paintings rather than directly from western works long after becoming familiar with these techniques artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs other ways of indicating depth included chinese tripartite composition method used in buddhist pictures where a large form is placed in foreground a smaller in midground and yet a smaller in background this can be seen in hokusai s great wave with a large boat in foreground a smaller behind it and a small mt fuji behind them there was a tendency since early ukiyo e to pose beauties in what art historian called a serpentine posture which involves subjects bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves art historian posited that this had its roots in traditional buyo dance countered that poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo e artists causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes this remained case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of composition themes and genres typical subjects were female beauties bijin ga kabuki actors yakusha e and landscapes women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure and promoted entertainments to be found in pleasure districts detail with which artists depicted courtesans fashions and hairstyles allows prints to be dated with some reliability less attention was given to accuracy of women s physical features which followed day s pictorial fashions faces stereotyped bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another portraits of celebrities were much in demand in particular

he had illustrated e hon books of illustrations were popular and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo e artists in late period hokusai produced three volume one hundred views of mount fuji and fifteen volume hokusai manga latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects traditional japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in judaeo christian sense and until changing morals of meiji era led to its suppression shunga erotic prints were a major genre while tokugawa regime subjected japan to strict censorship laws pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with censors approval many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship and often humour in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes voyeurs and oversized anatomy as with depictions of courtesans these images were closely tied to entertainments of pleasure quarters nearly every ukiyo e master produced shunga at some point records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent though timon screech posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over matter and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors especially in west scenes from nature have been an important part of asian art throughout history artists have closely studied correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times ukiyo e nature prints are called kacho e which translates as flower and bird pictures though genre was open to more than just flowers or birds and flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together hokusai s detailed precise nature prints are credited with establishing kacho e as a genre tenpo reforms of 1840s suppressed depiction of actors and courtesans aside from landscapes and kacho e artists turned to depictions of historical scenes such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend literature and religion 11th century tale of genji and 13th century tale of heike have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout japanese history including in ukiyo e well known warriors and swordsmen such as miyamoto musashi 1584 1645 were frequent subjects as were depictions of monsters supernatural and heroes of japanese and chinese mythology from 17th to 19th centuries japan isolated itself from rest of world trade primarily with dutch and chinese was restricted to island of dejima near nagasaki outlandish pictures called nagasaki e were sold to tourists of foreigners and their wares in mid 19th century yokohama became primary foreign settlement after 1859 from which western knowledge proliferated in japan especially from 1858 to 1862 yokohama e prints documented with various levels of fact and fancy growing community of world denizens with whom japanese were now coming in contact triptychs of scenes of westerners and their technology were particularly popular specialized prints included deluxe limited edition prints aimed at connoisseurs of which a five line poem was usually part of design and uchiwa e printed hand fans which often suffer from having been handled production paintings ukiyo e artists often made both prints and paintings some specialized in one or other in contrast with previous traditions ukiyo e painters favoured bright sharp colours and often delineated contours with sumi ink an effect similar to linework in prints unrestricted by technical limitations of printing a wider range of techniques pigments and surfaces were available to painter artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances such as safflower ground shells lead and cinnabar and later synthetic dyes imported from west such as paris green and

yoshiiku 1862 ukiyo e prints were works of teams of artisans in several workshops it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks labour was divided into four groups publisher who commissioned promoted and distributed prints artists who provided design image who prepared woodblocks for printing and printers who made impressions of woodblocks on paper normally only names of artist and publisher were credited on finished print ukiyo e prints were impressed on hand made paper manually rather than by mechanical press as in west artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper which was pasted to a block of cherry wood and rubbed with oil until upper layers of paper could be pulled away leaving a translucent layer of paper that block cutter could use as a guide block cutter cut away non black areas of image leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression original drawing was destroyed in process prints were made with blocks face up so printer could vary pressure for different effects and watch as paper absorbed water based sumi ink applied quickly in even horizontal strokes amongst printer s tricks were embossing of image achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on paper to achieve effects such as textures of clothing patterns or fishing net other effects included burnishing by rubbing with agate to brighten colours overprinting dusting with metal or mica and sprays to imitate falling snow ukiyo e print was a commercial art form and publisher played an important role publishing was highly competitive over a thousand publishers are known from throughout period number peaked at around 250 in 1840s and 1850s 200 in edo alone and slowly shrank following opening of japan until about 40 remained at opening of 20th century publishers owned woodblocks and copyrights and from late 18th century enforced copyrights through picture book and print publishers guild prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable as publisher could reuse woodblocks without further payment to artist or woodblock cutter woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or publishers were usually also vendors and commonly sold each other s wares in their shops in addition to artist s seal publishers marked prints with their own seals some a simple logo others quite elaborate incorporating an address or other information thumb left alt a

being granted right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names young designers could be expected to cover part or all of costs of cutting woodblocks as artists gained fame publishers usually covered these costs and artists could demand higher fees in pre modern japan people could go by numerous names throughout their lives their childhood personal name different from their name as an adult an artist s name consisted of a artist surname followed by an personal art name was most frequently taken from school artist belonged to such as utagawa or torii and normally took a chinese character from master s art name for example many students of toyokuni li guo took kuni guo from his name including kunisada guo zhen and kuniyoshi guo fang names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers hokusai was an extreme case using over a hundred names throughout his seventy year career prints were mass marketed and by mid 19th century total circulation of a print could run into thousands retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople in some cases prints advertised kimono designs by print artist from second half of 17th century prints were frequently marketed as part of a series each print stamped with series name and print s number in that series this proved a successful marketing technique as collectors bought each new print in series to keep their collections complete by 19th century series such as hiroshige s fifty three stations of tokaido ran to dozens of prints colour print production while colour printing in japan dates to 1640s early ukiyo e prints used only black ink colour was sometimes added by hand using a red lead ink in tan e prints or later in a pink safflower ink in beni e prints colour printing arrived in books in 1720s and in single sheet prints in 1740s with a different block and printing for each colour early colours were limited to pink and green techniques expanded over following two decades to allow up to five colours mid 1760s brought full colour nishiki e prints made from ten or more

blue was a prominent synthetic dye in 19th century printers first used natural colour dyes made from mineral or vegetable sources dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from primary red blue and yellow pigments in 18th century prussian blue became popular and was particularly prominent in landscapes of hokusai and hiroshige as was where printer produced gradations of colour or blending of one colour into another cheaper and more consistent synthetic aniline dyes arrived from west in 1864 colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments meiji government promoted their use as part of broader policies of westernization criticism and historiography contemporary records of ukiyo e artists are rare most significant is ukiyo e ruiko various thoughts on ukiyo e a collection of commentaries and artist biographies ota nanpo compiled first no longer extant version around 1790 work did not see print during edo era but circulated in hand copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations over 120 variants of ukiyo e ruiko are known before world war ii predominant view of ukiyo e stressed centrality of prints this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo e s founding to moronobu following war thinking turned to importance of ukiyo e painting and making direct connections with 17th century yamato e paintings this viewpoint sees matabei as genre s originator and is especially favoured in japan this view had become widespread among japanese researchers by 1930s but militaristic government of time suppressed it wanting to emphasize a division between yamato e scroll paintings associated with court and prints associated with sometimes anti authoritarian merchant class thumb upright alt a black and white profile photograph of head and shoulders of a middle aged bearded man facing left american scholar of japanese art ernest fenollosa was first to complete a comprehensive critical history of ukiyo e earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo e came from west ernest fenollosa was professor of philosophy at imperial university in tokyo from 1878 and was commissioner of fine arts to japanese government from 1886 his masters of of 1896 was first comprehensive overview and set stage for most later works with an approach to history in terms of epochs beginning with matabei in a primitive age it evolved towards a late 18th century golden age that began to decline with advent of utamaro and had a brief revival with hokusai and hiroshige s landscapes in 1830s laurence binyon keeper of oriental prints and drawings at british museum wrote an account in painting in far east in 1908 that was similar to fenollosa s but placed utamaro and sharaku amongst masters arthur davison ficke built on works of fenollosa and binyon with a more comprehensive chats on japanese prints in 1915 james a michener s floating world in 1954 broadly followed chronologies of earlier works while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions for michener and his sometime collaborator richard lane ukiyo e began with moronobu rather than matabei lane s masters of japanese print of 1962 maintained approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo e firmly within genealogy of japanese art book acknowledges artists such as yoshitoshi and kiyochika as late masters s traditional woodblock prints of japan of 1964 placed ukiyo e artists in three periods first was a primitive period that included harunobu followed by a golden age of kiyonaga utamaro and sharaku and then a closing period of decline following declaration beginning in 1790s of strict sumptuary laws that dictated what could be depicted in artworks book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had and viewed ukiyo e painting as a revival of yamato e painting further refined takahashi s analysis by identifying decline as coinciding with desperate attempts of shogunate to hold on to power through passing of draconian laws as its hold on country continued to break down culminating in meiji restoration in 1868 ukiyo e scholarship has tended to focus on cataloguing of artists an approach that lacks rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas such catalogues are numerous but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses little original research has been added to early foundational evaluations of ukiyo e and its artists especially with regard to relatively minor artists while commercial nature of ukiyo e has always been acknowledged evaluation of artists and their works has rested on aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success standards for inclusion in ukiyo e canon rapidly evolved in early literature utamaro was particularly contentious seen by fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo e s decline utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of form s greatest masters artists of 19th century such as yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized attracting scholarly attention only towards end of 20th century works on late era utagawa artists such as kunisada and kuniyoshi have revived some of contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed many late works examine social or other conditions behind art and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline novelist jun ichiro tanizaki was critical of superior attitude of westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo e he maintained that ukiyo e was merely easiest form of japanese art to understand from perspective of westerners values and that japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo e but that confucian morals of time kept them from freely discussing it social mores that were violated by west s flaunting of discovery thumb left alt black and white comic strip in japanese manga histories often find an ancestor in hokusai manga rakuten kitazawa to no tokyo

public from to wealthy merchants little concrete is known about production and consumption habits detailed records in edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans actors and sumo wrestlers but no such records pertaining to ukiyo e remain or perhaps ever existed determining what is understood about demographics of ukiyo e consumption has required indirect means determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in production quality size supply and demand and methods which went through changes such as introduction of full colour printing how expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout period in 19th century records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 to 100 for deluxe editions jun ichi okubo suggests that prices in 20s and 30s of were likely common for standard prints as a loose comparison a bowl of soba
