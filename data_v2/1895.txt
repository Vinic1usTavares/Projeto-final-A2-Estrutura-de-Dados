on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in summer clark further elaborated on decision to incorporate summer and harry potter themes into episode stating we went alright those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that we can t be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows but it just means we have a little more of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of genre in a much broader spectrum screenwriter powell explained that it is difficult for series to do topical stuff as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode but they were aware of fact that harry potter and deathly hallows part 2 would premiere shortly after episode was set to air so it would seem like we were hyper topical even though we had a good nine months advance notice he said powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources including lord of rings and wonderful wizard of oz in an interview with charles webb of mtv clark elaborated we make it a hodgepodge of wizard references and obviously main one is and most prominent one and one that s most relevant to pop culture is harry potter spoof that we ve thrown in there blockquote episode explores leonard s background and that he is essentially a deadbeat dad in an interview with matt barone of magazine complex powell revealed that he was inspired to write episode after reading a critic s review which referred to leonard as basically having omnipotence as he is able to conjure any magic he wants but is too lazy to take advantage of his powers review spurred an idea for an episode where leonard would be responsible for dealing with a kid powell called episode s mythology very bizarre and surreal but said that they tried to keep core themes relatable such as leonard s relationship with his estranged son same day as episode s original broadcast a deleted scene from wet hot demonic summer was made available on official ugly americans website in half minute

wet demonic summer also marked a drop in ratings compared to first season finale which received a 0 7 rating wet hot demonic summer received generally positive reviews from critics david hinckley of new york daily news rated it four out of five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers it is equally possible they will keep watching anyway because jokes work so well all by themselves hinckley went on to remark that ugly americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes happily its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of references are whizzing by unappreciated redeye critic curt wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes visual pizzazz cultural references and so fast you ll miss them jokes that it might require multiple viewings wagner however meant that this was a rather positive feature writing for example you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line lastly wagner observed that ugly americans can be gross and bizarre but everything makes sense in world that it has created josh harrison of ology deemed episode a good sign that second season will be just as good if not better than first season he said way it all works together in this episode is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there s method to madness ugly americans knows when to play this card at all other junctures it s got right instinct when it shows us yet more madness harrison praised battle scene between wizards and demons calling it one of best single sequences in series so far in contrast standard times critic kevin mcdonough was more critical regarding episode noting that it tries a tad too hard mcdonough commented efforts to meld 1980s summer camp fantasy comedies with harry potter movies are more odd than amusing then again that pretty much sums up ugly americans itself references external links category 2011 american television episodes category ugly
