production thelma is a film adaptation of 1887 novel of same name it was written under pen name marie corelli by mary mackay during era her novels were so well known that some reviewers did not need to include a summary of plot of film to reader a brief review in moving picture world went so far as to say practically everybody has read novel hence no long explanation is required film historian q david bowers states although present day scholars consider her works to be of no serious literary importance she is remembered by science fiction world for her vivacious imagination and her scientific discoveries including interstellar travel via personal electricity her writings were known in her time for sublimated sex fervent religiosity and far fetched fantasy writer of scenario is unknown but it was most likely lloyd lonergan lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by new york evening world while writing scripts for thanhouser productions he was most important script writer for thanhouser averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915 film director is unknown but it may have been barry o neil complete index to literary sources in film assigns theodore marston as director this film but this would seem to be in error apparent origin of this error is from american film index 1908 1915 bowers consulted one of co authors of book gunnar lundquist and confirmed that credit of marston was in error theodore marston worked with pathe kinemacolor vitagraph and other companies but there is no record of marston working with thanhouser bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production but two possible candidates exist blair smith was first cameraman of thanhouser company but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer role of cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions cast in role of thelma was anna rosemond one of two leading ladies of thanhouser company at time more minor role of sir philip errington was played by frank h crane who acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at thanhouser conspiring lady clara ashley was played by yvonne marvin an actress that bowers cites as her first and only known credit with thanhouser role of thelma s father was played by alphonse ethier a stage actor who had intermittent credited appearances in thanhouser productions release and reception single reel drama approximately 1000 feet long was released on june 21 1910 a review in moving picture world praised film by stating picture is admirably staged and acted and maintains interest from beginning to end of course picture does not contain detail of novel but it is a distinct improvement upon play it deserves a long run identifying theaters in which film was shown is made difficult by number of thelma plays and later selig polyscope s own version of thelma which appeared in 1911 popularity of play predates film adaptation by thanhouser one of troupes to perform play in 1910 were preston majestic players once selig film was released two productions were often not distinguished in advertisements one of last known advertisements conclusively for thanhouser production was in 1913 an incomplete 35 mm print of film survives in library of congress archives this print is missing main title credits and likely conclusion of film only funeral scene shows red film tinting
