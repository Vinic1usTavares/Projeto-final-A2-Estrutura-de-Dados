mass for dead poem opens with an apostrophe to a soul in a plea soul forget them not soul forget not dead these words appear to echo various psalms such as psalm 103 bless lord o my soul hebbel however evokes an eternal rest that is distinctly non religious poem offers no metaphysical reference christian or otherwise but calls for remembrance as only way to keep dead alive first lines in which speaker calls upon soul not to forget dead are repeated in centre of poem and again at its conclusion as a refrain that sets apart two longer sections of verse first of these sections describes how dead nurtured by love enjoy a final glow of life in contrast latter section portrays a different fate for souls that have been forsaken who are relegated to an unending desolate struggle for renewed existence musicologist katherine fitzgibbon notes that speaker of this narrative is not identified but may be a poetic narrator divine voice or even dead poem was published in 1857 separately

ihr leben their dimming life are illustrated by a sequence of chromatically descending sixth chords similar descending chords are often found in reger s works as a musical expression of pain fear death and suffering common associations with chromaticism since sixteenth century according to fitzgibbon both recurring refrain and descending chords reappear in later setting of poem in hebbel

a non liturgical requiem written in a language other than latin while still addressing traditional theme of rest for dead in this tradition reger s 1915 requiem is also not a setting of requiem in latin but of hebbel s poem he composed it in jena a year before his own death this time for a solo voice alto or baritone chorus and orchestra requiem was combined with hermit a setting of a poem by

around you ssaattbb c and if growing cold satb storm of night then seizes them satb piu mosso molto sostenuto allegro a soul forget them not solo satb chorale melody molto sostenuto sections a short instrumental introduction is based on a pedal point sustained for several measures reminiscent of pedal points in funeral music by schutz and bach in mozart s requiem in same key of d minor and in reger s previous latin requiem in a pattern similar to beginning of a german requiem bass notes are repeated here on a low d d1 soloist alone sings intimate appellation soul forget them not on a simple melody and repeating first line after second throughout piece soloist sings only these words in beginning and in repeats chorus here divided in eight parts evokes start of spiritual ascent see they hover around you shuddering abandoned in mostly homophonic chords marked ppp in a fashion reminiscent of schutz b in section b and in holy glowing pedal point ends chorus is divided in four to six parts in more independent motion as in works by schutz two or three voices often introduce new text a soloist sings recapitulation of beginning similar to first time again on pedal point but repeats second line one more time while chorus sings about hovering as before c in section c and if you coldly close yourself to them they stiffen reger uses word painting by means of downward lines and a final decrescendo for line sie bis in das they stiffen up to deepest on word chorus settles on a dissonant 5 part chord held for two measures suddenly fortissimo with a crescendo at end then repeated pianissimo an octave lower motionless in great contrast in storm of night then grips them a storm is depicted in dense motion of four parts imitating a theme in triplets a in conclusion soloist repeats earlier phrase but this time chorus finally joins in words of appellation soloist introduces a new wording forget them not dead chorus repeats this phrase marked on melody of chorale five stanzas of which bach used in his st matthew passion melody is not repeated as in original but continued for half a line reger is known for quoting chorales in general and this one in particular most often referring to its last stanza which bach included in passion right after death of jesus corresponding text would then be when i must depart one day do not part from me then when greatest anxiety reger completes chorale setting for chorus without further reference to chorale melody while solo voice repeats at same time concluding with descending tones of more than an octave scoring and performances requiem employs an orchestra of two flutes piccolo two oboes cor anglais two clarinets two bassoons four horns three trumpets three trombones tuba three percussionists and strings it requires a chorus to match reger himself wrote a version for piano to make music more accessible composer and organist max beckschafer arranged work for voice chorus and organ in 1985 organ version

thomaskirche on 10 june and hebbel requiem there on 17 june along with der mensch und and o tod wie bitter bist du evaluation in a review of a recording of choral works by reger gavin dixon said that requiem is almost mystical in its use of widely spaced chords unusual harmonic shifts and dreamy arpeggios in accompaniment program notes for recording say that in anguished expressionistic evocation
