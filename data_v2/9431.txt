2001 to may 13 2005 on upn spanning 98 episodes across four seasons sixth series in star trek franchise it served as a prequel to star trek original series show is set in 22nd century a hundred years before events of original series and just prior to formation of united federation of planets series follows adventures of enterprise earth s first starship capable of traveling at warp five as it explores galaxy and encounters various alien species following culmination of star trek deep space nine and with star trek voyager scheduled to end upn asked braga and berman to devise a new series to continue franchise rather than setting it in 24th century alongside deep space nine and voyager duo decided to set enterprise in an earlier period allowing them to explore new parts of star trek fictional universe wanting a more basic relatable and character driven series berman and braga concentrated episodes around a core trio of characters captain jonathan archer scott bakula commander charles trip tucker iii connor trinneer and sub commander t pol jolene blalock show broke with star trek convention in several respects in addition to dropping star trek prefix enterprise used pop influenced song where my heart will take me performed by russell watson as its theme it was filmed on paramount lot in los angeles california on same stages that housed star trek series and films since abandoned star trek phase ii in late 1970s first two seasons were characterized by stand alone episodes that explored topics like humanity s early relations with vulcans and their first encounters with klingons and andorians alien species already familiar to star trek franchise wanting to attract greater viewers upn called for changes for its third season series was renamed pursuing more action driven plots and a single serialized storyline crew s mission to prevent earth being destroyed by a newly introduced alien species called xindi upn cancelled series after its fourth season a fan led campaign for a fifth proved unsuccessful cancellation of star trek enterprise in 2005 marked first point in eighteen years that no new star trek episodes were produced a situation that remained until launch of star trek discovery in 2017 series overview general star trek enterprise follows adventures of crew of starship enterprise designation nx 01 they are first deep space explorers in starfleet using first warp 5 equipped vessel at start of series it is revealed that vulcans have withheld advanced technology from humanity since their first contact concerned that humans were not ready for it this has delayed human space exploration and caused resentment in captain jonathan archer whose father developed warp 5 engine but did not live to see it used enterprise was intentionally equipped with less advanced versions of technologies seen in previous series for example it has no tractor beam uses missiles instead of photon torpedoes and has only limited means of synthesizing foods and other consumable items communications officer linguist hoshi sato s expertise in linguistics helps compensate for lack of advanced universal translators series also showed crew making first contacts with a number of races previously seen in franchise notably klingons who appear in pilot broken bow have ridged makeup seen in movie franchise and from star trek next generation onwards excluding star trek discovery rather than smooth headed versions seen in star trek original series this particular change was attributed by berman and braga to advancements in makeup they felt that contradictions in continuity such as klingon ridges were unavoidable as well as those involving technology however continuity was restored by attributing change to a plague caused by genetic experimentation advances in real world now made mobile telephones smaller than communicators seen in original series and even desktop computers and monitors are more compact than those seen in voyager series s first season emphasized a core trio of characters jonathan archer t pol and charles trip tucker iii other main characters had primary roles in particular episodes such as dear doctor and fight or flight second season saw deepening relationships between characters for example friendship between tucker and reed seen in episodes such as two days and two nights and relationship between tucker and t pol which begins contentiously but leads to romance in later seasons temporal cold war addition of a futuristic temporal cold war element was seen as a nod to mystery by rick berman who sought to add an element of x files to series berman decided that full story of war would be revealed over course of several years at start of second season braga said that temporal cold war storyline would continue to be included if viewers were still interested but later described it as initially featured in pilot episode broken bow it featured suliban being manipulated by an unknown humanoid figure from future nicknamed future guy by viewers a moniker later adopted by series s writers at start of series braga said that they did not have a plan for who character would turn out to be carey ruditis 2001 p 258 ten years after end of series braga stated on twitter that future guy was archer manipulating his own timeline he and berman had previously stated however that character was intended to be a romulan crewman daniels matt winston introduced in episode cold front was revealed as an operative from 900 years in future who was fighting against forces which included suliban archer found that he was being manipulated by those forces as enterprise was blamed for destruction of a mining colony in shockwave in third season an escalation of temporal cold war introduced xindi and dealt with repercussions of their attack on earth daniels explained archer s importance in history during a trip to future in prime to witness final battle against sphere builders aliens who were also manipulating xindi into attacking earth during archer s time period in closing phase of temporal cold war daniels sent enterprise back to 1940s following a temporal incursion by aliens who had altered outcome of second world war to permit nazi germany to invade united states once leader of aliens is killed timeline corrects itself xindi braga and berman created season long xindi story arc which began with second season finale expanse and ran throughout third season until it was resolved in episode zero hour it opens with an attack on earth by a mysterious space probe which killed seven million people in a destructive swath stretching through florida to venezuela as a result enterprise is re directed to unexplored delphic expanse to find xindi and stop a further attack which will destroy earth garcia phillips 2009 p 275 although certain elements such as success of mission against xindi were preplanned others such as details of actual enemy race were not at time of initial development berman and braga were uncertain if storyline would last for a whole season or for just half a season xindi themselves were developed from on set discussions with writers and actors who portrayed them in this manner six species which make up xindi were created with one of them called humanoid xindi but after further discussions these were renamed to primate xindi first part of third season saw crew searching delphic expanse attempting to find clues that would lead them to xindi in order to complete this mission they took on additional crew members in form of military assault command operations abbreviated as soldiers due to increased military nature of task founding of federation birth of federation was first hinted at during part two of shockwave which opened second season when manny coto was made showrunner for fourth season he decided that focus of series should be to link to that event with this in mind his intention was for this season to move towards that goal judith and garfield reeves stevens were hired as writers on enterprise because they wrote non canon novel federation and after it was suggested by producer mike sussman episodes for fourth season were intended to lay framework for later creation of federation this was something that cast said that they would have liked to see more of with scott bakula later saying i would have loved to have been able to explore that journey to federation and their creation of it to a greater extent and i think that would have been um just more fun for audience just better longer storytelling in united founding races of federation humans vulcans andorians and worked together for first time to defeat a romulan plot in demons xenophobic terra prime movement is introduced which coto felt was final element of human nature that must be defeated before federation could be formed foundation of federation was shown on screen in final episode of series these are voyages which was set several years after rest of season cast and characters jonathan archer played by scott bakula is captain of earth s first warp 5 starship enterprise his father henry designed its engine giving archer a personal connection to his ship he was envisaged as being a cross between chuck yeager and han solo by executive producer rick berman while brannon braga said that he was more laidback and relatable character was initially openly prejudiced against vulcans but this softens over time t pol played by jolene blalock is science officer of enterprise originally attached to enterprise by vulcan high command to keep humans out of trouble she becomes loyal to archer leaving her position in high command to accompany him to find xindi and later joins starfleet in later seasons she forms a romantic relationship

her realize her value to ship travis mayweather played by anthony montgomery is helmsman of enterprise a space boomer travis is unique on enterprise having been born in space son of a freighter

caucasian man wearing glasses brannon braga was one of co creators and executive producers of enterprise prior to end of star trek voyager and following end of star trek deep space nine on june 1999 upn approached rick berman and brannon braga about production of a fifth star trek series either to overlap with final season of voyager or to immediately follow carey ruditis 2001 p 246 berman had previously created star trek deep space nine alongside michael piller voyager with piller and jeri taylor and had been wanting to work with braga on a series concept while fans online were suggesting that it could either be based on starfleet academy or adventures of hikaru sulu producers took care that no information was leaked to reveal what concept was going to be they later revealed that academy idea was never properly considered instead they opted to create a prequel to original series which is set after events in film star trek first contact as braga and berman felt it was a period in star trek universe which was unexplored carey ruditis 2001 p 247 idea was for series to portray first deep space explorers in star trek universe with braga explaining that everything will be new to crew and that since setting was closer in timeframe to modern day that their reactions to situations would be more contemporary as part of this they sought feedback from members of submarine service of united states navy which was reflected in certain design work on series such as starfleet uniforms network executives needed to be convinced of viability of a prequel series as they had presumed that series would take franchise further into future carey ruditis 2001 p 249 initial idea was for first season to be almost entirely set on earth as enterprise is rushed to completion to respond to first contact with klingons and crew being put together this idea was rejected by studio executives and these story elements were instead restricted to pilot broken bow they sought to make enterprise more character driven than previous series in star trek franchise and hoped that this would gain viewers who had watched next generation but had lost interest with deep space nine and voyager it was intended to link series directly into original series by having t pau as a main character who had previously appeared in episode amok time instead this character was developed into an original vulcan character t pol berman explained his vision for series at launch saying that we ll be seeing humanity when they truly are going where no man has gone before we are seeing people who don t take meeting aliens as just another part of job it s not routine nothing is routine also by bringing it back 200 years from voyager we re making characters closer to present and by doing that they can be a little bit more accessible and a little bit more flawed and a little bit more familiar to you and me he said that this setting would combine elements of original series while having a lot of fresh and new elements in it it was initially considered whether or not to have enterprise overlap with final season of voyager but it was decided that there would be a gap in broadcasting between two series as berman was concerned with oversaturation of franchise but he hoped that dramatic change in enterprise would mean that new viewers were drawn in to watch it as part of this change decision was made to drop star trek from title but berman explained that if there s any one word that says star trek without actually saying star trek that word is enterprise this title would last until third episode of season three extinction when series was renamed to star trek enterprise following a demand by paramount television executives in an effort to reconnect series with fans of franchise crew thumb left

majority of writers on series were fired by braga with exception of chris black he was promoted for second season to co executive producer and former x files and lone gunmen writer john shiban joined writing team and was also named co executive producer berman called recruitment of shiban a coup for series shiban stayed for second season while black left after third garcia phillips 2009 p 272 fourth season of enterprise saw a change to leadership for crew with manny coto taking over as executive producer and showrunner from braga and berman he had previously come onto writing staff during third season and wrote well received episode similitude coto was a fan of original series and sought to link enterprise closer to that earlier show he brought judith and garfield reeves stevens onto enterprise as writers they had previously written books on production of franchise as well as working with william shatner on his series of star trek novels braga and berman remained on staff with

scott bakula center was producers first choice for captain jonathan archer crew issued a casting call for main roles in series and keating and billingsley made immediate impressions on casting director and staff braga said that they knew they were right for those roles right off bat keating had previously auditioned for a role on voyager two years prior but berman wanted to keep him for a future main role saying that when he auditioned for reed that actor nailed it although there were discussions about accent he should be using with keating suggesting one from north of england but producers mistook it for scottish in end they chose to go with keating s natural voice he also praised casting processes involving trinneer park and billingsley calling latter perfect in his role as doctor phlox park was not required to audition but instead was hired on basis of her performance in a scene she appeared in wb series popular alongside anthony montgomery despite that character was intended to be older until park was cast montgomery had previously auditioned to play tuvok s son in voyager and after being chosen for part of travis mayweather he elected to take part instead of a role in a low budget movie he had been offered longest casting process was that of bakula as archer due to extended contract negotiations that took place which added to a delay in production he had been sought for part by executive producers although bakula wanted to do show he wanted to feel that he was making a good deal and that everyone was going to work together to make this a good experience he had signed up for a pilot for cbs called late bloomers before agreeing to appear on enterprise one of reasons he agreed to join cast of enterprise was that he had previously worked with kerry one of co founders of upn on quantum leap berman later admitted that they did not have an alternative in mind if bakula decided to turn down role thumb right alt a brunette woman her hair cascades over her left shoulder jolene blalock t pol was final member of main cast to join series braga explained that most difficult casting was that for t pol as they were seeking a kim cattrall type blalock and marjorie monaghan were among final three to be considered for part with blalock gaining role despite her agents rejecting requests for her to attend auditions early in casting process by time that blalock auditioned in final group crew had seen hundreds of actresses according to berman his main issue at time was to find a beautiful woman who can act and doesn t want to go right into feature films blalock was excited about casting as she had been a lifelong star trek fan with her favourite character being spock bakula s casting as archer was announced via press release on may 10 2001 however some of british media mistook announcement for bakula taking over from patrick stewart details of rest of main cast were released on may 15 with rest of character details publicised following day some recurring characters were played by actors who had previously appeared in star trek productions with jeffrey combs portraying andorian shran making his first appearance in season one episode andorian incident he had previously portrayed as well as ferengi brunt on deep space nine vaughn armstrong who played admiral maxwell forest had previously appeared in a number of roles in various trek productions since his first part as a klingon in next generation episode heart of glory and by end of enterprise run he had appeared as 13 different characters in total garcia phillips 2009 p 279 randy oglesby rick worthy and scott macdonald had also appeared in a variety of roles within franchise before taking on recurring parts of xindi council members throughout season three throughout production on enterprise there were rumours that william shatner would make a guest appearance during season four this idea was raised once again with reeves stevens suggesting that tantalus field previously thought to be a disintegrator seen in original series episode mirror mirror actually sent its victims back in time to a penal colony in regular universe this in turn would allow shatner to reprise his role as mirror universe version of captain james t kirk he pitched this to braga and berman but instead they pitched another idea back to actor in which he could play chef of enterprise who was taken to future by daniels and required to impersonate kirk after they could not settle on an idea mirror universe concept was reworked into two part episode in a mirror darkly sets and filming majority of filming took place on paramount pictures lot in los angeles california temporary sets for show were housed on stages 8 and 9 while permanent sets including bridge engineering and armory were located on stage 18 engineering set itself was built across two levels with large warp drive taking up majority of space stages 8 and 9 had housed sets for earlier star trek series since production was started on abandoned star trek phase ii during late 1970s they were subsequently used for films star trek motion picture star trek ii wrath of khan star trek iii search for spock and star trek iv voyage home before being used for next generation and voyager stage 18 had not been previously used for production of any star trek series or films during course of filming pilot between 130 and 150 members of staff worked on constructing sets this reduced to 20 to 25 crew members when show went to series these teams were led by construction coordinator tom arp who had previously worked on deep space nine and a number of star trek films in same capacity although a number of episodes required specific sets to be built from scratch team would save certain elements to enable them to be reused in later episodes production had a warehouse in burbank to store those pieces while they were not being used midway through third season from exile onwards series started to be broadcast in 1080i high definition television alongside jake 2 0 it was one of first two series on upn to be broadcast in high definition show contains over 4 214 minutes of special effects dialogue and other scenes although it was broadcast in high definition at 1080i it was not released on 1080p blu ray until later and an example is 2017 blu ray collection of full series called enterprise full journey until start of fourth season series was shot on traditional film stock it first three seasons were shot on wide screen 35mm film with and an aspect ratio of 1 78 1 and it was 3 perf super 35mm film after rush began testing a sony digital camera on standing sets for two days prior to production on storm front and demonstrated footage to braga and berman decision was made to switch to digital production rush felt that audience would not see a great deal of difference as footage can be shot in a way to look same as earlier seasons but felt that filming in high definition would be a benefit because of additional detail that could be seen on screen at time this was cutting edge for a tv show with allowing production team improved low light performance and it enabled shooting more compared to chemical films actual camera used was sony cinealta high definition camera and recording technology also used sony cinealta 24p a trademarked name of that company decision to move to sony s technology was a triple agreement of three executive producers of show and also supported by directory of photography season four s blu ray release of enterprise in 1080p has been praised as sharp and with satisfying color and best looking of seasons fourth season has been released multiple times with latest as a combined full series set in january 2017 music dennis mccarthy

jay chattaway john frizzell kevin kiner mark mckenzie velton ray bunch and brian tyler opening sequence and theme song franchise was known for typically using orchestral themes but berman said that theme tune would be more contemporary than heard in previous series and a little hipper theme was revealed to be a cover of rod stewart single faith of heart by british tenor russell watson stewart s song had originally appeared on soundtrack to 1998 film patch adams for use in enterprise it was retitled to where my heart will take me but prompted a negative reaction from existing star trek fans these included an online petition to have song removed and there was a protest held outside of paramount studios executive producers braga and berman both defended choice with berman saying that fan response was split over song while braga said that some people found song uplifting illustrator john eaves created a drawing of a number of real world and star trek vessels leaving earth which was subsequently turned into a poster by dan madsen at star trek communicator magazine eaves gave copies of this poster to braga and berman with berman suggesting possibility that this could be a good concept for an opening sequence aim of sequence was to follow evolution of exploration flight and space flight as suggested by eaves poster it included real world vessels such as hms enterprise spirit of st louis bell x 1 space shuttle enterprise amongst others in addition to mars rover sojourner and international space station star trek vessels featured included two new designs by eaves as well as

cancellation series was considered for cancellation at end of second season with paramount executives instead requesting a number of changes to enterprise in order to renew it following a letter writing campaign from fans these included a change of name to star trek enterprise early in third season and a new action oriented plot which resulted in development of xindi there was a major turn over of staff at paramount in june 2004 with jonathan dolgen head of entertainment at parent company viacom quitting following departure of viacom president mel dolgen was described by bakula as being huge star trek guy at paramount and his departure was followed by several other staff members leaving during these departures upn was purchased by cbs fans were resigned to cancellation at end of third season but were surprised when series was renewed which was due in part to a reduction in fees paramount was charging upn on a per episode basis however enterprise was moved to a slot on friday

was still being discussed with braga suggesting that fans could prompt netflix into producing a new season of enterprise by watching existing four seasons on service this resulted in a facebook

well as continue to link to original series with references to things such as cloud city of stratos as seen in cloud another feature that coto planned was to have a miniseries within a series with four or five episodes devoted to following up on events from mirror universe episode in a mirror darkly producers had also intended to bring jeffrey combs onto series as a regular by placing his

broadcast on upn this was during first full week of new season on american television and it was felt at time that combination of enterprise alongside buffy vampire slayer and roswell would help to cross promote each other due to science fiction and fantasy genre links this even included a cross over episode of roswell with a character from that series auditioning before jonathan frakes for a role on enterprise after first few weeks of episodes of enterprise ratings were considered to be solid enough and expectation was that series would run for seven seasons in same manner as next generation deep space nine and voyager however viewing figures began to decrease towards end of season changes were made for third season with introduction of season long xindi storyline this improved reviews that series was receiving and viewers in 18 to 35 demographics but overall ratings continued to decrease upn cut 26 episode order for third season to 24 meaning that if 24 episodes were created for fourth season as well then they would have 100 episodes needed for syndication as well as a move to friday nights fourth season was shortened further to 22 episodes meaning that at
