for a much darker scenario than other final fantasy games main cast were designed by nomura and naora while side characters were handled by nakaaki multiple pieces of merchandise and additional media have been created around characters including trading cards and multiple manga they have been subject of positive reviews in japan and import reviews main praise has gone to their interactions and writing while main criticism was difficulties arising from handling large cast western reviews were also generally positive about character portrayals but there were criticisms about dialogue character interactions and quality of localization concept and creation original scenario and concept of final fantasy type 0 originally a mobile title named final fantasy agito xiii was conceived by hajime tabata he wished for a group driven story as he felt that a single playable character would not be able to properly convey scope and themes of story because tabata wanted to show a history of survival told from point of view of young people caught in a war it was decided to set story during a war between four nations much of original story which mainly revolved about defying gods was drawn from popular anime and manga and did not survive after platform change to playstation portable tabata adopted a story telling style similar to a documentary film a direct inspiration for this was centuries of picture a documentary series broadcast on nhk alongside that multiple war films were used as inspiration type 0s script was written by hiroki chiba and sarah okabe during rough draft stage elements such as extra plot points involving khalia a boss fight with arecia and a main plot thread involving joker and tiz were planned most of these elements were cut from final product meaning elements such as joker and tiz s role needed to be included in written texts found in game so they were not left hanging deaths of class zero were planned from an early stage and to emphasize state of world a large number of supporting cast were killed off near end tabata wanted to create a story depicting different fates for type 0s characters and this decision was supported by both staff members and fans of original he also implemented ability for players to decide course of story which was to have been included in type 0 when it was still known as agito xiii final fantasy agito was given a more upbeat atmosphere when compared to type 0 although dark and more dramatic moments were still present story grew out of what tabata originally envisioned for type 0 setting of type 0 was written around fabula nova crystallis subseries which also includes final fantasy xiii and final fantasy xv mythos involves how humans are manipulated and controlled by world s deities crystals of type 0s world were equivalent of fal cie demigods serving these deities originally crystals were to have been called fal cie characters arecia gala and diva were also created to fill roles of fal cie approach taken to incorporation of mythos was that world of orience was part of a shared universe that also contained worlds of xiii and xv rather than a standalone existence as opposed to xiii which told a story directly related to mythos deities type 0 focused on human side of story depicting deities role in world events from a historical standpoint a key element carried directly from mythos is l cie humans chosen by servants of world s deities to fulfill a pre determined task called a focus tabata neglected including elements from fabula nova crystallis mythos until approximately halfway through process chiba and obake were ones responsible for including elements in storyline as well as including cyclic nature of game s world to help communicate some aspects of mythos originally disliked by tabata he later said that it suited game due to heavy eastern influences character design characters were designed by regular final fantasy designer tetsuya nomura art director yusuke naora co art director yusaku nakaaki and sub character designer roberto ferrari naora asked nomura to contribute to character designs naora and nomura did main cast while nakaaki and ferrari handled secondary characters each player character was initially given a basic design trait drawn by nomura design was gradually expanded upon during creative process working to avoid making them appear similar part of this was giving each character a unique weapon deuce s flute and ace s cards were most difficult to realize from a technical standpoint after world and setting were created characters personalities and traits were finalized for each character team planned how each character originated and events which happened around them main cast s naming system based on playing cards was chosen because team liked idea nomura came up with idea of having fourteen characters with thirteen main characters and a joker this idea originally created for agito xiii carried over into type 0 characters were made of various heights and builds to emphasize both game s realism and characters being teenagers while portraying bonds between members of class zero and between them and their summoned monsters along with game s themes of death and war naora drew inspiration from when he saw a cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats nomura was in charge of choosing voice cast which featured several well known voice actors when listening to samples and picking actors nomura focused on whether they could successfully project characters personalities actors and actresses helped define characters adding individual touches during voice recording sessions hoshino acted as game s character texture artist originally she was going to put in black voids where a female character s panties would have been due to hardware limitations however staff realized that players would be looking at backs of characters a lot so hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with staff to incorporate them into character models after type 0s release tabata resurrected his initial concept for a mobile game as prequel agito hoshino became title s art director as with type 0 one of areas she focused on was female characters underwear characters facial animations were done using silicon studio s motion portrait middleware for type 0 hd characters original gameplay models were replaced with updated versions of original cutscene models due to latter s higher detail due to this higher detail cutscene models looked older than gameplay models so they needed adjustments to look more like original models their appearances were also adjusted to look more charming game s graphical upgrade was only partially done for game s characters due to time constraints while main cast were given most attention secondary characters such as kurasame received less work playable characters thumb 300px right fourteen members of class zero in final fantasy type 0 are main protagonists and
