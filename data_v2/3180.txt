filmed in colour chitrapu narayana rao who directed 1942 film approached meiyappan in may 1965 and asked to direct a film meiyappan signed him as director for bhaktha prahlada since narayana rao was

bhaktha prahlada his sons were more interested in ave kallu than bhaktha prahlada uncertain of latter s commercial viability when sekhar showed set designs to meiyappan and his sons before building

up on a jack i precariously stand there with a fear that i d fall off stool but i should not show it in my face i should instead sing with a smiling face narayana rao was reluctant to direct film s climactic scene since he could not forget hiranyakashipu s death scene in a stage play in where actor playing narasimha was emotionally involved murugan directed scene according to meiyappan s wishes and a double was engaged for ranga rao for climactic scene meiyappan dissatisfied with overall result took close up shots of ranga rao to make scene look authentic gopalakrishnan and k s reddy
