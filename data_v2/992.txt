to information while en route or on site anywhere in city bridging digital divide in city was also a stated goal for network several ownership schemes were considered in process of building and running system one plan which named city officials as owners and operators of network was scrapped because city lacked core competency to do it on its own as well as 25 30 million capital investment required for initial construction plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running network this plan met opposition from institute for local self reliance an organization that stated that it believed that city should build network itself and then contract a private company to maintain it city opened up bidding for construction of network in 2005 eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers of these eight atlanta based earthlink and minnetonka based us internet were selected as semifinalists and each company set up a trial program in minneapolis before final decision was made during this process outcry arose from both members of institute for local self reliance about lack of public hearings on subject of network and

wireless network with certain exceptions such as eloise butler wildflower garden which lacked infrastructure to support such a system city s numerous lakes were also ruled out for network coverage since sending and receiving signals on them would require transmission poles in water first area of city to receive service was downtown minneapolis though it was delayed two weeks there due to technical challenges posed by skyscrapers in area as well as uneven terrain of mississippi river on east side of area goal was to blanket entire city with network by november 2007 and in spite of delays usi wireless expected that next area for installation a residential neighborhood would be easier thanks to its flat terrain in late 2008 however completion of network was stuck at 82 because of a misunderstanding between minneapolis park and recreation board who stated that usi wireless could not install their radio transmitters on park land without proper permits and usi wireless who had been unaware of this a further delay in 2008 came in form of light poles that were breaking under stress of wireless transmitters being placed upon them in neighborhoods in calhoun isles area of city in response city paid 1 million to install new light poles in area that would be capable of supporting transmitters by 2009 almost entirety of city s was covered by network with certain challenge areas being fitted with special equipment in 2006 when us internet was selected to construct network plans existed for wireless service to be available to residents for a subscription of 19 95 per

wireless service but using only six percent of capacity which it had purchased some complaints were raised by various municipal departments from whose budgets cost of network subscription was being deducted regardless of whether they were utilizing it more departments however were beginning to use network including city inspectors and 90 other city employees a trend which was expected to lead to a usage of fourteen percent of city s purchased capacity by end of 2011 city of minneapolis had connected 30 security cameras and 35 electronic street signs to network by end of 2010 with intention to connect 50 network enabled parking meters and 10 garbage trucks to system in near future fire and police conversion to citywide network was also underway though city was taking necessary precautions

collapse usi wireless opened up network to anyone not just subscribers and hastily added more wireless transmitters to area to give additional speed to network with cell phone service overwhelmed in just 30 minutes it was caldwell s goal that people would use smartphones to communicate via network instead whether or not voice communications traffic jumped in that period was unclear but network s usage did expand from 1 000 users before collapse to 6 000 afterwards network was also used heavily by government officials and rescue personnel who used pdas or laptops to log on to network it was used by rescue workers who were floating in middle of river and who could receive signal to communicate with headquarters in charge of rescue operations wireless service was integral in sending large
