russet sparrow passer cinnamomeus also called cinnamon or cinnamon tree sparrow is a passerine bird of sparrow family passeridae a chunky little seed eating bird with a thick bill it has a body length of its plumage is mainly warm rufous above and grey below it exhibits sexual dimorphism with plumage of both sexes patterned similarly to that of corresponding sex of house sparrow its vocalisations are sweet and musical chirps which when strung together form a song three subspecies are recognised differing chiefly in of their underparts subspecies rutilans and intensior breed in parts of eastern asia where they are usually found in light woodland and subspecies cinnamomeus breeds in himalayas where it is usually associated with terrace cultivation russet sparrow is typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where house and eurasian tree sparrows are absent in southern part of its range russet sparrow prefers higher altitudes but in north it breeds by sea russet sparrow is known well enough in himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages and is depicted in japanese art this sparrow feeds mainly on seeds of herbs and grains but it also eats berries and insects particularly during breeding season this diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas but also a predator of insect pests while breeding it is not social as its nests are dispersed it forms flocks when not breeding although it associates with other bird species infrequently in some parts of its range russet sparrow migrates at least to lower altitudes its nest is located in a tree cavity or a hole in a cliff or building male chooses nest site before finding a mate and uses nest for courtship display typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs both sexes incubate and feed young taxonomy english ornithologist john gould described a specimen of russet sparrow collected in himalayas at a meeting of zoological society of london in december 1835 under binomial name cinnamomea his description was included in volume of society s proceedings for 1835 that was published on 8 april 1836 dated 1835 on title page but published in 1836 its specific name comes from new latin cinnamomeus cinnamon coloured russet sparrow was described as fringilla rutilans by dutch zoologist coenraad jacob temminck from a specimen collected in japan 5 volumes were originally issued in 102 parts 1820 1839 temminck s description is contained in his nouveau recueil de planches d oiseaux which was issued in 102 or parts between 1820 and 1839 it was at one time believed that livraison containing description of russet sparrow was issued in 1835 but it has now been established that it appeared sometime in 1836 but as precise date is not known under rules of international commission on zoological nomenclature it is deemed to have been published on 31 december 1836 most taxonomists give priority to gould s publication and use binomial name passer cinnamomeus for russet sparrow russet sparrow has usually been placed in genus passer and within this genus it is seen as a part of palearctic black bibbed sparrow group which includes eurasian tree sparrow as well as house sparrow it has generally been seen as a close relation of house sparrow and richard even considered it to be same species as somali sparrow one of house sparrow s closest relatives however studies of mitochondrial dna indicate that russet sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among palearctic black bibbed sparrows while dna suggests speciation in passer occurred during miocene and pliocene british ornithologist j denis summers smith estimated that russet sparrow separated from other palearctic black bibbed sparrows about 25 000 to 15 000 years ago during last glacial period during this time sparrows would have been isolated in ice free refugia such as lower yangtze valley which summers smith considered most likely centre of evolution for russet sparrow thirteen subspecies have been described but only three are widely recognised these differing largely in colour of their underparts subspecies passer cinnamomea rutilans breeds in japan korea taiwan and southeastern and central china subspecies intensior described in 1922 by walter rothschild from yunnan breeds in southwest china and parts of india burma laos and vietnam in a large part of sichuan intensior intergrades with p c rutilans and a number of subspecies names have been proposed for intergrades nominate subspecies cinnamomeus described by gould from northwestern himalayas breeds from northern arunachal pradesh to nuristan in afghanistan description russet sparrow is a small chunky bird with plumage warm rufous in overall colour it is a medium sized sparrow at and it has a thick bill suited to eating seeds which is black on breeding male horn coloured on non breeding male and yellowish with a dark tip on female wingspans for males range between and those for females from tail bill and tarsus lengths are and respectively measurements for russet sparrow vary geographically between three subspecies and also within himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than others and within this form there is a tendency for birds at higher altitudes to be larger and a clinal variation in size with smallest birds in west of range and largest in east iris is chestnut in colour legs of both sexes are pale brown to pinkish brown flight of all sparrows is swift and that of russet sparrow is described as swifter and more direct than that of eurasian tree sparrow plumage thumb left an illustration by philipp franz von siebold from fauna japonica in which russet sparrow was described with now synonymised name passer sexes differ or are dimorphic in their plumage and have a similar pattern to that in corresponding sex of house sparrow there is some variation between three subspecies especially in colouration of underparts birds of subspecies rutilans are off white on their cheeks and sides of their necks and have pale grey underparts birds of subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks as well as darker upperparts while those of subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts moult is poorly recorded only records coming from sakhalin and himachal pradesh in sakhalin moult occurs in august and september between breeding season and migration in himachal pradesh g a observed captive and wild birds and reported that they were yellow from december to spring and whitish during remainder of year a pattern which may be atypical breeding male is bright russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump with a black streaking on its mantle it has a small black bib and black around its eye separated from russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium a stripe running from bill to rear of head side of its neck and cheek are off white and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow varying geographically shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut and its median coverts are black at base with white at tips rest of wing is light brown with black tinges its tail is blackish brown edged with ashy brown non breeding male differs little from breeding male being paler with more orange upperparts only species with which male is easily confused is eurasian tree sparrow which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back female has mostly pale brown upperparts and pale grey underparts so it resembles female house sparrow it differs from house sparrow in its slightly darker russet tinged plumage it has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye it has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff juvenile is similar to female though more pale and sandy as male reaches its first winter it resembles adult differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib voice russet sparrow s vocalisations are described by most sources as sweetest and most musical of any sparrow its basic call is a or similar to that of other sparrows this call is monosyllabic unlike house sparrow s chirrup call and is softer than that of other sparrows this call is given as a flight call or by displaying males recorded variations include a given by males at nest and a trilled sometimes male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone to create a sort of short song transcribed as or song is interspersed with sibilant notes similar to those of white wagtail a thin vocalisation not unlike that of an indian robin has been reported but context of this call is unrecorded during territorial disputes males give a rapid call distribution and habitat thumb alt male perching on a thin bare branch among young leaves breeding male in india thumb a wintering flock of russet sparrows in murree pakistan russet sparrow is found in parts of eastern asia and in himalayas it is not known whether its distribution is continuous between these two areas since political sensitivity of brahmaputra river s valley near china india border makes area less accessible to ornithologists in himalayas russet sparrow breeds from far northeast of india through southeastern tibet bhutan sikkim nepal uttarakhand and himachal pradesh to kashmir and nuristan in afghanistan here russet sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between november and april in many areas in eastern asia russet sparrow is found in sakhalin kuril islands a small part of mainland russia japan southern korea and part of northern china where it is mostly migratory it is distributed through southern china and taiwan and mountainous parts of burma southern northeast india laos and vietnam where it is mostly resident russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern japan further south of china and northern thailand in eastern asia autumn migration occurs between august and november russet sparrow appears to be abundant in most habitats across most of its very large range and in some areas it is among most common birds in southeast asia its range has contracted at lower elevations due to global warming but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common although its global population has not been quantified it is assessed for iucn red list as least concern for global extinction breeding takes place in mountains and uplands across most of range this preference for high altitudes is influenced by latitude in farthest south of its range it never breeds below above mean sea level but in northernmost part of its range it often breeds by sea in eastern asia russet sparrow prefers light woodland but it is sometimes found in towns and agricultural areas in sakhalin it breeds mostly in riparian forest in hokkaido russet sparrow finds a greater food supply for its young in more remote forests and has greater reproductive success in himalayas it is strongly associated with terrace cultivation and it probably only spread to himalayas when these agricultural practices arrived 3000 to 4000 years ago in towns where it occurs alongside house or tree sparrow it is found in gardens and less built up areas in those hill stations in india where both house and russet sparrow occur house sparrow breeds around more built up areas and bazaars whereas russet sparrow is rather more up market at larger houses with gardens and open spaces in towns where it is only sparrow it is not dependent on trees breeding around houses and eating scraps in streets in winter migratory birds occur in open cultivated land and riverine grasslands but are never far from shrubs or trees behaviour thumb a male eating yoshino cherry blossoms in aichi prefecture japan in many aspects of its behaviour russet sparrow is similar to house and eurasian tree sparrows like them it feeds on ground but spends most of its time perching on branches unlike those species it prefers open exposed branches for perching russet sparrow is described as shy and wary by some observers but j denis summers smith found it approachable in indian hill stations flocking russet sparrows feed close to ground moving forward as birds from rear of a flock move to front in what is called roller feeding outside its breeding season russet sparrow is gregarious and forms flocks to find food though it infrequently associates with other birds wintering flocks tend to keep away from human habitation russet sparrow is also social at night during winter and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes in breeding season female roosts in nests and male nests in foliage nearby adult russet sparrow is mostly a seed eater eating seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice barley and other grains berries such as those of certain berberis spp are also eaten when available nestlings are fed mostly on insects especially caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit during breeding season adults also consume insects mortality rates in russet sparrow have not been studied but it is known that many young birds die from isospora infections to which bird has little resistance other recorded parasites of russet sparrow include protocalliphora blowflies and menacanthus chewing lice breeding russet sparrow s breeding season is short lasting about three months himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus has been recorded breeding from april to august nominate subspecies breeds from may to july and subspecies intensior is believed to breed in march during its breeding season russet sparrow is not gregarious and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities often disused woodpecker nests russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests taking advantage of territorial defence of kites to avoid nest predation other nest locations include eaves of thatched roofs stone walls and embankments and electric junction boxes in bhutan it nests in holes in outer walls of monasteries often alongside eurasian tree sparrow in sakhalin it will sometimes build free standing nests in bushes russet sparrow also uses disused nests of red rumped swallow and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black crested tits from their nest male chooses nest site and uses it for his courtship display spending much time calling nearby when a female comes near a male at his nest male begins to display by raising his head drooping his wings pushing his chest forward and lowering his tail he then bows up and down in front of female who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive both sexes take part in building nest which consists of a loose untidy bunch of dry grass which fills nesting cavity lined with fur and feathers for warmth eggs are elongated ovals with a fine texture and a slight gloss they are whitish in overall colour with a grey tinge and brown spots streaks or blotches average size of egg is 19 2 millimetres 0 55 in eggs are similar to those of eurasian tree sparrow differing in a duller colour and more narrow shape though they cannot be separated from those of other sparrows with certainty two clutches of four or sometimes five or six eggs are laid in a year in hokkaido clutches are laid between early may and early july with two peaks in laying around mid may and late june both sexes incubate and feed young with male often being more active in feeding nestlings in hokkaido nestlings hatch weighing about and fledge fourteen or fifteen days after hatching weighing common cuckoo has been recorded in old literature as a brood parasite of russet sparrow relationships with humans thumb c 1830 woodblock hibiscus and sparrow by japanese artist hokusai which portrays russet sparrow alt an artwork with a red capped and reddish backed little bird flying beside pink five petalled blooms and dark green leaves of a hibiscus flower in parts of range russet sparrow inhabits towns and in most of its range it occurs near cultivation and is a minor pest of agriculture though it damages crops it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests in china russet sparrow has been recorded as a captive bird kept with eurasian tree sparrow in japan it was eaten in 1870s and sold in yokohama game market russet sparrow is known well enough in himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from eurasian tree sparrow examples of these vernacular names include lal in hindi and kang che go ma in tibetan japanese artist hokusai portrayed russet sparrow and due to this it has appeared on postage stamps featuring japanese art in japan gambia and guyana references works cited external links russet sparrow at internet bird collection recording of russet sparrow s calls russet sparrow category
