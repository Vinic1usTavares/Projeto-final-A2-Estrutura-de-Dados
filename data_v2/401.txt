second half of anime in it his story is almost same only exception is that mello s involvement with mafia is removed creation and conception tsugumi ohba death notes writer introduced near and mello together because he felt l individually could not defeat kira and that introducing only one new character would produce a repeat of struggle between light and l ohba asked takeshi obata artist of series to make both characters look a little l ish ohba wavered in their ages and considered making characters sons of l as ohba wanted to include a little l in near and mello obata tried to keep weirdness and panda eyes since l is an important character obata felt that he had made near and mello look too much like l when he first heard about near and mello obata assumed that they would join as a team and work together so he envisioned two as twins describing creation of character designs as a major struggle at first he tried to depict mello as having more energy than near however designs for characters became switched at a later phase final mello had near s design and vice versa when obata created designs his editor wrote wrong names to accompany them when obata received approval for designs it was too late to point out that labels were incorrect initially for him mello was more calm and feminine but later he felt that it s better that switch occurred ohba did not initially develop mello and near s personalities as he wanted to reveal them through their actions he added chocolate trait because he believed that chocolate represented all sweets and that trait would fit with story arc in united states obata designed mello s clothing based on clothes he enjoys drawing which includes shiny leather at first mello s hair was cut straight across obata preferred mello s hair becoming messy which occurred later in story obata became grateful when ohba added scar since he felt that he could draw mello looking cooler ohba added mello s scar to thumbnails as trait would give him more depth he further added mello looks more intense and more human with scar after drawing mello s updated appearance with scar obata finally felt that he could draw mello really well obata said that fact that ohba and obata did not regularly meet in person was for best because if obata had told ohba about his satisfaction with mello s new appearance ohba might not have killed mello however obata felt sad when mello died in story shortly afterward ohba considered having mello be character who ultimately defeats light according to ohba after disappearance of sidoh writer struggled with mello s role ohba s idea of mello ultimately defeating light and near being best was strong in his mind but once mello had learned too much about death note he had to kill him to sustain intensity of story as a result ohba did not give mello a large role at conclusion of death note and instead had mello negatively affect light indirectly ohba gave mello a very plain death depicted in only one panel he felt that if mello had perished dramatically it would reveal truth behind his death reception merchandise based on his character has been released including action figures and plush dolls moreover several publications for manga and anime have commented on mello s character referring to mello and near s introduction julie rosato of mania com said focus on both makes for a clash of attitudes and rough transitions however as they were introduced in anime ign s tom s pepirium criticized how it is not explained what mello is doing and how it differs from near s story writing for active anime holly ellingwood stated they truly represent light s newest and greatest enemies while briana lawrence from anime news network said both could be much better characters if they were treated as individuals instead of different halves of l erin finnegan from pop culture shock praised death note last name for absence of mello and near anime news network s casey brienza stressed mello s presence as a narrator in light novel makes things a bit too breathless in places and a bit too self conscious in others a e sparrow from ign praised how introduction of mello a man of action spiced things up a bit as he brought actually action to series manga news said mello is an interesting character as he is unpredictable and also praised action scenes he brings as such they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is one of few to bring some new blood to series after mello s death pepirium wrote mello deserved more on other hand mello is an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability according to chris beveridge of mania com animeland and manga news presented opposite opinions if whether or not mello is charismatic character with former declaring he does not replace l as he lacks charisma see also list of death note characters references category comics characters introduced in 2004 category death note characters category fictional detectives
