cheney worked to maintain strong ties between united states and its european allies cheney persuaded kingdom of saudi arabia to allow bases for u s ground troops and war planes in nation this was an

endara had been duly elected president of panama noriega nullified election outcome drawing intensified pressure in october noriega suppressed a military coup but in december after soldiers of

iraqi invasion of kuwait on august 1 1990 iraqi president saddam hussein sent invading iraqi forces into neighboring kuwait a small petroleum rich state long claimed by iraq as part of its territory this invasion sparked initiation of persian gulf war and it brought worldwide condemnation an estimated 140 000 iraqi troops quickly took control of kuwait city and moved on to saudi arabia kuwait border united states had already begun to develop contingency plans for defense of saudi arabia by u s central command headed by general norman schwarzkopf because of its important petroleum reserves u s and world reaction thumb left cheney meets with prince sultan minister of defence and aviation in saudi arabia to discuss how to handle invasion of kuwait cheney and schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full scale u s military operation according to general colin powell cheney had become a glutton for information with an appetite we could barely satisfy he spent hours in national military command center my staff with questions shortly after iraqi invasion cheney made first of several visits to saudi arabia where king fahd requested u s military assistance united nations took action as well passing a series of resolutions condemning iraq s invasion of kuwait un security council authorized all means necessary to eject iraq from kuwait and demanded that country withdraw its forces by january 15 1991 by then united states had a force of about 500 000 stationed in saudi arabia and persian gulf other nations including britain canada france italy syria and egypt contributed troops and other allies most notably germany and japan agreed to provide financial support for coalition effort named operation desert shield on january 12 1991 congress authorized bush to use military force to enforce iraq s compliance with un resolutions on kuwait military action first phase of operation desert storm which began on january 17 1991 was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack iraqi forces targeting key iraqi command and control centers including cities of baghdad and basra cheney turned most other department of defense matters over to deputy secretary atwood and briefed congress during air and ground phases of war he flew with powell to region to review and finalize ground war plans after an air offensive of more than five weeks un coalition forces launched ground war on february 24 within 100 hours iraqi forces had been routed from kuwait and schwarzkopf reported that basic objective expelling iraqi forces from kuwait had been met on february 27 after consultation with cheney and other members of his national security team bush declared a suspension of hostilities on working with this national security team cheney has said there have been five republican presidents since eisenhower i worked for four of them and worked closely with a fifth reagan years when i was part of house leadership best national security team i ever saw was that one least friction most cooperation highest degree of trust among principals especially aftermath a total of 147 u s military personnel died in combat and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes iraq agreed to a formal truce on march 3 and a permanent cease fire on april 6 there was subsequent debate about whether un coalition forces should have driven as far as baghdad to oust saddam hussein from power bush agreed that decision to end ground war when they did was correct but debate persisted as hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces arguably most significant debate concerned whether u s and coalition forces had left iraq too soon in an april 15 1994 interview with c span cheney was asked if u s and un forces should have moved into baghdad cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over country would have been a bad idea and would have led to a quagmire explaining that because if we d gone to baghdad we would have been all alone there wouldn t have been anybody else with us there would have been a u s occupation of iraq none of arab forces that were willing to fight with us in kuwait were willing to invade iraq once you got to iraq and took it over took down saddam hussein s government then what are you going to put in its place that s a very volatile part of world and if you take down central government of iraq you could very easily end up seeing pieces of iraq fly off part of it syrians would like to have to west part of it eastern iraq iranians would like to claim they fought over it for eight years in north you ve got kurds and if kurds spin loose and join with kurds in turkey then you threaten territorial integrity of turkey it s a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over iraq other thing was casualties everyone was impressed with fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had but for 146 americans killed in action and for their families it wasn t a cheap war and question for president in terms of whether or not we went on to baghdad took additional casualties in an effort to get saddam hussein was how many additional dead americans is saddam worth our judgment was not very many and i think we got it right cheney regarded gulf war as an example of kind of regional problem united states was likely to continue to face in future we re always going to have to be involved in middle east maybe it s part of our national character you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up put a ribbon around it you deploy a force you win war and problem goes away but it doesn t work that way in middle east it never has and isn t likely to in my lifetime private sector career between 1987 and 1989 during his last term in congress cheney
