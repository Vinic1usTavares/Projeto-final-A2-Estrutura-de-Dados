of safety he represented it at north carolina provincial congress and helped to draft first constitution of north carolina initially a major in 7th north carolina regiment hogun advanced quickly in rank during 1776 to become unit s commanding officer he participated in battles of brandywine and germantown in 1777 continental congress promoted hogun to brigadier general in 1779 although several congressmen and north carolina general assembly wished to see thomas clark of north carolina promoted instead hogun was in command of north carolina s line brigade during siege of charleston in spring of 1780 which ended in surrender of all but one of north carolina s regiments of regular infantry as well as more than 5 000 patriot soldiers under major general benjamin lincoln hogun was highest ranking officer from north carolina to be captured and imprisoned after surrender of charleston and despite being offered opportunity to leave internment under a parole that was generally extended to other captured continental officers he remained in a british prisoner of war camp near charleston hogun likely chose imprisonment in order to prevent british army from recruiting continental soldiers for its campaign in west indies he became ill and died in prison on haddrel s point a peninsula in charleston s harbor early life much of hogun s early life remains unknown due to his relative obscurity until american revolutionary war he immigrated to north carolina from ireland his place of birth in 1751 and on october 3 that year he married ruth norfleet couple had a son lemuel hogun made his home near modern day community of hobgood in halifax county in 1774 hogun became a member of halifax county committee of safety which indicated his rise to prominence since arriving in colony 23 years prior between august 1775 and november 1776 hogun represented halifax county in third fourth and fifth north carolina provincial congresses and demonstrated an interest in military matters as a delegate hogun assisted in drafting first constitution of north carolina american revolutionary war initial command hogun was named a major in 7th north carolina regiment in april 1776 and was given command of unit on november 26 1776 initially regiment had some difficulty organizing after several of officers delayed their military work in order to take care of their personal affairs hogun was forced to reprimand his officers sharply threatening them with loss of their commissions at same time currents of doubt ran through north carolina as loyalists attempted to hinder enlistment of patriots by spreading rumors about imminent demise of patriot army in north and disease that was allegedly ravaging that force while commanding his regiment hogun fought against british army in battles of brandywine and germantown and was present at valley forge in winter of 1777 78 in 1778 hogun was given orders to assist in recruiting so called additional regiments requested by continental congress from north carolina and afterwards was ordered to west point with first regiment so recruited after his arrival and throughout late autumn and winter of 1778 79 hogun s regiment served on a work detail tasked with building up fortifications at west point hogun was not satisfied with this task but his men lacked sufficient weapons to allow them to serve as a combat unit at that time approximately 400 muskets had to be requisitioned for regiment to be fully armed promotion and philadelphia in early 1779 major general benedict arnold then commandant of philadelphia pennsylvania requested that general george washington send him an additional regiment of continental soldiers to guard patriot stores in philadelphia hogun was sent to arnold with his newly recruited regiment arriving on or before january 19 1779 on january 9 1779 while en route to philadelphia hogun was promoted to brigadier general by continental congress his promotion came about in part as a result of what thomas burke a delegate to continental congress from north carolina and a fellow irishman termed distinguished intrepidity hogun had exhibited at germantown this caused some controversy as north carolina general assembly which was customarily consulted for promotion of generals from that state had already nominated thomas clark and jethro sumner for promotion to rank of brigadier general sumner was promoted but clark was passed over in favor of hogun who received support of nine of thirteen states hogun s surprising victory was due in large part burke s lobbying efforts among his colleagues in continental congress by political conventions governing such matters burke was bound by vote of north carolina general assembly to support state legislature s recommendations of clark and sumner but he worked to convince other congressmen to vote for hogun over clark hogun was appointed to succeed arnold as commandant of philadelphia on march 19 1779 serving until november 22 that

led brigade of about 700 men from philadelphia to charleston south carolina where he was placed under command of major general benjamin lincoln march was arduous and hogun s brigade endured one of coldest harshest winters in years hogun s command arrived at charleston on march 13 1780 which according to lincoln gave great spirit to town and confidence to army north carolinians were immediately put to task of defending city which was threatened with a siege by british general henry clinton in early march shortly after hogun s arrival many of north carolina s militia present in city began to return home because their enlistment terms ended on or about march 24 militiamen had only agreed to serve limited terms and as they were not under hogun s direct command he was powerless to stop them leaving charleston was principally located on a peninsula and so lincoln aligned his continental units in defensive works that barricaded neck of peninsula using a line of redoubts and batteries these defensive works were connected by a parapet and commanded from a concrete hornwork jutting out from defensive line in front of fortifications patriot forces dug an 18 foot wide moat and between moat and parapet they constructed a line of abatis to stall any british assault when siege by british army began in earnest on april 1 hogun and his men were positioned on right of continental army s lines near cooper river hogun participated in a council of war on april 20 1780 several members of south carolina privy council a part of civilian government threatened to block continental army s attempts to withdraw from charleston if council of war voted to do so although defending army had only eight to ten days worth of provisions lincoln bowed to pressure from civil authorities and delayed evacuation on april 26 another council of war at which hogun was present determined that british presence on all sides of city prevented army s escape for next two weeks british and patriot forces exchanged artillery and rifle fire at all times of day and british bombardment whittled down american breastworks on may 8 lincoln called another council of war with all his army s general and field officers and ships captains to discuss terms of surrender that had been proposed by clinton of 61 officers in attendance at that council 49 including hogun voted to offer terms of capitulation with british commander when these were rejected hostilities continued and lincoln called another council of war on may 11 to further discuss terms of capitulation council voted to present further terms to clinton which he accepted on may 12 1780 hogun was among officers under lincoln who formally surrendered to british army along with approximately 5 000 continental and militia soldiers surrender led to loss of all but one of regiments of north carolina line then in existence depriving state of all regular non militia soldiers as a brigadier general hogun held highest rank of approximately 814 continental soldiers from north carolina who capitulated at charleston imprisonment and death rather than allowing himself to be paroled hogun requested he be taken prisoner and was interned at british prison camp at haddrel s point on point pleasant located in what is now mount pleasant south carolina across from sullivan s island hogun s decision was based in part on his desire to stifle recruiting efforts of british who sought to enlist captured continental soldiers to serve in british west indies british however held only officers at haddrel s point deciding to house enlisted men in barracks in charleston officers at haddrel s point were subjected to harsh treatment barred from fishing to catch much needed food and threatened with deportation from south carolina approximately 3 300 patriot soldiers were confined in prison camps around charleston that were similar to one at haddrel s point and many were destined for cramped unsanitary prison ships because of conditions many continental soldiers agreed to join loyalist regiments but hogun and other officers set up courts martial in camps and attempted to maintain a dignified military structure hogun s health soon declined and he died in prison camp on january 4 1781 he was buried in an unmarked grave legacy on march 14 1786 north carolina legislature granted hogun s son lemuel a tract near modern day nashville tennessee in recognition of his father s service elder hogun was one of twenty two patriot generals who perished during american revolutionary war and one of twelve who died from disease or other non combat causes in early 20th century north carolina jurist and historian walter clark noted that while careers of three of north carolina s other generals brigadier generals francis nash and james moore and major general robert howe were well known to contemporary historians story of hogun s career as well as that of jethro sumner had been neglected hogun s personal papers appear to have been destroyed while in possession of his descendants in alabama during american civil war leaving virtually no surviving correspondence that would shed further light on his life in 1954 north carolina
