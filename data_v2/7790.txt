transited from hardware to third party development in 2001 nintendo and sega developed a closer relationship and worked together on f zero gx first significant video game collaboration between two idea for a crossover game between sega s sonic hedgehog and nintendo s mario characters had been casually discussed between two companies mascots creators yuji naka and shigeru miyamoto respectively had their private discussions revealed in 2005 sonic hedgehog is protagonist of video game series released by sega in order to provide company with a mascot to rival nintendo s flagship character mario in early 1990s despite discussions idea was not acted on as it lacked a setting that would give game an exclamation mark idea of an olympic setting for mascots originated after sega was awarded beijing 2008 olympic license approximately a year later developer adopted ioc s mission to promote a sporting spirit and wanted to interest young people in olympics with its newly acquired license corporation decided to base sports game around its characters that young people love and are very iconic instead of creating a more realistic simulation sega then requested nintendo for permission to include mario in game setting up first matchup between their mascots nintendo approved and partnered with sega in house to add another layer of quality control to development both companies felt that competitive sportsmanship of olympic games provided an ideal choice as a setting for once rival mascots mario sonic was officially announced with a joint press release by sega and nintendo on march 28

million copies on ds sold critical response although wii version of mario and sonic was awarded best wii game of 2007 at games convention in leipzig it received mixed reactions from game critics ds version had a similar reception a common complaint was that sega and nintendo failed to set first matchup between their mascots in genre that made them famous platform games instead two companies threw mario and sonic into an olympic themed party video game a move which tae kim of gamepro criticized as a marketing tool to popularize xxix olympic games although wii version of game was praised for being an entertaining multiplayer experience it was criticized for shallow gameplay and complex rules and instructions gametrailers concluded that mario sonic s lack of polish and simplicity leaves improbable grouping of mascots as its main attraction when compared to other party video games released for platform gamespot s aaron thomas rated wii version s motion control scheme as uninteresting and occasionally frustrating x play s morgan webb agreed calling controls non intuitive and commenting that minigames required players to wave their frantically while pressing several buttons at same time dan hsu of electronic gaming monthly mentioned that controls were complicated for a game that should be a pure pick up and play party game tae kim said events were short and fairly shallow and mostly required players to move wii remote and in specific ways rapidly up and down for running events for example mark bozon of ign called mario sonic a success due to entertainment value derived from slight variety of competitions offered in game however he and several other critics felt that events within same classification were similar bozon noted that diversity was lacking as five or six events felt nearly identical and thomas found gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite reviewer praising game for its number of events both reviewers favored more complex objectives found in fantasy events of game which shared attributes with that of mario sport games and archery on nintendo ds mario sonic was regarded as virtually same game in design as its wii counterpart however opinions on its control scheme varied greatly gamespy s gerald villoria thought between both versions made them equally enjoyable andrew fitch of 1up com assured readers in his review that less physically demanding gameplay of ds version made game accessible for extended periods of time fitch further stated that in nearly every case events were far more enjoyable on ds due to requirement of human body s finer motor skill abilities to control characters however eurogamer s ellie gibson noted that lack of physical demand reduced players with game craig harris of ign had a similar opinion stating rapidly drumming controllers is far more challenging than quickly stroking touchscreen harris felt ds version lost some relevance to its marginally superior wii counterpart since had a similar design and released almost three months afterwards most publications agreed that wii counterpart of mario sonic had clean textures and well done animations n europe s hockley thought that each character was pleasingly rendered and thomas added that graphics were crisp and colorful mark bozon preferred remixed nintendo and sega music and thought general olympic related music could be a bit generic gamedaily s robert workman called background music mostly forgettable echoing this sentiment for ds version emily of gamepro thought most of music wasn t too interesting compared to wii version ds version s visuals are of same style and its graphics are nearly on same level due to inability to compete against other players online harris regarded mario sonic at olympic games limited use of nintendo wi fi connection on ds as a missed opportunity many reviewers including gibson and pro g s james orry found uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process although home console version also has online rankings it lacks direct competition between players disappointed with aforementioned aspect bozon rationalized that leaderboards certainly made sense for a game like this legacy sonic at olympic games is a sonic themed sports game for mobile phones released in june 2008 developed by airplay and published by sega game features five events based on olympic games starring sonic tails knuckles and amy players control one character from a two dimensional prospective through one button commands commercial success of mario sonic
