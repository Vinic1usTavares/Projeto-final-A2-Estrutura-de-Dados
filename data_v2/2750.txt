being aware of centaurs status making her sinking a tragic accident however as nakagawa had a poor record as a submarine captain and was later convicted of machine gunning survivors of a british

posed an unacceptable risk while 102 survivors from behar were rescued by tone 82 of these prisoners were murdered after cruiser arrived in batavia on 16 march following war vice adm sakonju was

gill 1968 page 390 while japanese raid into indian ocean was not successful associated japanese shipping movements provoked a major allied response in early march 1944 allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left singapore in direction of surabaya and a u s submarine made radar contact with two large japanese ships in lombok strait australian chiefs of staff committee reported to government on 8 march that there was a possibility that these ships could have entered indian ocean to attack fremantle in response to this report all ground and naval defences at fremantle were fully manned all shipping was ordered to leave fremantle and several raaf squadrons were redeployed to bases in western australia odgers 1968 pages 136 139 this alert proved to be a false alarm however japanese ships detected in lombok strait were actually light cruisers and which were covering return of surface raiding force from central indian ocean alert was lifted at fremantle on 13 march and raaf squadrons began returning to their bases in eastern and northern australia on 20 march gill 1968 pages 390 391 german submarine offensive september 1944 january 1945 on

124 however u 196 disappeared in sunda strait some time after departing from penang on 30 november cause of u loss is unknown though it was probably due to an accident or mechanical fault kemp 1997 page 225 kemp suggests that u 196 may have been lost in a diving accident or due to a fault in boat s locally constructed snorkel only surviving submarine of force assigned to attack australia under korvettenkapitan heinrich timm had left kiel in may 1944 and reached penang on 9 september sinking five merchantmen on way she departed batavia on 18 november 1944 and arrived off south west tip of western australia on 26 november submarine had great difficulty finding targets as australian naval authorities warned of u approach had directed shipping away from routes normally used u 862 unsuccessfully attacked greek freighter ilissos off south australian coast on 9 december with bad weather spoiling both attack and subsequent australian efforts to locate submarine stevens 1997 pages

peter silvester was last allied ship to be sunk by axis in indian ocean during war gill 1968 page 557 u 862 arrived in jakarta in mid february 1945 and is only axis ship known to have operated in australian waters during 1945 following germany s surrender u 862 became japanese submarine but was not used operationally stevens 1997 page 222 while allied naval authorities were aware of approach of german strike force and were successful in sinking two of four submarines dispatched efforts to locate and sink u 862 once she reached australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti submarine warfare stevens 2005 page 258 as southern coast of australia was thousands of kilometres behind active combat front in south east asia and had not been raided for several years it should not be considered surprising that few anti submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945

australian aerial maritime operations 1921 1971 phd thesis page 120 in exchange allies sank only a single full sized japanese submarine in australian waters i 124 and two of three midgets that entered sydney harbour a total of 79 japanese sailors died in these sinkings and a further two sailors died on board third midget which was scuttled after leaving sydney harbour figures compiled from jenkins 1992 assessment while scale of axis naval offensive directed against australia was small compared to other naval campaigns of war such as battle of atlantic they were still most comprehensive and widespread series of offensive operations ever conducted by an enemy against australia david stevens japanese submarine operations against australia 1942 1944 accessed 1 september 2006 due to limited size of australian shipping industry and importance of sea transport to australian economy and allied military in south west pacific even modest shipping losses had potential to seriously damage allied war effort in south west pacific despite vulnerability of australian shipping industry axis attacks did not seriously affect australian or allied war effort while german surface raiders which operated against australia caused considerable disruption to merchant shipping and tied down allied naval vessels they did not sink many ships and only operated in australian waters for a few short periods alastair cooper 2001 effectiveness of japanese submarine campaign against australia was limited by inadequate numbers of submarines committed and flaws in japan s submarine doctrine submarines were however successful in forcing allies to devote considerable resources to protecting shipping in australian waters between 1942 and late 1943 stevens japanese submarine operations against australia 1942 1944 accessed 1 september 2006 institution of coastal convoys between 1942 and 1943 may have also significantly reduced efficiency of australian shipping industry during this period stevens 2005 page 334 performance of australian and allied forces committed to defence of shipping on australia station was mixed while threat to australia from axis raiders was anticipated and addressed seapower centre australia 2005 navy contribution to australian maritime operations defence publishing service canberra page 179 only a small proportion of axis ships and submarines which attacked australia were successfully located or engaged several german raiders operated undetected within australian waters in 1940 as number of allied warships and aircraft available were not sufficient to patrol these long 1973 six years war a concise history of australia in 1939 45 war australian war memorial and australian government publishing service canberra page 33 and loss of hmas sydney was a high price to pay for sinking kormoran in 1941 while australian authorities were quick to implement convoys in 1942 and no convoyed ship was sunk during that year escorts of convoys that were attacked in 1943 were not successful in either detecting any submarines before they launched their attack or successfully counter attacking these submarines stevens 2005 page 331 factors explaining relatively poor performance of australian anti submarine forces include their typically low levels of experience and training shortages of asw assets problems with co ordinating searches and poor sonar conditions in waters surrounding australia stevens 2005 page 281 nevertheless success in anti submarine warfare cannot be measured simply by total of sinkings achieved and australian defenders may have successfully reduced threat to shipping in australian waters by making it harder for japanese submarines to carry out attacks odgers 1968 page 153 see also axis naval activity in
