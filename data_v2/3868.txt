right upright 1 8 thumb sirens and ulysses 1837 442 5 cm by 297 cm 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in sirens and ulysses is a large oil painting on canvas by english artist william etty first exhibited in 1837 it depicts scene from homer s odyssey in which ulysses odysseus resists bewitching song of sirens by having his ship s crew tie him up while they are ordered to block their own ears to prevent themselves from hearing song while traditionally sirens had been depicted as human animal chimeras etty portrayed them as naked young women on an island strewn with decaying corpses painting divided opinion at time of its first exhibition with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant possibly owing to its unusually large size 442 5 cm by 297 cm 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in work initially failed to sell and was bought later that year at a bargain price by manchester merchant daniel grant grant died shortly afterwards and his brother donated sirens and ulysses to royal manchester institution sirens and ulysses was painted using an experimental technique which caused it to begin to deteriorate as soon as it was complete it was shown in a major london exhibition of etty s work in 1849 and at 1857 art treasures exhibition in manchester but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and was placed in gallery s archives restoration began on work in 2003 and in 2010 painting went on display in manchester art gallery over 150 years after being consigned to storage background right upright thumb william etty self portrait 1823 york born william etty 1787 1849 had originally been an apprentice printer in hull but on completing his apprenticeship at age of 18 moved to london to become an artist strongly influenced by works of titian and rubens he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical literary and mythological settings while many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full royal academician in 1828 others condemned content of his work as indecent in his depiction of scene he probably worked from alexander pope s translation their song is death and makes destruction please man whom music wins to stay nigh d shore and listen to lay in verdant meads they sport and wide around lie human bones that whiten all ground ground polluted floats with human gore and human carnage dreadful shore composition and reception right upright 1 4 thumb sirens are similar in appearance and painting probably depicts same model in three different poses alt three naked women with different hair colour but otherwise very similar appearance two hold musical instruments sirens and ulysses shows three sirens singing on an island surrounded by rotting corpses of dead sailors ulysses is visible in background tied to mast of his ship while dark clouds rise in background ulysses appears larger than his fellow sailors while sirens hold out their arms in traditional dramatic poses three sirens are very similar in appearance and etty s biographer leonard robinson believes it likely that etty painted same model in three different poses robinson considers their classical poses to be result of etty s lifelong attendance at academy s life classes where models were always in traditional poses while former curator of york art gallery richard green considers their pose a tribute to nereids in rubens s disembarkation at marseilles a work etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823 physical appearance of sirens is not described in odyssey and traditional greek representation of them was as bird lion or bird human chimeras etty rationalised fully human appearance of his sirens by explaining that their forms became fully human once out of sea an approach followed by a number of later painters of subject etty put a great deal of effort into painting including visiting a mortuary to sketch dead and decaying bodies on sirens island his use of real corpses became publicly known causing complaints from some critics although he visited brighton in 1836 to make studies of sea in connection with painting etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting and painting of sea and clouds is rudimentary in comparison with rest of work painting was etty s largest work to that time measuring 442 5 cm by 297 cm 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in work was completed in 1837 and exhibited at royal academy of arts later that year and hung in academy s new building at trafalgar square now national gallery work and etty s methods in making it divided opinion gentleman s magazine considered it by far finest painting that mr etty has ever painted it is a historical work of first class and abounds with beauties of all kinds while spectator described it as a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity glowing in colour and wonderful in execution but conceived in worst possible taste right upright 1 4 thumb bodies rotting on sirens island were drawn from actual corpses offending some critics alt dead bodies in various stages of decay possibly because of its size sirens and ulysses failed to sell at 1837 summer exhibition in october 1837 wealthy manchester cotton merchant daniel grant an admirer of etty who had already commissioned venus and her doves from him met etty at heaton park races and offered to buy sirens and ulysses and etty s smaller samson betrayed by delilah unseen for a total of ps200 etty was hoping for ps400 for two paintings but on being told by grant that his firm had lost ps100 000 that year offered a price of ps300 for pair grant counter offered ps250 about ps in today s terms which etty refused on leaving at end of evening grant suddenly said will you take money startling etty who in his surprise agreed grant died shortly afterwards leaving painting to his brother william who in turn gave it to royal manchester institution in 1839 etty considered painting to be his best work insisting that it form centrepiece of his 1849 royal society of arts solo exhibition royal manchester institution was concerned that painting would be damaged if moved refusing to allow it to be used in exhibition until etty and a number of influential friends visited manchester to beg them to release it etty died later that year and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity interest in him declined over time and by end of 19th century cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices as it was rarely exhibited sirens and ulysses had little influence on later artists although it is credited as an influence on frederic leighton s 1858 fisherman and syren right upright 1 4 thumb bound ulysses is shown as considerably larger than his crewmates removal and restoration etty had used experimental techniques to make sirens and ulysses using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused paint to dry hard and brittle and to flake off once dry a problem made worse by painting s large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved from moment it was complete it began to deteriorate after it was exhibited at 1857 art treasures exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display and it was placed in long term storage in archives of royal manchester institution and its successor manchester art gallery in mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair sirens and ulysses but an attempt to clean painting unintentionally damaged paint further in 2003 manchester art gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken painting would soon be beyond repair esmee fairbairn foundation and axa art insurance provided funding for restoration a replacement canvas to which painting had been attached in 1930s was removed following this a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore surface of painting and paint added during earlier attempted restoration was removed a new double layer of canvas was added to back of painting and three layers were glued together in 2006 repaired painting was moved back from conservation studios to manchester art gallery gallery nine section of mag was converted into a temporary studio open to public to watch final retouching work until it was completed in 2010 and sirens and ulysses currently hangs in gallery three footnotes references notes
