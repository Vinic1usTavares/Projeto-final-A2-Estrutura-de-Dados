number of deleted scenes from this episode notable cut scenes include michael berating and then apologizing to erin michael making a racist remark about slavery while in character various conference room scenes and extended sequences of members of office playing game in character cultural references wallace alerts office that company s troubles have been published in wall street journal but michael and erin mistake this to mean feelings journal michael listens to lullaby by shawn mullins to soothe himself chun explained that reason song was chosen was because michael would probably have loved top 40 pop from 90s and i figured song would have to be devoid of subtext that s why lullaby felt like a fit when jim lowers volume on michael s computer tell tale click of a mac computer comes out of speakers daniels and chun note that this was intentional and they wanted that specific sound even though windows computers do not make that sound pam s southern accent is compared to fictional character forrest gump after andy successfully does a savannah accent kevin asks him to do swedish chef andy not understanding reference asks what province he is from to which kevin replies that he
