director atom egoyan adapted russell banks novel sweet hereafter and incorporated pied piper of hamelin canadian director atom egoyan adapted screenplay after his wife actress arsinee khanjian suggested he read russell banks sweet hereafter novel is inspired by an incident in alton texas in 1989 in which a bus crash killed 21 students leading to multiple lawsuits egoyan found it initially challenging to acquire rights as they had been optioned to another studio that was not actually producing it shortly before option expired novelist margaret atwood suggested to egoyan that he meet with banks personally after director s success with film exotica 1994 and banks was willing to grant him rights egoyan later stated he was drawn to filming novel because he felt film is for confronting most extreme things as an armenian canadian he also saw story as a metaphor for armenian genocide in which those guilty had not accepted responsibility in adapting novel egoyan changed setting from upstate new york to british columbia to help secure canadian funding he also added references to story of pied piper of hamelin by robert browning to emphasize how egoyan saw sweet hereafter as a grim fairy tale nicole is seen reading pied piper to children who later die in accident in that story pied piper leads all children away never to return after their parents refuse to honour their debt to him egoyan wrote a new stanza in pied piper style for scene in which nicole testifies dolores was speeding in which she describes her father s lips as frozen as winter moon egoyan also made mitchell stephens main character and increased importance of stephens daughter and moved reveal of incest to later in film filming film was shot in british columbia and ontario on a budget of 5 million funding came from company alliance communications egoyan assembled many canadian actors he had worked with in prior films including bruce greenwood gabrielle rose and sarah polley egoyan explained benefit of working with a familiar cast saying when you re working on a limited production schedule it s a comfort to know that you know personalities involved you know what they need as opposed to having to discover that and be surprised by that ian holm was cast as mitchell stephens after actor originally set to play character donald sutherland quit project in casting part egoyan was inspired by holm s strangely compassionate yet furtive and menacing performance in homecoming 1973 holm explained why he accepted role saying it s not often you get offered a leading role at age 65 this is my first in a movie and afterwards said film is very touching and a masterpiece holm called his part challenging as it was his first lead but he found egoyan and canadian actors to be great to work with music pied piper references influenced composer mychael danna s music which uses a persian ney flute along with old instruments such as recorders and lutes creating a pseudo medieval score score thus combined danna s interests in old and exotic music egoyan stated medieval style music was used to make film feel timeless evoking brothers grimm fairy tales and avoiding feel of a tv movie polley s character nicole is an aspiring singer before accident and is seen on stage performing jane siberry s one more colour danna and polley cooperated to create nicole s music with polley writing lyrics to danna s original songs and with danna arranging adaptations of courage and one more colour songs were chosen because of their domestic popularity reinforcing local nature of nicole s music tragically hip s original version of courage also appears in film release film debuted in cannes film festival in may 1997 and went on to play in toronto international film festival telluride
