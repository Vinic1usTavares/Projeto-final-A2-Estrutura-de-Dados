development during production of kabhi alvida naa kehna 2006 tarun mansukhani conceived a film about three friends who share an apartment after production wrapped karan johar told him that mansukhani was ready to direct a film and should write a script if johar liked it he would produce film he set film in miami since he liked its lifestyle and culture people in miami work hard and party harder and i wanted to capture that in my film mansukhani worked for eight months on script johar liked it and asked him about cast in an interview manuskhani described dostana as a story of how three strangers come together live together in an apartment and have their moments of happiness and sorrow director was inspired by his own experiences germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school time friends i have lived in boarding school for most of my childhood and friends that i have today are ones whom i got in touch with during 4th 5th standard i may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom i can call up at 4 am without hesitation manuskhani soon realised that bollywood had explored friendship live in relationships marriage and divorce many times and he wanted to do something different for his debut film he decided to use sexuality to shed light on issue untouched by bollywood for indian audience mansukhani later added gay storyline because he thought it was an issue that needed to be touched on however director did not want film to be serious or preachy i also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it film has a message if you get it great if you don t no problem sit back relax and enjoy film he said about making it a romantic comedy in february 2008 johar announced film s title dostana producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father yash johar asked if his film was also a love triangle he replied well yes and no though it s a love story there s a never before twist in tale all i can say on record is that we ve never had a love triangle like this before gay storyline was not disclosed until trailers were released manan sagar was hired to edit film and duo salim sulaiman composed background score casting abhishek bachchan john abraham and priyanka chopra were cast in lead roles aishwarya rai was originally offered lead role but she refused it because she did not want to end up with another man in her first film with her husband bachchan after their marriage after dostana release she regretted decision saif ali khan refused role of kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife bachchan and rai playing other two leads in early april 2008 shilpa shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of film s songs bachchan said that sam was his most difficult character to play and he worked hard on his gestures and mannerisms i had to work very hard to portray a straight man acting gay it could easily have gone over board i wanted to avoid making character sic barring one portion we kept it controlled bachchan and abraham who had gained weight for their earlier films had to lose weight and become more muscular although chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit she refused to wear a bikini actress said that she did not lose any weight as media speculated but worked out for a toned look in her films she was also filming fashion 2008 at time according to chopra for fashion i had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as character progressed in film my body structure in dostana is more toned than in fashion as it is a completely beach film i ve worked very hard on my body costume design manish malhotra and aki narula designed dostana costumes malhotra for chopra and narula for rest of cast it was malhotra s second time working with chopra first was for andaaz 2003 since film was set in miami he decided on a holiday look chopra s character a fashion editor would wear stylish chic clothes actress had a lot of shorts tank tops tees formal jackets and bikini tops and her wardrobe had a beach vibe malhotra gave her a very young girlie look he designed clean lines with lots of colours toning down chopra s accessories you will notice that none of her dresses have any embroidery or designs either all her outfits are mainly in satin chiffon and georgette designer gave chopra shorts and singlets with loose silhouettes malhotra said that although actress prefers grey black and white he decided to experiment with bright solid colours like ones in citrus family chopra was initially apprehensive about colours but malhotra changed her mind priyanka has worn colour like never before in this film there s lime tangerine cranberry pink yellow purple rainbow he wanted to design swimsuit in a metallic gold or silver he and chopra settled on gold because of her dusky skin which they thought a perfect foil for colour golden swimsuit was created by combining two swimsuits because they were small malhotra attached second one to make swimsuit seen in film although johar and mansukhani wanted chopra to wear a gown for song desi girl malhotra suggested a sari they considered it unsuitable for a character in miami but malhotra said that if they could do a song like desi girl in miami chopra could wear a sari and treat it like a dress they later agreed on sari chopra s only indian costume in film malhotra designed a modern sari giving it a western feel with a long silver sequined skirt and a bikini type blouse designer chose silver because only a silver sari could compete with golden swimsuit unfamiliar with miami culture aki narula spent time there before filming began to learn how miamians dressed and gave bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours according to designer most interesting parts of his styling were matching scarves which resembled extended shirt collars narula gave bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and sunglasses embroidery primarily dragons and palm trees conveyed a tropical summer look narula gave abraham who plays a fashion photographer who works and lives on beach cargo and boxer shorts trunks for swimming scenes and jerseys and football shorts in fabrics he also gave him flip flops canvas shoes and t shirts with slogans such as a use a condom which designer considered important malhotra and narula collaborated on colour palette if manish would give priyanka yellow then i would go for a green for john and a pink for abhishek narula also designed for deol irani kher and mukherjee he chose brands such as dolce gabbana and gucci for deol verve editor giving him sleek suits with short jackets and skinny pants with narrow bottoms kirron kher who played bachchan s mother was styled as a typical punjabi salwar kameez clad woman with gota embroidery for sushmita mukherjee who played chopra s aunt narula chose animal prints and diamonds pearls silver and gold when we shopped for her it was like oh god this is so tacky let s buy it or oh i hate it it ll be fabulous filming principal photography took place over a two month period from mid march to may 2008 in miami dostana art director was amrita mahal mahal assisted sharmishta roy for four years worked with her on kabhi alvida naa kehna and became friends with tarun mansukhani when mansukhani asked her to work on his directorial debut she jumped at opportunity three large sets were created for film in miami apartment verve office and desi girl set smaller sets had simple floor plans types of houses in miami were researched and mahal described them as large and spacious compared to cramped apartments in new york thumb 300px alt aerial view of modern beachfront buildings dostana was filmed almost entirely in miami a three bedroom apartment with an outdoor pool was created and bedrooms were designed to suit their occupants after toying with colours for verve office mahal decided to make it black and used four colours for apartment her team gave furniture a victorian look mahal was pleased with chandeliers which she considered lavish for an office construction of desi girl set last to be built was stressful because of its light generated heat over 100 sketches were drawn to reach final version which used plaster of paris moulding fibre and wood a dance floor was surrounded by tables and chairs for a stage like appearance bose was film s cinematographer according to bose its location was big factor in his work dostana is based in miami and to me miami means sunshine and beaches that is what stayed in my mind bose chose a bright frame because film was a comedy about friendship and bright frame conveyed vibrancy that is what automatically gave dostana its expression he found office set challenging since there was nowhere to put lights and room had glass on one side and a wall on other however bose enjoyed filming on apartment and office sets desi girl was choreographed by farah khan and merchant choreographed other songs item number shut up bounce was shot in miami in early

you have in a long time it s a film with a one point agenda to entertain you while you re in your seat it achieves that no two ways about it sudhish kamath of hindu noted that dostana largely reflects a society in transition and begins to address issues of acceptance within indian framework of marriage dostana is great mass entertainment manipulating inherent homophobia of a country on threshold of change but what s significant is that it will bring parents and children together to share laughs over alternative sexuality and related issues that will no longer remain in closet raja sen of rediff com gave film a mixed review although he found it genuinely entertaining he was disappointed with dostana treatment of homosexuality according to sen it would set an already fragile mindset of indians a decade back in its attitudes we in india haven t yet matured to sensitive normalised portrayals of homosexuality and this film continues to paint them as freaks of nature awards award date category
