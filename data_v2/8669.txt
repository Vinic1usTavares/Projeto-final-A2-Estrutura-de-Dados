supporting his village and a mentor to naruto s son boruto uzumaki kishimoto conceived sasuke as a rival of series title character naruto uzumaki despite sasuke s dark character development later in story kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain he found designing character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him nonetheless kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him in manga s animated adaptations sasuke was voiced by noriaki sugiyama in japanese and yuri lowenthal in english sasuke s character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications his impressive fighting skills plot contribution and rivalry with naruto uzumaki received some praise but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in mold of similar characters from other shonen manga and as exhibiting a cold personality nevertheless sasuke s characterization in latter parts of story and more mature personality in boruto sequels earned further positive comments sasuke has also placed highly in naruto reader popularity polls and has also been subject of studies by scholars character based merchandise including action figures and key chains has been released creation development manga artist masashi kishimoto did not include sasuke uchiha in his original concept for naruto series a story revolving around character naruto uzumaki discussing series future his editor kosuke yahagi advised him to add a rival character for protagonist naruto and he created sasuke character s first name came from sanpei s manga sasuke and sarutobi sasuke a fictional ninja character in japanese children s stories to introduce sasuke kishimoto wrote a chapter that was set before formation of his ninja squad team 7 idea was scrapped yahagi told kishimoto to focus series first two chapters on introducing naruto instead and focus on sasuke and rest of supporting characters were shown in next chapters for first time kishimoto had read a variety of manga to obtain ideas for creation of an effective rivalry between two characters which he incorporated into naruto and sasuke s relationship he was also inspired by his relationship with his twin brother seishi kishimoto since childhood masashi had worried about seishi when he faced failure and had tried to help him to contrast sasuke with naruto kishimoto made him less emotional and depicted him as a cool genius he felt he had created an ideal rivalry in pair and when one character progressed he ensured other did as well kishimoto wanted naruto and sasuke to seem like brothers and rivals building on a mutual experience of childhood loneliness although sasuke does not regard naruto as a worthy opponent at first he is surprised by naruto s growth and becomes fiercely competitive in part i finale their rivalry leads to a fight and they grow further apart kishimoto said he did not want sasuke to recognize naruto as an equal until later in part ii when plot developments made sasuke one of story s antagonists kishimoto called him and naruto yin and yang because of their differences and complementary natures during this period he was asked whether sasuke was good or evil he replied that sasuke was neither and called him a very pure person he said although some of sasuke s actions such as following his clan s ideas were positive his self centeredness tended to cause problems with others since beginning of story s serialization kishimoto planned to conclude series with a fight between sasuke and naruto but he was uncertain whether characters would end up as friends or enemies although both characters had used ninja techniques throughout series kishimoto wanted two fighters to rely on hand to hand combat for climax of their final battle he decided to have naruto forgive sasuke because he had also forgiven nagato another former enemy final fight between sasuke and naruto was considered one biggest challenges by staff from pierrot as it took an entire month to adapt it from manga director hiroyuki yamashita elected himself in charge of battle which left most of anime members relieved due to his experience for scenario pierrot received assistance from cyberconnect2 video game development studio who had already adapted this battle through fighting game naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 4 there was a need to make every movement in fight look realistic giving sasuke a scary look as well as hair movement in order to express idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other which confused some due to naruto s wish to avoid this fate final clash between sasuke s chidori and naruto s rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of series to gave viewer a bigger emotional impact staff noted that following this fight sasuke s face became calmer despite his initial look giving room to explore his redemption kishimoto found sasuke a difficult character to write requiring considerable planning in series finale sasuke leaves on a solo journey kishimoto later stated that in addition to atonement sasuke wants to discover origin of final antagonist but this was not explained in story he planned sasuke and sakura haruno s romance early in naruto production and decided that despite having a good relationship with his allies sasuke would remain a rogue ninja at end of series kishimoto wished to further explore sasuke s role in series after naruto finale he wanted to explain connection between sasuke and sakura in spin off manga naruto seventh hokage and scarlet spring 2015 which focuses on their daughter sarada uchiha despite their separation during sasuke s mission which draws him away from his village story explains bond between three characters kishimoto focused on final scene of uchiha family which he regards as spin off s most important facet because sasuke had few appearances in naruto films kishimoto decided to give him a bigger role in boruto naruto movie 2015 in which he teaches naruto s firstborn child boruto uzumaki a reference to piccolo and gohan in akira toriyama s dragon ball manga series and also depicted in manga boruto naruto next generations 2016 kishimoto identified naruto s fights alongside sasuke against momoshiki as highlights of film and asked that film s staff pay close attention to those sequences two other scenes written by staff which surprised kishimoto were sasuke s use of one of his taijutsu moves and combination of his susanoo technique and naruto s recreation of nine tailed fox studio pierrot design kishimoto regarded sasuke as his most memorable character design because he was developed as naruto s opposite he said design of sasuke and his ability were influenced by character hiei in yoshihiro togashi s manga series yuyu hakusho sasuke originally had necklaces and ties around his arms and legs because kishimoto had a habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis kishimoto simplified design to a basic contrast with naruto s costume one of sasuke and kakashi hatake s best known fighting techniques originally had a different name that kishimoto forgot he found name chidori and its variant lightning blade appropriate kishimoto considered sasuke his most challenging character to design and draw he lacked a clear idea of how his face should look saying sasuke seemed older than naruto his contemporary and felt this inconvenience was a result of his inexperience in drawing characters who were mature beyond their years sasuke s hair which was originally short to save kishimoto time slowly grew longer as series progressed mid way through part i he drew a new costume for sasuke with belts strapped around his arms and legs but he returned to character s original design because it took less time to draw sasuke is his favorite character to draw despite time and energy required and he compared sasuke with sakura in difficulty kishimoto s superiors sometimes asked him to redraw parts of manga that did not illustrate sasuke well kishimoto s design focus for part ii was sasuke s older appearance originally kishimoto had wanted to draw him as a more attractive person but idea was discarded an outfit he initially planned combined younger sasuke s outfit with new more modern clothes kishimoto tried several other looks including use of to evoke antagonist orochimaru and a turtleneck and military uniform to connote cleanliness he avoided second option due to similarities with cold weather clothing and eventually chose japanese clothing and a chokuto sword for last naruto movie kishimoto gave sasuke a new young adult design with sharper facial features in contrast with older naruto who cut his hair sasuke s hairstyle grew longer to cover part of character s face in original concept hair hid sasuke s mysterious left eye according to kishimoto he decided to give character a large hood because sasuke concealed his identity during events
