began development in 1997 when universal pictures and dreamworks bought film rights to a concept pitched by scott mitchell rosenberg former president at malibu comics which he described as a graphic novel in development they hired steve oedekerk to write and direct film which oedekerk planned to do after completing nutty professor ii klumps rosenberg who formed platinum studios to pursue adapting cowboys aliens and other malibu comics properties into film and television joined as a producer by 1998 oedekerk left project to pursue a remake of 1964 film incredible mr limpet with jim carrey by 2004 film rights were acquired by columbia pictures who did not move project beyond development in 2006 rosenberg published cowboys aliens as a graphic novel in following year universal and dreamworks partnered again to adapt cowboys aliens into a film in june 2008 robert downey jr entered negotiations to star in film as zeke jackson a former union army gunslinger while downey jr was making iron man 2 he told director jon favreau about cowboys aliens favreau investigated project and in september 2009 he joined as director downey jr left project in january 2010 to star in sherlock holmes a game of shadows and later in month daniel craig was hired to replace him favreau said craig s portrayal of james bond brings a certain virtuosity he also described craig on one hand he s like this jason bourne type a leading man who s also a lethal character but on other hand he s also got a lot of humanity and vulnerability to him thumb left alt a brown leather fedora style hat type of fedora worn by ford in indiana jones films in april 2010 harrison ford was cast alongside craig favreau had cast craig and ford in film because they were actors who suited action adventure roles so characters would be less seen as comedic director compared ford in particular with john wayne in having a sense of history with actor and role before cowboys aliens ford had previously acted in western films a time for killing 1967 journey to shiloh 1969 and frisco kid 1979 while ford is well known for playing indiana jones filmmakers wanted to avoid giving him a cowboy hat that would remind audiences too much of jones writer alex kurtzman said we needed to make sure that no pun intended we tipped a hat to iconography of harrison ford and also presented audience with a very different version olivia wilde was cast in one of lead roles and favreau called wilde s character key to film sam rockwell was cast in a supporting role as doc character was described as a large mexican in original script but when favreau and writers learned of rockwell s interest in film they reconceived and expanded role favreau himself is known for appearing in his films but for cowboys aliens he chose not to make a cameo appearance because he thought it would affect tone of film however his face does appear on a wanted poster as todd kravitz in scene establishing craig as lonergan when asked about how film was developing rosenberg stated it s incredible sometimes it s like seeing exactly what was going through my head when i first had that spark in my head as a kid jon favreau s bringing his own talent and vision with adaptation but at same time it remains true to what i was really trying to get at in original story interview scott rosenberg on platinum studios cowboys aliens and future of comic book industry by nicholas steven spielberg one of film s executive producers visited director and writers during pre production to look over script and artwork he provided favreau with a collection of classic western films spielberg also invited director and writers to a private screening of several western films and provided live commentary on how to make one properly films included stagecoach my darling clementine and destry rides again spielberg made several other suggestions a main enemy alien jake s final use of gauntlet being to decapitate an alien favreau 1 37 20 and that jake and ella s first kiss should occur in climax of film favreau 1 40 45 writing in film s period as a developing project under several studios different versions of screenplay were drafted by numerous screenwriters beginning with steve oedekerk other screenwriters involved included david hayter thomas dean donnelly joshua oppenheimer jeffrey boam thompson evans and chris when universal and dreamworks re partnered in 2007 they hired hawk ostby and mark fergus in 2009 ostby and fergus were replaced by alex kurtzman roberto orci and damon lindelof kurtzman and orci analyzed american western films including searchers orci said first draft was very kind of jokey and broad and then it went very serious you kind of swing back and forth between two extremes and tone until you find exact right point where a western and a sci fi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural imagine you re watching unforgiven and then aliens land orci explained orci also said comic has themes of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has setting of that specific time period so we kept inspiration from all of that in terms of specifics of story and who these characters are we wanted audience to be surprised and to not feel like they ve already seen everything if they were fans of comic so while themes and setting and many of elements are a great inspiration story is completely adapted and translated for live action aliens were loosely based on gods of s interpretation of babylonian religion who have a distinct interest in gold filming cowboys aliens was not originally planned to be shown in 3 d when approached with idea by dreamworks favreau was not interested stating that westerns should be shot only on film as opposed to being shot digitally which is required for modern 3d technology and didn t want it to be converted after filming that would be like filming in black and white and it he reasoned director of photography matthew libatique shot cowboys aliens in anamorphic format on 35 mm film to further a classic movie feel on a budget of 163 million principal photography for cowboys aliens began at albuquerque studios in new mexico on june 30 2010 one of filming locations was plaza blanca white place where western films like missing 3 10 to yuma city slickers young guns and legend of lone ranger had been filmed sound stage work took place in los angeles with additional location shooting at california filming finished on september 30 a scene in which craig s character rides a horse alongside a ravine and jumps down it onto a spacecraft emulated many scenes in american western films where cowboys rode along a moving train and jumped on it favreau said scene referenced one in film raiders of lost ark 1981 where indiana jones chases a truck and noted that a similar scene existed in film stagecoach 1939 saying we re constantly referencing back to our roots cowboys aliens also make multiple references to close encounters of third kind such as introduction to aliens through bright lights on their 0 28 30 0 29 30 and an upturned paddle steamer in middle of desert favreau 0 44 00 film also tease s monster movies and scenes in paddle steamer were a deliberate homage to alien design and effects scott chambliss was hired as production designer based on his work on star trek produced by orci and kurtzman visual effects were created by industrial light magic ilm represented by roger guyett and eddie as visual effects supervisors under supervision of shane mahan legacy effects created practical puppet aliens and full scale alien speeders new deal studios constructed a miniature of paddle steamer that is seen upturned in film kerner optical built a miniature of alien ship and bluescreen stand ins film also featured visual effects by fuel vfx embassy ghost and shade vfx with previsualization from entertainment favreau noted that cowboys aliens focuses on a specific aspect of alien genre which primarily revolves around films of 1980s and although we have quite a bit of cg i like way they told stories before before you could show everything with cg and it was a real unveiling of creature little by little and using lighting and camera work and music to make it a very subjective experience and so we tried to preserve that here in designing film s aliens ilm was careful to make creatures cool and captivating guyett stated that they adopted a similar approach to that of district 9 thumb alt a reptilian creature in a desert landscape impaled by multiple arrows having wounds secreting a dark colored blood and growing a yellow fungus an alien with wounds covered in a yellow fungus details such as this were created to depict creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place use of anamorphic widescreen rather than shooting full frame flat and cropping later gave ilm no extra room to re frame shots it was a challenge to show both nine foot tall aliens and smaller humans in same space instead guyett said they shot more areas in case portions of shots were lost in filming gun battle between cowboys and aliens in which aliens move at twice speed of humans actors were required to ride through scene on horseback and shoot at men in gray suits and three foot tall hats they aimed at faces drawn by jon favreau on top of hats a big challenge for ilm s texture artists was to show aliens in both a dark cave environment and harsh sunlight creatures were rendered in high resolution for close ups dirt and wounds were added to aliens to emphasize injuries they sustained in battle after favreau requested that aliens experience a very unpleasant biological reaction to being wounded on earth texture team created a yellow fungus like look on scars of aliens to design fungus texture supervisor martin murphy searched internet for real pictures of mold and growth on trees and eventually designed a fried egg pattern heads of aliens were based on those of sea turtles after favreau encountered sea turtles during a trip to hawaii at suggestion of steven spielberg an uber alien was also designed it was unclear if red scar jake gives uber alien after escaping vivisection would be enough of an identifier to distinguish it from other aliens so creature was redesigned with translucent pale skin due to lack of time spent outside favreau described uber alien as more fleshy and anthropomorphic than other 1 44 45 1 45 27 and murphy commented there are some parts of him like his arm that you can see into it s almost like glass or ice or surface that blends into a dryer area there s pieces of him that are more like a soft shell crab or shiny and wet in addition to aliens other visual effects were required for speeders alien spaceship its interior environment re creations and head up display for jake s arm gauntlet for invasion of town of absolution both practical laser lighting and fire effects were utilized along with practical ships and effects enhancements ilm artists had to enhance initial look of alien bolos cables used to abduct people with renderings such as extra lights after viewers thought studio had failed to paint out cables in film s first trailer for a scene in which jake and ella ride on a speeder actors were filming on a practical mock up against bluescreen they were digitally replaced in wider shots themes in cowboys aliens director jon favreau sought a plausible approach to how humans from late 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry he said it was very well laid out well planned and there were a lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient so we made sure we earned each step director also sought to maintain a western tone as aliens appeared in film saying it s very easy to just cut string and then all of a sudden action starts and you re in independence day favreau cited works of john ford and sergio leone as sources of inspiration as well as butch cassidy and sundance kid favreau also wanted science fiction element to stand on its own referencing alien predator and close encounters of third kind he said of both genres it s about finding intersection of those two genres if you do it right it honors both and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand conventions of instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you ve seen before in americas native american nations were severely damaged by european settlers specifically because of europeans advanced military technology favreau compared film to historical confrontation in frustration of not having technology to allow you to prevail it s always low tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side in film cowboys are low tech culture and aliens with advanced technology possess belief of manifest destiny favreau also said of premise it allows cowboys and native americans to come together which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy it sets western up in a very classic way and then turns it on its ear when aliens appear film becomes a road movie in which main characters try to track aliens team up with different groups and ultimately confront aliens favreau compared gathering to magnificent seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation character of meacham also presents an unconventional take on christian principles to support film s main theme of redemption according to favreau meacham s teaching doc how to shoot not only references similar scenes in other westerns but also teach es him how to be a person favreau 0 46 40 meacham s dying words to jake god don t care who you were son only who you are speaks of central theme of redemption favreau 0 52 50 0 53 20 hummingbird that jake sees at various points in film is a good spirit that could represent either alice or ella an alternate theory is that ella was an angel that helped jake get over alice favreau 1 50 45 1 51 20 favreau also suggested a back story to cowboys aliens uber alien is mastermind of invasion all other aliens are worker bees possibly genetically engineered by another species of aliens that remained on their home planet and sent worker bees as conquistadors marketing thumb right 250px harrison ford jon favreau daniel craig and olivia wilde promoting film at 2010 san diego comic con cowboys aliens which crosses genres with american western element of cowboys and science fiction element of extraterrestrials has an inherently comic title and premise at san diego comic con international in july 2010 director jon favreau hosted a presentation and was accompanied by film s primary cast members including harrison ford in his first comic con appearance in presentation favreau explained to audiences that he intended film as a serious mix of western styles of sergio leone and john ford and really scary science fiction like alien and predator first trailer for film appeared in following november and new york times reported that film audiences found premise comedic eddie egan president of marketing at universal pictures acknowledged misconception and said trailer is first very public step in reconciling tone of movie with more immediate effect of title on its own studio anticipated a marketing campaign that would demonstrate that film is a tough minded adventure like unforgiven by clint eastwood during super bowl xlv on 2011 studio aired a tv spot for cowboys aliens hours before american football game favreau used twitter to link followers to spot online entertainment weekly reported it roused geek hive fan base and stirred new speculation about his hybrid of classic westerns and extraterrestrial invasion thrillers after spot aired favreau said first trailer was intended as an introduction to pique people s curiosity and that super bowl tv spot was showing more of sense of adventure as things unfold in april 2011 favreau and roberto orci appeared at wondercon in san francisco where they presented nine minutes of film footage and answered questions about film favreau explained that marketing would show only a brief glimpse of aliens of title before film is released he explained withholding of certain elements i think there are enough visionary people involved with this film that there is an understanding that there is a personality that marketing campaign can take on as well as film itself i want to make sure that if audience goes to see film there is going to be a lot of surprises in it that they haven t seen in marketing materials release cowboys aliens had its world premiere at san diego comic con international in san diego on 2011 it was commercially released in united states and canada on 2011 and in other territories in ensuing weekends paramount pictures international also released film in imax theaters around world as it did for favreau s previous film iron man 2 box office mojo forecast that cowboys aliens would gross total in united states and canada for comparatively low figure website cited that marketing had not contextualized film effectively and that hybridized western films like jonah hex and wild wild west were not successful at box office in territories outside united states and canada website forecast total citing that american western films are not historically popular but that premise of alien invasion and presence of international stars like daniel craig and harrison ford would generate interest in contrast box office tracker paul dergarabedian said film s combination of cowboy and extraterrestrial themes in particular would attract audiences dergarabedian also believed that audiences familiarity with craig as character james bond would help film box office on opening day of cowboys aliens estimates showed that its opening day gross was 13 0 million and it came in second place to smurfs opening day gross of 13 3 million this was considered a surprise since cowboys aliens was expected to be clear winner for weekend box office update smurfs stuns cowboys aliens with 13 3 mil on friday and potter prepares to hit 1 billion worldwide estimates then showed cowboys aliens and smurfs tied at 1 spot for weekend with 36 2 million each box office report it s a tie cowboys aliens and smurfs both open to 36 2 mil however when actual results for weekend were announced cowboys aliens won weekend with 36 4 million just beating out smurfs which grossed 35 6 million film

film was a financial disappointment with los angeles times listing film in 2014 as one of most expensive box office flops of all time eller claudia costliest box office flops of all time los angeles times january 15 2014 critical reception cowboys aliens received mixed reviews from critics on rotten tomatoes film has an approval rating of 45 based on 250 reviews with an average rating of 5 59 10 site s critical consensus reads daniel craig and harrison ford are as dependably appealing as ever but they re let down by director jon favreau s inability to smooth cowboys aliens jarring tonal shifts on metacritic film has a score of 50 out of 100 based 41 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter praised film saying it sounds kooky on paper but on screen cowboys and aliens make beautiful fun music together honeycutt felt that success of film s blend of aliens and western themes was due to determination by everyone involved to play damn thing straight even slightest goofiness tiniest touch of camp and whole thing would blow sky high but it doesn t he criticized aliens which he said don t rate as characters existing as moving blobs you shoot at in a video game varietys peter debruge echoed honeycutt s sentiments that potential hamminess of premise is offset by cast particularly craig through a mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity he considered however that wilde had opposite effect stating she appears out of place among her grizzled co stars debruge appreciated attention paid to roots of two genres saying beneath all state of art special effects beats an old fashioned heart one that prizes both of genres in play and concluded that a canny blend of cg and practical effects serve sci fi elements well while location shooting and mary zophres form fitting period duds make west look its best nick pinkerton of village voice said western elements of film were lovingly handled but felt science aspects a gimmick and much more standard fare in comparison he added that ford enlivened by dude garb seems to enjoy himself in front of a camera for first time in decades roger ebert gave film three stars out of four writing that as preposterous moneymakers go it s ambitious and well made acting from large cast is of a high standard craig and ford were more or less born into their roles and director jon favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do instead of posing them in front of special effects he lamented however that film was not a pure western saying of aliens t here is more genuine suspense when percy dolarhyde starts shooting up town than when countless aliens appear salons andrew o hehir offered a mixed response claiming film to be well made and clever and singling out craig and ford for their performances o hehir was however critical of combination of western and science fiction elements calling it a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot em up slants nick schager reacted negatively stating cowboys aliens mashes up genres with a staunch dedication to getting everything wrong making sure that each scene is more inane than one that preceded it giving film one star out of four schager continued cowboys western accoutrements are so false as to be stunning with every steely eyed glare from craig s man with no memory every confrontation between his jake and ford s grizzled dolarhyde and every silhouetted horseback ride across a sunset range seeming like a wan approximation of a familiar genre staple favreau s visuals have an inauthentic and bland blockbuster sheen and his actors are similarly afflicted with a case of poseur itis craig s affected silent type glowering ford s gruff racism or wilde s blank wide eyed stares failing to deliver a single believable line reading or gesture one minor criticism is that story line did not include appearance of buffalo soldiers african american us cavalry which were present in arizona and new mexico during time period that film is set it would have made an interesting sub plot to see how different groups ie townspeople apaches outlaws and african american soldiers would have interacted among themselves working together to fight a common enemy accolades cowboys aliens received five
