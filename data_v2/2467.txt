william herschel telescope wht is a optical near infrared reflecting telescope located at observatorio del roque de los muchachos on island of la palma in canary islands spain telescope which is named after william herschel is part of isaac newton group of telescopes it is funded by research councils from united kingdom netherlands and spain at time of construction in 1987 wht was third largest single optical telescope in world bta 6 6 0 m and hale telescope 5 1 m were both larger multiple mirror telescope also had a larger collecting area but did not have a single primary mirror it is currently second largest in europe neighbouring gran telescopio canarias 10 4 m overtook wht in 2009 to become largest in europe and was final telescope constructed by grubb parsons in their 150 year history wht is equipped with a wide range of instruments operating over optical and near infrared regimes these are used by professional astronomers to conduct a wide range of astronomical research astronomers using telescope discovered first evidence for a supermassive black hole sgr a at centre of milky way and made first optical observation of a gamma ray burst telescope has 75 clear nights with a median seeing of 0 7 history wht was first conceived in late 1960s when anglo australian telescope aat was being designed british astronomical community saw need for telescopes of comparable power in northern hemisphere in particular there was a need for optical follow up of interesting sources in radio surveys being conducted at jodrell bank and mullard observatories both located in uk which could not be done from southern hemisphere location of aat aat was completed in 1974 at which point british science and engineering research council began planning for a group of three telescopes located in northern hemisphere now known as isaac newton group of telescopes ing telescopes were to be a which became jacobus kapteyn telescope isaac newton telescope which was to be moved from its existing site at herstmonceux castle and a 4m class telescope initially planned as a a new site was chosen at an altitude of on island of la palma in canary islands that is now observatorio del roque de los muchachos project was led by royal greenwich observatory rgo who also operated telescopes until control passed to an independent ing when rgo closed in 1998 by 1979 4 m was on verge of being scrapped due to a ballooning budget whilst aperture had been reduced to a panel known as tiger team was convened to reduce cost a re design cut price tag by 45 savings were primarily made by reducing focal length of telescope which allowed use of a smaller dome and relocating non essential functions outside dome to a simpler and thus cheaper rectangular annexe in same year isaac newton telescope was moved to roque de los muchachos observatory becoming first of isaac newton group of telescopes in 1981 nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek netherlands organization for scientific research nwo bought a 20 stake in project allowing wht to be given go ahead that year was 200th anniversary of discovery of uranus by william herschel and it was decided to name telescope in his honour construction of telescope was by grubb parsons last telescope that company produced in its 150 year history work began at their workshop in newcastle upon tyne in 1983 and telescope was shipped to la palma in 1985 two other telescopes of isaac newton group began operating in 1984 wht saw first light on 1 june 1987 it was third largest optical telescope in world at time total cost of telescope including dome and full initial suite of instruments was ps15m in 1984 equivalent to psm in within budget once inflation is taken into account design left thumb william herschel telescope inside its dome two black tubes are light baffles two large enclosures on left and right are nasmyth platforms instruments at cassegrain focus are visible at base and three black boxes in centre house calibration lamps located at folded cassegrain alt white metal truss frame inside white dome atop a circular base and flanked by two rectangular boxes on either side optics telescope consists of a f 2 5 primary mirror made by owens illinois from a zero expansion glass ceramic material and ground by grubb parsons mirror blank was produced in 1969 as one of a set of four along with those for aat and blanco telescopes and was purchased for wht in 1979 ten years after it was made primary is solid and un thinned so no active optics system is required despite its weight of mirror support cell holds main mirror on a set of 60 pneumatic cylinders even under most extreme loading with telescope pointing at horizon so mirror is vertical shape of mirror changes by only during normal operation deformation is much smaller in its most usual configuration a hyperbolic secondary mirror made of is used to form a ritchey chretien f 11 cassegrain system with a 15 arcmin field of view an additional flat fold mirror allows use of any one of two nasmyth platforms or two folded cassegrain stations each with 5 arcmin fields of view telescope sometimes operates in a wide field prime focus configuration in which case secondary is removed and a three element field correcting lens inserted which provides an effective f 2 8 focus with a 60 arcmin field of view 40 arcmin changing between cassegrain and nasmyth foci takes a matter of seconds and may be done during night switching to and from prime focus requires replacing secondary mirror with a prime focus assembly during daytime two are mounted back to back which takes around 30 minutes a coude focus was planned as a later addition to feed an optical interferometer with another telescope but this was never built a chopping f 35 secondary mirror was planned for infrared observations but was placed on hold by cost saving re design and never implemented mount optical system weighs and is manoeuvred on an alt azimuth mount with a total moving mass of plus instruments bta 6 and multi mirror telescope had demonstrated during 1970s significant weight and therefore cost savings which could be achieved by alt azimuth design compared to traditional equatorial mount for large telescopes however alt azimuth design requires continuous computer control compensation for field rotation at each focus and results in a 0 2 degree radius blind spot at zenith where drive motors cannot keep up with sidereal motion drives have a maximum speed of one degree per second in each axis mount is so smooth and finely balanced that before drive motors were installed it was possible to move then assembly by hand during closed loop guiding mount is capable of an absolute pointing accuracy of 0 03 arcseconds dome thumb right wht dome above a sea of clouds alt aerial view of white domed building on side of mountain with floor of white clouds extending to horizon below and behind mountain telescope is housed in an onion shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of manufactured by brittain steel telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that centre of rotation is above ground level which lifts telescope above ground layer air turbulence for better seeing a conventional up down 6m wide shutter with wind blind several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control and a capacity crane used for moving primary mirror e g for are all incorporated size and shape of shutter allow observations down to 12deg above horizon which corresponds to an airmass of 4 8 total moving mass of dome is which is mounted on top of a three storey cylindrical building dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations driven down into volcanic basalt to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on building affecting telescope pointing attached to dome is a three storey rectangular building which houses telescope control room computer room kitchen etc almost no human presence is required inside dome which means environmental conditions can be kept very stable as a result wht obtains perfect dome seeing this building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant because wht has largest single mirror at observatorio del roque de los muchachos its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel large enough to accommodate mirrors from any other telescope on mountain as a result all of other telescopes at observatory contract to use wht plant for their realuminising with exception of gran telescopio canarias which has its own plant operations thumb 300px right part of roque de los muchachos observatory

funding is provided by uk s science and technology facilities council stfc 65 netherlands nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek nwo 25 and spain s instituto de astrofisica de canarias iac 10 2008 values telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding although spain receives an additional 20 allocation in return for use of observatory site five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities as a competitive research telescope wht is heavily oversubscribed typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available vast majority of observations are carried out in visitor mode i e with investigating astronomer physically present at telescope a shift to service mode operations those carried out by observatory staff on behalf of astronomers who do not travel to telescope has been considered and rejected on scientific and operational grounds instruments wht is equipped with a wide range of scientific instruments providing astronomers with capabilities to conduct a large variety of scientific investigations current common user instrumentation is auxiliary

visitor instruments which in recent years have included pns integral sauron and visitor instruments can use either cassegrain focus or one of nasmyth foci a common set of calibration lamps helium and neon arc lamps and a tungsten flat field lamp are permanently mounted at one of broken cassegrain foci and can be used for any of other instruments isis and liris are workhorses of wht and approximately two thirds of all time awarded is for these two instruments scientific research thumb right peter jenniskens with a fragment of 2008 an asteroid observed by wht just days earlier alt low angle picture from ground showing sand and a large rock with a man looming a few feet back against a blue sky astronomers use wht to conduct scientific research across most branches of observational astronomy including solar system science galactic astronomy extragalactic astronomy and cosmology most of instruments are designed to be useful for a range of different research wht has been used to make many significant new discoveries some of more notable include first evidence of a supermassive black hole sgr a at centre of milky way in 1995 and first optical observation of a gamma ray burst in 1997 since mid 1990s wht has faced increasing competition from newer telescopes nevertheless a wide range of research continues to be done with telescope in recent years this has included sauron project an integral field spectrograph survey of nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies 2001 2010 first spectrum of an asteroid which subsequently hit earth 2009 first spectrum of s 2009 discovery
