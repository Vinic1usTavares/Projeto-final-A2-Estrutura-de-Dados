would slowly unravel with each of its appearances it was first holonovel to be featured in series taylor originally imagined program as a simulation of western fiction in which janeway assumed role of a pioneer emigrating to american west on a covered wagon janeway s character was described as a wife and mother struggling with daily tasks and was presented as polar opposite of janeway s position as a starfleet captain taylor described western concept as a metaphor for captain s predicament in delta quadrant and a method of developing and enhancing janeway s character plan was subsequently abandoned after mulgrew disliked working with horses and estimates for developing and filming each scene ranged up to an additional 100 000 per day taylor said it was not a prudent decision to keep western concept considering show s budget and difficulty in shooting outdoor locations as a result concept of janeway lambda one was changed to be a work of gothic fiction set in 1840s england poe

s director winrich kolbe collaborated with visual effects producer dan curry to create gothic novel setting through use of second unit blue screen sequences in episode s pre production meeting kolbe and taylor met with special effects coordinator dick brownfield and unit production manager brad to finalize set design and to clarify special effects their discussion covered minor actions and effects such as how much rainwater would be coming through an open window and whether or not raindrops on janeway s clothing would disappear when simulation ended poe 1998 p 20 kolbe meticulously planned actors performances in teaser sequence such as researching proper way of pouring and serving tea according to 1840s customs according to poe attention to such small details in script was common in production of star trek episodes according to script for eye of needle holodeck program occurred in a drawing room in an english lord s nineteenth century manor script for cathexis mentions

1994 on paramount stage 16 set s construction pushed episode s cost over its budget this was considered normal for a new series and next four episodes also exceeded their budgets poe 1998 p 25 despite high cost of manor set crew designed it for repeated use over course of series this was more appealing than shooting several sequences of a covered wagon on location in countryside curry took special care to merge blue screen effects with kolbe s footage seamlessly to achieve effect of manor transforming back into holodeck curry and kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects cast response and abandonment studio executives and show s crew were skeptical about taylor s plans for janeway lambda one ron wilkerson who wrote learning curve with jean

altman 1996 p 145 persistence of vision episode in which holonovel was most heavily featured was initially met with resistance from paramount pictures executives taylor attempted to include episode in show s first season but idea was rejected on basis of its story and script form studio executives felt episode was a very soft story that lacked action or a clear antagonist and believed it would not hold an audience s attention gross altman 1996 p 159 while discussing janeway s fight with templeton seymour said writers were uncertain of how to further develop her character and viewed scene as an example of how t hey got carried away seymour said that janeway killed templeton in original draft of fight scene but this was removed as she couldn t do that because she s never killed anyone poe cited janeway lambda one as an example of an idea that sounded good in theory that didn t work out in practice storyline was abandoned since everyone disliked it taylor reported that fans lack of interest and criticism of janeway portrayed in role of a servant or subordinate resulted in holonovel being discontinued seymour attributed storyline s removal to decision to avoid excessive use of holodeck taylor wrote a conclusion for novel which was never developed into an episode and she was disappointed that narrative was left incomplete despite her attachment to project she said that she was never afraid to cut our losses if something wasn t working holonovel was replaced by janeway seeking counsel from a holographic version of leonardo da vinci in her book star trek media studies

janeway decides to take a break from fantasy and holodeck thematic analysis thumb analysis of janeway lambda one revolved around its representation of captain kathryn janeway played by kate mulgrew pictured in 2007 alt a woman with shoulder length brown hair and a dark dress stands in front of a clapping man while looking forward taylor developed janeway lambda one as a space for janeway to experience a life separate from responsibilities of being a captain she said janeway focused more on using holodeck to care for a family rather than satisfy an intellectual curiosity about a period of history commentators have contrasted holonovel with other characters use of holodeck murray 1997 p 16 academic janet horowitz murray cited janeway s appreciation of gothic novel with captain jean luc picard s patrick stewart s interest in film noir lieutenant commander data s brent spiner identification with sherlock holmes and dr julian bashir s alexander siddig preference for james bond murray wrote that unlike men who find enjoyment in violent conflict s that are resolved within a single star trek episode janeway immerses herself in domestic chores without pursuing a narrative with constant action a bowdoin van riper a historian specializing in modern science and technology wrote that janeway lambda one was only time a holonovel used by a woman was shown on screen and identified janeway as only starfleet officer whose fantasies are of home hearth and children taylor attributed holonovel specifically in persistence of vision as allowing janeway to move forward from her engagement to her fiancee mark johnson stan iver in regards to janeway s personal life taylor said we cannot put her into romantic situations until she decides he has given her up for dead and moved on and only wise thing for her to do is same dillard sackett 1996 p 218 van riper cited janeway as part of a trend in which fictional female captions recreate home and hearth on high seas by forming and maintaining committed romantic relationships murray interpreted her romance with fictional lord burleigh as a serious exercise posing psychological and moral questions for audience and characters to explore during episodes she likened janeway with character jane eyre based on their strong resistance to being bullied a willingness to stand on principle and courage to face fear and isolation head on referring to janeway as a person of victorian integrity murray 1997 p 25 murray described holonovel as opening a channel of exploration that brings her benefit of self knowledge in order to return her to real world all stronger murray 1997 p 26 critical reception janeway lambda one was panned by television critics a v club s brandon nowalk viewed janeway s holonovel as unsuccessful and called lord burleigh a holographic irish bodice ripper stereotype in his book a critical history of doctor who on television john kenneth muir compared show s allusions to jane eyre to those shown on british science fiction television series doctor who muir criticized holonovel as essentially a time waster that serves no dramatic or character purpose except to enlighten viewer that janeway likes victorian novels while muir praised doctor who for immersing its characters in victorian time period he felt that davenport narrative was kept separate from rest of narrative and characters muir 2007 p 315 io9 s james whitbrook ranked janeway lambda one as number nine on its list of recurring star trek holodeck programs and described it as dull as critics were divided on how holonovel fit into janeway s role as a female captain whitbrook considered subplot to be an excuse to portray mulgrew out of her starfleet uniform trektoday s michelle erica green dismissed holonovel as a failed assertion that janeway was not just a captain she s a woman writing that it invoked all sorts of ugly cliches about how women secretly want to be swept off their feet by men who consider themselves their superiors she criticized janeway s investment in holonovel over leading her crew and questioned her portrayal in show s early seasons as isolating herself on holodeck and holding junior officers at arm s length in response to a fan s criticism that janeway was too busy prancing around in frilly dresses on holodeck to be an effective captain tor com s sara eileen haines responded wait janeway wears frilly dresses wait you mean janeway was a girl under that uniform american studies professor katja kanzler interpreted holonovel as show s way of adding ultra traditional images of femininity to its ultra authoritative female captain kanzler recommended that janeway should be seen a work in progress and a project in which authors test and playfully combine different narratives of gender power and social interaction kanzler 2004 p 180 show s expansion of holodeck technology received negative feedback national reviews jonah goldberg wrote that frequent use of holodeck was an outrage seemingly conceived for actors and costume designers to indulge themselves at audience s expense nowalk described various appearances of holodeck in voyager as representing how writers were fascinated with concerned by and curious about virtual reality in early days of internet murray expanded on theoretical physicist lawrence m krauss determination that creating tactile simulations through holodeck is an example of unrealistic technology to write that janeway would have been unable to drink tea and hug lord burleigh in reality green was critical of how holodeck technology was written as a means for personal gratification rather than as a space to further develop a skill or hobby references citations book sources external links category fictional software category gothic fiction
