thumb alt view of right side of mummy mummy in top view thumb alt close up of skin impressions skin impression from abdomen of mummy edmontosaurus mummy amnh 5060 is an exceptionally well preserved fossil of a dinosaur in collection of american museum of natural history amnh discovered in 1908 in united states near lusk wyoming it was first dinosaur specimen found to include a skeleton encased in skin impressions from large parts of body it is ascribed to species edmontosaurus annectens originally known as trachodon annectens a hadrosaurid duck billed dinosaur mummy was found by fossil hunter charles hazelius sternberg and his three sons in lance formation although sternberg was working under contract to british museum of natural history henry fairfield osborn of amnh managed to secure mummy osborn described fossil in detail in 1912 coining name dinosaur mummy for it several dinosaur mummies of similar preservation have been discovered since then this specimen has considerably influenced scientific conception of hadrosaurids skin impressions found in between fingers were once interpreted as interdigital webbing bolstering now rejected perception of hadrosaurids as aquatic animals a hypothesis that remained unchallenged until 1964 today mummy is considered one of most important fossils of amnh mummy was discovered lying on its back its neck twisted backwards and its forelimbs outstretched skeleton is complete save tail hind feet and hind portion of pelvis all bones are preserved and still connected to each other almost two thirds of skin is preserved delicate for size of animal skin includes two different types of non overlapping scales that were between in diameter in contrast with other similar dinosaur mummies skin of amnh 5060 was tightly attached to bones and partially drawn into body interior indicating that carcass dried out before burial specimen would thus constitute fossil of a natural mummy after dehydration mummy likely would have been rapidly buried by a meandering river with bacteria consolidating surrounding sediments resulting in its excellent preservation discovery thumb alt photograph showing excavation in badlands only known photograph of mummy s excavation wyoming 1908 mummy was discovered and excavated in 1908 by charles hazelius sternberg and his three sons george charles jr and levi an independent fossil collector sternberg earned a living by selling his finds to museums in north america and europe sons worked as assistants for their father and later became renowned paleontologists early in 1908 sternberg planned an expedition to lance creek area in eastern wyoming where family had not worked before in search of of potential fossil finds he wrote to british museum of natural history that he knew where in wyoming to find a skull of horned dinosaur triceratops knowing that museum was lacking a good specimen museum agreed to buy any good fossil finds if such were made sternbergs left their family residence in kansas in early spring and arrived in lance creek area in july sternberg s plan foresaw exploration of an uninhabited area of approximately north to north platte river and south to cheyenne river in converse county today niobrara county predominant badlands of this area expose sedimentary rocks of maastrichtian stage of upper cretaceous which today are known as lance formation area had already been intensively explored by paleontological expeditions before start of his expedition sternberg learned that american museum of natural history had been unsuccessfully working in area for years although party was enthusiastic sternberg s sons had never discovered dinosaur fossils before first weeks of search were unsuccessful sternberg wrote in his 1909 book life of a fossil hunter at end of august sternberg finally discovered a fossil horn weathering out of rock subsequent excavation revealed a long triceratops skull soon after george oldest son found bones sticking out of rock while prospecting new territory with levi youngest son levi discovered more bones nearby apparently belonging to same skeleton by then group had travelled from their base camp and food was running short sternberg instructed george and levi to carefully remove sandstone above skeleton and sternberg himself set off for lusk with charles jr to purchase new supplies and to initiate shipping of triceratops skull to british museum third day after their father s departure george and levi recognized that they had found an apparently complete skeleton lying on its back when removing a large piece of sandstone from chest region of specimen george discovered to his surprise a perfectly preserved skin impression in 1930 george remembered thumb left alt photograph showing mummy on exhibit at american museum of natural history in 2008 mummy on exhibit in american museum of natural history 2008 when sternberg finally returned at fifth day george and levi had run out of food and had eaten only potatoes for last two days nevertheless they had exposed skeleton dig measured in width in length and in depth when paleontologist henry fairfield osborn manager of american museum of natural history learned about new find he immediately sent staff member and paleontologist albert thomson to attempt to secure it for museum osborn knew about agreement between sternberg and british museum which gave latter rights to acquire any of finds he appealed to sternberg s patriotism and promised permanent exhibition of fossil when thomson arrived he was unable to evaluate fossil as it had already been wrapped in burlap and shellac for transport yet asking price of 2 000 was high on same day as thomson william jacob holland director of carnegie museum of natural history arrived at lusk osborn now worried about losing his opportunity quickly acquired specimen for an unknown sum at american museum preparation of skin impressions was completed by preparator otto subsequently mummy was scientifically described by osborn himself and famous paleontologist barnum brown in three articles published in 1911 and 1912 and afterwards was put on display in exhibition mummy protected by a glass showcase is shown lying on its back as it was discovered museum decided not to restore missing parts today mummy is regarded as one of museum s most important fossils it is cataloged under specimen number amnh 5060 significance and classification thumb alt photo and outline drawing of mummy in bottom view mummy in bottom view with outline drawing amnh 5060 is considered one of best preserved dinosaur fossils ever discovered scientific value of mummy lies in its exceptionally high degree of preservation articulation of bones in their original anatomical position and extensive skin impressions enveloping specimen in 1911 osborn concluded as dinosaur skin impressions were previously known only from a few fragments mummy became a paleontological sensation as noted by osborn in 1912 famous holotype specimen of trachodon mirabilis amnh 5730 found in 1884 by jacob wortman originally also contained extensive skin impressions but most had been destroyed during excavation leaving only three fragments from tail region as explained by osborn very thin layer containing skin impressions in stone is difficult to detect and many such impressions might have been lost in previous years as they were not expected nor recognized by excavators thumb left skin impression of shoulder region showing smaller ground tubercles and clusters of larger pavement tubercles alt photograph of part of skin impression of shoulder region in his 1911 description osborn coined term dinosaur mummy for specimen this term was later used by some authors to refer to a handful of similar hadrosaurid duck billed dinosaurs specimens with extensive skin impressions all of which have been discovered in north america second such mummy now in naturmuseum senckenberg in frankfurt am main germany was discovered by sternbergs in 1910 just two years after discovery of amnh 5060 although skeleton of senckenberg mummy is more complete it is less well preserved than amnh 5060 another mummy specimen was discovered by barnum brown 1912 in alberta canada and subsequently described as new genus corythosaurus yet another mummy was discovered by sternberg which he sent to british museum during world war i transport ship ss mount temple was sunk by a german raider ship in 1916 resulting in loss of mummy as well as many other fossils discovered by sternberg after these initial finds no more mummy specimens were discovered until 2000 when a brachylophosaurus mummy nicknamed leonardo was discovered in judith river formation of montana another edmontosaurus mummy nicknamed dakota was excavated from hell creek formation of north dakota in 2006 gregory s paul in 1987 stated that life appearance of edmontosaurus and corythosaurus can be more accurately restored than that of any other dinosaur thanks to well preserved mummy specimens yet evidence provided by amnh 5060 was not regularly taken into account by paleoartists possibly because it was described before world war i during which activity in dinosaur research abated only to be revitalized in mid 1960s amnh 5060 belongs within hadrosauridae a family of ornithischian bird hipped dinosaurs barnum brown initially identified mummy as trachodon annectens at time genus trachodon encompassed nearly all known hadrosaurid specimens since 1942 mummy was referred to species copei which in 1990 was placed within its own genus anatotitan anatotitan copei is now regarded as a synonym of edmontosaurus annectens by most researchers majority of dinosaur skin impressions are referable to hadrosauridae in north american specimens from maastrichtian age skin impressions are 31 times more abundant in association with hadrosaurid specimens than with any other group reasons for this distribution is unclear of all known hadrosaurid skin impressions 25 belong edmontosaurus description and interpretation thumb skin impressions at back of head of mummy alt photograph and interpretive drawing of a region at back of skull showing bones and skin impressions most of skeleton is preserved bones still attached to each other in their original anatomical position tail hind feet and hind portion of pelvis had eroded away before mummy was discovered fossils often become flattened during fossilization but amnh 5060 is preserved three dimensionally without significant deformation specimen was found lying on its back with head and neck twisted upwards backwards and to right side of body both knees are drawn forwards while forelimbs are outstretched although tail curves upwards and forwards over body in many dinosaur skeletons it was probably straight in mummy as movement would have been restricted by almost two thirds of total skin area is preserved often with excellent preservation skin impressions are pressed tightly onto bones and are partially drawn into body in between bones when discovered skin impressions probably encased whole skeleton but were partially destroyed while freeing it from surrounding rocks skin impressions are preserved on forelimbs neck and throat and chest as well as on right side of trunk as well as skin impressions sternberg noted preservation of muscle impressions in 2007 paleontologist kenneth carpenter suggested that even impressions of inner organs are possibly preserved this cannot be evaluated without detailed computer tomography and x ray analyses skin thumb left alt interpretive drawing of skin impression pattern drawing of skin impressions from underside of trunk skin was thin and delicate in relation to size of animal as typical for dinosaurs skin consisted of non overlapping scales called tubercles two sorts of tubercles can be distinguished evenly distributed on skin were ground tubercles which were small rounded scales between in diameter larger pavement tubercles less than in diameter were pentagonal in shape raised relative to ground tubercles and arranged in irregular clusters interrupting surface formed by lower ground tubercles these clusters consisted of between twenty and several hundred individual pavement tubercles and were bordered by intermediate tubercles which mediated in size and shape between ground and pavement tubercles in chest and abdominal region clusters were small oval in shape and arranged in irregular longitudinal lines they became larger towards sides of trunk where they reached in diameter their shape became more irregular largest clusters could be found above pelvis and measured in diameter clusters of similar size were presumably present along whole back of animal muscles and joints were generally occupied with smaller tubercles to enable greater flexibility larger tubercles are found in those parts that are tightly pressed to bones largest surviving scales are found on outer side of arms these polygonal tubercles were up to in diameter inner side of arms was completely covered by small tubercles thigh also showed relatively small tubercles on inner side no impressions of outer side are preserved a patch of skin is also present in nostril region of snout these scales measured in diameter skin frill upright thumb proposed skin frill above neck vertebrae photograph and interpretive drawing alt photograph and interpretive drawing of a part of neck region of mummy above neck vertebrae a long and deep skin impression is preserved osborn interpreted this impression as part of an ornamental frill of loose skin that extended along midline of neck and back osborn noted that this frill was folded above vertebral joints to ensure mobility of neck giving comb a ruff like appearance areas in between folded areas were occupied by an oval cluster of pavement tubercles osborn observed that upper edge of comb had been destroyed during recovery of mummy so that height of crest can no longer be determined he assumed that frill would have extended upwards by at least one further row of clusters an edmontosaurus fossil described by paleontologist john horner in 1984 shows a regular row of rectangular lobes in tail area stephen czerkas in 1997 argued that this row would likely have extended over much of body including neck making a frill of loosely folded skin seem unlikely instead skin impression described by osborn would have come from fleshy crest above downward curved neck spine this neck crest would have been much deeper than previously assumed connecting base of head to shoulder region observed folding would have been a consequence of mummification and caused by a withered nuchal ligament hand amnh 5060 allowed for first accurate reconstruction of hand skeleton of a hadrosaurid barnum brown in 1912 showed that of mummy did not consist of two complete rows of ossified carpals as othniel charles marsh had assumed in his reconstruction of 1892 but that only two ossified carpals were present in mummy these elements lie directly above each other and above third metacarpal this arrangement probably reflects original position in living animal since both hands show same arrangement brown further pointed out that first finger was missing and second to fifth fingers each consisted of three phalanges marsh had reconstructed first finger as a reduced element with only two phalanges while fifth finger was absent in his reconstruction thumb left alt interpretive drawing of upper and underside of right hand drawing of upper left and underside right of right hand showing metacarpal bones and fingers enclosed by skin cover fingers of mummy are partially connected to each other by an envelope of skin impressions in 1912 osborn suggested that this skin envelope represented webbing between fingers and that forelimb would have functioned as a paddle which he considered a clear indication of an aquatic lifestyle for trachodon edmontosaurus and presumably other representatives of hadrosauridae webbing would not only have connected fingers with each other but would also have extended up to beyond fingertips furthermore osborn noted lack of clearly pronounced hooves and large fleshy foot pads on forelimb features to be expected in a primarily land dwelling animal with senckenberg mummy another trachodon specimen with supposed webbing was discovered in 1910 a possible aquatic lifestyle of hadrosaurids had been proposed before in particular based on great depth and flat sides of a well preserved tail discovered by brown in 1906 this hypothesis appeared to be in accordance with an 1883 account by edward drinker cope describing hadrosaurid teeth as slightly attached and delicate and therefore suitable for feeding on soft aquatic plants it was only after discovery of two mummies that hypothesis of an aquatic lifestyle became undisputed doctrine charles h sternberg wrote in 1917 thumb right alt 1909 painting of two edmontosaurus individuals on lake shore shown with fingers joined into a paddle 1909 reconstruction of trachodon edmontosaurus drawn by charles r knight under supervision of henry fairfield osborn fingers are shown to be joined into a paddle as was inferred from apparent interdigital webbing seen in mummy it was not until 1964 that john h ostrom voiced doubts about webbed finger hypothesis ostrom was able to show that hadrosaurids did not feed on soft aquatic plants as previously assumed but that their elaborate chewing apparatus was designed to crush resistant plant material such as conifers skeletal anatomy would furthermore indicate a highly specialized two legged locomotion on land ostrom noted that hadrosaurids showed no osteoderms or similar structures to defend against predators that are found in many other herbivorous dinosaurs and suggested that webs may have been used to allow escape into water in case of danger robert bakker in 1986 argued that animal had no webs and that skin between its fingers was remnant of a fleshy pad enveloping hand that had dried out and flattened during mummification very similar skin structures originating from foot pads can be found on modern day mummified camel carcasses furthermore bakker argued that fingers were short and could hardly have been spread apart which distinguishes them fundamentally from long spread toes of today s paddling animals such as ducks bakker concluded today webbing hypothesis is widely refuted phil senter in 2012 examined amnh 5060 and several other hadrosaurid specimens to reconstruct orientation of hand while trackway evidence indicates that palm was directed inwards and only slightly backwards many hadrosaurid skeletons have instead been mounted with palm of hand facing backwards in such reconstructions radius either crosses ulna instead of being parallel or connects to inner of two condyles of humerus instead of to outer although palms of mummy face backwards this is because carcass lay on its back which caused forelimbs to sprawl and humeri to detach from shoulder joints in both forelimbs of mummy radius and ulna are parallel to each other and radius is connected to outer condyle confirming that palm must have faced inwards in life ossified tendons and stomach contents in 1909 charles h sternberg noted that hundreds of ossified tendons were preserved along dorsal spine each about as thick as a pencil sternberg speculated that these tendons served as defensive structures and could not be penetrated by claws of predatory dinosaurs such as contemporary tyrannosaurus today it is known that these tendons stiffened spine probably to counteract bending forces on spine during walking although tail is not preserved in mummy other edmontosaurus specimens show that it had also been stiffened by such tendons sternberg also reported carbonized food remains discovered in stomach region of mummy an analysis of these remains has not yet been performed in 1922 investigated a concretion of brown plant material in senckenberg mummy that consisted mainly of branches and needles of conifers in both mummies possibility cannot be ruled out that plant material was washed into abdominal cavity only after death of animal attempts to reconstruct color patterns thumb alt modern artistic reconstruction of edmontosaurus modern reconstruction of edmontosaurus annectens osborn observed in 1912 that clusters of pavement tubercles were more numerous on upper sides of trunk and limbs than on underside consequently they would dominate in areas that would have been exposed to sun when animal was alive in many reptiles living today these sun exposed areas contain most pigment from these observations osborn hypothesized a connection between pigmentation and scaling pavement tubercle clusters might have represented dark colored areas on a bright base irregular distribution of clusters would indicate an irregular color pattern and most elaborate color pattern would be present on skin frill of neck osborn did admit that in today s lizards distribution of pigments is largely independent of type of scaling catherine forster in 1997 stated that color information can in principle not be derived from skin impressions of dinosaur mummies in 2015 philip manning and colleagues concluded that skin in dinosaur mummies is not simply preserved as an impression but contains original biomolecules or their derivatives these researchers inferred presence of melanin pigments in skin of another edmontosaurus mummy nicknamed dakota while clarifying that a reconstruction of coloration is currently not possible given many different factors that influence coloration they remarked that melanin distribution may potentially allow for deriving a monochrome black and white picture of animal s pigmentation pattern any chemical analysis of amnh 5060 would be problematic however as consolidating chemicals have been applied to its skin for preservation nostrils thumb alt photograph of senckenberg mummy on exhibit in germany senckenberg mummy on exhibition in naturmuseum senckenberg in frankfurt am main germany as in other edmontosaurus specimens sides of snout were excavated by a large and elongated depression depression which housed nostrils as confirmed by amnh 5060 would not have occupied entire depression richard swann lull and nelda wright in a 1942 publication suggested that skin impressions are preserved within depression a deepening in this possible skin in front part of depression could mark position of fleshy nostrils this skin is smooth and wrinkled and tubercles are absent in contrast with rest of body accordingly paleoart often shows remainder of depression being occupied by a scaleless inflatable bladder in 2015 however albert prieto marquez and jonathan wagner found low and subtle impressions of polygonal scales in frontmost part of depression behind beak these scales suggest that rest of skin that once covered depression might have been scaly for this reason these authors preferred an older interpretation by james a hopson from 1975 who proposed a scaly bladder with brightly colored skin between scales which became visible only when bladder was inflated prieto marquez and wagner further suggested that sedimentary ridges within depression likely represent former soft tissue structures rear edge of bony nostril was extended towards front by a flange which was probably a cartilaginous structure indicating that rear part of bony nostril was covered by soft tissue forming a nasal cavity as this covering was apparently restricted to rear part it is likely that opening of nasal passage into skull interior would also have been situated there a ridge running diagonally across depression might have been a cartilaginous septum supporting a nasal cavity ridge ends in lower front of depression which is most likely location for fleshy nostril nasal cavity that this ridge once supported would therefore have been main nasal air passage taphonomy thumb upright left alt photograph and interpretive drawing of thorax region of mummy thorax region of mummy showing skin impressions that tightly adhere to bones several authors discussed question of how animal died and what circumstances led to its exceptionally good preservation charles h sternberg in 1909 and charles m sternberg in 1970 assumed that animal died in water gases accumulating in abdomen after death would have floated carcass with belly pointing upwards and head moving into its final position under shoulder carcass would then have sunk to bottom to come to rest on its back and become covered by sediments skin would have been drawn into body cavity by load of sediments or due to escape of gases osborn suggested another scenario in 1911 animal could have died a natural death and carcass would have been exposed to sun for a longer time in a dry riverbed unaffected by scavengers muscles and intestines would have completely dried out and thus shrunk whereby hard and leathery skin sank into body cavity and finally adhered tightly to bones forming a natural mummy at end of dry season mummy would have been hit by a sudden flood transported a distance and quickly covered with sediments at embedding site fine grain size of sediment fine river sand with sufficient clay content would have led to perfect impressions of filigree skin structures before hardened skin could soften today osborn s hypothesis is considered most probable thumb upright alt aerial photograph of a meandering river aerial photograph of a meandering river showing sliding slopes sand point bar on inside and impact slopes on outside of river loops cause of death of specimen can only be speculated about kenneth carpenter in 1987 and 2007 considered starvation during a drought to be most likely cause of death given similarity of mummy to cadavers of today s animals found during droughts loss of muscle mass due to malnutrition could also partly explain why mummy s skin was sunken around bones furthermore carcass was not affected by scavengers this could have been due to a drought keeping scavengers away from affected area or leading to accumulation of many carcasses that could not all be handled by existing scavengers as can be observed during modern droughts furthermore carpenter noted that today s large even toed ungulates are closely bound to water during droughts to prevent overheating main cause of death of these animals during droughts is starvation not thirst mummy was discovered in river sediments therefore animal likely died near a river or at least a dry riverbed sediments of discovery site were deposited by a meandering river this type of river constantly migrates its riverbed by eroding cut bank bank on outside of river bends and depositing sediment on slip off slope on inside of bends a slip off slope forms a characteristic sediment sequence known as a point bar carpenter concluded from a photograph taken during excavation that mummy was discovered within such a point bar and suspected that carcass was embedded during flood events after end of a drought carcass would have been an obstacle for current resulting in its rapid burial as water flowed around carcass its velocity would have increased leading to a removal of sediment carcass would have successively sunk into resulting depression additional sediment that led to further burial would have originated from cut banks collapsing into river further upstream which is indicated by high clay content of sandstones sediment load carried by river would have been deposited as current velocity and thus carrying capacity diminished which is case at end of a flood carcass would have been embedded within hours or days taphonomic processes that affected mummy after its burial are difficult to reconstruct as samples from surrounding sedimentary rocks do not exist probably a slow bacterial decay of carcass was initiated first carpenter emphasized that excellent preservation of fossil was made possible only by minerals formed by bacteria biomineralization these minerals would have solidified clay rich sand surrounding mummy resulting in its unusual three dimensional preservation at same time this solidified sediment would have preserved skin impressions at contact surface between sand and cadaver mineralization furthermore anchored bones in their anatomical position and thus prevented them from falling apart as soft tissue decayed important minerals formed after burial would include calcium carbonate calcite and iron carbonate siderite latter after being oxidized to would have been responsible for rusty color of mummy after more or less complete decomposition of soft tissue a cavity remained in cemented sediment that was subsequently filled with sand together with skin impression it contained references external links category saurolophines category dinosaur
