good kangaroo legacy fabulous kangaroos are considered by many in wrestling world as one of best tag teams in history of wrestling in fact many people in past held mistaken belief that fabulous kangaroos invented tag team wrestling which was not true since tag team wrestling had been seen as early as 1936 reason for this belief lies in fact that kangaroos were one of first teams to popularize tag team wrestling and because tag teaming was often referred to as australian rules or australian tag team kangaroos themselves were not slow to play off this belief often claiming kayfabe that they were such a well coordinated tag team because amateur team wrestling was very popular in australia term australian rules had been coined long before 1957 debut of kangaroos records indicate that tag team wrestling was already being referred to as australian rules already in mid 1940s fabulous kangaroos were among first people in wrestling to play up sports entertainment elements in professional wrestling beyond being talented wrestlers costello especially was also very good at playing up their characters kangaroos showed their advertising skills through promotional literature
