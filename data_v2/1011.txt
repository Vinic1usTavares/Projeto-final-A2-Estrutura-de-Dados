lactarius alnicola commonly known as golden milkcap is a species of fungus in russulaceae family fruit bodies produced by fungus are characterized by a sticky vanilla colored cap up to wide with a mixture of yellow tones arranged in faint concentric bands stem is up to long and has yellow brown spots when it is cut or injured mushroom oozes a white latex which has an intensely peppery taste acrid taste of fruit bodies renders them unpalatable fungus is found in western united states and mexico where it grows in mycorrhizal associations with various coniferous trees species such as spruce pine and fir and deciduous species such as oak and alder it has also been collected in india two varieties have been named var pitkinensis known from colorado and var pungens from michigan taxonomy species was originally described by american mycologist alexander h smith in 1960 from a collection made near warm lake idaho two years prior species was originally collected under alders with conifers nearby and its specific epithet reflects presumed association between species alnicola means living with alder researchers subsequently discovered that species has a relationship with conifers not with alders as name implies bessette et al 2009 pp 145 46 mushroom is commonly known as golden milkcap lactarius alnicola is classified in subsection of section in genus lactarius species in this subsection are characterized by having a milk white to creamy or whey like latex that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air and which may stain freshly cut surfaces of fruit body yellow further cap margin is bearded covered with sharp straight and stiff hairs and coarsely tomentose or woolly when young other species in subsection include l l delicatus l l payettensis l l pubescens l and l scrobiculatus type species of subsection hesler and smith 1979 p 237 pp 285 86 description thumb left gills are forked near stem cap is wide initially convex but becoming depressed to funnel shaped in maturity cap margin is initially rolled inward then becomes uplifted as cap expands cap surface is sticky to slimy and near margin there are matted hairs beneath slimy or sticky layer color of cap surface is yellow ochre sometimes with concentric bands of lighter and darker shades color becomes paler near margin gills are adnate squarely attached to stem to decurrent attached to and running down length of stem narrow and crowded closely together forked near stem gills are initially whitish before becoming pale ochraceous buff there are many lamellulae small gills that do not extend completely to stem stem is long and thick nearly equal in width throughout or tapered downward dry hard coarsely pitted and whitish to cream yellowish it is initially solid then becomes hollow with age flesh is thick hard whitish and slowly stains pale yellow after mushroom has been cut open it has no distinctive odor while taste is immediately acrid latex is sparse white on exposure to air and unchanging or very slowly changing color to yellow it stains cut flesh yellow and tastes acrid according to mycologist david arora oak loving central and southern californian population of this species has a more latent acrid taste spore print may range slightly in color thin deposits are white thick deposits are more yellow mushroom is considered inedible because of intensely peppery taste microscopic characters thumb right spores of l alnicola viewed at 1000x 10 divisions equal 9 75 um spores are 7 5 10 by 6 8 5 um ellipsoid and ornamented with warts and narrow bands that form a partial reticulum surface prominences are up to 1 um high but mostly in range 0 3 0 6 um spores are hyaline translucent and amyloid meaning that they will adsorb iodine when stained with melzer s reagent basidia spore bearing cells are four spored and measure 37 48 by 8 11 um cap cuticle is an ixocutis a tissue layer on surface of a mushroom made of a layer of gelatinous hyphae made of encrusted hyphae that are 3 5 um wide varieties in their 1979 monograph of north american lactarius species hesler and smith named two varieties of l alnicola lactarius alnicola var pitkinensis reported under mixed aspen and conifers from ashcroft colorado is very similar to nominate variety but it has a white to cream colored cap and white unchanging latex it has slightly smaller fruit bodies with caps up to wide and stems up to long its spores are slightly larger measuring 9 10 5 by 7 5 9 um lactarius alnicola var pungens reported only from mixed forests in michigan is similar but has a tacky surface that soon dries a dull ochraceous to ochraceous tan cap with an ochraceous tawny center it has whitish flesh with a pungent odor described as distinct and peculiar hesler and smith 1979 pp 300 04 similar species thumb right cantharellus cibarius novice mushroom hunters may mistake l alnicola for edible species cantharellus cibarius a choice edible species that has a vase shaped fruit body with strongly decurrent gills other similar lactarius species include l zonarius l payettensis l yazooensis l olympianus and l psammicola f glaber l olympianus also associates with conifers and has a pale yellow ochre frequently zonate cap but may be distinguished by its stem which is usually covered with spots l payettensis has a roughened not smooth cap margin l yazooensis has a zonate cap and extremely acrid flesh its gills change color from pale vinaceous to light pinkish brown in maturity bessette et al 2009 p 268 l psammicola f glaber has a pinkish buff spore print bessette et al 2009 p 222 mature fruit bodies of l scrobiculatus var montanus have been confused with l alnicola its fruit bodies feature a smooth cap margin acrid taste white latex which slowly over several minutes turns yellow on exposure or stains flesh yellow and do not turn clay color when bruised ecology habitat and distribution lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species and engages in a mutualistic association with certain plant species in this association hyphae of fungus permeate large volumes of soil and obtain scarce elements especially phosphorus which is often limiting for plant growth which they pass on to plant in exchange for metabolic products of plant s photosynthesis ectomycorrhizae that fungus forms in association with picea engelmannii have been shown to contain latex producing cells and pigments similar to fruit body fruit bodies of fungus grow in groups on ground under alders and conifers usually appearing between july and october it is a fairly common species in western united states and baja california additional collection locations in mexico include veracruz villarreal and tapia a population in central and southern california is known to associate with oak trees in rocky mountains it is associated with subalpine tree species spruce picea engelmannii while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce picea glauca it is also known to associate with ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and douglas fir genus pseudotsuga mushroom has also been collected from in state of uttarakhand india see also list of lactarius species
