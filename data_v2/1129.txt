yumekobo a company formerly known as aicom but rebranded to mark their new direction of working closely with snk initial discussions began with concept for a follow up to their shooter pulstar however they wanted their new game to maintain a degree of independence from original scan collection translation with significant changes made to gameplay style and setting team treated their new game as a gaiden and did not want to use pulstar in title yumekobo s president at time opposed this wanting pulstar in title for business reasons at some point game was titled pulstar blast publisher snk entered dispute saying they did not want yumekobo s new shooter to be associated to pulstar in west because it received poor reception there due to its high difficulty team settled on title blazing star for its western release chosen among others including zero hour and zenith not wanting to keep names different between regions yumekobo s president decided to make blazing star title in all regions team had trouble designing attack patterns and enemy placements to establish right level of difficulty interesting combat patterns made game more difficult but game was boring otherwise director of pulstar thought original game was too difficult and wanted new shooter to have a charge shot for an easier challenge although much of game changed through development charge shot was one of early concepts that was kept along with goal to create impressive scenery yumekobo staff believed game s best selling point was its detailed graphics artists had to overcome challenges creating textures animation and reducing sprites to 16 colors each due to neo geo hardware limitations system s sprite limit restricted number of bullets they could place on screen there was still some sprite flickering in final game due to crossing this threshold character has a kogal personality and was modeled after yuko asahina from memorial at request of game designers jb was modeled after actor jean

and keeping classic genres such as shoot em ups alive edge wrote that side scrolling shooters were rare to find but game should satisfy fans of genre they praised colorful backgrounds and 3d special effects video games agreed that graphics were nice but felt some of backgrounds were pale and it ultimately did not offer ultimate in neo geo graphics as was advertised on game s packaging next level argued that game took better advantage of neo geo hardware than pulstar with its improved background and lighting effects journalists found game similar to its predecessor but video games in particular thought pulstar was better game they gave blazing star a score of 72 and felt it was too short not challenging enough and lacking in sophisticated level design they did however like bosses as did next level and edge who both appreciated game for carrying on large boss trend from pulstar edge ultimately felt that frenetic old school gameplay will keep neo geo s devotees happy ios and android ports of blazing star were well received toucharcade commended strategic gameplay impressive 2d backgrounds and felt it featured some of most intricate shooter gameplay you can find in vast

occasionally they still thought game was addictive and equivalent of machine in corner that hardened veterans congregate around dropping in coin after coin as they inch their way up leaderboards reviewing arcade archives release nintendo life called it a perfect port noting that it even retained framerate slowdown when screen is filled with sprites their biggest complaints were game s aged pre rendered graphics and sharp difficulty increase in latter stages but they felt these were minor issues they felt hamster corporation s hi score and caravan modes were perfect complements to blazing star nintendo world report felt that it had uneven level design wishing earlier levels had more stage hazards they did however appreciate game for maintaining a degree of simplicity without sacrificing gameplay depth and called it one of more accessible and fun shoot em ups out there legacy retro gamer and gaming 101 wrote that game is sometimes remembered for its poorly translated
