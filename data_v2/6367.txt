casting crowns although lead vocalist mark hall who either wrote or co wrote all songs on album felt a little worried about band s follow up album fellow recording artists steven curtis chapman who co produced band s first album and mac powell of christian rock band third day encouraged hall to say what god wants you to say they also advised him to not worry about commercial expectations or whether people are going to like it ultimately hall absorbed feedback their first record had received using it as inspiration lifesong focuses mainly on truth can be a tough pill to swallow message that there are broken people within arm s reach of church and if there is any hope of healing it begins with people who will be hands and feet of jesus hall responded to critics who felt band s material was preaching to choir by saying how can writing songs that challenge church songs that ask christians to consider their actions be a bad thing after all it s message that matters everybody is passionate about what they do about what they feel called to so for one to say other s ministry is more or less meaningful or spiritual or anything is ridiculous hall also felt that there were too many walls in christian music and said i think people listen to you if you re transparent people want to hear truth you just hang around church for a while and you ll see people don t want you to talk around it they want you to tell it like it is even if it hurts hall ultimately wrote songs such as does anybody hear her and stained glass masquerade which challenge believers according to hall he was trying to say that he didn t think it bothers world if people in church sin rather he felt that world is bothered when christians act like they don t sin lifesong was produced by mark a miller with recording and mixing done by sam hewitt at zoo studio in franklin tennessee additional recording was done at lifesong studio in mcdonough georgia album was mastered by richard dodd and engineered by dale oliver and john lewis lee iii strings on album were arranged by bobby huff and were recorded at little big studio by boeho shin and daewoo kim composition musically lifesong is influenced by adult contemporary and pop rock music album also has influence from worship music in vein of u2 with songs building into sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes much of album s lyrical content is devoted to challenging christian church and indicting hypocrisy and piousness within church songs such as title track and father spirit jesus have worshipful lyrics while others such as stained glass masquerade note inability of church congregations to share their burdens openly does anybody hear her condemns church s focus on judging rather than realizing pain and gives message than condemning other people is wrong set me free is set from perspective of demon possessed man who is calling to jesus for relief it also incorporates more of a rock sound than casting crowns normally uses critical reception and accolades lifesong received mostly positive reviews from music critics kim jones of about com gave it five out of five stars saying bottom line my hat goes off to casting crowns for a job well done once again this is one band that doesn t soft pedal their message even if it is one that people enjoying a comfort zone may not want to hear jared johnson of allmusic gave album four and a half out of five stars opining one of brightest spots on ccm map in 2005 lifesong was powered by a second dose of mark hall s earnestly challenging worship themes and a penchant for reflective pop from start to finish album showcases songwriting that is consistent polished and potent furthering septet s reputation as one of christian music s most popular acts of 21st century deborah evans price of billboard said that there is no sophomore letdown here for casting crowns this is intelligent soulful music that goes beyond mere entertainment to something deeper david mccreary of ccm magazine gave lifesong an a opining staying true to their approach of assimilating crisp melodies forthright lyrics and stout vocals crowns effectively blend uptempo worship anthems and emotive ballads for another well balanced set russ breimeier of christianity today gave album three and a half out of five stars calling music derivative said that casting crowns fans will find much to love while others continue to ponder secret of this band s success all can probably agree that lifesong is a sequel in truest sense offering more of same to delight of those so touched and inspired by music of casting crowns first time simon eden of cross rhythms gave album ten out of ten squares saying with lifesong being officially casting crowns second release pressure is on to see if they can deliver simple answer is quite probably yes as band use a refreshing formula that challenges church instead of serving up milk and cookies john dibiase of jesus freak hideout gave it three out of five stars opining overall lifesong is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity as band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to church body frontman and chief songwriter mark hall s strained shouting style vocals is sic still an acquired taste along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics but lifesong is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band brian mansfield of usa today gave album two and a half out of four stars commenting casting crowns comes from school of u2 influenced modern worship music so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes band s message is more distinctive calling out happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples to offer themselves to lonely grieving desperate lifesong and
