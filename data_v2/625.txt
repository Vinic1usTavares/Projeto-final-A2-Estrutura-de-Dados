undercut anti death penalty lobby proposed eliminating penalty for all crimes except murder but expressed concern that more such acquittals by sympathetic juries would undermine connection between crime and punishment rogers pp 88 90 briggs argument was used in 1849 trial of washington goode a black mariner accused of killing a rival for affections of a lady case against goode was essentially circumstantial but jury heeded district attorney s call for assertive punishment of crimes of violence and convicted him rogers pp 90 91 there were calls for briggs to commute goode s capital sentence
