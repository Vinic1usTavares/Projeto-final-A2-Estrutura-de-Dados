long range desert group lrdg was a reconnaissance and raiding unit of british army during second world war originally called long range patrol lrp unit was founded in egypt in june 1940 by major ralph a bagnold acting under direction of general archibald wavell bagnold was assisted by captain patrick clayton and captain william shaw at first majority of men were from new zealand but they were soon joined by southern rhodesian and british volunteers whereupon new sub units were formed and name was changed to better known long range desert group lrdg lrdg never numbered more than 350 men all of whom were volunteers lrdg was formed specifically to carry out deep penetration covert reconnaissance patrols and intelligence missions from behind italian lines although they sometimes engaged in combat operations because lrdg were experts in desert navigation they were sometimes assigned to guide other units including special air service and secret agents across desert during desert campaign between december 1940 and april 1943 vehicles of lrdg operated constantly behind axis lines missing a total of only 15 days during entire period gross o carroll and chiarvetto 2009 p 19 possibly their most notable offensive action was during operation caravan an attack on town of barce and its associated airfield on night of 13 september 1942 however their most vital role was road watch during which they clandestinely monitored traffic on main road from tripoli to benghazi transmitting intelligence to british army headquarters with surrender of axis forces in tunisia in may 1943 lrdg changed roles and moved operations to eastern mediterranean carrying out missions in greek islands italy and balkans after end of war in europe leaders of lrdg made a request to war office for unit to be transferred to far east to conduct operations against japanese empire request was declined and lrdg was disbanded in august 1945 formation before war major ralph bagnold learned how to maintain and operate vehicles how to navigate and how to communicate in desert on 23 june 1940 he met general archibald wavell commander of middle east command in alexandria and explained his concept for a group of men intended to undertake long range reconnaissance patrols to gather intelligence behind italian lines in libya general wavell was familiar with desert warfare having been a liaison officer with egyptian expeditionary force during first world war and he understood and endorsed bagnold s suggested concept wavell assisted in equipping force haskew 2007 p 34 thumb alt six vehicles each with a

volunteered two officers and 85 other ranks including 18 administrative and technical personnel were eventually selected coming mostly from divisional cavalry regiment and 27th machine gun battalion once men had been recruited they started training in desert survival techniques and desert driving and navigation with additional training in radio communications and demolitions lrp could initially form only three units known as patrols but a doubling of strength allowed addition of a new heavy section jenner and list 1999 pp 8 9 12 in november 1940 name of lrp was changed to long range desert

11 and a non military philips model 635 receiver no 11 set had been designed for use in tanks and had transmitter and receiver circuits royal signals expected to use no 11 set to transmit and receive between and with use of or antennas lrdg used morse code for all transmissions and were able to transmit over great distances using either a dipole antenna system attached to a rod antenna mounted on truck which was adequate up to or for greater distances a windom dipole system slung between two tall poles disadvantage of using windom system was that it took time to erect and work out correct antenna length so it could only be used in a relatively safe area molinari 2007 p 79 to power no 11 set extra batteries had to be carried by radio vehicles philips receiver was used to monitor

this was simplified to a green flag displaying patrol letter in white later half patrols used a plain green flag on occasion when it became necessary to change course from an intended route or in event of enemy action patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags or hand signals depending on how widely dispersed trucks were navigation all trucks of lrdg were equipped with bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also equipped with a p8 tank compass kennedy shaw 1943 p 255 each patrol had a navigator who always rode in second truck in formation he was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings and maps kennedy shaw 1943 pp 254 256 watches were used and adjusted each evening using gmt time check one major problem faced early on by lrdg was a lack of accurate maps for libya in particular patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took in july
