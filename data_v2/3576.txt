october 1996 india cyclone also known as cyclone 05a had an unusual and protracted path that spanned much of northern indian ocean it originated in a weather disturbance that formed on october 14 in southern bay of bengal off india s east coast moving westward it struck andhra pradesh on october 17 as a well defined low pressure area it crossed southern india and reorganized in arabian sea off western coast of india system developed into a depression on october 22 and quickly intensified while moving northward by october 24 cyclone approached hurricane intensity as it developed an eye reaching peak winds of at least 110 km h 70 mph on october 25 storm abruptly stalled and weakened off gujarat and progressed southwestward as a minimal storm it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by october 28 although its remnants persisted until november 2 when they dissipated east of somalia in southern india storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused severe flooding in andhra pradesh at least 112 reservoirs and dams were breached killing 200 people in prakasam district floodwaters ruined about of crops and damaged around 53 000 houses leaving thousands homeless floods killed 388 people in southern india and caused us 388 million in damage storm later brushed west coast of india stranding 50 boats indian military helped with relief and rescue efforts another cyclone struck andhra pradesh in november causing additional damage and deaths meteorological history long tracked storm originated from monsoon trough which spawned an area of convection or thunderstorms in southern bay of bengal on october 14 it moved to west northwest and later to west without much development india meteorological department imd classified system as a well marked low pressure area before system moved over southern indian state of andhra pradesh on october 17 system slowly crossed southern india emerging into arabian sea on october 21 that day convection organized into a circular cluster as circulation became more defined system slowed and turned to north around periphery of a ridge to east system organized into a depression on october 22 same day that joint typhoon warning center jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 05a as storm moved slowly northward it quickly intensified and imd upgraded system s status from a depression on october 22 to severe cyclonic storm status late on october 23 around that time storm developed an eye and jtwc estimated 1 minute peak winds of 120 km h 75 mph at 18 00 utc that day equivalent to a minimal hurricane on october 24 imd estimated peak 3 minute winds of 110 km h 70 mph although estimates derived from dvorak technique suggested winds of 120 km h 75 mph on october 25 storm stalled about 95 km 60 mi south of gujarat coast as steering currents from retreating ridge of high pressure diminished strengthening wind shear cooler waters and dry air rapidly weakened storm by late on october 25 jtwc had discontinued warnings and imd downgraded storm to depression status system began moving to southwest away from wind shear imd downgraded system further to a remnant low on october 28 although jtwc began issuing advisories again after a nearby ship reported winds of 65 km h 40 mph accelerating to west storm again weakened on october 31 prompting jtwc to discontinue advisories while system was about 110 km 70 mi northeast of socotra remnants turned to southwest dissipating near east coast of somalia on november 2 jtwc remarked that storm had one of most unusual tracks in north indian ocean cyclone history and was also one of longest tracked cyclones in basin according to imd most storms approaching gujarat strike coast or weaken and move westward agency stated that there is no parallel of this system in tropical cyclone history impact and aftermath precursor to storm brought heavy rainfall to southern india mainly in andhra pradesh as well as in tamil nadu to south karnataka to west
