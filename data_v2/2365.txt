of christ chalkites with gate is unclear cyril mango suggested that it was located to its left but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop gatehouse itself mango 1958 p 154 it is known that chapel was placed atop an elevated platform and 18th century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of hagia sophia vestibule s interior decoration is also described by procopius walls

of statuary recorded in parastaseis concluded that references came from a text written in ca 600 in great part because images of emperor maurice and his family are unlikely to have survived their

origins of icon are obscure based on its mention in parastaseis it may have existed by ca 600 but it cannot be stated with any certainty mango 1958 pp 103 108 112 its prominent display on very entrance to imperial palace made it one of city s major religious symbols cameron herrin 1984 p 175 consequently its removal in 726 or 730 by emperor leo iii isaurian r 717 741 was both a major political statement and a spark for violent rioting in city and marked beginning of official prohibition of icons in empire kazhdan 1991 pp 406 440 icon was restored a first time by empress eirene in

lazaros replaced it cormack 2000 p 114 exact appearance of icon is unclear although early image has been interpreted as a bust of christ pantocrator type late byzantine references such as coins by
