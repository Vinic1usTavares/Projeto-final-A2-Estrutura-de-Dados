archaeomarasmius is an extinct genus of gilled fungus in agaricales family tricholomataceae containing single species archaeomarasmius leggetti it is known from two fruit bodies recovered from amber one consisting of a complete cap with a broken stem other consisting of a fragment of a cap cap has a diameter ranging from while stem is thick spores were also recovered from amber and are broadly ellipsoid to egg shaped measuring roughly 7 3 by 4 7 mm species which resembles extant genera marasmius and marasmiellus is inferred to have been saprobic on plant litter or other forest debris genus is solely known from new jersey amber deposits along atlantic coastal plain in new jersey united states which date from turonian stage about 90 94 mya of upper cretaceous archaeomarasmius is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in fossil record and only one to be described from new jersey amber history and classification genus is known only from two holotype fossils a fruit body or mushroom and a fragment of a mushroom both currently residing in american museum of natural history specimens collected in november 1994 from area of east brunswick new jersey by g r case p d borodin and j j leggett were found as a single clear yellow amber nodule in diameter specimen was found above south amboy fire clay part of raritan formation suggesting that it is turonian in age upper cretaceous about 90 to 94 million years ago due to weathering amber specimen amnh nj 90 fractured into a number of chips along fractures and flow lines chips with holotype specimens amnh nj 90y and amnh nj 90z were first studied by a group of researchers consisting of david hibbett and michael donoghue from harvard university with david grimaldi of amnh hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in american journal of botany generic epithet archaeomarasmius is a combination of greek archaeo meaning ancient and marasmius a modern genus which it resembles specific epithet leggetti was coined by authors in honor of j j leggett and company who first discovered amber nodule and donated it to amnh when first reported archaeomarasmius leggetti was second extinct species of agaric fungus to be described and it is only species to be known from new jersey amber three species aureofungus yaniguaensis coprinites dominicana and protomycena electra have been described from miocene dominican amber found in dominican republic extinct agaricomycetes species found in marine calcareous concretions on vancouver island canada and dating to about 130 125 mya is probably in or polyporales in 2007 another agaric was reported palaeoagaracites antiquus found in early cretaceous burmese amber about 100 mya description holotypes of archaeomarasmius consist of mushrooms and associated basidiospores specimen amnh nj 90y is a nearly complete mushroom broken off near base of stipe stem pileus cap is up to in diameter and has a convex shape sporting an umbo a broad raised central region mushroom is a medium dark brown color with thin minutely textured flesh and an incurved margin lamellae or gills are distantly spaced with 12 gills extending fully from cap edge to stipe and lack lamellulae short gills which do not reach stipe from edge of pileus pileus is centered on stipe which is long and is broken off above base stipe lacks a veil and is smooth and cylindrical top of pileus is exposed on a fracture plain and to prevent oxidation area was coated in a fine layer of synthetic resin which also resulted in slightly improved visibility of mushroom specimen amnh nj 90z is a small wedge shaped fragment of pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study splitting it in half though researchers had not intended to perform destructive analysis on sample this fracturing warranted sacrifice of some parts of specimen for structural and molecular study small pieces of specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy sem stubs and sputter coated with a gold palladium alloy resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen another sample of specimen was mounted in spurr s resin an embedding medium used in electron microscopy and sectioned with a diamond knife resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy tem lack of discernible biological material from mushroom seen in sem study was confirmed in tem analysis a final section of fossil was selected to attempt dna sequencing a small sample of fossil was extracted at amnh and sent to peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology for dna amplification none of three selected extracts showed any results after amplification was attempted it is possible that fractures and which split amnh nj 90z during initial preparation had already penetrated into fossil and destroyed hermetic seal which would have been needed for preserving organic matter of mushroom basidiospores recovered with fruiting body were examined during sem study spores showed considerable damage from both fossilization process and subsequent weathering and specimen collection they also displayed distinct halos in amber possibly from gas or liquid leaching out or a reaction in spores that prevented resin from turning to amber even so enough remained to make some observations about spore morphology basidiospores are broadly elliptic to oval measuring approximately 7 3 by 4 7 mm and each shows a distinct hilar appendage combined characters of archaeomarasmius indicate a relation to modern family tricholomataceae with a close similarity to genera marasmius and marasmiellus both genera are noted for toughening and drying rather than this property would increase chances of a mushroom becoming entombed in amber however a number of other species are also possible close relatives of archaeomarasmius mostly in tricholomataceae although some species in family strophariaceae are also authors suggest it may also be appropriate to classify archaeomarasmius more conservatively as incertae sedis of uncertain placement within agaricales or associated inclusions amber specimen amnh nj 90 which preserved two holotypes also preserved a number of other inclusions that give indications as to what ecology of archaeomarasmius may have been of approximately forty insect inclusions present flies in families ceratopogonidae and chironomidae together with caddisflies of order trichoptera suggest that mushroom was growing near fresh water beetles from family a termite and a in addition to mushroom are indicators of rotting wood probably from a tree in family modern marasmiaceae members are saprobic obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter and specimens included with archaeomarasmius indicate a similar habit for mushroom see also list of tricholomataceae genera references archaeomarasmius archaeomarasmius category prehistoric fungi category fossil taxa
