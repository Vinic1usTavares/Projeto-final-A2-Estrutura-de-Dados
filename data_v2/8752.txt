there is some difficult stuff to watch but i know my spirit and intention are good starved premiered to an audience of 1 54 million viewers scoring a neilsen rating of 0 8 and a 2 share among adults 18 49 network s target demographic reviews were unfavorable variety echoed slogan of belt tighteners in dismissing series as not ok noting series edgy content variety allows that pushing envelope in terms of standards is all well and good assuming that series earn right to do so starved it says did not earn that right series stabs at poignancy feel unconvincing and forced and from an emotional standpoint there s seldom a truthful note washington post concurred in this assessment describing premise of show as hey what happens if you take characters from seinfeld and give them eating disorders while crediting starved for a few inventive laughs language and sexuality of show are described as exceptionally coarse and outrageous for cable television even later at night worse than these issues post felt that schaeffer neglected to develop characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them t his failure to build understanding into show dooms it to emptiness with a sour aftertaste as if you had just you know hurled new york times credited series for its bold premise and noted that show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire ultimately however times found that starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross out farce los angeles times found show vexing for being at once assured and shallow accomplished and unconvincing well acted and empty review singles out schaeffer s character sam as especially unappealing and points to schaeffer s roles as creator producer writer and director as an object lesson in wisdom of a system of checks and balances perhaps most in noting schaeffer s experiences with addiction reviewer writes that just because you ve had an experience doesn t mean you have anything interesting to say about it or are able to articulate whatever interesting thing you have to say new york magazine called it best show you probably never watched nbc used a clip from second episode in most outrageous tv moments fx canceled starved in october 2005 fx president john landgraf told variety show had a lot of fans so it was tough to choose between it and it s always sunny in philadelphia ultimately we felt that we re just not in a position to spread our resources we launched our dramas one at a time and launching two comedies like we did this summer just didn t
