kreutz sungrazers pronounced are a family of sungrazing comets characterized by orbits taking them extremely close to sun at perihelion they are believed to be fragments of one large comet that broke up several centuries ago and are named for german astronomer heinrich kreutz who first demonstrated that they were related a kreutz sungrazers s aphelion is about 170 au from sun these sungrazers make their way from distant outer solar system from a patch in sky in canis major to inner solar system to their perihelion point near sun and then leave inner solar system in their return trip to their aphelion several members of kreutz family have become great comets occasionally visible near sun in daytime sky most recent of these was comet ikeya seki in 1965 which may have been one of brightest comets in last millennium it has been suggested that another cluster of bright kreutz system comets may begin to arrive in inner solar system in next few years to decades many hundreds of smaller members of family some only a few meters across have been discovered since launch of soho satellite in 1995 none of these smaller comets have survived its perihelion passage larger sungrazers such as great comet of 1843 and c 2011 w3 lovejoy have survived their perihelion passage amateur astronomers have been successful at discovering kreutz comets in data available in real time via internet discovery and historical observations thumb 150px left an illustration of sungrazing great comet of 1843 as seen from tasmania first comet whose orbit had been found to take it extremely close to sun was great comet of 1680 this comet was found to have passed just 200 000 km 0 au above sun s surface equivalent to around a seventh of sun s diameter or about half distance between earth and moon it thus became first known sungrazing comet its perihelion distance was just 1 3 solar radii astronomers at time including edmond halley speculated that this comet was a return of a bright comet seen close to sun in sky in 1106 163 years later great comet of 1843 appeared and also passed extremely close to sun despite orbital calculations showing that it had a period of several centuries some astronomers wondered if it was a return of 1680 comet a bright comet seen in 1880 was found to be travelling on an almost identical orbit to that of 1843 as was subsequent great comet of 1882 some astronomers suggested that perhaps they were all one comet whose orbital period was somehow being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage perhaps by retardation by some dense material surrounding sun an alternative suggestion was that comets were all fragments of an earlier sun grazing comet this idea was first proposed in 1880 and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when great comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage in 1888 heinrich kreutz published a paper showing that comets of 1843 c 1843 d1 great march comet 1880 c 1880 c1 great southern comet and 1882 c 1882 r1 great september comet were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets after another kreutz sungrazer was seen in 1887 c 1887 b1 great southern comet of 1887 next one did not appear until 1945 two further sungrazers appeared in 1960s comet pereyra in 1963 and comet ikeya seki which became extremely bright in 1965 and broke into three pieces after its perihelion appearance of two kreutz sungrazers in quick succession inspired further study of dynamics of group group generally has an inclination of roughly 140 degrees a perihelion distance of around 0 01 au and a longitude of ascending node of 340 10deg notable members brightest members of kreutz sungrazers have been spectacular easily visible in daytime sky three most impressive have been great comet of 1843 great comet of 1882 and comet ikeya seki another notable kreutz sungrazer was eclipse comet of 1882 see further below great comet of 1843 great comet of 1843 was first noticed in early february of that year just over three weeks before its perihelion passage by february 27 it was easily visible in daytime sky and observers described seeing a tail 2 3deg long stretching away from sun before being lost in glare of sky after its perihelion passage it reappeared in morning sky and developed an extremely long tail it extended about 45deg across sky on march 11 and was more than 2deg wide tail was calculated to be more than 300 million kilometers 2 au long this held record for longest measured cometary tail until 2000 when comet hyakutake s tail was found to stretch to some 550 million kilometers in length earth sun distance 1 au is only 150 million kilometers comet was very prominent throughout early march before fading away to almost below naked eye visibility by beginning of april it was last detected on april 20 this comet apparently made a substantial impression on public inspiring in some a fear that judgement day was imminent eclipse comet of 1882 a party of observers gathered in egypt to watch a solar eclipse in may 1882 were greatly surprised when they observed a bright streak near to sun once totality began by a remarkable coincidence eclipse had coincided with perihelion passage of a kreutz comet comet would otherwise have gone unnoticed its sighting during eclipse was only observation of it photographs of eclipse revealed that comet had moved noticeably during eclipse as would be expected for a comet racing past sun at almost 500 km s comet is sometimes referred to as tewfik after tewfik pasha khedive of egypt at time great comet of 1882 thumb right 250px photograph of great comet of 1882 as seen from south africa great comet of 1882 was discovered independently by many observers as it was already easily visible to naked eye when it appeared in early september 1882 just a few days before perihelion it grew rapidly brighter and was eventually so bright it was visible in daytime for two days 16 17 september even through light cloud after its perihelion passage comet remained bright for several weeks during october its nucleus was seen to fragment into first two and then four pieces some observers also reported seeing diffuse patches of light several degrees away from nucleus rate of separation of fragments of nucleus was such that they will return about a century apart between 670 and 960 years after break up comet ikeya seki comet ikeya seki is most recent very bright kreutz sungrazer it was discovered independently by two japanese amateur astronomers on september 18 1965 within 15 minutes of each other and quickly recognised as a kreutz sungrazer it brightened rapidly over following four weeks as it approached sun and reached apparent magnitude 2 by october 15 its perihelion passage occurred on october 21 and observers across world easily saw it in daytime sky a few hours before perihelion passage on october 21 it had a visible magnitude from 10 to 11 comparable to first quarter of moon and brighter than any other comet seen since 1106 a day after perihelion its magnitude decreased to just 4 japanese astronomers using a coronagraph saw comet break into three pieces 30 minutes before perihelion when comet reappeared in morning sky in early november two of these nuclei were definitely detected with third suspected comet developed a very prominent tail about 25deg in length before fading throughout november it was last detected in january 1966 dynamical history and evolution thumb right 350px approximate relationship of largest members of kreutz sungrazers note that perihelion passage at which fragmentations occurred may not be well established a study by brian g marsden in 1967 was first attempt to trace back orbital history of group to identify progenitor comet all known members of group up until 1965 had almost identical orbital inclinations at about 144deg as well as very similar values for longitude of perihelion at 280 with a couple of outlying points probably due to uncertain orbital calculations a greater range of values existed for argument of perihelion and longitude of ascending node marsden found that kreutz sungrazers could be split into two groups with slightly different orbital elements implying that family resulted from fragmentations at more than one perihelion tracing back orbits of ikeya seki and great comet of 1882 marsden found that at their previous perihelion passage difference between their orbital elements was of same order of magnitude as difference between elements of fragments of ikeya seki after it broke up this meant it was realistic to presume that they were two parts of same comet which had broken up one orbit ago by far best candidate for progenitor comet was that seen in 1106 great comet of 1106 ikeya seki s derived orbital period gave a previous perihelion almost exactly at right time and while great comet of 1882 s derived orbit implied a previous perihelion a few decades later it would only require a small error in orbital elements to bring it into agreement sun grazing comets of 1668 1689 1702 and 1945 seem to be closely related to those of 1882 and 1965 although their orbits are not well enough determined to establish whether they broke off from parent comet in 1106 or previous perihelion passage before that some time in 3 5th centuries ad this subgroup of comets is known as subgroup ii comet white ortiz bolelli which was seen in 1970 is more closely related to this group than subgroup i but appears to have broken off during previous orbit to other fragments sun grazing comets observed in 1843 great comet of 1843 and 1963 comet pereyra seem to be closely related and belong to subgroup i although when their orbits are traced back to one previous perihelion differences between orbital elements are still rather large probably implying that they broke apart from each other one revolution before that they may not be related to comet of 1106 but rather a comet that returned about 50 years before that subgroup i also includes comets seen in 1695 1880 great southern comet of 1880 and in 1887 great southern comet of 1887 as well as vast majority of comets detected by soho mission see below distinction between two sub groups is thought to imply that they result from two separate parent comets which themselves were once part of a grandparent comet which fragmented several orbits previously one possible candidate for grandparent is a comet observed by aristotle and ephorus in 371 bc ephorus claimed to have seen this comet break into two however modern astronomers are skeptical of claims of ephorus because they were not confirmed by other sources instead comets that arrived between 3rd and 5th centuries ad comets of 214 426 and 467 are considered as possible progenitors of kreutz family original comet must certainly have been very large indeed perhaps as large as 100 km across for comparison nucleus of comet hale bopp was about 40 km across although its orbit is rather different from those of main two groups it is possible that comet of 1680 is also related to kreutz sungrazers via a fragmentation many orbits ago kreutz sungrazers are probably not a unique phenomenon studies have shown that for comets with high orbital inclinations and perihelion distances of less than about 2 au cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations tends to result in sungrazing orbits one study has estimated that comet hale bopp has about a 15 chance of eventually becoming a sun grazing comet recent observations until recently it would have been possible for even a very bright member of kreutz sungrazers to pass through inner solar system unnoticed if its perihelion had occurred between about may and august at this time of year as seen from earth comet would approach and recede almost directly behind sun and could only become visible extremely close to sun if it became very bright only a remarkable coincidence between perihelion passage of eclipse comet of 1882 and a total solar eclipse allowed its discovery however during 1980s two sun observing satellites serendipitously discovered several new members of kreutz family and since launch of soho sun observing satellite in 1995 it has been possible to observe comets very close to sun at any time of year satellite provides a constant view of immediate solar vicinity and soho has now discovered hundreds of new sun grazing comets some just a few metres across about 83 of sungrazers found by soho are members of kreutz group with other being referred to as non kreutz or sporadic sungrazers meyer marsden and 2 families on average a new member of kreutz family is discovered every three days apart from comet lovejoy none of sungrazers seen by soho has survived its perihelion passage some may have plunged into sun itself but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely more than 75 of soho sungrazers have been discovered by amateur astronomers analysing soho s observations via internet some amateurs have managed remarkable numbers of discoveries with rainer of germany having chalked up 211 michael oates of united kingdom making 144 and zhou bo of china spotting 97 as of december 2011 over 2 000 kreutz sungrazers have been identified using soho data soho observations have shown that sungrazers frequently arrive in pairs separated by a few hours these pairs are too frequent to occur by chance and cannot be due to break ups on previous orbit because fragments would have separated by a much greater distance instead it is thought that pairs result from fragmentations far away from perihelion many comets have been observed to fragment far from perihelion and it seems that in case of kreutz sungrazers an initial fragmentation near perihelion can be followed by an ongoing cascade of break ups throughout rest of orbit number of subgroup i kreutz comets discovered is about four times number of subgroup ii members this suggests that grandparent comet split into parent comets of unequal size future dynamically kreutz sungrazers might continue to be recognised as a distinct family for many thousands of years yet eventually their orbits will be dispersed by gravitational perturbations although depending on rate of fragmentation of constituent parts group might be completely destroyed before it is gravitationally dispersed continuing discovery of large numbers of smaller members of family by soho will undoubtedly lead to a greater understanding of how comets break up to form families it is not possible to estimate chances of another very bright kreutz comet arriving in near future but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over last 200 years another great comet from kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point comet white ortiz bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1 in december 2011 kreutz sungrazer c 2011 w3 lovejoy survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of 3 see also list of kreutz sungrazers references further reading
