seasons philadelphia flyers and ottawa senators had met in stanley cup playoffs and on each occasion senators had eliminated flyers flyers had not beaten senators in their previous five regular season

is something in my opinion that players should take care of recchi also mentioned revenge not specifically from flyers during an interview with cbc it doesn t surprise me coming from this guy he s that type of player he s done it before it might not come from our team but he better protect himself said recchi game summary despite having what rob maaddi of associated press described as bad blood between them first period of game passed without serious incident chris neil opened scoring for ottawa just over four minutes into period but flyers then took lead when claude lapointe and mark recchi scored 30 seconds apart danny markov added a third for philadelphia to give them a two goal lead only penalty assessed in period was for holding against philadelphia s tony amonte both teams scored a goal each in second and third periods in second period an early tripping penalty against ottawa s mike fisher put flyers on power play during which kim johnsson extended philadelphia s lead to 4 1

brookbank with 1 45 left in third period flyers enforcer donald brashear hit rob ray an enforcer for senators from behind instigating a fight between pair when he was asked after game why he started fight brashear replied with his own question did you see last game his reply was interpreted as being a reference to havlat s slashing penalty against recchi brashear was generally considered to win fight with tim of philadelphia inquirer claiming that brashear destroyed rob ray fight left ray bloodied and as brashear was being escorted off ice by linesman he exchanged blows with both brian pothier and todd simpson philadelphia s patrick sharp attempted to restrain simpson who then pushed sharp to ice and started throwing punches at him markov intervened and fought simpson at same time

somik with his stick and pair started scrapping at same time zdeno chara started a fight with flyers mattias timander for which former received an instigator penalty both fights angered philadelphia head coach ken hitchcock who claimed that their tough guy rob ray got beat up and then their next two lines fought guys who don t fight flyer general manager bob clarke was also critical saying i understand rob ray fighting donald brashear that s okay but don t go after guys who don t know how to defend themselves like somik and timander as chara had been ejected from game his penalty was served by martin havlat who had been placed there to protect him from any possible attempts at retribution chara s penalty meant that at next restart teams were back to even strength with four players each immediately after ensuing face off michal handzus and mike fisher took part in seventh fight of game there were no fights straight after next restart which resulted in booing from crowd within 24 seconds of that restart crowd had their way mark recchi hit wade redden who immediately launched himself into a fight with john leclair while those two fought recchi and bryan smolinski engaged in a

took officials 90 minutes to allocate all penalties that had been given to two sides two teams combined for 419 penalty minutes an nhl record breaking previous total of 406 in a 1981 game between boston bruins and minnesota north stars philadelphia s 213 penalty minutes was also a new league record as were 409 minutes assessed in third period interviewed after game mike fisher of ottawa said that senators knew they had to fight back they had to stand up for each other aftermath media drew comparisons between game and broad street bullies era of philadelphia flyers in 1970s when they played very aggressive hockey with numerous fights at conclusion of game bobby clarke philadelphia s general manager attempted to enter senators dressing room to confront their head coach jacques martin but was restrained by a colleague clarke said that he would not have hit martin but that he had wanted to challenge martin about unbalanced fight pairings clarke subsequently lodged a complaint with league supervisor claude only player to receive a fine or suspension as a result of game was danny markov who got a statutory one game ban for collecting his third game misconduct of season philadelphia based comcast sportsnet csn which had aired game live described it as an instant classic replayed game following wednesday march 10 replay received a nielsen rating of 1 0 a higher figure than most telecasts involving philadelphia flyers league officials from nhl were unhappy with replay being shown as they perceived game to tarnish league s image and they requested that csn not replay game again flyers and senators met once more during season and despite some claims from bobby clarke that philadelphia would seek further revenge there were only six minor penalties assessed in match which senators won 3 1 ottawa defenceman zdeno chara explained that both teams were really focusing on two points we weren t going to risk that by fighting both teams qualified for 2004 playoffs ottawa was eliminated in first round by toronto maple leafs while philadelphia defeated new jersey devils and maple leafs to reach eastern conference finals but were then beaten by eventual stanley cup champions tampa bay lightning brawl along with an incident between vancouver canucks todd bertuzzi and steve moore of colorado avalanche in which bertuzzi hit moore from behind breaking his neck in retaliation for a hit by moore on one of bertuzzi s team mates a month earlier brought issue of violence in ice hockey into focus particular attention was given to retaliation when brashear was interviewed on subject of bertuzzi incident he defended such on ice revenge and suggested that bertuzzi should not receive a suspension because all they have to do is go after him when he comes back that mindset echoed comments made by ken hitchcock and mark recchi about martin havlat and sam donnellon of philadelphia daily news suggested that it was prevailing opinion amongst all players in league he suggested that rather than wanting stricter penalties to clamp down on dangerous play which he advocated players believed that removing penalty for instigating a fight and allowing players to therefore get their retribution by that means would have same effect mike of dallas morning news also believed that league should be stricter in handing out fines and suspensions suggesting that hitchcock should possibly have been penalised for his revenge comments and that if havlat had received a lengthier ban for his actions brawl between flyers and senators may not have happened 2004 05 nhl season was cancelled because of a labor dispute but upon league s return for 2005 06 season a rule was added which meant that any player being assessed for an instigator penalty in last five minutes of a match would receive an automatic one game ban and player s head coach could also be fined 10 000 this was designed to avoid situations such as happened in game between flyers and senators
