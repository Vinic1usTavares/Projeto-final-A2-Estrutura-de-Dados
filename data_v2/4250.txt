design ship had originally been ordered by ottoman empire under name fatih from thames ironworks shipyard in london england in 1865 vessel was built to a design created by british naval architect edward reed and at time it was regarded in press to be most powerful vessel in world some larger than contemporary british ironclad she also carried a larger gun battery but owing to ottoman inability to pay for vessel builder placed still incomplete vessel for sale following year kingdom of prussia had embarked on a program to acquire sea going ironclad warships and after having placed orders for two such vessels in british and french shipyards in 1865 opted to add fatih to prussian navy when opportunity arose small prussian fleet had been unable to defeat danish naval blockade in second

its flagship indeed konig wilhelm remained largest german vessel until 1891 this was in part due to fact that germany laid down only one small ironclad between 1876 and 1888 four s launched in 1891 and 1892 were first ships to surpass konig wilhelm in size general characteristics and machinery thumb left line drawing of sms konig wilhelm konig wilhelm was long at waterline and long overall she

service history ship was laid down in 1865 and prussians purchased her on 6 february 1867 initially renaming her wilhelm i they changed her name again to konig wilhelm on 14 december and she was launched on 25 april 1868 after completing fitting out she was commissioned less than a year later on 20 february 1869 ship s first commander was kapitan zur see ludwig von henk shortly after entering service she joined ironclads and for training exercises in august and september franco prussian war in may 1870 konig wilhelm kronprinz and friedrich carl were joined by ironclad ram for a visit to britain though friedrich carl was damaged after running aground in great belt konig wilhelm kronprinz and prinz adalbert continued on to plymouth while friedrich carl returned to kiel for repairs latter vessel quickly rejoined ships there and on 1 july they departed for a training cruise to fayal in azores portugal but tensions with france over hohenzollern candidacy for vacant spanish throne were reaching a crisis point while they cruised east through english channel they learned of increasing likelihood of war and prussians detached prinz adalbert to dartmouth to be kept informed of events rest of squadron joined her there on 13 july and as war seemed to be imminent prussians ended cruise and returned to home ships arrived back in wilhelmshaven on 16 july three days before france declared war on prussia over ems dispatch initiating franco prussian war greatly numerically inferior prussian navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by french navy kronprinz friedrich carl and konig wilhelm were concentrated in north sea at port of wilhelmshaven with a view toward breaking french blockade of port they were subsequently joined there by turret ship which had been stationed in kiel despite great french naval superiority french had conducted insufficient pre war planning for an assault on prussian naval installations and concluded that it would only be possible with danish assistance which was not forthcoming four ships under command of vizeadmiral vice admiral eduard von jachmann made an offensive sortie in early august 1870 out to dogger bank though they encountered no french warships konig wilhelm and other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble which left arminius alone to conduct operations konig wilhelm friedrich carl and kronprinz stood off island of wangerooge for majority of conflict while arminius was stationed in mouth of elbe river on 11 september three broadside ironclads were again ready for action they joined arminius for another major operation into north sea it too did not encounter french opposition as french navy had by this time returned to france peacetime operations in 1870s after war prussian navy became imperial navy and resumed its peacetime training routines general albrecht von stosch became chief of imperial navy and organized fleet for coastal defense through early 1870s konig wilhelm and other armored frigates operated intermittently alternating between periods of training activity and stints in reserve typically ships were commissioned for summer training cycles before being laid up over winter with one or two ironclads kept in commission but with reduced crews to serve as guard ships for 1875 training year konig wilhelm cruised with kronprinz and recently completed ironclads and though they stayed in local waters konig wilhelm remained laid up through 1876 and 1877 thumb konig wilhelm collides with grosser kurfurst konig wilhelm was recommissioned in early 1878 to take part in that year s training program while steaming in straits of dover on 31 may konig wilhelm accidentally collided with newly commissioned turret ironclad two ships along with had left wilhelmshaven on 29th konig wilhelm and preussen steamed in a line with grosser kurfurst off to starboard on morning of 31st three ships encountered a pair of sailing vessels off folkestone grosser kurfurst turned to port to avoid boats while konig wilhelm sought to pass two boats but there was not enough distance between her and grosser kurfurst she therefore turned hard to port to avoid grosser kurfurst but action was not taken quickly enough and konig wilhelm found herself pointed directly at grosser kurfurst konig wilhelms ram bow tore a hole in grosser kurfurst a failure to adequately seal watertight bulkheads aboard grosser kurfurst caused ship to sink rapidly in span of about eight minutes out of a crew of 500 men 269 died in accident konig wilhelm was also badly damaged in collision with severe flooding forward konig wilhelms captain initially planned on beaching ship to prevent it from sinking but determined that ship s pumps could hold flooding to an acceptable level ship made for portsmouth where temporary repairs could be effected to allow ship to return to germany in aftermath of collision german navy held a court martial for rear admiral batsch squadron commander and captains monts and kuehne commanders of two ships along with lieutenant clausa first officer aboard grosser kurfurst to investigate sinking damage to konig wilhelm necessitated a lengthy period of repairs from 1878 to 1882 work was carried out at imperial dockyard in wilhelmshaven and also included reboilering and replacement of ship s

maneuvers during cruise konig wilhelm ran aground on a mud bank off frisian coast and quickly pulled ship free with minimal damage ships then proceeded to scotland via oslo and bergen division returned to kiel at end of may to replenish its stocks of coal and provisions for summer exercises during 1894 maneuvers von s ii division acted as opposing force in baltic simulating a russian fleet attacking germany s baltic coast following conclusion of maneuvers in september diederichs left squadron and was replaced by admiral karl in 1895 konig wilhelm went into drydock at blohm and voss shipyard in hamburg for an extensive reconstruction into an armored cruiser vessel s armament was increased ship rig was removed and new fighting masts were installed in place of old masts ship s crew was dramatically increased to 38 officers and 1 120 enlisted men work lasted through 1896 and ship was returned to fleet in her new guise on 25 january 1897 on 26 june she represented germany at fleet
