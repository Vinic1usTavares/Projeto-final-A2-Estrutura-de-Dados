need for a beacon of some kind there in 1814 he returned in company of sir walter scott and a party of nlb commissioners nicholson 1995 p 98 scott wrote later that year an act of parliament was passed enabling construction of a lighthouse yet despite pleas for a light arriving almost weekly at nlb events proceeded only slowly it was not until 1834 that robert stevenson returned in company of his son alan a painstaking survey made it clear that there was little choice for a location single largest area was a rock that measured only at low tide readings for wave pressure indicated that any tower would have to withstand forces of there were suggestions that a tower of cast iron or bronze might be sufficient but stevenson senior wrote that no pecuniary consideration could in my opinion have justified adoption of an iron lighthouse for skerryvore nicholson 1995 p 99 munro 1979 p 112 bathhurst 2000 p 149 on more than one occasion surveyors had to warn passing vessels of danger a ship

experience may have been persuasive bathhurst 2000 p 153 alan stevenson was duly appointed as engineer for project aged only 30 he designed a tower high with a base of narrowing to just at lantern

march 2008 shore station thumb hynish signal tower now a museum hynish on tiree was initial shore station and construction site located on south west corner of tiree its proximity to skerryvore and resulting abundance of bounty from wrecks led to rentals being higher here and on rest of west coast than elsewhere on island bathhurst 2000 p 148 work on new facilities began in 1837 granite blocks were quarried from mull and brought to village to be cut and shaped before being shipped out to reef several cottages for keepers were built in 1844 from same stone as well as a massive pier and a tall granite tower to enable signalling to and from skerryvore itself murray w h 1966 hebrides london heinemann p 124 stevenson remarked that hive of activity there contrasted with desolation and misery he imagined to be lot of surrounding population munro 1979 p 115 barrack and foundation thumb left temporary barrack used in erection of skerryvore lighthouse in 1838 ps15 000 in wages alone was spent on constructing a 150 ton steamer in leith to ferry workers and materials out to reef difficulties should not be underestimated although skerryvore is a dozen miles from hynish it is from mainland first work to be undertaken on skerryvore itself was construction of a six legged frame on top of which a wooden barrack to house 40 men was placed building was created in gourock before being dismantled and re built on site nicholson 1995 p 100 initial work began on rock on 7 august 1838 stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board sailing vessel pharos and began to unload barrack whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of rock after only two days site had to be abandoned as a storm swept in from atlantic it was a further six days before they could resume punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4 am and 8 pm fearing sea sickness many of man preferred to attempt to sleep on damp rocks than on ever rolling pharos nicholson 1995 p 101 work for season lasted only until 11 september by which time barrack legs had been secured although not main structure less than two months later stevenson received a letter from storekeeper at hynish mr hogben it began dear sir i am extremely sorry to inform you that barrack erected on skerryvore rock has totally disappeared structure had been destroyed during a gale on 3 november and four months effort had been wasted bathhurst 2000 p 166 stevenson hired a boat to take him out to inspect damage same day he received this news firm in his self belief he resolved to build a stronger but otherwise identical replacement work began in april 1839 and by early september completed barrack stood above rock entry was via ladders attached to legs that led into lowest level containing a kitchen middle level contained two cabins one for stevenson other for his master of works whilst top level provided sleeping quarters for a further 30 to 40 men nicholson 1995 p 102 work on foundations for lighthouse continued until 30 september a total of 296 charges were used to remove 2 000 tons of rock and stevenson believed that rock was so hard that effort involved was four times that required for boring aberdeenshire granite work went well but by end of second season no blocks had yet been laid however between april 1839 and june 1840 4 300 blocks had been fashioned stone donated by duke of argyll from quarries on mull roughly hewn rock was taken to hynish where blocks were hammered and into shape largest weighed over 2 5 tons smallest 0 75 tons and precision required meant that a single block could take 320 man hours to complete nicholson 1995 pp 104 5 author states charges used were dynamite but this was not invented for another two decades tower new barrack withstood violence of storms during winter of 1839 40 work re commenced on rock on 30 april 1840 and after arrival of new steamer skerryvore carefully fashioned blocks began to arrive on site first one was laid by john campbell 7th duke of argyll on 4 july his son george later wrote soon up to 95 blocks a day were arriving from hynish although weather continued to play its part during summer of 1840 steamer was unable to reach reef for fourteen consecutive days and on another occasion no landings were possible for seven weeks and supplies began to run low when work ceased again in autumn 800 tons of granite standing high stood on skerryvore and up to 80 craftsmen continued to labour on blocks at hynish all winter first three courses of base are of hard hynish gneiss remainder are granite from ross of mull munro

voyage of inspection walls at base are thick and thick at top and lantern sit above nine apartments in diameter total cost of works undertaken by northern lighthouse board was ps86 977 including cost of establishing shore station at hynish estimated at ps13 000 it is a credit to stevenson his foreman charles stewart and captain landing master that not a single life was lost during construction

outline for stylistic reasons bathhurst 2000 p 163 his nephew robert louis described it as noblest of all extant deep sea lights and according to northern lighthouse board it is asserted by some that

not normally approached by shipping however completion of construction work did not result in an end to difficulties for those involved in its operations easiest landing is at s gully which intersects rock near tower an unaided landing has been described as like climbing up side of a bottle a system of ropes attached to a derrick was installed to assist these dangerous operations munro 1979 pages 114 and 118 statistics compiled for two decades from 1881 1890 showed skerryvore as having been part of scotland there were a total of 542 storms lasting 14 211 hours during that period munro 1979 p

assistants were commended by nlb for their efforts munro 1979 pp 181 2 john muir who served as a keeper with nlb for 39 years all told had a posting to skerryvore from 1902 to 1914 he helped complete

advantage of proximity to site during construction period however small harbour offered little shelter for shipping keepers operated from here until 1892 when operations were transferred to erraid
