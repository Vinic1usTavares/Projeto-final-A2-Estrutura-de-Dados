tkach himself or by others in church leadership church leadership at that time included mike feazell executive assistant and editorial advisor to tkach greg albrecht editor of plain truth and joseph tkach jr son of joseph w tkach and church administration director one conspiracy theory stated that decisions did not come from tkach himself but from church leadership another stated that ideas did originate from tkach but he formed them early in his career kept them hidden from armstrong and only allowed ideas to come to fruition after armstrong s death feazell claims that reforms were initially driven by a re examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by questions posed by church ministers and members j michael feazell liberation of worldwide church of god zondervan

its annual operating subsidy pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004 in assessing work of tkach there are two points of view critics of tkach especially those who formed splinter churches see tkach as key person responsible for collapse of wcg they believe that changes he brought were a turn against god and say his rejection of armstrong s unique doctrines were at best without biblical foundation tkach s supporters including those in leadership of wcg see events differently wcg describes tkach s tenure as a decade of painful change and that end result of his work was reconciliation of church with mainstream christianity ruth tucker an evangelical leader and an early supporter of changes which occurred in wcg wrote in an article in christianity today that changes as they are referred to by insiders are truly historic never before in history of christianity has there been such a complete move to orthodox christianity by an unorthodox fringe church vern bullough a secular humanist and senior editor of free inquiry commented on significance of changes noting shedding of almost every doctrine worldwide church of god once clung to is a story almost without parallel in
