steorn ltd was a small private technology development company based in dublin ireland in august 2006 it announced that it had developed a technology to provide free clean and constant energy via an apparent perpetual motion machine something which is contrary to law of conservation of energy a fundamental principle of physics steorn challenged scientific community to investigate their claim and in december 2006 said that it had chosen a jury of scientists to do so in june 2009 jury gave its unanimous verdict that steorn had not demonstrated production of energy steorn gave two public demonstrations of their technology in first demonstration in july 2007 at kinetica museum in london device failed to work second demonstration which ran from december 2009 to february 2010 at waterways visitor centre in dublin involved a motor powered by a battery and provided no independent evidence that excess energy was being generated it was dismissed by press as an attempt to build a perpetual motion machine and a publicity stunt in november 2016 company laid off its staff closed its facility and prepared for liquidation history steorn was founded in 2000 and in october 2001 their website stated that they were a specialist service company providing programme management and technical assessment advice for european companies engaging in e commerce projects steorn is a norse word meaning to guide or manage in may 2006 sunday business post reported that steorn was a former dot com company which was developing a microgenerator product based on same principle as self winding watches as well as creating e commerce websites for customers company had also recently raised about eur2 5 million from investors and was three years into a four year development plan for its microgenerator technology steorn later stated that account given in this interview was intended to prevent a leak regarding their free energy technology company s investment history shows several share allotments for cash between august 2000 and october 2005 investments totalling eur3 million in 2006 steorn secured eur8 1 million in loans from a range of investors in order to continue their research and these funds were also converted into shares steorn said that they would seek no further funding while attempting to prove their free energy claim in order to demonstrate their genuine desire for validation liquidation in june 2016 company informed shareholders that it had failed to meet expectations that company founder shaun sean mccarthy was being replaced as ceo and that operating costs were nearly eur1 million per year after investments totaling nearly eur23 million over a ten year period in november 2016 company shut down and laid off its staff due to a lack of additional funding to continue operations free energy claim in august 2006 steorn placed an advertisement in economist saying that they had developed a technology that produced free clean and constant energy called orbo technology was said to violate conservation of energy but had allegedly been validated by eight independent scientists steorn claimed none of these scientists would talk to media and suggested that this was because they did not want to become embroiled in a controversy views on technology no specific details of workings of claimed technology were made public mccarthy stated in a 2006 rte radio interview what we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields so that when you travel round magnetic fields starting and stopping at same position you have gained energy in 2011 steorn s website was updated to suggest that orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time barry williams of australian skeptics has pointed out that steorn is not first company to claim they have suddenly discovered miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy while martin fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy following a meeting between mccarthy and professor sir eric ash in july 2007 ash reported that orbo is a mechanical device which uses powerful magnets on rim of a rotor and further magnets on an outer shell during this meeting mccarthy referred to law of conservation of energy as scientific dogma however conservation of energy is a fundamental principle of physics more specifically a consequence of unchanging nature of physical laws with time by noether s theorem ash said that there was no comparison with religious dogma since there is no flexibility in choosing to accept that energy is always conserved rejecting conservation of energy would undermine all science and technology ash also formed opinion that mccarthy was truly convinced in validity of his invention but that this conviction was a case of prolonged self deception many people have accused steorn of engaging in a publicity stunt although steorn denied such accusations eric berger writing on houston chronicle website commented steorn is a former e business company that saw its market vanish during dot com bust it stands to reason that steorn has retooled as a web marketing company and is using free energy promotion as a platform to show future clients how it can leverage print advertising and a slick web site to promote their products and ideas thomas at engadget suggested that steorn s free energy claim was a ruse to improve brand recognition and to help them sell hall probes while josh features editor for mashable believes that it was merely an elaborate hoax jury process in its advertisement in economist steorn challenged scientists to form an independent jury to test their technology and publish results within 36 hours of advertisement being published 420 scientists contacted steorn and on 1 december 2006 steorn announced it had selected a jury it was headed by ian macdonald emeritus professor of electrical engineering at university of alberta and process began in february 2007 in june 2009 jury announced its unanimous verdict that steorn s attempts to demonstrate claim have not shown production of energy jury is therefore ceasing work dick ahlstrom writing in irish times concluded from this that steorn s technology did not work steorn responded by saying that because of difficulties in implementing technology focus of process had been on providing jury with test data on magnetic effects for study steorn also said that these difficulties had been resolved and disputed its jury s findings demonstrations thumb a notice at kinetica museum announcing cancellation of public demonstration on 4 july 2007 technology was to be displayed at kinetica museum spitalfields market london a unit constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that arrangement of magnets could be seen and to demonstrate that device operated without external power sources public demonstration was delayed and then cancelled because of technical difficulties steorn initially said that problems had been caused by excessive heat from lighting a second demonstration ran between 15 december 2009 and february 2010 at waterways visitor centre in dublin and was streamed via steorn s website demonstration was of a device powered by a rechargeable battery steorn said that device produced more energy than it consumed and recharged battery no substantive details of technology were revealed and no independent evidence of steorn s claim was provided on 1 april 2010 steorn opened an online development community called steorn knowledge development base which they said would explain their technology access was available only under licence on payment of a fee in may 2015 steorn put an orbo powercube on display behind bar of a pub in dublin powercube was a small box which pub website claimed contained a perpetual motion motor which required no external power source cube was shown charging a mobile phone steorn claimed to be performing some basic field trials in undisclosed locations orbo phone charger beginning in december 2015 steorn began accepting orders for two products including a phone charger through email only announcement was posted only to a facebook page titled orbo and a steorn youtube channel in early december mccarthy said that he was waiting for first shipment of two products orbo phone and orbo cube from a manufacturer in china steorn described orbo cube as a showcase for technology rather than a mass market product with cube retailing at eur1 200 see also pseudoscience history of perpetual motion machines references category technology
